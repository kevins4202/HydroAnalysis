rsm is built as a surrogate for computationally expensive numerical simulations to improve the efficiency of the optimization the multi island genetic algorithm miga is applied to the optimization a 2 7m swath test model has been taken as a verification model the optimization result shows the effectiveness of the optimization and the advantage of the achieving hull forms that have lower resistance than the original hull keywords swath design optimization numerical simulation rsm miga 1 introduction the small waterplane area twin hull swath is an excellent ship form and has been successfully applied to passenger ferries cruise ships oceanographic research and diving support vessels patrol boats etc since the birth of the first swath in 1973 because of its prior seakeeping performance papanikolaou et al 1991 mcnatt et al 2013 vernengo and brizzolara 2017 compared with conventional hull forms hydrodynamic resistance is one of the weakest points of swaths huang 1987 the predictions of hydrodynamic resistance rely on the experimental results however the model tests require a large labour outlay and time for preparation and operation which is not useful in early design stages michalski 2008 therefore how to estimate resistance without model testing is of vital importance in the preliminary design of swath with the development of computer techniques the advanced simulation analysis methods have been proposed as an alternative to the building and testing paradigm a significant number of studies which apply simulation based hull form optimization to reduce resistance have attest to a rapidly growing interest in hydrodynamic optimization campana and peri et al 2006 huang and yang 2016 cerka and mickeviciene et al 2017 chen and zou et al 2017 wu and liu et al 2017 brizzolara and vernengo 2011 papandreou and papanikolaou 2013 in addition plenty of studies have been carried out on the hydrodynamic performance of the swaths based on numerical simulations qian and yi et al 2015 ali et al 2017 sun and yao et al 2016 guo and ji et al 2017 papanikolaou et al 1991 michalski 2008 tuck 1987 vernengo and bruzzone 2016 whereas there are few works applying the numerical simulation to the optimization process of the swaths except brizzolara 2004 who obtained an optimal swath with a non conventional underwater hull form by developing a viscous inviscid cfd method in the optimization based on brizzolara s study qian and yi et al 2015 focused on optimization of inclined struts of the swath by hydrodynamic analysis the numerical simulation result of swath with inclined struts was compared manually with a vertical strut swath hence the present study by considering the numerical simulations aims to set up an integrated computational environment for the optimization of swath hull forms as automated as possible generally simulation based hull form optimization integrates three main aspects including simulation analysis geometrical modification and optimization algorithms for simulation analysis a series of cfd solvers have been developed which give accurate flow prediction h k versteeg and authoranonymous 2007 however the major drawback with numerical simulation is the great computational costs for ship flow systems it can take up to several days for a single cfd calculation which limits the optimization as several hundred calculations are required for reliable optimization one possible solution is the application of so called response surface models rsms as surrogates for computationally expensive numerical simulations in this study a high fidelity cfd solver based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations which has been proved accurate in flow prediction is integrated into the optimization module it should be noted that the hydrodynamic resistance is calculated while other critical issues related to swath static and dynamic behavior papanikolaou et al 1991 brizzolara et al 2012 olaoye 2015 begovic et al 2015 will not be considered in this study in addition the rsm is applied to improve the optimization with respect to ship geometry modeling for hull form optimization a number of techniques have been proposed ranging from semi parametric models based on nurbs peri and campana 2003 or subdivision surface coppedé et al 2018 to fully parametric models harries and abt 1999 abt 2001 guan et al 2013 2018 the parametric modeling techniques are most commonly used because of its efficiency on small and intermediate modification the parametric modeling techniques generate the geometric model with few design variables which are suitable for an automatic optimization procedure what s more due to the modular and the geometrically simple constitutive elements of swath it s an ideal choice to build parametric model in this study in order to guarantee the convergence of the optimization solution an appropriate optimization scheme is needed various optimization algorithms have been investigated and compared in the ship hull form optimization wu et al 2017 h kim et al 2011 y tahara et al 2011 therefore the multi island genetic algorithm is employed which is an advanced genetic algorithm with excellent global search ability and a better performance in terms of quality of results the present work is structured as follows first the parametric geometry model of a swath is introduced in section 2 the detailed analysis methods applied in numerical simulation of swath are analyzed and validated in section 3 the optimization module with rsm and optimization algorithm is described in section 4 then an optimization example is defined in section 5 the typical results of the example are shown and discussed in section 6 finally section 7 draws the conclusion 2 parametric geometry definition the key for a successful hull form optimization relies on an efficient parametric geometry definition swath consists of three parts underwater hulls struts and superstructure the superstructure above the waterline does not much affect the performance of a ship to simplify the problem the superstructure is not considered in all numerical simulations hence the parametric model is structured in two blocks one for the underwater hull and the other for the strut 2 1 the geometry parameters for practical reasons the primary quantities as shown in table 1 are employed to define the swath in addition for mathematical convenience the dimensionless combinations of the primary geometric quantities are employed as follows 1 x m x m l h r b o w r b o w l h d 2 r s t e r n r s t e r n l h d 2 c p 4 π d 2 l h 2 2 parametric geometry of the underwater hull the underwater hull is expressed based on the sectional area curve the sectional area curve represents the longitudinal distribution of cross sectional area blew the dwl which proves of great value for determining the relative fullness of the hull in addition the section area curve is proportional to an axial doublet distribution lewis 1988 hence the desired body in a uniform stream lyon and smith 1932 is generated by revolving ordinates y of the profile which are the radii of each section the offsets of the underwater hull is derived by the method described in gertler 1950 from a sixth degree polynomial in dimensionless form 2 y 2 x k 1 6 a k x k where x and y are dimensionless coordinates x x l h y y d x is the length direction coordinate of the underwater hull m y is the vertical coordinate of the generatrix profile of underwater hull m the coefficient a k k 1 2 6 are determined in terms of x m r bow r stern c p by imposing the following constraints 1 the length condition y 0 when x 1 2 the diameter condition y 1 2 when x x m 3 d y d x 0 when x x m 4 the radius of curvature at the bow and stern can be evaluated from the formula 3 r 1 d x d y 2 3 2 d 2 x d 2 y which can be written in the dimensionless form 4 r 1 l h 2 d 2 d x d y 2 3 2 d 2 x d 2 y 5 the volume of the underwater hull is expressed as 5 v π d 2 l h 0 1 y 2 x d x π d 2 l h c p 4 substituting the constraints into equation 1 the coefficient a k are obtained so that when x m r bow r stern c p are given the offsets may be rapidly computed fig 1 shows the dimensionless representation of a sectional area curve 2 3 parametric geometry of strut in this study the surface of the strut is assumed vertically cylindrical with parabolic section of the form brizzolara 2004 6 y s x s t s 2 l s 2 t s l s 3 x s 2 where t s is the maximum thickness of the strut and l s is its length the local coordinate is on the middle point of the strut length the x s direction goes from the stern to the bow of the hull and the y s direction goes from the middle point to the port fig 2 shows the waterline plane of the strut 3 cfd analysis and validation the hydrodynamic numerical simulations are carried out using the cfd code fluent the results and their accuracy depend on the cfd computer program the model grid the method of calculation boundary conditions and other parameters blazek 2005 3 1 key techniques of cfd analysis ship flows are governed by the general conservation laws for mass momentum and energy collectively referred to as the navier stokes equations yang and huang 2016 in practice the full navier stokes equations can t be solved analytically for most of the ship cases thus a set of techniques has been proposed incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations blazek 2005 are used as the control equation which assume the velocity components can be represented as a rapidly fluctuating turbulent velocity around a slowly varying mean velocity and r n g k ε model blazek 2005 is chosen in order to compute turbulent flows with the rans equations a fractional volume of fluid vof method which has been proved flexible and efficient for treating complicated free boundary configurations is applied to approximate free boundaries h k versteeg and authoranonymous 2007 in the process of solver the finite volume method fvm is applied for integration of rans equations 3 2 computational domain and boundary conditions the computational domain should be large enough to capture the entire viscous inviscid interaction and the wake development two velocity inlet including the water and the air inlet one length upstream of the underwater hull are defined with two phase vof model to simulate water level a pressure outlet is positioned 3 l h downstream of the underwater hull a symmetry boundary condition is applied to the longitudinal section of the hull the topside and bottom of the flow region respectively one length away from the hull are modeled with a no slip wall condition fig 3 shows the computer domain and boundary conditions 3 3 grid density analysis in general the larger the number of cells the better the solution both the accuracy of a solution and its cost in terms of necessary computer hardware and calculation time are dependent on the fineness of the grid considering above a structured mesh is built in the far field and a hybrid finite volume unstructured mesh using tetrahedral around the hull in addition a mesh sensitivity analysis is performed five different meshes are generated to evaluate the influence of grid density on simulation results all simulations are performed in the same computational domain and boundary conditions with speed of 1 5 m s all these calculations are set with a time step of 0 001s the calculated total resistance forces are considered to be converged when the maximum deviation is less than 0 5 of the averaged value chen et al 2017 the averaged values of the total resistance force in the last 100 iterations are obtained as the final results for the mesh density analysis shown as table 2 considering the calculation time and the solution precision the no 3 model with approximately 2 4 million cells is decided as the final computational grid in this study fig 4 presents the final meshing results 3 4 validation of the cfd method a series of numerical simulations of a single hull of the 2 7m swath model are performed for validation of the cfd method the towing test results of the model presented by david w taylor ship r d center in the united states were reported in gertler 1950 the experimental case model 4157 at fr 0 29 in gertler s report is chosen for validation the main characteristics of the model are listed in table 3 the depth of the body axis with respect to the free surface is 2 7 m fig 5 presents the comparison between the numerically predicted and experimentally measured total resistance showing a reasonable agreement the total pressure distribution on the hull shown as fig 6 is reasonable demonstrates the validity of the simulation procedure proposed 4 optimization module 4 1 rsm in optimization process when computationally expensive numerical simulations are used directly as analysis tools the optimization process can be too expensive for this reason the response surface model rsm with doe design of experiment is applied to optimization which has been proved as a viable and effective option for ship hydrodynamic optimization serani et al 2016 rsm can significantly improve the efficiency of hull form optimization and shorten the time needed by the optimization liu et al 2017 fig 7 depicts the creation process of the rsm model the basic process of rsm creation is as follows 1 sample data are selected by different methods including the design of experiment doe random number technique and experimental approach the samples are divided into two sets one is the training set for the construction of rsm model the other is the testing set for error analysis 2 the numerical simulations of the selected data are performed in order to obtain the response data of the rsm model 3 a proper approximate model function is chosen and the rsm is constructed using the training set the most common forms of the function are polynomial equations including first second third fourth order the cubic polynomial equation form as follows is chosen in this study 7 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β m x m β m 1 x 1 2 β m 2 x 2 2 β 2 m x 2 m 2 β 2 m 1 x 1 3 β 2 m 2 x 2 3 β 3 m x 3 m 3 i j β i j x i x j 4 the rsm is validated combined with the testing set for error and reliability analysis four error type methods are applied including average error maximum error root mean square error determination coefficient r 2 typically it is concluded that the rsm satisfies the requirements of the optimization when all the error values achieve the acceptance levels otherwise the rsm has to be modified by selecting new data or changing the polynomial equation the precision of the rsm approximate model depends mainly on selection of sample points the design of experiment doe is widely used for sampling hence many doe methods are proposed raymond h myers 2009 the optimal latin hypercube sampling olhs method jin et al 2005 is a modified latin hypercube design in which the combination of factor levels for each factor is optimized rather than randomly uniformly divided hence the training set of 46 sample points are achieved by optimal latin hypercube sampling olhs method which improves the space filling degree of sample points considerably compared with lhs and the testing set of 23 sample points are randomly selected in addition the minimum number of samples depends on the order of the polynomial equation and the numbers of design parameters m in this study the d x m r bow r stern are chosen as the input parameters according to equation 1 and the four input parameters the minimum number of samples n s is calculated by equation 2 as a result n s 19 which proves that the numbers of sample points 46 achieve the acceptance level of the approximation 8 n s m 1 m 2 2 m fig 8 shows the distributions of the training and testing samples all four design parameters are in the range from 90 to 110 of their initial value and the total hull resistances are set as the response values which are obtained from numerical simulation as stated in section 3 for each sample point the numerical simulation is run in parallel on 38 cores for approximately 25 h fig 9 shows an example of the rsm of total hull resistance with respect to parameter d and x m and the other two parameters r bow r stern are set to the following values 0 55 0 1 the error analysis results listed in table 4 indicate good accuracy of the rsm moreover the total hull resistances predicted from the rsm are compared with the numerical values shown as fig 10 4 2 the miga algorithm the multi island genetic algorithm miga which has been applied for highly nonlinear problems mao et al 2017 is proposed in this study miga is an advanced genetic algorithm ga the basic gas are inspired from genetic engineering to improve a generation of the solutions and result excellent solutions which are able to cover the solution space widely and easy to hybrid with other algorithms goldberg 1989 the main difference between miga and ga is that miga divides the population into several islands in which chromosomes can migrate between the islands shown as fig 11 as a result miga provides a speedup through the use of parallel processing corcoran and wainwright 1994 in addition miga finds better quality solutions than gas by solving each sub problem separately in island populations and assembling the partial solutions into a complete solution through the use of migration whitley and heckendorn 1999 the basic process of the miga is as follows 1 the global variables are initialized and the population is split into several islands then the global variables are sent to each island 2 each island is performed in parallel by the basic ga process including selection recombination mutation migration locality and neighborhood 3 the best solution from each island is received until the optimization criteria is met 4 3 optimization module the optimization platform is built using isight software lai et al 2012 with which simulation codes of different disciplines can be coupled the following software are coupled to evaluate the objective function through cfd analysis simens nx gambit and fluent fig 12 shows the process of the optimization 5 the definition of the swath optimization problem in this paper the minimization of the total hull resistance is selected as a single objective function the optimization is performed for a single speed 1 5 m s f r 0 29 with 0 21 m 3 and l 2 7 m fixed the input design variables are d r bow r stern and x m all four design variables are in the range from 90 to 110 of their initial values which have been listed in table 2 therefore the optimization model can be specified as follows m i n t o t a l h u l l r e s i s t a n c e s t 360 m m d 440 m m 0 45 r bow 0 55 0 09 r stern 0 11 0 36 x m 0 44 x d r b o w r s t e m x m 6 optimization results and discussion the optimization is performed with the rsm using the miga fig 13 shows the iteration results of the optimization after 1001 iterations the 3d scatter plot of d x m and total resistance force during the iterations is shown in fig 14 the 2d scatter plots of the design parameters with respect to the hull resistance are shown in fig 15 it can be seen that the values of the some design variables of the solutions are similar during the optimization suggesting the tendency of convergence although some outlier designs as shown in fig 13 are created because of the mutation in each generation during the iterations there is little impact on the final optimization result the hull resistances are low when the values of x m are at range of 0 43 0 44 and the influence of r bow on the resistance is more obvious the hull resistances are low when the values of r bow are at range of 0 54 0 55 however the values of d and r stern vary in large ranges three cases are selected for comparison one is the optimal solution case3 after 947 iterations the other two cases case 1 after 224 iterations case 2 after 466 iterations are the intermediate solutions during the evolution of the optimization the optimal solution is marked in green in figs 13 and 14 table 5 shows the comparison of the main parameters and hull resistances between prototype and the three cases fig 16 shows the shapes of the three selected cases as can be seen the optimization makes the underwater hull into a more streamline pattern the comparison between the initial design and the optimal design is shown in table 6 the total resistance of the optimal hull is reduced by 28 9 with respect to the original hull in order to validate the optimization result the numerical simulation of the optimal solution is performed over a range of speeds as stated in section 3 fig 17 shows the comparison of resistance between the original and optimal hull over a range of speeds the total resistance is separated into two parts viscous force and pressure force fig 19 shows the decreases of the resistance of optimal hull moreover the decrease is more noticeable on viscous force than pressure force 7 conclusion an automated optimization platform has been set up based on miga method in combination of the rsm through the platform the automatic generation of the form hulls the analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of swath can be achieved the cfd calculation is performed to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the samples which are used to generate the rsm a 2 7m swath test model has been taken as a verification model the optimization has been performed aiming at the reduction of the total hull resistance in calm water at fr 0 29 as a result a resistance reduction of 28 9 has been achieved the results have shown the effectiveness of the optimization and the advantage of the achieving hull forms that have lower resistance than the original hull which give the basic guidelines for selecting the optimal underwater form of swath during the design stage in addition the application of optimal latin hypercube design and rsm is an effective way to decrease the computation time while satisfying the accuracy and provides a promising method for the optimization design future work will focus on the multi objective optimization of the swath acknowledgment the authors would like to express their sincere thanks to institute of ship and marine

error root mean square error determination coefficient r 2 typically it is concluded that the rsm satisfies the requirements of the optimization when all the error values achieve the acceptance levels otherwise the rsm has to be modified by selecting new data or changing the polynomial equation the precision of the rsm approximate model depends mainly on selection of sample points the design of experiment doe is widely used for sampling hence many doe methods are proposed raymond h myers 2009 the optimal latin hypercube sampling olhs method jin et al 2005 is a modified latin hypercube design in which the combination of factor levels for each factor is optimized rather than randomly uniformly divided hence the training set of 46 sample points are achieved by optimal latin hypercube sampling olhs method which improves the space filling degree of sample points considerably compared with lhs and the testing set of 23 sample points are randomly selected in addition the minimum number of samples depends on the order of the polynomial equation and the numbers of design parameters m in this study the d x m r bow r stern are chosen as the input parameters according to equation 1 and the four input parameters the minimum number of samples n s is calculated by equation 2 as a result n s 19 which proves that the numbers of sample points 46 achieve the acceptance level of the approximation 8 n s m 1 m 2 2 m fig 8 shows the distributions of the training and testing samples all four design parameters are in the range from 90 to 110 of their initial value and the total hull resistances are set as the response values which are obtained from numerical simulation as stated in section 3 for each sample point the numerical simulation is run in parallel on 38 cores for approximately 25 h fig 9 shows an example of the rsm of total hull resistance with respect to parameter d and x m and the other two parameters r bow r stern are set to the following values 0 55 0 1 the error analysis results listed in table 4 indicate good accuracy of the rsm moreover the total hull resistances predicted from the rsm are compared with the numerical values shown as fig 10 4 2 the miga algorithm the multi island genetic algorithm miga which has been applied for highly nonlinear problems mao et al 2017 is proposed in this study miga is an advanced genetic algorithm ga the basic gas are inspired from genetic engineering to improve a generation of the solutions and result excellent solutions which are able to cover the solution space widely and easy to hybrid with other algorithms goldberg 1989 the main difference between miga and ga is that miga divides the population into several islands in which chromosomes can migrate between the islands shown as fig 11 as a result miga provides a speedup through the use of parallel processing corcoran and wainwright 1994 in addition miga finds better quality solutions than gas by solving each sub problem separately in island populations and assembling the partial solutions into a complete solution through the use of migration whitley and heckendorn 1999 the basic process of the miga is as follows 1 the global variables are initialized and the population is split into several islands then the global variables are sent to each island 2 each island is performed in parallel by the basic ga process including selection recombination mutation migration locality and neighborhood 3 the best solution from each island is received until the optimization criteria is met 4 3 optimization module the optimization platform is built using isight software lai et al 2012 with which simulation codes of different disciplines can be coupled the following software are coupled to evaluate the objective function through cfd analysis simens nx gambit and fluent fig 12 shows the process of the optimization 5 the definition of the swath optimization problem in this paper the minimization of the total hull resistance is selected as a single objective function the optimization is performed for a single speed 1 5 m s f r 0 29 with 0 21 m 3 and l 2 7 m fixed the input design variables are d r bow r stern and x m all four design variables are in the range from 90 to 110 of their initial values which have been listed in table 2 therefore the optimization model can be specified as follows m i n t o t a l h u l l r e s i s t a n c e s t 360 m m d 440 m m 0 45 r bow 0 55 0 09 r stern 0 11 0 36 x m 0 44 x d r b o w r s t e m x m 6 optimization results and discussion the optimization is performed with the rsm using the miga fig 13 shows the iteration results of the optimization after 1001 iterations the 3d scatter plot of d x m and total resistance force during the iterations is shown in fig 14 the 2d scatter plots of the design parameters with respect to the hull resistance are shown in fig 15 it can be seen that the values of the some design variables of the solutions are similar during the optimization suggesting the tendency of convergence although some outlier designs as shown in fig 13 are created because of the mutation in each generation during the iterations there is little impact on the final optimization result the hull resistances are low when the values of x m are at range of 0 43 0 44 and the influence of r bow on the resistance is more obvious the hull resistances are low when the values of r bow are at range of 0 54 0 55 however the values of d and r stern vary in large ranges three cases are selected for comparison one is the optimal solution case3 after 947 iterations the other two cases case 1 after 224 iterations case 2 after 466 iterations are the intermediate solutions during the evolution of the optimization the optimal solution is marked in green in figs 13 and 14 table 5 shows the comparison of the main parameters and hull resistances between prototype and the three cases fig 16 shows the shapes of the three selected cases as can be seen the optimization makes the underwater hull into a more streamline pattern the comparison between the initial design and the optimal design is shown in table 6 the total resistance of the optimal hull is reduced by 28 9 with respect to the original hull in order to validate the optimization result the numerical simulation of the optimal solution is performed over a range of speeds as stated in section 3 fig 17 shows the comparison of resistance between the original and optimal hull over a range of speeds the total resistance is separated into two parts viscous force and pressure force fig 19 shows the decreases of the resistance of optimal hull moreover the decrease is more noticeable on viscous force than pressure force 7 conclusion an automated optimization platform has been set up based on miga method in combination of the rsm through the platform the automatic generation of the form hulls the analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of swath can be achieved the cfd calculation is performed to analyze the hydrodynamic performance of the samples which are used to generate the rsm a 2 7m swath test model has been taken as a verification model the optimization has been performed aiming at the reduction of the total hull resistance in calm water at fr 0 29 as a result a resistance reduction of 28 9 has been achieved the results have shown the effectiveness of the optimization and the advantage of the achieving hull forms that have lower resistance than the original hull which give the basic guidelines for selecting the optimal underwater form of swath during the design stage in addition the application of optimal latin hypercube design and rsm is an effective way to decrease the computation time while satisfying the accuracy and provides a promising method for the optimization design future work will focus on the multi objective optimization of the swath acknowledgment the authors would like to express their sincere thanks to institute of ship and marine

23046,a computational study of the flow over an axisymmetric submarine hull undergoing unsteady maneuvers is presented the computational model is based on the unsteady reyonolds averaged navier stokes equations solved in body fixed coordinates using the wilcox two equation turbulence model static drift and dynamic sway simulations are performed on a hull geometry with a slenderness ratio of 8 5 and reynolds number of 3 1 million in strut supported and unsupported configurations simulation results are compared with horizontal planar motion mechanism experiments at two reduced frequencies k 0 12 and k 0 03 simulated results for a strut supported hull are compared with experimental values to estimate simulation accuracy for static drift and dynamic sway simulation results for an unsupported hull demonstrate significant hysteresis of the hydrodynamic forces at k 0 12 while at k 0 03 the lateral force and yawing moment collapse towards the quasi steady limit dynamic forces are decomposed in terms of the inviscid added mass and a viscous component which cannot be accounted for by the quasi steady assumption and is attributed to flow history effects the effect of flow history is further shown by visualisations of the wake vorticity finally it is demonstrated that the presence of the support strut results in significant interference effects in all cases keywords cfd urans submarine

realistic submarine undergoing maneuvers at speed in the ocean the hydrodynamics depend not just on the vehicles current position and speed but on the vehicles motion history as well as a submarine maneuvers and the surrounding flow evolves the submarine will continuously shed vorticity into its wake which will influence the instantaneous force on the hull through the coupling of the pressure and velocity fields despite this the majority of models in use today to predict maneuvering performance are based on the quasi steady assumption that the hydrodynamic forces can be accurately predicted based on the instantaneous state alone with no consideration for motion history the semi empirical model presented by jeans et al 2010 uses hydrodynamic impulse concepts in order to predict the quasi steady loads in the lateral and normal directions on a bare submarine hull during translation it is designed for use in a component based submarine dynamics model where the total force on the vehicle is estimated on a per component basis plus interference effects the hull is a difficult component for submarine dynamics models due to the complex flow around it during flow at incidence this flow will feature a pair of counter rotating trailing vorticies attached to the hull by open topology separation lines and results in a nonlinear hydrodynamic force on the hull the extension of the model of jeans et al 2010 to unsteady flows must necessarily model the development of these vortices and will require high fidelity transient data on the evolution of these flows as the jeans model is primarily a tool for predicting the control forces of which the lateral force and yawing moment dominate these two forces are the primary focus of the present study as the first step towards developing a fully unsteady force estimation model a cfd model has been developed to simulate the unsteady flow over a submarine hull during dynamic maneuvers this model is here validated by comparison to a subset of the horizontal planar motion mechanism hppm experiments performed by azarsina azarsina et al 2008 azarsina 2009 in the 90 m ice tank at the national research council nrc facility in st john s newfoundland on the phoenix unmanned underwater vehicle uuv geometry the profile of the phoenix geometry is taken here to be representative of a scaled submarine hull due to its geometric profile and slenderness ratio both of which align with standard submarine geometries the hpmm experiments extensively investigated the maneuvering performance of the phoenix geometry at five different slenderness ratios the results include static translation data for incidence angles from 20 β 20 dynamic sway data from 45 combinations of sway kinematics and geometry slenderness and dynamic pitch data from 25 combinations of pitch kinematics and slenderness while standard practice for submarine hydrodynamics would stipulate the use of a vertical planar motion mechanism vpmm rather than an hppm in order to reduce the effect of the support struts on the results goodman 1960 such a facility is not currently available at nrc despite the unusual nature of the experiment azarsinas experiments are chosen for two reasons the first is that the vast majority of experimental data on submarine maneuvering is reported in terms of the maneuvering coefficients rather than the actual record of transient force the second is that of the tests which do report the transient force data the present study has kinematic conditions such that unsteady effects are believed to be significant to the forces during maneuvering for these reasons this dataset has been chosen as the validation case for the cfd model the present simulations were restricted to the geometry with a slenderness ratio of 8 5 to maintain similarity with typical submarine hulls and to static translation and dynamic sway maneuvers for simplicity this results in a reynolds number based on hull length of 3 1 million simulations are conducted first on the experimental configuration including pmm support struts in order to validate the force predictions in addition to the validation of the cfd model simulations of the unsupported hull were conducted for which no experimental comparison is available the results of unsupported simulations are presented and analyzed in terms of the hysteresis of the hydrodynamic forces and moments during dynamic sway these forces are decomposed into those predicted by inviscid added mass and an unsteady residual force this residual contains the quasi steady lift and drag due to circulatory flow about the body and additional effects which are attributed to the flow history the hydrodynamic effect of the hppm support strut is analyzed along with visualizations of the effect of flow history in the vehicle s wake for both supported and unsupported cases these results demonstrate the significance of unsteady effects on the hydrodynamic forces of submarine hull including the motion history effects due to the vortical wake and reinforce the need for truly unsteady models of submarine hull hydrodynamics the remainder of this paper is laid out as follows an overview of past work on unsteady submarine maneuvering is presented in section 2 details on the methodology and the maneuver kinematics are then presented in sections 3 and 4 an overview on the decomposition of unsteady forces is given in section 5 the results of simulations of the geometry undergoing dynamic sway and steady translation are presented in section 6 finally a summary and some concluding remarks are presented in section 7 2 past studies of unsteady submarine maneuvering while a number of studies have been conducted on submarines in steady translation and steady turning considerably less attention has been paid to the analysis of unsteady forces during maneuvers a series of experiments on a 6 1 pitching prolate spheroid in a wind tunnel have been presented by wetzel et al wetzel and simpson 1998 wetzel et al 1998 their results focus primarily on the separation line location during unsteady maneuvers however force and moment data are also presented in wetzel 1996 while hoang et al 1994 present data on the surface pressure distribution these experiments were then repeated for the darpa suboff geometry first focusing on separation line location hosder and simpson 2007 and later on force and moment granlund and simpson 2004 in all cases the results demonstrated differences between unsteady motion and equivalent steady tests both in terms of separation line location and hull force and moment unfortunately the turning rates and reduced frequency were too low for comparison to realistic submarine maneuvers and it is believed that the deviations from quasi steady results are entirely due to added mass rather than unsteady viscous effects an unappended unmanned underwater vehicle uuv hull was tested in dynamic sway and dynamic yaw using an hpmm by azarsina et al azarsina et al 2008 azarsina 2009 in which it was found that the experimentally predicted hydrodynamic maneuvering coefficients were functions of the frequency of the oscillating motion szebehley and niederer 1953 studied a 7 1 prolate spheroid mounted to a torsional oscillator undergoing free oscillation in a tow tank and found that hydrodynamic damping was again dependent on the motion frequency finally sevik 1964 studied an 8 1 ellipsoid performing small amplitude heaving oscillations in a water channel and found significant transient differences between the oscillatory pressures on the body and those predicted by potential flow theory in addition to the above many additional studies exist which report the maneuvering coefficients found from model testing however the majority of these do not report the hydrodynamic forces or analyze the degree to which the result is dependent on motion history as with experimental studies comparatively little attention has been paid to cfd simulations of unsteady submarine maneuvering rhee and hino 2002 simulated the prolate spheroid case investigated by wetzel and simpson 1998 and found that their results matched the experiment well early in the maneuver but were increasingly in error at late times or equivalently high angles they attributed this to errors in separation prediction due to their use of the spalart allmaras turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1992 similarly taylor et al 1995 attempted to replicate the experimental study of hoang et al 1994 using the algebraic baldwin lomax turbulence model baldwin and lomax 1978 but found their results to also contain significant errors at high angle in both cases the qualitative aspects of the experimental force and moment were well replicated including deviations from equivalent steady maneuvers despite the issues related to numerically predicting separation in addition to the use of captive model experiments and prescribed motion simulations submarine maneuvering has also been studied both experimentally and computationally using free moving tests free swimming experiments such as those reported by overpelt et al 2015 have been remarked as being the best predictors of real world maneuvering performance hess et al 2010 unfortunately such experiments typically do not provide data on the forces during maneuvering such data can be collected by numerical methods such as the simulations of unsteady motion of a buoyantly rising submarine which were studied computationally by bettle et al 2009 they demonstrated the development of a roll instability over the course of the emergency rise maneuver using a coupled six dof motion model and urans cfd solver computational methods have also been used to develop the maneuvering coefficients for submarine bodies as demonstrated by toxopeus 2001 while such studies provide excellent direction towards the use of unsteady cfd methods for submarine maneuvering they typically do not present enough data to conduct the in depth analysis required to evaluate the role of unsteadiness in the hull forces 3 methodology 3 1 numerical method simulations were conducted using the cfd code exn aero produced by envenio inc exn aero is a finite volume code which has been designed to make efficient use of hybrid multicore manycore architectures gerber et al 2013 it solves the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations which are discretized with van leer differencing on the advection term van leer 1975 central differencing on the diffusion term and a second order backwards euler method for the unsteady term the equations are closed with the 2006 wilcox turbulence model wilcox 2006 the implementation of the wilcox 2006 model uses standard closure coefficients with the exception of the cross diffusion term which has been disabled by setting σ d 0 the suitability of the urans turbulence modeling formulation for the dynamic case requires that the turbulent timescales and the time scale of dynamic motion do not overlap if the turbulent timescale is taken to be approximated by the crossflow time scale d v 0 36 s then even in the fastest oscillation this is approximately an order of magnitude smaller then the period of the motion t 3 5 s on this basis a urans model should be justifiable alternative models such as les or des have not been investigated at this time due to the significantly increased computational expense the urans and wilcox equations are solved iteratively using the simple c algorithm with an algebraic multigrid solver all simulations in this study utilized the same solver parameters full details on the numerical models implemented in exn aero are available in gerber et al 2013 within a time step the target mass flow error was set to 0 005 within the equation solver normalized convergence targets were set to 1 0e 4 for the rms residual the achieved convergence depended on the mesh and simulation for the strut supported cases on the medium mesh the achieved mass error averaged 0 008 across all cases with an average of 2 0e 5 for the momentum and turbulent residuals and 5 0e 4 for pressure residuals the unsupported case achieved similar values of 0 008 for the mass error 5 0e 6 for the momentum residuals 1 0e 3 for the pressure residual and 6 0e 5 for the turbulent residuals 3 2 experimental setup and computational mesh the phoenix geometry consists of a half ellipsoid nose constant diameter mid body and parabolic tail with a slenderness ratio of l d 8 5 and a total length of l 1 724 m the profile of the phoenix geometry is shown in fig 1 in the experiment the phoenix geometry is towed down the length of a towing tank which is 90 m long 12 m wide and 3 m deep and which has been filled to a depth of 2 18 m the geometry is towed by an hpmm mechanism which is mounted on rails above the tank the hpmm mechanism is attached to the submerged phoenix geometry by two vertical struts the hpmm mechanism traverses the tank at a speed of 2 m s which is the towing speed of the geometry the hpmm is able to manipulate the struts connected to the phoenix geometry in order to produce different maneuvers in steady translation the struts are set so that phoenix has a constant angle of drift relative to the direction of towing in sinusoidal sway the struts are actuated throughout the maneuver so that a sinusoidally oscillating swaying motion is super imposed on the towing motion in all configurations force data is read from a load cell attached to each strut with the live side connected to the model all force and moment data reported is therefore for the loads experienced by the phoenix hull only full details on the use of pmm mechanisms for submarine maneuvering testing are available in goodman 1960 while the experiment is careful to only record force data from the loading on the phoenix hull the struts which connect the model to the hpmm mechanism necessarily alter the flow field around them and so have an indirect or interference effect on the forces experienced by the vehicle the strut interference effects have not been removed from the experimental data and so the struts must be included in the flow simulation in order to properly validate the flow model each of the struts is symmetric in profile and streamlined in shape with a chord length of 0 176 m and 26 maximum thickness giving a reynolds number based on chord length of 3 1e5 the struts are separated by 0 723 m or 0 42 l and are attached to the phoenix geometry at the parallel mid body the exact strut profile and attachment point are not reported azarsina 2009 the strut profile has been approximated by a naca 0026 airfoil the struts have been positioned so that the quarter chord is evenly spaced about the reported measurement centre of the hull which is located 0 736 m from the nose or λ l 0 427 where λ is the distance measured from the nose the experimental apparatus maintained a small gap between the strut and the hull surface through which instrumentation could be installed however for reasons of computational economy the struts are attached directly to the hull in the simulation in the experimental testing neither the support struts nor the hull used boundary layer trips to instigate transition no attempt has been made to model transition in the simulations the hull centre of buoyancy is located at 0 815 m from the nose or λ l 0 473 all moments are taken about the centre of buoyancy the flow domain is rectangular with the submarine hull placed approximately two body lengths downstream of the inlet ten body lengths upstream of the outlet thirty diameters to the sides 4 37 diameters to the bottom and 5 37 diameters to the top a schematic of the domain is shown in fig 2 the top and bottom boundaries coincide with the calm water line and tank bottom respectively while the side inlet and outlet boundaries are truncations of the experimental domain the simulation domain can then be viewed as a sub domain of the larger experimental domain which moves with the body and is chosen so as to minimize the domain size for computational economy reasons and to avoid a relative motion problem with the tank side walls the no slip boundary condition is applied at the hull and the support struts a high reynolds number wall treatment is used on the support strut ie a wall function while a low reynolds number wall treatment is applied on the hull a symmetry condition is applied at the top and bottom surface labeled as 1 in fig 2 a farfield condition is applied at the inlet and sides labels 2 and 3 which switches operation between a specified velocity inlet and a zero gradient pressure outlet depending on the instantaneous mesh motion at the boundary face a zero gradient pressure outlet is applied at the outlet boundary indicated by label 4 while the hull and strut geometry are symmetrical about a vertical plane sway motion will result in an asymmetrical flow field and hence no symmetry is used on the model three meshes of both the strut supported geometry and an unsupported hull geometry were generated for the purpose of a mesh dependency study all meshes are block structured and use hexahedral cells where possible the meshes for the strut supported and unsupported hull geometries are identical with the same global block topologies and surface resolution details on the coarse medium and fine resolution meshes and time steps are provided in table 1 including the non dimensionalized time step based on both body length l and the strut chord c fig 3 displays longitudinal and lateral cross sections from the medium resolution mesh near the hull surface while fig 4 shows a side on view for reference the medium resolution mesh uses 335 nodes along the hull longitudinally and 241 nodes circumferentially for an average surface resolution of 0 13 c m 2 unless otherwise specified all results reported in this text refer to the medium mesh case 4 maneuvering kinematics simulations were conducted of both steady and unsteady maneuvers steady translation maneuvers represent the quasi steady equivalent of the instantaneous motion during dynamic maneuvers in pure sway maneuvers the objective is to generate an unsteady motion which contains no rotation the model is towed down the tank with a constant forward velocity while the longitudinal axis of the model is kept constantly aligned with the tank walls the model is oscillated side to side with a sinusoidal sway velocity and hence develops a sinusoidally oscillating incidence angle at the same frequency since the model orientation is maintained along the tank axis and no rotation develops the local angle of incidence along the hull is thus constant and equal to the nominal angle of incidence at the model centre of buoyancy the support struts maintain their orientation with the hull and do not align with the flow resulting in the same nominal incidence angle note however that the amplification of the flow by the circular cross section of the hull will result in higher incidence angles on the strut in the vicinity of the junction with the hull the equivalent quasi steady maneuver in this case is then a series of steady translations at the instantaneous angle of incidence the model forward velocity was held constant at u 2 m s the experiment varied the amplitude of the sway displacement from the centreline y 0 and the frequency of the sway oscillation ω so that the nominal amplitude of the sway velocity for all dynamic sway cases was approximately constant at v 0 y 0 ω 0 55 m s this is equivalent to an angle of incidence oscillation amplitude of β 0 16 while a number of different frequencies were studied in the experiment the simulations focused only on the extreme fast and slow frequencies for this work the sway frequency is parameterized by the reduced frequency k which is here defined as 1 k f l 2 u where f is the temporal frequency of oscillation f ω 2 π the fast and slow frequencies simulated by the cfd model then correspond to reduced frequencies of k 0 03 and k 0 12 respectively these choices highlight the differences between fully unsteady and quasi steady maneuvers a full list of the kinematic parameters for each case is given in table 2 note that the sway velocity amplitude in the rapid sway differs slightly from the nominal target of 0 55 m s this is believed to be due to the accuracy of the sway controller in the experimental setup and has been replicated in the simulations for the sake of comparison it is not believed that this difference is large enough to significantly affect the comparison between the rapid and slow sway maneuvers in terms of the effect of k 5 decomposition of unsteady hydrodynamic forces in steady flow the physical origin of the hydrodynamic forces and moments is relatively clear friction along the hull generates shearing forces while the differences in pressure along the body surface generate pressure forces together these generate the six components of the hydrodynamic forces and moments which are determined uniquely by the orientation of the body in a given flow corresponding to the forces and moments the boundary layer and wake behind the vehicle will have a unique vorticity distribution dependent on the body orientation in unsteady flows the rate of change of body orientation also plays a role and different components of the hydrodynamic force can be identified based on their response to this rate of change this section aims only to provide a brief overview of unsteady hydrodynamic forces and a method of their decomposition the reduced frequency can be interpreted as the ratio of the time required for flow to traverse the body length and the time required to complete a cycle of oscillatory motion low k then corresponds to motions which are slow with respect to convection so that a fluid parcel traversing the body does not perceive significant changes in the body orientation during its transit and vice versa the maneuvers investigated here are chosen such that for a given reduced frequency the sway velocity amplitude is constant at v 0 0 55 and the free stream speed can be taken to be constant at u 0 2 08 m s as a result the reynolds number free stream dynamic pressure and range of incidence angles are also constant for all maneuvers this enables maneuvers of differing k to be compared in terms of their instantaneous incidence angle and a meaningful measure of the unsteady effects can be observed as k increases in classical hydrodynamics unsteady effects arise from two different physical mechanisms the first is due to the inertia of the surrounding fluid any body that is accelerated must in turn accelerate some portion of the fluid surrounding it the inertia of the fluid will resist this acceleration and that resistance is felt by the body as an additional force which is proportional to the acceleration of the body this force is referred to as the added mass force since it acts analogously to a virtual increase in the mass of the body added mass forces will act on the body primarily through the pressure field and are often calculated from potential flow theory they are distributed along the body according to the geometry of the body surface and in an incompressible flow react instantaneously to body acceleration the added mass forces in this work are estimated using predictions of the added mass coefficients generated by the aircraft 3d panel method apame code apame is an open source potential flow tool which uses standard methods for solving potential flow problems as outlined by the apame documentation filkovic 2018 the use of apame for generating the added mass coefficients of submarine geometries has been previously validated by marshall 2017 the phoenix geometry is unappended and axisymmetric the maneuvers of interest have no rotation and so the only added mass coefficients of significance are the axial and lateral coefficients a panel density of thirty thousand panels was found to give a sufficiently converged result of x u 6 91 e 4 and y v 1 67 e 2 the coefficients are here non dimensionalized by 1 2 ρ l 3 in addition to the added mass unsteady flows will also possess additional forces due to the dynamic nature of the vehicles wake as the vehicle changes orientation vorticity is shed into the wake in response to the changes in incidence this unsteady wake vorticity modifies the flow field from what it would be in the equivalent steady case and thus provides a memory effect due to the wake s time history through the biot savart law it is known that any modification of the wake vorticity must modify the velocity field and hence the pressure field and the forces and moments on the vehicle and so shed vorticity will provide additional unsteady forces the effect of a parcel of shed vorticity on the hydrodynamic force will diminish as the parcel is swept downstream the rate at which vorticity is shed into the wake depends on the rate of oscillation of the body while the rate at which it is swept downstream is characterized by the vehicles velocity and so the unsteady force due to shed vorticity is taken to be a function of k throughout this work reference is made to circulatory forces and to circulatory effects which alter the flowfield these phrases are meant to include all those forces and effects due to the distribution of vorticity about the body and in the wake they include both quasi steady viscous forces and the flow history effects due to the dynamic wake structure these circulatory forces may contain components in phase with either the velocity or acceleration the decomposition of the hydrodynamic forces into added mass and circulatory components is unfortunately not straight forward classically added mass forces act in proportion to acceleration while circulatory forces are proportional to both ω and the vehicles velocity and so are sometimes described as a frequency dependent damping factor for the oscillatory motions chosen however the acceleration is also a function of ω and so it is not possible to directly separate a function of ω from one of v the procedure taken in the validation is to separate the forces based on a phase decomposition of the force signal with forces acting in phase with acceleration attributed to added mass and inertia and those acting in phase with velocity attributed to circulatory effects this is in keeping with the experimental database developed by azarsina 2009 as well as the traditional procedures of experimental hydrodynamics goodman 1960 and so will also allow direct comparison of the unsteady force components between the simulation results and the experimentally determined values it should be noted however that this procedure is somewhat arbitrary as it is not guaranteed that all components in phase with acceleration are physically due to added mass and all components in phase with velocity are circulatory this issue is discussed in detail by sarpkaya 2000 for the unsupported cases the forces will instead be decomposed into those predicted by the inviscid added mass coefficients presented above and an unsteady residual force which is taken to contain all of the flow history and vorticity information this decomposition mirrors the approach taken in most submarine dynamics models by its use of the inviscid added mass coefficients and so the deviation of the residual force from the equivalent steady forces can then be taken to be a measure of the error due to the quasi steady assumption 6 simulation results and discussion simulations have been completed for four different configurations of the phoenix experiment the cfd model was first validated by comparing the results of simulations of the experimental configuration including the pmm support struts to the experimentally determine values for the forces and moments this is done for both steady translation in section 6 1 and dynamic sway in section 6 2 in order to establish the accuracy of the model for conditions ranging from steady flow through quasi steady and truly unsteady flow conditions while these simulations are necessary in order to build confidence in the cfd model the ultimate goal of the research project is to examine the unsteady flow along bare submarine hulls for which experimental data is not available for this reason both the static and dynamic tests are repeated with the pmm struts removed the data from these simulations is analyzed to highlight the effect of unsteady flow conditions on the hydrodynamics and to expose the deficiency of the quasi static assumption for this flow in sections 6 3 and 6 4 while not a goal of the present research it was also considered of interest to compare the results from the strut supported and unsupported tests in order to quantify the interference caused by the hpmm support strut in the experimental configuration these results are presented in section 6 5 6 1 strut supported steady translation static simulations of the strut supported geometry were conducted at incidence angles of 0 4 8 12 and 16 in order to validate the cfd model for steady flow conditions the simulations were run with d t 0 001 seconds for 5 s starting from a uniform flow field for all cases on the coarse and medium meshes and for the fine mesh cases above 8 incidence this run time was sufficient for the force and moment data to achieve steady mean values with a standard deviation of less then one percent for the final second of simulation which was taken to be a converged result for the fine mesh cases with incidence angles less than or equal to 8 oscillations in the flow at the junction of the hull and the strut prevented the force values from converging to within this standard these oscillations are due to periodic vortex shedding from a leading edge separation on the rear strut at the junction where it meets the hull where the struts meet the hull vortices are formed which will propagate into the wake behind the strut fig 5 plots contours of vorticity in the wake behind the strut and near the junction in which the junction vortices and the interaction between the struts is clearly visible as the incidence angle decreases the rear strut operates increasingly in the wake of the forward strut resulting in complex flows on the tail of the submarine the amplitude of the force oscillation varied with the mesh and incidence angle but was less then 10 of the mean value in all cases fig 6 through 8 plot the axial force lateral force and yawing moment for the hull as a function of angle of incidence and compares these to the experimental results reported by azarsina et al 2008 the experimental trends are well produced by all results with the exception of the axial force predicted at 16 the flow at high angles is quite complex due to the interaction of the strut and the hull especially in the vicinity of the strut hull junction fig 9 a plots the skin friction lines and pressure contours from simulated results for the hull at 12 while fig 9b plots the same at 16 it is clear from the figures that the struts alter the simulated flow field in their vicinity and that the simulated flow is sensitive to changes in drift angle in this region while it is not possible to comment on the accuracy of the simulated flow field in this region without additional data it is clear that the struts introduce large uncertainties which are significantly effected by changes in the flow the goal of studies of submarine maneuvering is often to predict the set of non dimensional coefficients which describe a vehicles maneuvering performance for steady translations this is done by calculating the slope of the force curves in fig 6 through 8 as they pass through zero using fig 7 an estimate of d y d β 0 050 is calculated for the simulated result on the medium mesh while a value of d y d β 0 072 is found for the experimental data similarly using fig 8 an estimate of d n d β 0 023 is found from medium mesh simulations versus a value of d n d β 0 021 from experimental data this corresponds to a discrepancies of 30 8 laterally and 9 8 in yaw as with the force data themselves these estimates are subject to significant uncertainties as a result of the strut issues related to the prediction of the force coefficients and the effect of the strut will be explored further in section 6 5 the experiment only reports the standard deviation for the axial force signal during steady straight ahead flow which is plotted in fig 6 this value was reported by azarsina in azarsina 2009 and is calculated by taking the standard deviation of the measured axial force signal during a single experimental run of the phoenix geometry at zero degree incidence while the value is quite high in comparison to the reported force note that the axial force at zero degrees drift represents a low loading state compared to for example the lateral force at high drift further at any significant angle of drift it is expected that the lateral force will be significantly higher than the axial force for a body of this type as a result axial forces at low drift are expected to have higher relative uncertainty in comparison to lateral forces at high drift this is a known issue with experimental testing across large ranges of drift angle and can be seen in other similar results such as those of watt et al 1993 simulated values of the axial force are well within this range of deviation for the zero degree drift condition the simulations predict a higher yawing moment than the experiment at all angles of incidence while the lateral force is predicted higher than the experiment at high angles but slightly lower than the experiment at low angles this corresponds to an average discrepancy between experimental and simulated values of 21 axially 14 laterally and 22 in yaw without additional information on the experimental error it is difficult to comment on the implications of these discrepancies between the simulated and experimental results as the simulated results are within the experimental uncertainty for the case for which it is reported if that uncertainty is taken to be representative of the experiment then the axial force predictions are within this range at all incidences and the lateral force results are within it for angles below 12 it is known from previous work on submarine hulls in translation jeans et al 2009 that turbulent anisotropy is significant within the wake and that reynold s stress turbulence models give improved force predictions compared to two equation models such as the wilcox model it is possible then that better agreement between the experimental results and the simulation results could be obtained from a reynold s stress model in addition it is known that boundary layer transition can have a significant impact on hydrodynamic forces no attempt at modeling transition has been made in this work however it is possible that the results could be improved by implementing a transition model based on the significance of the flow around the junction of the struts and the hull it is also likely that the simulation results are sensitive to the assumptions made regarding the strut profile and positioning mesh refinement was seen to lower the simulated yawing moment results for all angles while the lateral force prediction is either lowered or held constant axial force predictions increased with mesh refinement at the intermediate angles of 8 and 12 but decreased at 4 and 16 these different trends with mesh refinement are thought to be due to the complexity of the flow at the junction of the struts and the hull it is believed that the coarse mesh diffuses the wake of the upstream strut and works to suppress some of the complex flow in the rear strut junction as a result resulting in a net increase in the lateral pressure force at the tail at low angles similarly the transition of the separation on the rear strut junction from a leading edge bubble type to a fully stalled type is suppressed by the coarse mesh these results demonstrate significant variation in the effects of mesh refinement at different incident angles and result in a very noisy signal from which to estimate grid dependent error using the procedure of celik et al 2008 and the lateral force and yawing moment predictions at 8 the fine mesh grid convergence index celik et al 2008 was estimated at 4 7 and 1 2 respectively indicating good convergence towards a grid independent solution at these conditions similarly at these conditions the relative error between the medium and fine meshes was 3 3 for both lateral force and yawing moment the 8 case is the mean angle of attack studied in this work and so was taken as the best representation of the kinematic range of the maneuvers based on these results it was concluded that the medium mesh case gives an appropriate balance of accuracy and computational economy the hydrodynamics are significantly effected by the flow around the strut junctions which is extremely sensitive to the local mesh and turbulence model as well as the assumptions made regarding the strut geometry the goal of this study however is to demonstrate reasonable confidence in the cfd model for the purposes of simulating unsupported hulls which do not feature the complications of the flow in the strut hull junctions for this reason further improvement of the computational model for the strut supported case was not pursued 6 2 strut supported dynamic sway dynamic sway simulations of the strut supported geometry were conducted using the kinematics presented in table 2 using the mesh and time step parameters given in table 1 in order to validate the cfd model for quasi steady and unsteady flow conditions the experiment began recording as the model passed the centreline of the tank corresponding to maximum sway velocity and zero sway acceleration the dynamic simulations start with a brief relaxation time during which the kinematics are held at the initial condition to remove any non physical transient due to the startup procedure the time signal is shifted accordingly ie t 0 during the relaxation period while t 0 corresponds to the beginning of sway motion at the tank centreline azarsina s experiments report the results of a cosine fit to the measured lateral force and yawing moment the fit is reported in terms of the amplitude of the fitting cosine y 0 and n 0 and the phase angle ϕ y and ϕ n the inertia of the model mass m 49 2 kg when flooded was included in the reported forces azarsina 2009 and therefore must be added to the cfd solution in his work azarsina defines a positive damping force as one which opposes the sway velocity but a positive apparent inertial force as one which is directed with the acceleration azarsina 2009 the fluid force from cfd will contain inertial components which are positive when opposed to the acceleration and damping components which are positive when opposed to the velocity if y 0 c f d and ϕ y c f d are the magnitude and phase angle of the force from cfd then the inertial and damping components are given by 2 y i y 0 c f d sin ϕ y c f d sin ω t 3 y d y 0 c f d cos ϕ y c f d cos ω t in order to be consistent with the experiment the sign of the inertial component must be reversed and then the components must be summed along with the inertia of the flooded model the experimental force is then given by 4 y e x p m v y i y d all results reported in this section are given in terms of the experimental lateral force from equation 4 no such correction is required for the axial force or yawing moment since there is no inertial effect on these quantities the baseline case was taken to be the rapid k 0 12 sway with the medium mesh and timestep which was simulated for 18 s or 5 cycles after 5 cycles of the rapid sway the standard deviation of the force amplitude was 0 25 while the standard deviation of the force phase angle was 0 32 both the amplitude and the phase of the first cycle deviate by 1 from the mean value and so it was concluded that only a single cycle was required to converge the amplitude and phase statistics these results were typical of all force and moment components all subsequent simulations completed 2 5 cycles corresponding to approximately 9 s for the rapid sway and 36 s for the slow way in order to balance computational economy and confidence in the simulated data as well as to ensure no influence due to the startup transient the results of the dynamic sway simulations are reported in table 3 for the amplitude and phase of the fitting cosines and in table 5 for the apparent mass and damping factor also included in both tables are the results of a refinement study on the rapid sway case the apparent mass and damping factor are found by dividing the magnitude of the force component by the corresponding motion component ie m a p p a r e n t y i m v v and b y d v the apparent mass in table 4 represents the combination of the flooded vehicle mass and the inertia of the surrounding fluid and thus will always be greater than the mass of the vehicle the experimental and simulated phase angles have good agreement with the relative error between simulated and experimental results 5 for all cases the amplitude of the simulated lateral force agrees well with the experiment at high k where the relative error is between 14 and 9 5 and within the range of error from the static simulations the simulation predicts a much greater force amplitude at low k however with a relative error of 38 which is much higher then the static error the simulated yawing moment amplitude is higher than the experiment for all cases with an average relative error of approximately 44 the static simulations similarly predicted a higher yawing moment in all cases although with a lower relative value based on the results for the apparent mass and damping factor predictions in table 4 it appears that the discrepancy between simulated and experimental values is more pronounced in the damping components improved mesh resolution reduces the damping factor while having little effect on the apparent mass prediction it is important to note however that a large percentage of the apparent mass is due to the physical mass of the system and so errors in the force amplitude and phase angle are expected to be less significant in the apparent mass prediction with the close agreement of the phase angles in table 3 it is likely that much of the over prediction of the damping factor is driven by the over prediction of the force amplitude as in the case of the force amplitude at high k this result is in keeping with the error of the static experiments at low k it is possible that additional error has been introduced beyond that present in the static simulations at low k there is an additional discrepancy in the apparent mass prediction both the experiment and the simulations predict a reduction in the inertial force as the acceleration goes to zero in keeping with theory the inertial force does not decrease in proportion to the acceleration however leading to an increase in the predicted apparent mass potential flow theory would predict that the apparent mass is constant for all accelerating motion and the experiment did find that the apparent mass tended to a constant value as k increased azarsina 2009 it is possible then that the increase of apparent mass as k approaches zero is due to a viscous effect which is in phase with acceleration becoming more pronounced for both the experiment and the simulations the behaviour of the apparent mass as k 0 is ill defined and the evaluation of the apparent mass becomes more difficult due to the decreasing significance of the acceleration and so it is expected that the accuracy of apparent mass prediction is worse at low k as the majority of the interest is in higher values of k where unsteady effects are expected to be significant this issue has not been investigated further 6 3 unsupported dynamic sway with the physical veracity of the cfd model established by the comparison of the strut supported simulations with experiment the steady and dynamic maneuvering simulations were repeated using the unsupported geometry in order to demonstrate the significant effect of flow history and the weakness of the quasi steady assumption no experimental data is available for the validation of the unsupported geometry and so it is only possible to infer the accuracy of the cfd model by comparison with the strut supported case and with computational results from other geometries the grid dependency of the unsupported geometry simulations was examined using the cases of steady translation at 16 incidence and dynamic sway at k 0 12 the predicted values at all resolutions are shown in table 5 for the lateral force amplitude and for the dynamic case the phase angle these cases demonstrated excellent grid convergence with an approximately 1 5 variation during steady translation and 1 variation in dynamic sway the medium resolution case is therefore taken to be sufficiently resolved and all further results are based on the medium resolution parameters the forces and moments for both steady and dynamic maneuvers are plotted in fig 10 through 12 as a function of incidence angle note that these forces and moments are the traditional hydrodynamic forces as would be calculated from integration of the pressure and shear stress on the hull they do not include the inertia of the flooded model and have not been corrected using equation 4 these plots omit the initial relaxation period ie no data is plotted for t 0 the lateral force and yawing moment hysteresis loops are traversed in the clockwise direction starting from the left the axial force similarly starts in the left and moves initially to the right for clarity the direction of traverse has been indicated by colour coded arrows in the relevant figures and the initial position is indicated with a triangular marker from the data in fig 10 through 12 there is a clear hysteresis effect for both the forces and moment which varies in effect with increasing k in these plots zero incidence corresponds to the condition of zero sway velocity and hence maximum sway acceleration and vice versa for high incidence the axial velocity is held constant through the maneuver so there is no axial added mass force and the hysteresis of the axial force must then be entirely due to unsteady circulatory effects the mean axial force during the maneuver is seen to first decrease and then increase with increasing k and there is no clear collapse towards the quasi steady limit at low k the two inner loops at low angles contain the bulk of the hysteresis while at high k the outer loops at high angles are larger in all cases the deviation from the quasi steady line is relatively small in comparison with the deviation of the lateral force the lateral force must contain forces due to both added mass and circulatory effects it is likely that much of the lateral force hysteresis at low angles is due to added mass due to the high acceleration at these instants the yawing moment displays relatively little effect of unsteady sway motion compared to the forces which is consistent with the result that the yawing moment about the centre of buoyancy would have no added mass contribution in sway suggesting minimal circulatory effect on the yaw from these results the effect of dynamic motion on the hydrodynamic forces and moments is quite significant for reduced frequencies as low as k 0 03 the lateral force and yawing moment are seen to clearly collapse towards the quasi steady limit as k is reduced the lateral force can be further analyzed by decomposition into the force from inviscid added mass predictions and an unsteady residual force r t as 5 y t y v v t r t figs 13 and 14 plot this decomposition for k 0 03 and k 0 12 respectively note that the residual force hysteresis loops are traversed in the counter clockwise direction the residual forces are directly compared in fig 15 along with the steady translation results and the predictions from the model of jeans et al 2010 for this configuration these results clearly demonstrate that there is a significant error associated with the quasi steady assumption in the model of jeans et al which grows in proportion to k the reader may also note the good agreement between the model predictions and the results of the steady translation simulations lending increased confidence to the unsupported cfd model the error of the quasi steady assumption can be estimated by subtracting the jeans et al model prediction from the unsteady residual force the result is plotted in fig 16 the error has here been normalized by the root mean square rms of the total lateral force during the maneuver to give an average again rms error of 14 at k 0 03 and 36 at k 0 12 these results clearly demonstrate a significant motion history effect on the hydrodynamic forces for realistic values of the reduced frequency during submarine maneuvering 6 4 wake topology of the unsupported hull fig 10 through 12 clearly demonstrate the significant effect that sway oscillation can have on the hydrodynamic forces felt by the vehicle any change in the forces and moments on the body must be accompanied by changes in the flow field in particular the vorticity in the wake and so it is instructive to examine the effects of dynamic motion on the flow field further insight into the effects of dynamic sway motion can then be gained by analysis of these changes on an unsupported hull flow at incidence generates cross flow velocities along the hull which feed a pair of equal and counter rotating vortices through open topology separation lines whose strength grows in proportion to the incidence angle shown in fig 17 are contours of vorticity magnitude at five stations along the hull of the vehicle and into the wake found from simulations of steady translation of the unsupported vehicle the cross flow vortices are clearly visible in the last three stations of fig 17b fig 18 plots the same vorticity contours at an instantaneous incidence angle of β 16 during dynamic sway of the unsupported hull the slow sway in fig 18a shows negligible change due to sway motion in comparison to the static case consistent with quasi steady flow at low reduced frequencies the rapid sway in fig 18b however demonstrates significant differences due to the sway motion the hull vortices are reduced in size compared to the steady case and appear to be pulled towards the centreline as opposed to the more rounded static vortices this is most obvious in the aft plane which is significantly deformed compared to the steady case the high incidence angle of the results in fig 18 corresponds with the high velocity and low acceleration portion of the sway maneuver an examination of fig 11 however shows that hysteresis is expected to be most significant at low incidence angles corresponding to low velocity and high acceleration fig 19 plots the contours of wake vorticity at an instantaneous incidence of β 4 for dynamic motion of the unsupported hull with both positive and negative acceleration for this motion positive acceleration corresponds with decreasing β and vice versa unlike the high incidence case significant differences from the static wake are clearly visible even during slow oscillations for increasing β and high k the wake in fig 19c is clearly delayed in comparison with the static case with the majority of the wake vorticity still concentrated on the windward side of the body the delay is not as obvious at low k however the wake plane vorticity is notably more circular than in the steady case for decreasing β in fig 19b and d both reduced frequencies have noticeable differences compared to the steady case at k 0 03 in fig 19b the vortex contours are slightly more pronounced than the steady case particularly at the aft station at k 0 12 in fig 19d this is much more pronounced particularly at the two rearmost stations 6 5 hydrodynamic effect of the support strut standard experimental practice holds that a vertical pmm mechanism should be used to test maneuvering performance in sway due to the significant interference of the support struts as previously mentioned a horizontal mechanism was chosen due to lack of vpmm facilities however no attempt was made to quantify the interference effect of the support struts in azarsina 2009 fig 20 through 22 compare the simulated forces and moments on the body in steady translation for the strut supported and unsupported geometries as would be expected the differences are most pronounced at high angles of incidence where the effects of flow separation and lift carry over from the struts to the body are largest the support strut can be seen to increase the axial force and yawing moment by small but significant amounts the effect of the strut on the lateral force however is extremely large more than doubling the lateral force at β 16 this has the effect of not only over predicting the forces experienced on the vehicle but would also significantly effect predictions for the maneuvering performance if control derivatives for example y v were evaluated from this data by taking the slope of the force curve through zero the strut supported case would predict y v 0 0289 while the unsupported case predicts y v 0 0083 the strut supported test would predict a lateral force dependence on sway velocity of almost 3 5 times the unsupported case these results clearly demonstrate the significant effect of strut interference on sway maneuvering testing using hpmm contours of the wake vorticity during static translation of the strut supported hull are shown in fig 23 comparing these results to those for the unsupported hull in fig 17 the effect of the struts is clearly significant at low incidence angles in fig 23a the hull vortices cannot be clearly discerned but strong cross flow vortices have been generated at the junction of the strut and the hull at high incidence angles in fig 23b the hull vortices are now visible however the upper hull vortex is merged with the forward junction vortex and has been significantly deformed in comparison with the lower hull vortex at all angles of incidence the wake vorticity has clearly been pulled towards the upper surface due to the presence of the struts both figures also demonstrate the presence of span wise vortex sheets generated by the struts these junction vortices and their effect on the hull vortices are significant departures from the unsupported case on the upper half of the hull fig 24 compares the lateral force distribution on the body at β 16 for the unsupported and strut supported cases with the position of the struts clearly marked the effect of the struts is to increase the force on the mid body in comparison with the unsupported case the presence of the increased wake vorticity reduces the pressure recovery on the lee of the vehicle from the unsupported case resulting in a significantly higher lateral pressure force on the mid body the effect of the struts on the nose and tail is seen to be comparatively minor fig 25 compares the hydrodynamic forces for the unsupported and strut supported vehicle during dynamic sway the effect of the strut on the yawing moment is again relatively minor with the unsupported hull having slightly decreased amplitude and phase with respect to the sway velocity and slightly more hysteresis effect in general in comparison the axial and lateral forces are seen to be significantly affected by the presence of the support strut the strut supported vehicle has an increased axial and lateral force amplitude and for the lateral force a large variation in the phase the hysteresis of the axial force is also more pronounced in the strut supported case these results clearly demonstrate the significant interference effect of the hpmm support struts in sway experiments 7 summary and conclusions simulations of the strut supported phoenix uuv geometry were conducted using the exn aero cfd code the strut supported geometry was first studied in steady translation at incidence angles up to 16 and a reynolds number of 3 1 million in order to validate the model for steady flows the simulated results were compared with experimental data from towing tank trials and are within the experimental uncertainty where that data is available it was demonstrated that the hpmm support struts have a significant affect on the flow around the hull and the resulting hydrodynamic forces and moments variation of mesh resolution was seen to effect the separation on the rear strut causing significant changes in the predicted force transient simulations of the strut supported submarine undergoing a dynamic pure sway maneuver were conducted at reduced frequencies of k 0 03 and k 0 12 in order to further validate the model for quasi steady and unsteady flows the phase angle and amplitude of the cosine fit lateral force and yawing moment are compared with experiment and are consistent with the accuracy of the static results the discrepancy between the experiment and simulation results for lateral force can be seen to be primarily due to relatively high damping in the simulation improved mesh resolution was seen to decrease the damping force resulting in better agreement both the experiment and the simulation predict an increase in the apparent mass of the system with decreasing reduced frequency suggesting a possible frequency dependence or viscous effect on the added mass force as with the static case it is believed that the dynamic results are sensitive to the strut geometry for both the static and dynamic cases it is expected that improved results could be obtained with turbulence models that are better able to capture the known anisotropy of the vehicles wake such as reynolds stress models or les wake vorticity contours were examined for both the strut supported and unsupported cases to further demonstrate the effects of motion history for the unsupported hull clear differences in the wake topology were visible when comparing dynamic sway and steady translation and the degree of difference was proportional to the reduced frequencies these results clearly demonstrate the significance of flow history in unsteady flows the effect of the struts on the hydrodynamic forces and moments was examined by comparison between the simulated results for the unsupported and supported geometries in both steady translation and dynamic sway it was seen that the strut has a significant effect on the lateral force prediction in both static and dynamic maneuvers examination of the wake vorticity contours in steady translation revealed that the wake is dominated by the action of the upper hull vortex which is generated by cross flow along the hull but has been distorted by vorticity generated at the junction of the forward strut and the hull the action of this vortex accounts for the increased force and hysteresis on the mid body of the vehicle the simulated hydrodynamic forces and moments of the unsupported geometry were examined as a function of incidence angle in order to demonstrate the significant effect of flow history and the weakness of the quasi steady assumption the forces and moments clearly demonstrated hysteresis in the lateral force and yawing moment predictions the results collapse towards the quasi steady limit of static translation as k is reduced with the value of that limit likely to be near k 0 03 for the lateral force the yawing moment appeared to be approximately quasi steady up to k 0 12 the highest reduced frequency examined the lateral force hysteresis was decomposed into an inviscid added mass contribution and an unsteady residual which contained all circulatory effects it was demonstrated that a quasi steady analysis using only the steady translation model of jeans et al and the inviscid added mass coefficients contained significant error due to

23046,a computational study of the flow over an axisymmetric submarine hull undergoing unsteady maneuvers is presented the computational model is based on the unsteady reyonolds averaged navier stokes equations solved in body fixed coordinates using the wilcox two equation turbulence model static drift and dynamic sway simulations are performed on a hull geometry with a slenderness ratio of 8 5 and reynolds number of 3 1 million in strut supported and unsupported configurations simulation results are compared with horizontal planar motion mechanism experiments at two reduced frequencies k 0 12 and k 0 03 simulated results for a strut supported hull are compared with experimental values to estimate simulation accuracy for static drift and dynamic sway simulation results for an unsupported hull demonstrate significant hysteresis of the hydrodynamic forces at k 0 12 while at k 0 03 the lateral force and yawing moment collapse towards the quasi steady limit dynamic forces are decomposed in terms of the inviscid added mass and a viscous component which cannot be accounted for by the quasi steady assumption and is attributed to flow history effects the effect of flow history is further shown by visualisations of the wake vorticity finally it is demonstrated that the presence of the support strut results in significant interference effects in all cases keywords cfd urans submarine

realistic submarine undergoing maneuvers at speed in the ocean the hydrodynamics depend not just on the vehicles current position and speed but on the vehicles motion history as well as a submarine maneuvers and the surrounding flow evolves the submarine will continuously shed vorticity into its wake which will influence the instantaneous force on the hull through the coupling of the pressure and velocity fields despite this the majority of models in use today to predict maneuvering performance are based on the quasi steady assumption that the hydrodynamic forces can be accurately predicted based on the instantaneous state alone with no consideration for motion history the semi empirical model presented by jeans et al 2010 uses hydrodynamic impulse concepts in order to predict the quasi steady loads in the lateral and normal directions on a bare submarine hull during translation it is designed for use in a component based submarine dynamics model where the total force on the vehicle is estimated on a per component basis plus interference effects the hull is a difficult component for submarine dynamics models due to the complex flow around it during flow at incidence this flow will feature a pair of counter rotating trailing vorticies attached to the hull by open topology separation lines and results in a nonlinear hydrodynamic force on the hull the extension of the model of jeans et al 2010 to unsteady flows must necessarily model the development of these vortices and will require high fidelity transient data on the evolution of these flows as the jeans model is primarily a tool for predicting the control forces of which the lateral force and yawing moment dominate these two forces are the primary focus of the present study as the first step towards developing a fully unsteady force estimation model a cfd model has been developed to simulate the unsteady flow over a submarine hull during dynamic maneuvers this model is here validated by comparison to a subset of the horizontal planar motion mechanism hppm experiments performed by azarsina azarsina et al 2008 azarsina 2009 in the 90 m ice tank at the national research council nrc facility in st john s newfoundland on the phoenix unmanned underwater vehicle uuv geometry the profile of the phoenix geometry is taken here to be representative of a scaled submarine hull due to its geometric profile and slenderness ratio both of which align with standard submarine geometries the hpmm experiments extensively investigated the maneuvering performance of the phoenix geometry at five different slenderness ratios the results include static translation data for incidence angles from 20 β 20 dynamic sway data from 45 combinations of sway kinematics and geometry slenderness and dynamic pitch data from 25 combinations of pitch kinematics and slenderness while standard practice for submarine hydrodynamics would stipulate the use of a vertical planar motion mechanism vpmm rather than an hppm in order to reduce the effect of the support struts on the results goodman 1960 such a facility is not currently available at nrc despite the unusual nature of the experiment azarsinas experiments are chosen for two reasons the first is that the vast majority of experimental data on submarine maneuvering is reported in terms of the maneuvering coefficients rather than the actual record of transient force the second is that of the tests which do report the transient force data the present study has kinematic conditions such that unsteady effects are believed to be significant to the forces during maneuvering for these reasons this dataset has been chosen as the validation case for the cfd model the present simulations were restricted to the geometry with a slenderness ratio of 8 5 to maintain similarity with typical submarine hulls and to static translation and dynamic sway maneuvers for simplicity this results in a reynolds number based on hull length of 3 1 million simulations are conducted first on the experimental configuration including pmm support struts in order to validate the force predictions in addition to the validation of the cfd model simulations of the unsupported hull were conducted for which no experimental comparison is available the results of unsupported simulations are presented and analyzed in terms of the hysteresis of the hydrodynamic forces and moments during dynamic sway these forces are decomposed into those predicted by inviscid added mass and an unsteady residual force this residual contains the quasi steady lift and drag due to circulatory flow about the body and additional effects which are attributed to the flow history the hydrodynamic effect of the hppm support strut is analyzed along with visualizations of the effect of flow history in the vehicle s wake for both supported and unsupported cases these results demonstrate the significance of unsteady effects on the hydrodynamic forces of submarine hull including the motion history effects due to the vortical wake and reinforce the need for truly unsteady models of submarine hull hydrodynamics the remainder of this paper is laid out as follows an overview of past work on unsteady submarine maneuvering is presented in section 2 details on the methodology and the maneuver kinematics are then presented in sections 3 and 4 an overview on the decomposition of unsteady forces is given in section 5 the results of simulations of the geometry undergoing dynamic sway and steady translation are presented in section 6 finally a summary and some concluding remarks are presented in section 7 2 past studies of unsteady submarine maneuvering while a number of studies have been conducted on submarines in steady translation and steady turning considerably less attention has been paid to the analysis of unsteady forces during maneuvers a series of experiments on a 6 1 pitching prolate spheroid in a wind tunnel have been presented by wetzel et al wetzel and simpson 1998 wetzel et al 1998 their results focus primarily on the separation line location during unsteady maneuvers however force and moment data are also presented in wetzel 1996 while hoang et al 1994 present data on the surface pressure distribution these experiments were then repeated for the darpa suboff geometry first focusing on separation line location hosder and simpson 2007 and later on force and moment granlund and simpson 2004 in all cases the results demonstrated differences between unsteady motion and equivalent steady tests both in terms of separation line location and hull force and moment unfortunately the turning rates and reduced frequency were too low for comparison to realistic submarine maneuvers and it is believed that the deviations from quasi steady results are entirely due to added mass rather than unsteady viscous effects an unappended unmanned underwater vehicle uuv hull was tested in dynamic sway and dynamic yaw using an hpmm by azarsina et al azarsina et al 2008 azarsina 2009 in which it was found that the experimentally predicted hydrodynamic maneuvering coefficients were functions of the frequency of the oscillating motion szebehley and niederer 1953 studied a 7 1 prolate spheroid mounted to a torsional oscillator undergoing free oscillation in a tow tank and found that hydrodynamic damping was again dependent on the motion frequency finally sevik 1964 studied an 8 1 ellipsoid performing small amplitude heaving oscillations in a water channel and found significant transient differences between the oscillatory pressures on the body and those predicted by potential flow theory in addition to the above many additional studies exist which report the maneuvering coefficients found from model testing however the majority of these do not report the hydrodynamic forces or analyze the degree to which the result is dependent on motion history as with experimental studies comparatively little attention has been paid to cfd simulations of unsteady submarine maneuvering rhee and hino 2002 simulated the prolate spheroid case investigated by wetzel and simpson 1998 and found that their results matched the experiment well early in the maneuver but were increasingly in error at late times or equivalently high angles they attributed this to errors in separation prediction due to their use of the spalart allmaras turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1992 similarly taylor et al 1995 attempted to replicate the experimental study of hoang et al 1994 using the algebraic baldwin lomax turbulence model baldwin and lomax 1978 but found their results to also contain significant errors at high angle in both cases the qualitative aspects of the experimental force and moment were well replicated including deviations from equivalent steady maneuvers despite the issues related to numerically predicting separation in addition to the use of captive model experiments and prescribed motion simulations submarine maneuvering has also been studied both experimentally and computationally using free moving tests free swimming experiments such as those reported by overpelt et al 2015 have been remarked as being the best predictors of real world maneuvering performance hess et al 2010 unfortunately such experiments typically do not provide data on the forces during maneuvering such data can be collected by numerical methods such as the simulations of unsteady motion of a buoyantly rising submarine which were studied computationally by bettle et al 2009 they demonstrated the development of a roll instability over the course of the emergency rise maneuver using a coupled six dof motion model and urans cfd solver computational methods have also been used to develop the maneuvering coefficients for submarine bodies as demonstrated by toxopeus 2001 while such studies provide excellent direction towards the use of unsteady cfd methods for submarine maneuvering they typically do not present enough data to conduct the in depth analysis required to evaluate the role of unsteadiness in the hull forces 3 methodology 3 1 numerical method simulations were conducted using the cfd code exn aero produced by envenio inc exn aero is a finite volume code which has been designed to make efficient use of hybrid multicore manycore architectures gerber et al 2013 it solves the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations which are discretized with van leer differencing on the advection term van leer 1975 central differencing on the diffusion term and a second order backwards euler method for the unsteady term the equations are closed with the 2006 wilcox turbulence model wilcox 2006 the implementation of the wilcox 2006 model uses standard closure coefficients with the exception of the cross diffusion term which has been disabled by setting σ d 0 the suitability of the urans turbulence modeling formulation for the dynamic case requires that the turbulent timescales and the time scale of dynamic motion do not overlap if the turbulent timescale is taken to be approximated by the crossflow time scale d v 0 36 s then even in the fastest oscillation this is approximately an order of magnitude smaller then the period of the motion t 3 5 s on this basis a urans model should be justifiable alternative models such as les or des have not been investigated at this time due to the significantly increased computational expense the urans and wilcox equations are solved iteratively using the simple c algorithm with an algebraic multigrid solver all simulations in this study utilized the same solver parameters full details on the numerical models implemented in exn aero are available in gerber et al 2013 within a time step the target mass flow error was set to 0 005 within the equation solver normalized convergence targets were set to 1 0e 4 for the rms residual the achieved convergence depended on the mesh and simulation for the strut supported cases on the medium mesh the achieved mass error averaged 0 008 across all cases with an average of 2 0e 5 for the momentum and turbulent residuals and 5 0e 4 for pressure residuals the unsupported case achieved similar values of 0 008 for the mass error 5 0e 6 for the momentum residuals 1 0e 3 for the pressure residual and 6 0e 5 for the turbulent residuals 3 2 experimental setup and computational mesh the phoenix geometry consists of a half ellipsoid nose constant diameter mid body and parabolic tail with a slenderness ratio of l d 8 5 and a total length of l 1 724 m the profile of the phoenix geometry is shown in fig 1 in the experiment the phoenix geometry is towed down the length of a towing tank which is 90 m long 12 m wide and 3 m deep and which has been filled to a depth of 2 18 m the geometry is towed by an hpmm mechanism which is mounted on rails above the tank the hpmm mechanism is attached to the submerged phoenix geometry by two vertical struts the hpmm mechanism traverses the tank at a speed of 2 m s which is the towing speed of the geometry the hpmm is able to manipulate the struts connected to the phoenix geometry in order to produce different maneuvers in steady translation the struts are set so that phoenix has a constant angle of drift relative to the direction of towing in sinusoidal sway the struts are actuated throughout the maneuver so that a sinusoidally oscillating swaying motion is super imposed on the towing motion in all configurations force data is read from a load cell attached to each strut with the live side connected to the model all force and moment data reported is therefore for the loads experienced by the phoenix hull only full details on the use of pmm mechanisms for submarine maneuvering testing are available in goodman 1960 while the experiment is careful to only record force data from the loading on the phoenix hull the struts which connect the model to the hpmm mechanism necessarily alter the flow field around them and so have an indirect or interference effect on the forces experienced by the vehicle the strut interference effects have not been removed from the experimental data and so the struts must be included in the flow simulation in order to properly validate the flow model each of the struts is symmetric in profile and streamlined in shape with a chord length of 0 176 m and 26 maximum thickness giving a reynolds number based on chord length of 3 1e5 the struts are separated by 0 723 m or 0 42 l and are attached to the phoenix geometry at the parallel mid body the exact strut profile and attachment point are not reported azarsina 2009 the strut profile has been approximated by a naca 0026 airfoil the struts have been positioned so that the quarter chord is evenly spaced about the reported measurement centre of the hull which is located 0 736 m from the nose or λ l 0 427 where λ is the distance measured from the nose the experimental apparatus maintained a small gap between the strut and the hull surface through which instrumentation could be installed however for reasons of computational economy the struts are attached directly to the hull in the simulation in the experimental testing neither the support struts nor the hull used boundary layer trips to instigate transition no attempt has been made to model transition in the simulations the hull centre of buoyancy is located at 0 815 m from the nose or λ l 0 473 all moments are taken about the centre of buoyancy the flow domain is rectangular with the submarine hull placed approximately two body lengths downstream of the inlet ten body lengths upstream of the outlet thirty diameters to the sides 4 37 diameters to the bottom and 5 37 diameters to the top a schematic of the domain is shown in fig 2 the top and bottom boundaries coincide with the calm water line and tank bottom respectively while the side inlet and outlet boundaries are truncations of the experimental domain the simulation domain can then be viewed as a sub domain of the larger experimental domain which moves with the body and is chosen so as to minimize the domain size for computational economy reasons and to avoid a relative motion problem with the tank side walls the no slip boundary condition is applied at the hull and the support struts a high reynolds number wall treatment is used on the support strut ie a wall function while a low reynolds number wall treatment is applied on the hull a symmetry condition is applied at the top and bottom surface labeled as 1 in fig 2 a farfield condition is applied at the inlet and sides labels 2 and 3 which switches operation between a specified velocity inlet and a zero gradient pressure outlet depending on the instantaneous mesh motion at the boundary face a zero gradient pressure outlet is applied at the outlet boundary indicated by label 4 while the hull and strut geometry are symmetrical about a vertical plane sway motion will result in an asymmetrical flow field and hence no symmetry is used on the model three meshes of both the strut supported geometry and an unsupported hull geometry were generated for the purpose of a mesh dependency study all meshes are block structured and use hexahedral cells where possible the meshes for the strut supported and unsupported hull geometries are identical with the same global block topologies and surface resolution details on the coarse medium and fine resolution meshes and time steps are provided in table 1 including the non dimensionalized time step based on both body length l and the strut chord c fig 3 displays longitudinal and lateral cross sections from the medium resolution mesh near the hull surface while fig 4 shows a side on view for reference the medium resolution mesh uses 335 nodes along the hull longitudinally and 241 nodes circumferentially for an average surface resolution of 0 13 c m 2 unless otherwise specified all results reported in this text refer to the medium mesh case 4 maneuvering kinematics simulations were conducted of both steady and unsteady maneuvers steady translation maneuvers represent the quasi steady equivalent of the instantaneous motion during dynamic maneuvers in pure sway maneuvers the objective is to generate an unsteady motion which contains no rotation the model is towed down the tank with a constant forward velocity while the longitudinal axis of the model is kept constantly aligned with the tank walls the model is oscillated side to side with a sinusoidal sway velocity and hence develops a sinusoidally oscillating incidence angle at the same frequency since the model orientation is maintained along the tank axis and no rotation develops the local angle of incidence along the hull is thus constant and equal to the nominal angle of incidence at the model centre of buoyancy the support struts maintain their orientation with the hull and do not align with the flow resulting in the same nominal incidence angle note however that the amplification of the flow by the circular cross section of the hull will result in higher incidence angles on the strut in the vicinity of the junction with the hull the equivalent quasi steady maneuver in this case is then a series of steady translations at the instantaneous angle of incidence the model forward velocity was held constant at u 2 m s the experiment varied the amplitude of the sway displacement from the centreline y 0 and the frequency of the sway oscillation ω so that the nominal amplitude of the sway velocity for all dynamic sway cases was approximately constant at v 0 y 0 ω 0 55 m s this is equivalent to an angle of incidence oscillation amplitude of β 0 16 while a number of different frequencies were studied in the experiment the simulations focused only on the extreme fast and slow frequencies for this work the sway frequency is parameterized by the reduced frequency k which is here defined as 1 k f l 2 u where f is the temporal frequency of oscillation f ω 2 π the fast and slow frequencies simulated by the cfd model then correspond to reduced frequencies of k 0 03 and k 0 12 respectively these choices highlight the differences between fully unsteady and quasi steady maneuvers a full list of the kinematic parameters for each case is given in table 2 note that the sway velocity amplitude in the rapid sway differs slightly from the nominal target of 0 55 m s this is believed to be due to the accuracy of the sway controller in the experimental setup and has been replicated in the simulations for the sake of comparison it is not believed that this difference is large enough to significantly affect the comparison between the rapid and slow sway maneuvers in terms of the effect of k 5 decomposition of unsteady hydrodynamic forces in steady flow the physical origin of the hydrodynamic forces and moments is relatively clear friction along the hull generates shearing forces while the differences in pressure along the body surface generate pressure forces together these generate the six components of the hydrodynamic forces and moments which are determined uniquely by the orientation of the body in a given flow corresponding to the forces and moments the boundary layer and wake behind the vehicle will have a unique vorticity distribution dependent on the body orientation in unsteady flows the rate of change of body orientation also plays a role and different components of the hydrodynamic force can be identified based on their response to this rate of change this section aims only to provide a brief overview of unsteady hydrodynamic forces and a method of their decomposition the reduced frequency can be interpreted as the ratio of the time required for flow to traverse the body length and the time required to complete a cycle of oscillatory motion low k then corresponds to motions which are slow with respect to convection so that a fluid parcel traversing the body does not perceive significant changes in the body orientation during its transit and vice versa the maneuvers investigated here are chosen such that for a given reduced frequency the sway velocity amplitude is constant at v 0 0 55 and the free stream speed can be taken to be constant at u 0 2 08 m s as a result the reynolds number free stream dynamic pressure and range of incidence angles are also constant for all maneuvers this enables maneuvers of differing k to be compared in terms of their instantaneous incidence angle and a meaningful measure of the unsteady effects can be observed as k increases in classical hydrodynamics unsteady effects arise from two different physical mechanisms the first is due to the inertia of the surrounding fluid any body that is accelerated must in turn accelerate some portion of the fluid surrounding it the inertia of the fluid will resist this acceleration and that resistance is felt by the body as an additional force which is proportional to the acceleration of the body this force is referred to as the added mass force since it acts analogously to a virtual increase in the mass of the body added mass forces will act on the body primarily through the pressure field and are often calculated from potential flow theory they are distributed along the body according to the geometry of the body surface and in an incompressible flow react instantaneously to body acceleration the added mass forces in this work are estimated using predictions of the added mass coefficients generated by the aircraft 3d panel method apame code apame is an open source potential flow tool which uses standard methods for solving potential flow problems as outlined by the apame documentation filkovic 2018 the use of apame for generating the added mass coefficients of submarine geometries has been previously validated by marshall 2017 the phoenix geometry is unappended and axisymmetric the maneuvers of interest have no rotation and so the only added mass coefficients of significance are the axial and lateral coefficients a panel density of thirty thousand panels was found to give a sufficiently converged result of x u 6 91 e 4 and y v 1 67 e 2 the coefficients are here non dimensionalized by 1 2 ρ l 3 in addition to the added mass unsteady flows will also possess additional forces due to the dynamic nature of the vehicles wake as the vehicle changes orientation vorticity is shed into the wake in response to the changes in incidence this unsteady wake vorticity modifies the flow field from what it would be in the equivalent steady case and thus provides a memory effect due to the wake s time history through the biot savart law it is known that any modification of the wake vorticity must modify the velocity field and hence the pressure field and the forces and moments on the vehicle and so shed vorticity will provide additional unsteady forces the effect of a parcel of shed vorticity on the hydrodynamic force will diminish as the parcel is swept downstream the rate at which vorticity is shed into the wake depends on the rate of oscillation of the body while the rate at which it is swept downstream is characterized by the vehicles velocity and so the unsteady force due to shed vorticity is taken to be a function of k throughout this work reference is made to circulatory forces and to circulatory effects which alter the flowfield these phrases are meant to include all those forces and effects due to the distribution of vorticity about the body and in the wake they include both quasi steady viscous forces and the flow history effects due to the dynamic wake structure these circulatory forces may contain components in phase with either the velocity or acceleration the decomposition of the hydrodynamic forces into added mass and circulatory components is unfortunately not straight forward classically added mass forces act in proportion to acceleration while circulatory forces are proportional to both ω and the vehicles velocity and so are sometimes described as a frequency dependent damping factor for the oscillatory motions chosen however the acceleration is also a function of ω and so it is not possible to directly separate a function of ω from one of v the procedure taken in the validation is to separate the forces based on a phase decomposition of the force signal with forces acting in phase with acceleration attributed to added mass and inertia and those acting in phase with velocity attributed to circulatory effects this is in keeping with the experimental database developed by azarsina 2009 as well as the traditional procedures of experimental hydrodynamics goodman 1960 and so will also allow direct comparison of the unsteady force components between the simulation results and the experimentally determined values it should be noted however that this procedure is somewhat arbitrary as it is not guaranteed that all components in phase with acceleration are physically due to added mass and all components in phase with velocity are circulatory this issue is discussed in detail by sarpkaya 2000 for the unsupported cases the forces will instead be decomposed into those predicted by the inviscid added mass coefficients presented above and an unsteady residual force which is taken to contain all of the flow history and vorticity information this decomposition mirrors the approach taken in most submarine dynamics models by its use of the inviscid added mass coefficients and so the deviation of the residual force from the equivalent steady forces can then be taken to be a measure of the error due to the quasi steady assumption 6 simulation results and discussion simulations have been completed for four different configurations of the phoenix experiment the cfd model was first validated by comparing the results of simulations of the experimental configuration including the pmm support struts to the experimentally determine values for the forces and moments this is done for both steady translation in section 6 1 and dynamic sway in section 6 2 in order to establish the accuracy of the model for conditions ranging from steady flow through quasi steady and truly unsteady flow conditions while these simulations are necessary in order to build confidence in the cfd model the ultimate goal of the research project is to examine the unsteady flow along bare submarine hulls for which experimental data is not available for this reason both the static and dynamic tests are repeated with the pmm struts removed the data from these simulations is analyzed to highlight the effect of unsteady flow conditions on the hydrodynamics and to expose the deficiency of the quasi static assumption for this flow in sections 6 3 and 6 4 while not a goal of the present research it was also considered of interest to compare the results from the strut supported and unsupported tests in order to quantify the interference caused by the hpmm support strut in the experimental configuration these results are presented in section 6 5 6 1 strut supported steady translation static simulations of the strut supported geometry were conducted at incidence angles of 0 4 8 12 and 16 in order to validate the cfd model for steady flow conditions the simulations were run with d t 0 001 seconds for 5 s starting from a uniform flow field for all cases on the coarse and medium meshes and for the fine mesh cases above 8 incidence this run time was sufficient for the force and moment data to achieve steady mean values with a standard deviation of less then one percent for the final second of simulation which was taken to be a converged result for the fine mesh cases with incidence angles less than or equal to 8 oscillations in the flow at the junction of the hull and the strut prevented the force values from converging to within this standard these oscillations are due to periodic vortex shedding from a leading edge separation on the rear strut at the junction where it meets the hull where the struts meet the hull vortices are formed which will propagate into the wake behind the strut fig 5 plots contours of vorticity in the wake behind the strut and near the junction in which the junction vortices and the interaction between the struts is clearly visible as the incidence angle decreases the rear strut operates increasingly in the wake of the forward strut resulting in complex flows on the tail of the submarine the amplitude of the force oscillation varied with the mesh and incidence angle but was less then 10 of the mean value in all cases fig 6 through 8 plot the axial force lateral force and yawing moment for the hull as a function of angle of incidence and compares these to the experimental results reported by azarsina et al 2008 the experimental trends are well produced by all results with the exception of the axial force predicted at 16 the flow at high angles is quite complex due to the interaction of the strut and the hull especially in the vicinity of the strut hull junction fig 9 a plots the skin friction lines and pressure contours from simulated results for the hull at 12 while fig 9b plots the same at 16 it is clear from the figures that the struts alter the simulated flow field in their vicinity and that the simulated flow is sensitive to changes in drift angle in this region while it is not possible to comment on the accuracy of the simulated flow field in this region without additional data it is clear that the struts introduce large uncertainties which are significantly effected by changes in the flow the goal of studies of submarine maneuvering is often to predict the set of non dimensional coefficients which describe a vehicles maneuvering performance for steady translations this is done by calculating the slope of the force curves in fig 6 through 8 as they pass through zero using fig 7 an estimate of d y d β 0 050 is calculated for the simulated result on the medium mesh while a value of d y d β 0 072 is found for the experimental data similarly using fig 8 an estimate of d n d β 0 023 is found from medium mesh simulations versus a value of d n d β 0 021 from experimental data this corresponds to a discrepancies of 30 8 laterally and 9 8 in yaw as with the force data themselves these estimates are subject to significant uncertainties as a result of the strut issues related to the prediction of the force coefficients and the effect of the strut will be explored further in section 6 5 the experiment only reports the standard deviation for the axial force signal during steady straight ahead flow which is plotted in fig 6 this value was reported by azarsina in azarsina 2009 and is calculated by taking the standard deviation of the measured axial force signal during a single experimental run of the phoenix geometry at zero degree incidence while the value is quite high in comparison to the reported force note that the axial force at zero degrees drift represents a low loading state compared to for example the lateral force at high drift further at any significant angle of drift it is expected that the lateral force will be significantly higher than the axial force for a body of this type as a result axial forces at low drift are expected to have higher relative uncertainty in comparison to lateral forces at high drift this is a known issue with experimental testing across large ranges of drift angle and can be seen in other similar results such as those of watt et al 1993 simulated values of the axial force are well within this range of deviation for the zero degree drift condition the simulations predict a higher yawing moment than the experiment at all angles of incidence while the lateral force is predicted higher than the experiment at high angles but slightly lower than the experiment at low angles this corresponds to an average discrepancy between experimental and simulated values of 21 axially 14 laterally and 22 in yaw without additional information on the experimental error it is difficult to comment on the implications of these discrepancies between the simulated and experimental results as the simulated results are within the experimental uncertainty for the case for which it is reported if that uncertainty is taken to be representative of the experiment then the axial force predictions are within this range at all incidences and the lateral force results are within it for angles below 12 it is known from previous work on submarine hulls in translation jeans et al 2009 that turbulent anisotropy is significant within the wake and that reynold s stress turbulence models give improved force predictions compared to two equation models such as the wilcox model it is possible then that better agreement between the experimental results and the simulation results could be obtained from a reynold s stress model in addition it is known that boundary layer transition can have a significant impact on hydrodynamic forces no attempt at modeling transition has been made in this work however it is possible that the results could be improved by implementing a transition model based on the significance of the flow around the junction of the struts and the hull it is also likely that the simulation results are sensitive to the assumptions made regarding the strut profile and positioning mesh refinement was seen to lower the simulated yawing moment results for all angles while the lateral force prediction is either lowered or held constant axial force predictions increased with mesh refinement at the intermediate angles of 8 and 12 but decreased at 4 and 16 these different trends with mesh refinement are thought to be due to the complexity of the flow at the junction of the struts and the hull it is believed that the coarse mesh diffuses the wake of the upstream strut and works to suppress some of the complex flow in the rear strut junction as a result resulting in a net increase in the lateral pressure force at the tail at low angles similarly the transition of the separation on the rear strut junction from a leading edge bubble type to a fully stalled type is suppressed by the coarse mesh these results demonstrate significant variation in the effects of mesh refinement at different incident angles and result in a very noisy signal from which to estimate grid dependent error using the procedure of celik et al 2008 and the lateral force and yawing moment predictions at 8 the fine mesh grid convergence index celik et al 2008 was estimated at 4 7 and 1 2 respectively indicating good convergence towards a grid independent solution at these conditions similarly at these conditions the relative error between the medium and fine meshes was 3 3 for both lateral force and yawing moment the 8 case is the mean angle of attack studied in this work and so was taken as the best representation of the kinematic range of the maneuvers based on these results it was concluded that the medium mesh case gives an appropriate balance of accuracy and computational economy the hydrodynamics are significantly effected by the flow around the strut junctions which is extremely sensitive to the local mesh and turbulence model as well as the assumptions made regarding the strut geometry the goal of this study however is to demonstrate reasonable confidence in the cfd model for the purposes of simulating unsupported hulls which do not feature the complications of the flow in the strut hull junctions for this reason further improvement of the computational model for the strut supported case was not pursued 6 2 strut supported dynamic sway dynamic sway simulations of the strut supported geometry were conducted using the kinematics presented in table 2 using the mesh and time step parameters given in table 1 in order to validate the cfd model for quasi steady and unsteady flow conditions the experiment began recording as the model passed the centreline of the tank corresponding to maximum sway velocity and zero sway acceleration the dynamic simulations start with a brief relaxation time during which the kinematics are held at the initial condition to remove any non physical transient due to the startup procedure the time signal is shifted accordingly ie t 0 during the relaxation period while t 0 corresponds to the beginning of sway motion at the tank centreline azarsina s experiments report the results of a cosine fit to the measured lateral force and yawing moment the fit is reported in terms of the amplitude of the fitting cosine y 0 and n 0 and the phase angle ϕ y and ϕ n the inertia of the model mass m 49 2 kg when flooded was included in the reported forces azarsina 2009 and therefore must be added to the cfd solution in his work azarsina defines a positive damping force as one which opposes the sway velocity but a positive apparent inertial force as one which is directed with the acceleration azarsina 2009 the fluid force from cfd will contain inertial components which are positive when opposed to the acceleration and damping components which are positive when opposed to the velocity if y 0 c f d and ϕ y c f d are the magnitude and phase angle of the force from cfd then the inertial and damping components are given by 2 y i y 0 c f d sin ϕ y c f d sin ω t 3 y d y 0 c f d cos ϕ y c f d cos ω t in order to be consistent with the experiment the sign of the inertial component must be reversed and then the components must be summed along with the inertia of the flooded model the experimental force is then given by 4 y e x p m v y i y d all results reported in this section are given in terms of the experimental lateral force from equation 4 no such correction is required for the axial force or yawing moment since there is no inertial effect on these quantities the baseline case was taken to be the rapid k 0 12 sway with the medium mesh and timestep which was simulated for 18 s or 5 cycles after 5 cycles of the rapid sway the standard deviation of the force amplitude was 0 25 while the standard deviation of the force phase angle was 0 32 both the amplitude and the phase of the first cycle deviate by 1 from the mean value and so it was concluded that only a single cycle was required to converge the amplitude and phase statistics these results were typical of all force and moment components all subsequent simulations completed 2 5 cycles corresponding to approximately 9 s for the rapid sway and 36 s for the slow way in order to balance computational economy and confidence in the simulated data as well as to ensure no influence due to the startup transient the results of the dynamic sway simulations are reported in table 3 for the amplitude and phase of the fitting cosines and in table 5 for the apparent mass and damping factor also included in both tables are the results of a refinement study on the rapid sway case the apparent mass and damping factor are found by dividing the magnitude of the force component by the corresponding motion component ie m a p p a r e n t y i m v v and b y d v the apparent mass in table 4 represents the combination of the flooded vehicle mass and the inertia of the surrounding fluid and thus will always be greater than the mass of the vehicle the experimental and simulated phase angles have good agreement with the relative error between simulated and experimental results 5 for all cases the amplitude of the simulated lateral force agrees well with the experiment at high k where the relative error is between 14 and 9 5 and within the range of error from the static simulations the simulation predicts a much greater force amplitude at low k however with a relative error of 38 which is much higher then the static error the simulated yawing moment amplitude is higher than the experiment for all cases with an average relative error of approximately 44 the static simulations similarly predicted a higher yawing moment in all cases although with a lower relative value based on the results for the apparent mass and damping factor predictions in table 4 it appears that the discrepancy between simulated and experimental values is more pronounced in the damping components improved mesh resolution reduces the damping factor while having little effect on the apparent mass prediction it is important to note however that a large percentage of the apparent mass is due to the physical mass of the system and so errors in the force amplitude and phase angle are expected to be less significant in the apparent mass prediction with the close agreement of the phase angles in table 3 it is likely that much of the over prediction of the damping factor is driven by the over prediction of the force amplitude as in the case of the force amplitude at high k this result is in keeping with the error of the static experiments at low k it is possible that additional error has been introduced beyond that present in the static simulations at low k there is an additional discrepancy in the apparent mass prediction both the experiment and the simulations predict a reduction in the inertial force as the acceleration goes to zero in keeping with theory the inertial force does not decrease in proportion to the acceleration however leading to an increase in the predicted apparent mass potential flow theory would predict that the apparent mass is constant for all accelerating motion and the experiment did find that the apparent mass tended to a constant value as k increased azarsina 2009 it is possible then that the increase of apparent mass as k approaches zero is due to a viscous effect which is in phase with acceleration becoming more pronounced for both the experiment and the simulations the behaviour of the apparent mass as k 0 is ill defined and the evaluation of the apparent mass becomes more difficult due to the decreasing significance of the acceleration and so it is expected that the accuracy of apparent mass prediction is worse at low k as the majority of the interest is in higher values of k where unsteady effects are expected to be significant this issue has not been investigated further 6 3 unsupported dynamic sway with the physical veracity of the cfd model established by the comparison of the strut supported simulations with experiment the steady and dynamic maneuvering simulations were repeated using the unsupported geometry in order to demonstrate the significant effect of flow history and the weakness of the quasi steady assumption no experimental data is available for the validation of the unsupported geometry and so it is only possible to infer the accuracy of the cfd model by comparison with the strut supported case and with computational results from other geometries the grid dependency of the unsupported geometry simulations was examined using the cases of steady translation at 16 incidence and dynamic sway at k 0 12 the predicted values at all resolutions are shown in table 5 for the lateral force amplitude and for the dynamic case the phase angle these cases demonstrated excellent grid convergence with an approximately 1 5 variation during steady translation and 1 variation in dynamic sway the medium resolution case is therefore taken to be sufficiently resolved and all further results are based on the medium resolution parameters the forces and moments for both steady and dynamic maneuvers are plotted in fig 10 through 12 as a function of incidence angle note that these forces and moments are the traditional hydrodynamic forces as would be calculated from integration of the pressure and shear stress on the hull they do not include the inertia of the flooded model and have not been corrected using equation 4 these plots omit the initial relaxation period ie no data is plotted for t 0 the lateral force and yawing moment hysteresis loops are traversed in the clockwise direction starting from the left the axial force similarly starts in the left and moves initially to the right for clarity the direction of traverse has been indicated by colour coded arrows in the relevant figures and the initial position is indicated with a triangular marker from the data in fig 10 through 12 there is a clear hysteresis effect for both the forces and moment which varies in effect with increasing k in these plots zero incidence corresponds to the condition of zero sway velocity and hence maximum sway acceleration and vice versa for high incidence the axial velocity is held constant through the maneuver so there is no axial added mass force and the hysteresis of the axial force must then be entirely due to unsteady circulatory effects the mean axial force during the maneuver is seen to first decrease and then increase with increasing k and there is no clear collapse towards the quasi steady limit at low k the two inner loops at low angles contain the bulk of the hysteresis while at high k the outer loops at high angles are larger in all cases the deviation from the quasi steady line is relatively small in comparison with the deviation of the lateral force the lateral force must contain forces due to both added mass and circulatory effects it is likely that much of the lateral force hysteresis at low angles is due to added mass due to the high acceleration at these instants the yawing moment displays relatively little effect of unsteady sway motion compared to the forces which is consistent with the result that the yawing moment about the centre of buoyancy would have no added mass contribution in sway suggesting minimal circulatory effect on the yaw from these results the effect of dynamic motion on the hydrodynamic forces and moments is quite significant for reduced frequencies as low as k 0 03 the lateral force and yawing moment are seen to clearly collapse towards the quasi steady limit as k is reduced the lateral force can be further analyzed by decomposition into the force from inviscid added mass predictions and an unsteady residual force r t as 5 y t y v v t r t figs 13 and 14 plot this decomposition for k 0 03 and k 0 12 respectively note that the residual force hysteresis loops are traversed in the counter clockwise direction the residual forces are directly compared in fig 15 along with the steady translation results and the predictions from the model of jeans et al 2010 for this configuration these results clearly demonstrate that there is a significant error associated with the quasi steady assumption in the model of jeans et al which grows in proportion to k the reader may also note the good agreement between the model predictions and the results of the steady translation simulations lending increased confidence to the unsupported cfd model the error of the quasi steady assumption can be estimated by subtracting the jeans et al model prediction from the unsteady residual force the result is plotted in fig 16 the error has here been normalized by the root mean square rms of the total lateral force during the maneuver to give an average again rms error of 14 at k 0 03 and 36 at k 0 12 these results clearly demonstrate a significant motion history effect on the hydrodynamic forces for realistic values of the reduced frequency during submarine maneuvering 6 4 wake topology of the unsupported hull fig 10 through 12 clearly demonstrate the significant effect that sway oscillation can have on the hydrodynamic forces felt by the vehicle any change in the forces and moments on the body must be accompanied by changes in the flow field in particular the vorticity in the wake and so it is instructive to examine the effects of dynamic motion on the flow field further insight into the effects of dynamic sway motion can then be gained by analysis of these changes on an unsupported hull flow at incidence generates cross flow velocities along the hull which feed a pair of equal and counter rotating vortices through open topology separation lines whose strength grows in proportion to the incidence angle shown in fig 17 are contours of vorticity magnitude at five stations along the hull of the vehicle and into the wake found from simulations of steady translation of the unsupported vehicle the cross flow vortices are clearly visible in the last three stations of fig 17b fig 18 plots the same vorticity contours at an instantaneous incidence angle of β 16 during dynamic sway of the unsupported hull the slow sway in fig 18a shows negligible change due to sway motion in comparison to the static case consistent with quasi steady flow at low reduced frequencies the rapid sway in fig 18b however demonstrates significant differences due to the sway motion the hull vortices are reduced in size compared to the steady case and appear to be pulled towards the centreline as opposed to the more rounded static vortices this is most obvious in the aft plane which is significantly deformed compared to the steady case the high incidence angle of the results in fig 18 corresponds with the high velocity and low acceleration portion of the sway maneuver an examination of fig 11 however shows that hysteresis is expected to be most significant at low incidence angles corresponding to low velocity and high acceleration fig 19 plots the contours of wake vorticity at an instantaneous incidence of β 4 for dynamic motion of the unsupported hull with both positive and negative acceleration for this motion positive acceleration corresponds with decreasing β and vice versa unlike the high incidence case significant differences from the static wake are clearly visible even during slow oscillations for increasing β and high k the wake in fig 19c is clearly delayed in comparison with the static case with the majority of the wake vorticity still concentrated on the windward side of the body the delay is not as obvious at low k however the wake plane vorticity is notably more circular than in the steady case for decreasing β in fig 19b and d both reduced frequencies have noticeable differences compared to the steady case at k 0 03 in fig 19b the vortex contours are slightly more pronounced than the steady case particularly at the aft station at k 0 12 in fig 19d this is much more pronounced particularly at the two rearmost stations 6 5 hydrodynamic effect of the support strut standard experimental practice holds that a vertical pmm mechanism should be used to test maneuvering performance in sway due to the significant interference of the support struts as previously mentioned a horizontal mechanism was chosen due to lack of vpmm facilities however no attempt was made to quantify the interference effect of the support struts in azarsina 2009 fig 20 through 22 compare the simulated forces and moments on the body in steady translation for the strut supported and unsupported geometries as would be expected the differences are most pronounced at high angles of incidence where the effects of flow separation and lift carry over from the struts to the body are largest the support strut can be seen to increase the axial force and yawing moment by small but significant amounts the effect of the strut on the lateral force however is extremely large more than doubling the lateral force at β 16 this has the effect of not only over predicting the forces experienced on the vehicle but would also significantly effect predictions for the maneuvering performance if control derivatives for example y v were evaluated from this data by taking the slope of the force curve through zero the strut supported case would predict y v 0 0289 while the unsupported case predicts y v 0 0083 the strut supported test would predict a lateral force dependence on sway velocity of almost 3 5 times the unsupported case these results clearly demonstrate the significant effect of strut interference on sway maneuvering testing using hpmm contours of the wake vorticity during static translation of the strut supported hull are shown in fig 23 comparing these results to those for the unsupported hull in fig 17 the effect of the struts is clearly significant at low incidence angles in fig 23a the hull vortices cannot be clearly discerned but strong cross flow vortices have been generated at the junction of the strut and the hull at high incidence angles in fig 23b the hull vortices are now visible however the upper hull vortex is merged with the forward junction vortex and has been significantly deformed in comparison with the lower hull vortex at all angles of incidence the wake vorticity has clearly been pulled towards the upper surface due to the presence of the struts both figures also demonstrate the presence of span wise vortex sheets generated by the struts these junction vortices and their effect on the hull vortices are significant departures from the unsupported case on the upper half of the hull fig 24 compares the lateral force distribution on the body at β 16 for the unsupported and strut supported cases with the position of the struts clearly marked the effect of the struts is to increase the force on the mid body in comparison with the unsupported case the presence of the increased wake vorticity reduces the pressure recovery on the lee of the vehicle from the unsupported case resulting in a significantly higher lateral pressure force on the mid body the effect of the struts on the nose and tail is seen to be comparatively minor fig 25 compares the hydrodynamic forces for the unsupported and strut supported vehicle during dynamic sway the effect of the strut on the yawing moment is again relatively minor with the unsupported hull having slightly decreased amplitude and phase with respect to the sway velocity and slightly more hysteresis effect in general in comparison the axial and lateral forces are seen to be significantly affected by the presence of the support strut the strut supported vehicle has an increased axial and lateral force amplitude and for the lateral force a large variation in the phase the hysteresis of the axial force is also more pronounced in the strut supported case these results clearly demonstrate the significant interference effect of the hpmm support struts in sway experiments 7 summary and conclusions simulations of the strut supported phoenix uuv geometry were conducted using the exn aero cfd code the strut supported geometry was first studied in steady translation at incidence angles up to 16 and a reynolds number of 3 1 million in order to validate the model for steady flows the simulated results were compared with experimental data from towing tank trials and are within the experimental uncertainty where that data is available it was demonstrated that the hpmm support struts have a significant affect on the flow around the hull and the resulting hydrodynamic forces and moments variation of mesh resolution was seen to effect the separation on the rear strut causing significant changes in the predicted force transient simulations of the strut supported submarine undergoing a dynamic pure sway maneuver were conducted at reduced frequencies of k 0 03 and k 0 12 in order to further validate the model for quasi steady and unsteady flows the phase angle and amplitude of the cosine fit lateral force and yawing moment are compared with experiment and are consistent with the accuracy of the static results the discrepancy between the experiment and simulation results for lateral force can be seen to be primarily due to relatively high damping in the simulation improved mesh resolution was seen to decrease the damping force resulting in better agreement both the experiment and the simulation predict an increase in the apparent mass of the system with decreasing reduced frequency suggesting a possible frequency dependence or viscous effect on the added mass force as with the static case it is believed that the dynamic results are sensitive to the strut geometry for both the static and dynamic cases it is expected that improved results could be obtained with turbulence models that are better able to capture the known anisotropy of the vehicles wake such as reynolds stress models or les wake vorticity contours were examined for both the strut supported and unsupported cases to further demonstrate the effects of motion history for the unsupported hull clear differences in the wake topology were visible when comparing dynamic sway and steady translation and the degree of difference was proportional to the reduced frequencies these results clearly demonstrate the significance of flow history in unsteady flows the effect of the struts on the hydrodynamic forces and moments was examined by comparison between the simulated results for the unsupported and supported geometries in both steady translation and dynamic sway it was seen that the strut has a significant effect on the lateral force prediction in both static and dynamic maneuvers examination of the wake vorticity contours in steady translation revealed that the wake is dominated by the action of the upper hull vortex which is generated by cross flow along the hull but has been distorted by vorticity generated at the junction of the forward strut and the hull the action of this vortex accounts for the increased force and hysteresis on the mid body of the vehicle the simulated hydrodynamic forces and moments of the unsupported geometry were examined as a function of incidence angle in order to demonstrate the significant effect of flow history and the weakness of the quasi steady assumption the forces and moments clearly demonstrated hysteresis in the lateral force and yawing moment predictions the results collapse towards the quasi steady limit of static translation as k is reduced with the value of that limit likely to be near k 0 03 for the lateral force the yawing moment appeared to be approximately quasi steady up to k 0 12 the highest reduced frequency examined the lateral force hysteresis was decomposed into an inviscid added mass contribution and an unsteady residual which contained all circulatory effects it was demonstrated that a quasi steady analysis using only the steady translation model of jeans et al and the inviscid added mass coefficients contained significant error due to

water waves energy in recent years polymer based piezoelectric paints have been investigated by a few researchers as a potential substitute for piezoelectric ceramics in certain sensing applications egusa and iwasawa 1996 white et al 2004 li et al li and zhang 2018 examined the feasibility of using a piezoelectric paint as an in plane strain wave based acoustic emission sensor with applicability

et al kang and lee 2014 presented a fabrication method for a piezoelectric paint sensor and its application to the impact and vibration monitoring of a beam structure they showed that an impact force signal over 10 n can be captured using the piezo paint however to the best knowledge of authors no research works proposed a wave energy harvester coating with piezoelectric paints in our previous studies e g mutsuda et al 2017a we developed a highly flexible piezoelectric device fped to harvest flow induced vibration energy by converting ambient kinetic energy such as wind current or ocean energy into electrical power the fped typically uses piezoelectric layers e g polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf and elastomer materials e g rubber and silicon to achieve high electrical performance and efficiency to withstand the extreme bending and weathering caused by waves and currents in real sea states a flexible device coated with a piezoelectric paint was developed mutsuda et al 2017b a theoretical model was also developed to predict electro fluid structure interactions and to evaluate the mechanical and electrical performance of the painted fped moreover a preliminary field test in 2016 was conducted to examine the electrical power of the painted fped installed on a fish aggregating device fad in real sea states however the painted fped was not optimised for wave conditions to obtain high electrical power and the influence of the laminated structure of the painted fped its substrate and its aspect ratio were not found in detail the purpose of this study is to reveal the mechanical deformation and electrical performance of a painted fped excited by wave conditions we also clarify the influence of key parameters such as the submerged depth wave steepness aspect ratio actuator pattern unimorph and bimorph and thickness of the painted piezo material and elastomer on the output voltage generated by the painted fped in wave conditions with various wave heights and periods furthermore a theoretical model based on a mode coupling technique is developed and applied to the painted fped in wave conditions 2 overview of the painted fped in this study the fped from the previous work mutsuda et al 2017a was improved to overcome some weak points in its practical use the painted fped proposed in this study had several improved mechanical and electrical performance features compared with other harvesters this section provides an overview of the painted fped proposed in this paper in our previous works mutsuda et al 2017a tanaka et al 2012 tanaka et al 2014 tanaka et al 2016 an energy harvester was developed to generate electrical power from ambient energy sources such as wave tidal current wind and mechanical vibration it was called a fped the device had a laminated structure consisting of a piezo film e g pvdf elastic material and adhesive the device could be easily deformed by an external force such as wind wave current or vibration and then generate electrical power from an ambient non utilised energy source however the fped may have had a fatal problem in practical application the surface between the piezo film and elastic material could sometimes be separated by external forces thus a fatigue fracture could occur to substantially address the problem the interface between them was thinly coated with a piezoelectric paint using a spray gun co et al japan co et al 2013 the thickness of the piezoelectric layer was generally about 50 100 μm to obtain high electrical performance as shown in fig 1 this was firstly proposed in the previous study mutsuda et al 2017b the painted fped was attached to the fad as an ocean energy harvester to generate electrical power from waves in a field test the fad combined with artificial ocean infrastructures forms an environment friendly ecosystem leading fishes to safety and feeding areas the fad was floated near the water surface and moored by a chain and fibre rope to a caisson on the sea bottom it was located 20 km offshore in water with a depth of 1000 m near the okinawa islands japan the field test revealed that the painted fped generated electrical power and had high durability in the bending and weathering caused by waves and current in a real sea state fig 2 shows the typical laminated structure of a painted fped whose size was l 1 length b 1 width t 1 thickness of the painted piezo material in this study the piezoelectric paint was coated onto the lower electrode in an area of l 2 length b 2 width which was made of polyphenylene sulphide pps with copper painting the upper and lower electrodes and coaxial cables were also coated with thin silicone for waterproof protection an elastic material with thickness t e was applied to the lower electrode the distance δ between the piezoelectric paint layer and centreline of the device is one of the key parameters for generating electrical power therefore a suitable distance δ must be selected considering both the external forces and rigidity of the device mutsuda et al 2017a in this study both the unimorph and bimorph types of painted fped were produced and compared for electrical power as shown in fig 3 3 overview of theoretical model for the painted fped in our previous study a theoretical model was proposed by patel et al patel et al 2014 to estimate the electrical performance and mechanical behaviours of a fped however the present model with some improvements was applied to the prediction of the electrical power generated by the painted fped in this study fig 4 shows an illustration of the theoretical model for the painted fped which is one example of a bimorph type cantilever supported by a jig on one side the other side is deformed by an external force the painted piezoelectric materials were coated from x 1 to x 3 on both sides of the pps substrate where x 2 is the length of the painted piezo material and x 1 and x 3 are the distances from the both ends of the painted fped based on knowledge from the experimental results as shown in section 4 it can be assumed that the painted fped was excited through a typical harmonic motion in the first deformation mode the governing equation of transverse vibration can be represented as 1 2 m x t x 2 m x 2 w x t t 2 f e where m x t is the internal moment of the painted fped at the cross section m x is the mass per unit length f e is an external force such as a wave or current and w x t is the transverse displacement represented by 2 w x t x r e l x t w b x t where w r e l x t is the displacement of the painted fped including the displacement of the base w b x t which is forced with an amplitude and a frequency the internal moment can be represented by 3 m x t e i x 2 w r e l x t x 2 ε v x t where e i x is the flexural rigidity v x t is the output voltage generated by the painted fped and is the permittivity at constant strain in this paper the external force f e can be estimated by the fundamental water wave theory waves in fluids and cambridg 1978 substituting eq 3 into eq 1 the following equation can be obtained 4 x 2 e i x 2 w r e l x t x 2 ε v x t m x 2 x r e l x t t 2 f e the mechanical behaviour of the painted fped is calculated by eq 4 thus the modal analysis can be typically applied to eq 4 the displacement of the painted fped w r e l x t can be represented as 5 w r e l x t q 1 w q x η q t where q is the mode number w q x is the normalised eigenvectors and η p is the time dependent generalised coordinates the modal response of the painted fped including modal damping can be represented by 6 η q 2 γ q w q η q t w q 2 η q t ε v t w q x 1 x 2 w q x 1 0 l f e x w q x d x where γ is the ratio of the modal damping and l is the length of the painted fped here the first mode represented by q 1 was assumed only in this study the differential equation of the output voltage generated by the painted fped can be represented by 7 c p v t t v t r l o a d q 1 e p d 31 t p c b p w q x x x 1 x 1 x 2 η q t where c p is the piezoelectric internal capacitance r l o a d is the load resistance e p is the young s modulus of the piezoelectric material d 31 is the piezoelectric material constant in the axial direction dominantly in the transverse direction t p c is the distance between the neutral axis and centre of the piezoelectric material and b p is the width of the piezoelectric layer which is assumed to be constant along the beam length both the mechanical equation eq 4 and the electrical equation eq 7 can be coupled which means electromechanical coupling modes to consider the interaction between the deformation of the painted fped and its electrical performance 4 vibration test of the painted fped in a water tank before investigating the electrical performance of the painted fped in wave conditions vibration tests were performed to reveal the mechanical deformation and electrical performance forced by a simple vibration controlled for amplitude and frequency in addition the repeatability and fatigue of the painted fped were examined 4 1 experimental setup to clarify the characteristics of the output voltage generated by the painted fped in response to a periodic external force a vibration test of the painted fped was conducted in a water tank it was a cantilever type of unimorph and the experimental setup is shown in fig 5 the water tank was 10 m length 0 6 m height 0 25 m width the initial water depth was set at 0 45 m to avoid disturbance from the water surface and tank walls the water tank has an absorbing beach in the downstream side to reduce wave amplitude and relevant forces and to avoid generating resonant waves the painted fped was horizontally supported at the bottom end of the linear slider and the vertical guide rail was controlled with a vibrated amplitude and period the output voltage from the painted pfed was measured using a laptop computer and a d convertor in open circuit with a 1 m ω resistor a high speed video camera was located beside the water tank to record the deformation of the painted fped and its deformation rate was analysed by particle tracking velocimetry ptv the experimental conditions in the vibration test are shown in table 1 considering the experimental conditions of the wave forcing test in section 5 a scale model was based on froude s law for real sea states the vibrated amplitude was set to a v 10 50 mm and the vibrated period was set to t v 0 5 2 0 s the specifications of the unimorph type of painted fped are shown in table 2 its dimensions were l 500 mm length and b 10 mm width with an aspect ratio ar 1 5 the thickness of the elastomer t e was exchanged from 10 to 20 mm including the painted piezo material with a thickness of 50 100 μm in order to investigate influence of stiffness on the output voltage and distance δ as defined in section 2 silicone with a young s modulus of 3 mpa and density of 2200 kg m3 was employed as the elastomer for fped a fped b and fped c and an acrylic with a young s modulus of 3140 mpa and density of 1200 kg m3 was used for fped d the flexural rigidity e i was set to 0 0962 2 475 n m2 4 2 results and discussion to investigate the mechanical performance of the painted fped in a deformation mode and to confirm its responsiveness to an external force with vibration and without electrical noise images of the deformation of the painted fped in water were captured by a high speed camera see fig 6 the time histories of the painted fped s tip deformation and velocity are shown in fig 7 the painted fped in water was deformed smoothly by the vertical vibration and the tendency of the deformation and velocity can be regarded as the first mode deformation fig 8 shows the time histories of the output voltage generated by each painted fped which were vibrated with an amplitude a v 30 mm and period t v 0 5 s it can be seen that the first mode deformation was clearly generated in all of the painted fpeds and there was no electrical or deformable noise in the output voltage the responsiveness of the painted fped in the water was also higher in sensitivity to the repeated external force compared with the previous devices mutsuda et al 2017a mutsuda et al 2017b the results indicated that the painted fped could generate electrical power in real sea states including irregular seas with varying wave heights and periods to examine relationships between the displacement of the painted fped and its output voltage and to clarify the characteristics of its electrical performance and deformation fig 9 plots the output voltage against the vibrated amplitude the output voltage was averaged by the maximum value per period in the time histories as shown in fig 8 it was found that the output voltage increased with increasing vibrated amplitude for all of the painted fpeds the painted fpeds with weak stiffness such as fped a and fped b demonstrated high performance with longer vibration periods whereas fped d with strong stiffness generated a higher output voltage with the vibration period t 0 5 s in addition fped c had the same tendency with the vibration period t 1 0 s the tip deformation rate of the painted fped is shown in fig 10 the deformation rate of the painted fped at the tip end was obtained from analysis of the images captured by the high speed video camera the output voltage increased rapidly with deformation rate especially fped d which had relatively strong stiffness these results indicated that the stiffness of the painted fped should be appropriately designed for the wave conditions including wave height and period to induce high electrical power generation and high efficiency 5 wave forcing test acting on the painted fped in a towing tank 5 1 experimental setup to examine the characteristics of the output voltage generated by a painted fped caused by waves the wave forcing test was conducted in a towing tank having dimensions of 100 m length 8 m width 3 5 m depth as shown in fig 11 the towing tank has an absorbing beach in the downstream side to reduce wave amplitude and relevant forces and to avoid generating resonant waves the painted fped was vertically and strongly supported by fixed aluminum frames located on the towing train to avoid frame vibrations whose natural frequency is about f n 30 hz that is quite different from the natural frequency of the painted fped less than f n 10 hz and six fpeds were simultaneously set at a certain increment to avoid fluid interactions between them the alignment and phase material were also carefully checked without any vibration noise before conducting the experiment the painted fpeds were set at a depth d l below the still water depth where l is the length of the device the painted fpeds were forced by a regular wave with a wave height and period controlled by a plunger type wave maker the incident wave height and current velocity were measured by a wave gauge and a current metre located on the upstream side of the tank respectively as the initial external force condition the output voltage generated by the painted fped was measured using a data logger a d convertor and a laptop computer the internal resistance of the data logger in open circuit was set at 1 m ω to calculate the electrical power using ohm s law a video camera was employed to record the deformation of the painted fped forced by waves the incident wave conditions are shown in table 3 the regular wave height was set to 50 150 mm and the wave period was 0 8 1 5 s which was decided considering real sea states and the model scale the specifications of the painted fpeds are shown in table 4 their dimensions were l 1 420 mm length b 1 80 170 mm width the thickness t e of the elastomer was set to 5 6 8 and 10 mm which was nitrile rubber with a density of 1600 kg m3 and a young s modulus of 4 17 mpa in order to examine the influence of stiffness on the output voltage and the aspect ratio ar b 2 l 2 1 5 1 3 and 1 2 the painted piezo material was coated onto an area of l 2 300 mm length b 2 60 150 mm width t 1 50 100 μm thickness 5 2 results and discussion to confirm the output voltage without any electrical disturbance and to investigate the electrical performance in the wave conditions shown in table 3 fig 12 shows the time histories of the output voltage generated by the painted fped acted upon by a wave with height h 0 15 m and period t 1 2 s the output voltages were clearly and periodically generated by the wave force this was mostly recognised as the first mode deformation although there was a small fluctuation of high frequency caused by small vortices between the painted fpeds fig 13 shows the influence of the submerged depth d l of the painted fped on the output voltage to the wave steepness h λ where h is the wave height and λ is the wavelength the output voltage increased with increasing wave steepness in all cases in the case of d l 0 5 where the painted fped was submerged by a half length of the painted fped the output voltage was higher compared with that of d l 1 0 especially for fped3 this is because the wave force acted on the bottom end of the painted fped below the water surface as a concentrated load not as a distributed load on the whole area of the painted fped consequently the moment caused by the wave force was also larger the influence of the wave height on the output voltage of each painted pfed is shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the output voltage increased with increasing wave height and the best performance was found with fped3 in all cases this indicated that the stiffness of fped3 was appropriately selected for the wave conditions fig 15 shows a comparison of the output voltages versus the aspect ratios ar of the painted fpeds the output voltages increased with the wave steepness thus the aspect ratio ar 1 2 was suitable for high performance in these wave conditions a comparison between the output voltages of the unimorph and bimorph types is shown in fig 16 the output voltage per unit area of the bimorph type of painted fped was larger than that of the unimorph it also increased with wave steepness to generate high voltage the thickness of the elastomer should be relatively thin although the distance between the piezoelectric paint layer and centreline of the painted fped was larger in the case of t e 10 mm that is because the deformation of the painted fped was smoothly and easily excited by the wave force fig 17 shows the influence of the thickness t 1 of the painted piezo material on the output voltage in the case in with an aspect ratio ar 1 2 the output voltage per unit area with t 1 50 μm was higher when the wave steepness increased especially with the thin elastomer t e 5 mm this indicated that the stiffness with t 1 50 μm was deformable compared with that for t 1 100 μm therefore the stiffness related to t 1 and t e should be suitably designed to excite the first mode deformation of the painted fped considering the wave conditions 6 estimation of energy harvesting in real ocean field to validate the output voltage estimated by the proposed theoretical model against the experiment results comparisons of the thickness t 1 of the painted piezo electric material the actuator pattern unimorph and bimorph and the thickness t e of the elastomer are shown in fig 18 the fped3 with ar 1 2 was the focus of these comparisons because its maximal output voltage was excited mostly in the wave conditions mentioned in section 5 the results indicated that the theoretical results were in overall agreement with the experimental results under several structural and all wave conditions therefore the theoretical model could estimate the output voltage and electrical power induced by wave conditions it could also be a useful design tool for the painted fped in real sea states fig 19 shows the influence of the wave height and period on the output voltage in conditions with a wave height h 1 0 4 0 m and t 5 12 s which usually occurs in real sea states indicating an operating condition for the painted fped3 the external force f e was estimated by the fundamental water wave theory waves in fluids and cambridg 1978 and the internal resistance of the data logger in open circuit was set at 1 m ω to calculate the electrical power using ohm s law as the same experimental condition it can be seen that the output voltage was gradually increasing with the wave height and period especially in long and high wave conditions and a saturation condition was not found in these conditions in actual sea states a certain limitation for operating the painted fped should be set to realise high performance in the first deformation mode without disturbance the wave frequency in real sea states could be different from the natural frequency of the painted fped therefore wave forces with a wave period can excite the painted fped as a trigger for generating the output voltage therefore a free vibration test was also conducted to obtain the natural frequency of the painted fped3 and the coefficient of attenuation as shown in table 5 fig 20 shows one example of the time history of the output voltage caused by wave trains with a wave height h 4 m and wave period t 5 s the amplitude of the output voltage decreased gradually with the natural frequency at each application of the force and with the time interval of the wave period this result means that the output voltage of the painted fped was repeatedly generated by wave force as a trigger with the wave period the output voltage was vibrated and attenuated with the natural frequency until the next wave acts on the painted fped the summation of the absolute output voltage could be integrated into the time history and the total electrical power could be also estimated fig 21 shows the estimated power generated by the painted fped acted upon by each wave versus the wave steepness and period the total electrical power per painted fped during one day was estimated as shown in fig 22 the estimated electrical power per unit area p mw cm2 increased with wave steepness and period the maximal power density reached about p m a x 2 0 mw cm2 under excitation by one wave which was the same order or larger than the previous result 20 mw m2 15 w m2 as summarised in jbaily and yeung 2015 the total electrical power per device during one day also increased with the wave steepness and the maximal power was approximately 25 w day device the results indicated that the electrical power could be stored in batteries both the monitoring sensors and ocean environmental devices could be triggered and activated to work for practical applications in real sea states however to estimate output power in real sea conditions impedance matching by adding an external resistance should be considered as an important factor in an electric circuit design to improve electric performance particularly when a bimorph fped is used 7 conclusions this study developed a painted fped for harvesting wave energy moreover a theoretical model was proposed and the electrical power was estimated the main conclusions can be summarised as follows a painted fped with a laminated structure was proposed and developed as a wave energy harvester to generate electrical power the painted fped was characterised and designed according to different specifications such as the thickness of the painted piezo material and elastomer stiffness and aspect ratio a theoretical model was proposed to estimate the electrical performance and mechanical behaviours of the painted fped excited by a wave force and the results were in good agreement with the experimental ones the painted fped in water was smoothly deformed by the vertical vibration and the tendency of the deformation and velocity could be regarded as the first mode deformation the output voltage increased rapidly with the deformation rate especially in the case of strong stiffness under wave conditions an output voltage was clearly and periodically generated by the wave force and was found mostly as the first mode deformation the output voltage increased with increasing wave steepness and the aspect ratio ar 1 2 was suitable for high electrical performance in wave conditions the output voltage per unit area with a thickness of painted piezo material t 1 50 μm was higher when the wave steepness increased especially with the thin elastomer t e 5 mm the output voltage increased gradually with the wave height and the wave period especially in long wave length and high wave conditions the estimated electrical power per unit area p mw cm2 increased with the wave steepness and the wave period the maximal power density reached about p m a x 2 0 mw cm2 under excitation by one wave and the total electrical power per a painted fped during one day was approximately 25 w day device this electrical power could be stored in batteries in addition both the monitoring sensors and ocean environmental devices could be triggered and activated to work for practical purposes in real sea states in future efforts a painted fped optimised by parameter studies should be installed on an ocean structure in a real ocean field to evaluate its electrical performance and to examine extreme bending weathering and fatigue during a long term field test the reliability and durability of the painted fped in deep water should be also examined to install in real sea condition the impedance matching with the external resistance should be examined to improve electric performance then better electrical performance and efficiency should be achieved for activating several types of sensors acknowledgement the authors want to express our appreciation for the

modelling work that uses analytical approaches empirical methods and numerical methods they also compared the advantages and disadvantages of different hydrodynamic modelling methods these large scale energy sources involve relatively high cost extraction technologies and the resources are unavailable at certain times of the year therefore extensive research works have been continuously conducted in order to enhance the feasibility and usage of large scale efforts not only in the nearshore zone but also in the offshore zone in deep water using a long power supply on the other hand small scale

with heights and lengths of 2 and 15 m respectively hwang et al hwang et al 2017 demonstrated a piezoelectric ocean wave energy harvesting system that can harvest energy from low frequency vibrations such as those induced by ocean waves the proposed harvester design consisted of a metal ball moving along a rail that was positioned over a stationary magnet xie et al xie et al 2014b and wu et al wu et al 2015 proposed an ocean wave energy harvester that used the transverse wave motion of water particles using piezoelectric effect they developed a mathematical model to describe the principle of their piezoelectric energy harvester in wave motions and estimated that the rms of the electrical power increased from 2 5 to 30 w when the cantilever length changed from 1 to 1 7 m woo et al woo et

water waves energy in recent years polymer based piezoelectric paints have been investigated by a few researchers as a potential substitute for piezoelectric ceramics in certain sensing applications egusa and iwasawa 1996 white et al 2004 li et al li and zhang 2018 examined the feasibility of using a piezoelectric paint as an in plane strain wave based acoustic emission sensor with applicability

et al kang and lee 2014 presented a fabrication method for a piezoelectric paint sensor and its application to the impact and vibration monitoring of a beam structure they showed that an impact force signal over 10 n can be captured using the piezo paint however to the best knowledge of authors no research works proposed a wave energy harvester coating with piezoelectric paints in our previous studies e g mutsuda et al 2017a we developed a highly flexible piezoelectric device fped to harvest flow induced vibration energy by converting ambient kinetic energy such as wind current or ocean energy into electrical power the fped typically uses piezoelectric layers e g polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf and elastomer materials e g rubber and silicon to achieve high electrical performance and efficiency to withstand the extreme bending and weathering caused by waves and currents in real sea states a flexible device coated with a piezoelectric paint was developed mutsuda et al 2017b a theoretical model was also developed to predict electro fluid structure interactions and to evaluate the mechanical and electrical performance of the painted fped moreover a preliminary field test in 2016 was conducted to examine the electrical power of the painted fped installed on a fish aggregating device fad in real sea states however the painted fped was not optimised for wave conditions to obtain high electrical power and the influence of the laminated structure of the painted fped its substrate and its aspect ratio were not found in detail the purpose of this study is to reveal the mechanical deformation and electrical performance of a painted fped excited by wave conditions we also clarify the influence of key parameters such as the submerged depth wave steepness aspect ratio actuator pattern unimorph and bimorph and thickness of the painted piezo material and elastomer on the output voltage generated by the painted fped in wave conditions with various wave heights and periods furthermore a theoretical model based on a mode coupling technique is developed and applied to the painted fped in wave conditions 2 overview of the painted fped in this study the fped from the previous work mutsuda et al 2017a was improved to overcome some weak points in its practical use the painted fped proposed in this study had several improved mechanical and electrical performance features compared with other harvesters this section provides an overview of the painted fped proposed in this paper in our previous works mutsuda et al 2017a tanaka et al 2012 tanaka et al 2014 tanaka et al 2016 an energy harvester was developed to generate electrical power from ambient energy sources such as wave tidal current wind and mechanical vibration it was called a fped the device had a laminated structure consisting of a piezo film e g pvdf elastic material and adhesive the device could be easily deformed by an external force such as wind wave current or vibration and then generate electrical power from an ambient non utilised energy source however the fped may have had a fatal problem in practical application the surface between the piezo film and elastic material could sometimes be separated by external forces thus a fatigue fracture could occur to substantially address the problem the interface between them was thinly coated with a piezoelectric paint using a spray gun co et al japan co et al 2013 the thickness of the piezoelectric layer was generally about 50 100 μm to obtain high electrical performance as shown in fig 1 this was firstly proposed in the previous study mutsuda et al 2017b the painted fped was attached to the fad as an ocean energy harvester to generate electrical power from waves in a field test the fad combined with artificial ocean infrastructures forms an environment friendly ecosystem leading fishes to safety and feeding areas the fad was floated near the water surface and moored by a chain and fibre rope to a caisson on the sea bottom it was located 20 km offshore in water with a depth of 1000 m near the okinawa islands japan the field test revealed that the painted fped generated electrical power and had high durability in the bending and weathering caused by waves and current in a real sea state fig 2 shows the typical laminated structure of a painted fped whose size was l 1 length b 1 width t 1 thickness of the painted piezo material in this study the piezoelectric paint was coated onto the lower electrode in an area of l 2 length b 2 width which was made of polyphenylene sulphide pps with copper painting the upper and lower electrodes and coaxial cables were also coated with thin silicone for waterproof protection an elastic material with thickness t e was applied to the lower electrode the distance δ between the piezoelectric paint layer and centreline of the device is one of the key parameters for generating electrical power therefore a suitable distance δ must be selected considering both the external forces and rigidity of the device mutsuda et al 2017a in this study both the unimorph and bimorph types of painted fped were produced and compared for electrical power as shown in fig 3 3 overview of theoretical model for the painted fped in our previous study a theoretical model was proposed by patel et al patel et al 2014 to estimate the electrical performance and mechanical behaviours of a fped however the present model with some improvements was applied to the prediction of the electrical power generated by the painted fped in this study fig 4 shows an illustration of the theoretical model for the painted fped which is one example of a bimorph type cantilever supported by a jig on one side the other side is deformed by an external force the painted piezoelectric materials were coated from x 1 to x 3 on both sides of the pps substrate where x 2 is the length of the painted piezo material and x 1 and x 3 are the distances from the both ends of the painted fped based on knowledge from the experimental results as shown in section 4 it can be assumed that the painted fped was excited through a typical harmonic motion in the first deformation mode the governing equation of transverse vibration can be represented as 1 2 m x t x 2 m x 2 w x t t 2 f e where m x t is the internal moment of the painted fped at the cross section m x is the mass per unit length f e is an external force such as a wave or current and w x t is the transverse displacement represented by 2 w x t x r e l x t w b x t where w r e l x t is the displacement of the painted fped including the displacement of the base w b x t which is forced with an amplitude and a frequency the internal moment can be represented by 3 m x t e i x 2 w r e l x t x 2 ε v x t where e i x is the flexural rigidity v x t is the output voltage generated by the painted fped and is the permittivity at constant strain in this paper the external force f e can be estimated by the fundamental water wave theory waves in fluids and cambridg 1978 substituting eq 3 into eq 1 the following equation can be obtained 4 x 2 e i x 2 w r e l x t x 2 ε v x t m x 2 x r e l x t t 2 f e the mechanical behaviour of the painted fped is calculated by eq 4 thus the modal analysis can be typically applied to eq 4 the displacement of the painted fped w r e l x t can be represented as 5 w r e l x t q 1 w q x η q t where q is the mode number w q x is the normalised eigenvectors and η p is the time dependent generalised coordinates the modal response of the painted fped including modal damping can be represented by 6 η q 2 γ q w q η q t w q 2 η q t ε v t w q x 1 x 2 w q x 1 0 l f e x w q x d x where γ is the ratio of the modal damping and l is the length of the painted fped here the first mode represented by q 1 was assumed only in this study the differential equation of the output voltage generated by the painted fped can be represented by 7 c p v t t v t r l o a d q 1 e p d 31 t p c b p w q x x x 1 x 1 x 2 η q t where c p is the piezoelectric internal capacitance r l o a d is the load resistance e p is the young s modulus of the piezoelectric material d 31 is the piezoelectric material constant in the axial direction dominantly in the transverse direction t p c is the distance between the neutral axis and centre of the piezoelectric material and b p is the width of the piezoelectric layer which is assumed to be constant along the beam length both the mechanical equation eq 4 and the electrical equation eq 7 can be coupled which means electromechanical coupling modes to consider the interaction between the deformation of the painted fped and its electrical performance 4 vibration test of the painted fped in a water tank before investigating the electrical performance of the painted fped in wave conditions vibration tests were performed to reveal the mechanical deformation and electrical performance forced by a simple vibration controlled for amplitude and frequency in addition the repeatability and fatigue of the painted fped were examined 4 1 experimental setup to clarify the characteristics of the output voltage generated by the painted fped in response to a periodic external force a vibration test of the painted fped was conducted in a water tank it was a cantilever type of unimorph and the experimental setup is shown in fig 5 the water tank was 10 m length 0 6 m height 0 25 m width the initial water depth was set at 0 45 m to avoid disturbance from the water surface and tank walls the water tank has an absorbing beach in the downstream side to reduce wave amplitude and relevant forces and to avoid generating resonant waves the painted fped was horizontally supported at the bottom end of the linear slider and the vertical guide rail was controlled with a vibrated amplitude and period the output voltage from the painted pfed was measured using a laptop computer and a d convertor in open circuit with a 1 m ω resistor a high speed video camera was located beside the water tank to record the deformation of the painted fped and its deformation rate was analysed by particle tracking velocimetry ptv the experimental conditions in the vibration test are shown in table 1 considering the experimental conditions of the wave forcing test in section 5 a scale model was based on froude s law for real sea states the vibrated amplitude was set to a v 10 50 mm and the vibrated period was set to t v 0 5 2 0 s the specifications of the unimorph type of painted fped are shown in table 2 its dimensions were l 500 mm length and b 10 mm width with an aspect ratio ar 1 5 the thickness of the elastomer t e was exchanged from 10 to 20 mm including the painted piezo material with a thickness of 50 100 μm in order to investigate influence of stiffness on the output voltage and distance δ as defined in section 2 silicone with a young s modulus of 3 mpa and density of 2200 kg m3 was employed as the elastomer for fped a fped b and fped c and an acrylic with a young s modulus of 3140 mpa and density of 1200 kg m3 was used for fped d the flexural rigidity e i was set to 0 0962 2 475 n m2 4 2 results and discussion to investigate the mechanical performance of the painted fped in a deformation mode and to confirm its responsiveness to an external force with vibration and without electrical noise images of the deformation of the painted fped in water were captured by a high speed camera see fig 6 the time histories of the painted fped s tip deformation and velocity are shown in fig 7 the painted fped in water was deformed smoothly by the vertical vibration and the tendency of the deformation and velocity can be regarded as the first mode deformation fig 8 shows the time histories of the output voltage generated by each painted fped which were vibrated with an amplitude a v 30 mm and period t v 0 5 s it can be seen that the first mode deformation was clearly generated in all of the painted fpeds and there was no electrical or deformable noise in the output voltage the responsiveness of the painted fped in the water was also higher in sensitivity to the repeated external force compared with the previous devices mutsuda et al 2017a mutsuda et al 2017b the results indicated that the painted fped could generate electrical power in real sea states including irregular seas with varying wave heights and periods to examine relationships between the displacement of the painted fped and its output voltage and to clarify the characteristics of its electrical performance and deformation fig 9 plots the output voltage against the vibrated amplitude the output voltage was averaged by the maximum value per period in the time histories as shown in fig 8 it was found that the output voltage increased with increasing vibrated amplitude for all of the painted fpeds the painted fpeds with weak stiffness such as fped a and fped b demonstrated high performance with longer vibration periods whereas fped d with strong stiffness generated a higher output voltage with the vibration period t 0 5 s in addition fped c had the same tendency with the vibration period t 1 0 s the tip deformation rate of the painted fped is shown in fig 10 the deformation rate of the painted fped at the tip end was obtained from analysis of the images captured by the high speed video camera the output voltage increased rapidly with deformation rate especially fped d which had relatively strong stiffness these results indicated that the stiffness of the painted fped should be appropriately designed for the wave conditions including wave height and period to induce high electrical power generation and high efficiency 5 wave forcing test acting on the painted fped in a towing tank 5 1 experimental setup to examine the characteristics of the output voltage generated by a painted fped caused by waves the wave forcing test was conducted in a towing tank having dimensions of 100 m length 8 m width 3 5 m depth as shown in fig 11 the towing tank has an absorbing beach in the downstream side to reduce wave amplitude and relevant forces and to avoid generating resonant waves the painted fped was vertically and strongly supported by fixed aluminum frames located on the towing train to avoid frame vibrations whose natural frequency is about f n 30 hz that is quite different from the natural frequency of the painted fped less than f n 10 hz and six fpeds were simultaneously set at a certain increment to avoid fluid interactions between them the alignment and phase material were also carefully checked without any vibration noise before conducting the experiment the painted fpeds were set at a depth d l below the still water depth where l is the length of the device the painted fpeds were forced by a regular wave with a wave height and period controlled by a plunger type wave maker the incident wave height and current velocity were measured by a wave gauge and a current metre located on the upstream side of the tank respectively as the initial external force condition the output voltage generated by the painted fped was measured using a data logger a d convertor and a laptop computer the internal resistance of the data logger in open circuit was set at 1 m ω to calculate the electrical power using ohm s law a video camera was employed to record the deformation of the painted fped forced by waves the incident wave conditions are shown in table 3 the regular wave height was set to 50 150 mm and the wave period was 0 8 1 5 s which was decided considering real sea states and the model scale the specifications of the painted fpeds are shown in table 4 their dimensions were l 1 420 mm length b 1 80 170 mm width the thickness t e of the elastomer was set to 5 6 8 and 10 mm which was nitrile rubber with a density of 1600 kg m3 and a young s modulus of 4 17 mpa in order to examine the influence of stiffness on the output voltage and the aspect ratio ar b 2 l 2 1 5 1 3 and 1 2 the painted piezo material was coated onto an area of l 2 300 mm length b 2 60 150 mm width t 1 50 100 μm thickness 5 2 results and discussion to confirm the output voltage without any electrical disturbance and to investigate the electrical performance in the wave conditions shown in table 3 fig 12 shows the time histories of the output voltage generated by the painted fped acted upon by a wave with height h 0 15 m and period t 1 2 s the output voltages were clearly and periodically generated by the wave force this was mostly recognised as the first mode deformation although there was a small fluctuation of high frequency caused by small vortices between the painted fpeds fig 13 shows the influence of the submerged depth d l of the painted fped on the output voltage to the wave steepness h λ where h is the wave height and λ is the wavelength the output voltage increased with increasing wave steepness in all cases in the case of d l 0 5 where the painted fped was submerged by a half length of the painted fped the output voltage was higher compared with that of d l 1 0 especially for fped3 this is because the wave force acted on the bottom end of the painted fped below the water surface as a concentrated load not as a distributed load on the whole area of the painted fped consequently the moment caused by the wave force was also larger the influence of the wave height on the output voltage of each painted pfed is shown in fig 14 it can be seen that the output voltage increased with increasing wave height and the best performance was found with fped3 in all cases this indicated that the stiffness of fped3 was appropriately selected for the wave conditions fig 15 shows a comparison of the output voltages versus the aspect ratios ar of the painted fpeds the output voltages increased with the wave steepness thus the aspect ratio ar 1 2 was suitable for high performance in these wave conditions a comparison between the output voltages of the unimorph and bimorph types is shown in fig 16 the output voltage per unit area of the bimorph type of painted fped was larger than that of the unimorph it also increased with wave steepness to generate high voltage the thickness of the elastomer should be relatively thin although the distance between the piezoelectric paint layer and centreline of the painted fped was larger in the case of t e 10 mm that is because the deformation of the painted fped was smoothly and easily excited by the wave force fig 17 shows the influence of the thickness t 1 of the painted piezo material on the output voltage in the case in with an aspect ratio ar 1 2 the output voltage per unit area with t 1 50 μm was higher when the wave steepness increased especially with the thin elastomer t e 5 mm this indicated that the stiffness with t 1 50 μm was deformable compared with that for t 1 100 μm therefore the stiffness related to t 1 and t e should be suitably designed to excite the first mode deformation of the painted fped considering the wave conditions 6 estimation of energy harvesting in real ocean field to validate the output voltage estimated by the proposed theoretical model against the experiment results comparisons of the thickness t 1 of the painted piezo electric material the actuator pattern unimorph and bimorph and the thickness t e of the elastomer are shown in fig 18 the fped3 with ar 1 2 was the focus of these comparisons because its maximal output voltage was excited mostly in the wave conditions mentioned in section 5 the results indicated that the theoretical results were in overall agreement with the experimental results under several structural and all wave conditions therefore the theoretical model could estimate the output voltage and electrical power induced by wave conditions it could also be a useful design tool for the painted fped in real sea states fig 19 shows the influence of the wave height and period on the output voltage in conditions with a wave height h 1 0 4 0 m and t 5 12 s which usually occurs in real sea states indicating an operating condition for the painted fped3 the external force f e was estimated by the fundamental water wave theory waves in fluids and cambridg 1978 and the internal resistance of the data logger in open circuit was set at 1 m ω to calculate the electrical power using ohm s law as the same experimental condition it can be seen that the output voltage was gradually increasing with the wave height and period especially in long and high wave conditions and a saturation condition was not found in these conditions in actual sea states a certain limitation for operating the painted fped should be set to realise high performance in the first deformation mode without disturbance the wave frequency in real sea states could be different from the natural frequency of the painted fped therefore wave forces with a wave period can excite the painted fped as a trigger for generating the output voltage therefore a free vibration test was also conducted to obtain the natural frequency of the painted fped3 and the coefficient of attenuation as shown in table 5 fig 20 shows one example of the time history of the output voltage caused by wave trains with a wave height h 4 m and wave period t 5 s the amplitude of the output voltage decreased gradually with the natural frequency at each application of the force and with the time interval of the wave period this result means that the output voltage of the painted fped was repeatedly generated by wave force as a trigger with the wave period the output voltage was vibrated and attenuated with the natural frequency until the next wave acts on the painted fped the summation of the absolute output voltage could be integrated into the time history and the total electrical power could be also estimated fig 21 shows the estimated power generated by the painted fped acted upon by each wave versus the wave steepness and period the total electrical power per painted fped during one day was estimated as shown in fig 22 the estimated electrical power per unit area p mw cm2 increased with wave steepness and period the maximal power density reached about p m a x 2 0 mw cm2 under excitation by one wave which was the same order or larger than the previous result 20 mw m2 15 w m2 as summarised in jbaily and yeung 2015 the total electrical power per device during one day also increased with the wave steepness and the maximal power was approximately 25 w day device the results indicated that the electrical power could be stored in batteries both the monitoring sensors and ocean environmental devices could be triggered and activated to work for practical applications in real sea states however to estimate output power in real sea conditions impedance matching by adding an external resistance should be considered as an important factor in an electric circuit design to improve electric performance particularly when a bimorph fped is used 7 conclusions this study developed a painted fped for harvesting wave energy moreover a theoretical model was proposed and the electrical power was estimated the main conclusions can be summarised as follows a painted fped with a laminated structure was proposed and developed as a wave energy harvester to generate electrical power the painted fped was characterised and designed according to different specifications such as the thickness of the painted piezo material and elastomer stiffness and aspect ratio a theoretical model was proposed to estimate the electrical performance and mechanical behaviours of the painted fped excited by a wave force and the results were in good agreement with the experimental ones the painted fped in water was smoothly deformed by the vertical vibration and the tendency of the deformation and velocity could be regarded as the first mode deformation the output voltage increased rapidly with the deformation rate especially in the case of strong stiffness under wave conditions an output voltage was clearly and periodically generated by the wave force and was found mostly as the first mode deformation the output voltage increased with increasing wave steepness and the aspect ratio ar 1 2 was suitable for high electrical performance in wave conditions the output voltage per unit area with a thickness of painted piezo material t 1 50 μm was higher when the wave steepness increased especially with the thin elastomer t e 5 mm the output voltage increased gradually with the wave height and the wave period especially in long wave length and high wave conditions the estimated electrical power per unit area p mw cm2 increased with the wave steepness and the wave period the maximal power density reached about p m a x 2 0 mw cm2 under excitation by one wave and the total electrical power per a painted fped during one day was approximately 25 w day device this electrical power could be stored in batteries in addition both the monitoring sensors and ocean environmental devices could be triggered and activated to work for practical purposes in real sea states in future efforts a painted fped optimised by parameter studies should be installed on an ocean structure in a real ocean field to evaluate its electrical performance and to examine extreme bending weathering and fatigue during a long term field test the reliability and durability of the painted fped in deep water should be also examined to install in real sea condition the impedance matching with the external resistance should be examined to improve electric performance then better electrical performance and efficiency should be achieved for activating several types of sensors acknowledgement the authors want to express our appreciation for the

fractal aggregate 1 introduction the erosion of cohesive soils is an important process in sediment contaminant transport and land protection winterwerp et al 2004 erodibility is often expressed as a

developed a probabilistic model that incorporated the tensile strength of the soil which is an aggregate measure of the resistant forces of both chemical and organic bonds currently no reliable method exists to estimate the erosion threshold for cohesive soils based on the soil properties cossette et al 2012 it is well known that cohesive soil particles tend to form complex structures called aggregates due to cohesive or adhesive forces and aggregateg networks tend to be self similar meakin 1988 kranenburg 1994 based on the scale invariance of a self similar fractal structure the number of bonds in an erosion plane does not depend on the size of aggregates kranenburg 1994 presented the erosion threshold as the function of the effective density 1 τ c ρ e 2 3 d where τ c is the erosion

coefficient ranging between 0 5 and 1 5 bache 2004 following the definition of the solids volume fraction within an aggregate it can be concluded that the yield strength is not constant but a function of fractal structure and size son and hsu 2009 assumed that the yield strength of aggregates depends on the strength of inter particle bonds and the number of the inter particle bonds within aggregates and gave an expression of the yield strength of aggregates 3 τ c π 6 2 3 f cp d a d p 2 d 3 d a 2 where f cp is the cohesive force of primary particles and is considered as an empirical parameter because it depends on the properties of sediments the difficulties in modeling erodibility of cohesive soils are due to the strong inter particle attractions found in cohesive soil winterwerp et al 2004 the interparticle attraction is influenced by a large number of soil properties that interact in complex ways the hierarchical nature of the cohesive mechanisms electrostatic clay and sesquioxide cement bonds results in soils with complex cohesive properties grabowski et al 2011 fractal model for aggregates offers a good method to study the erosion threshold of cohesive soils kranenburg 1994 son and hsu 2009 in this paper according to the fractal model for the aggregates a new formula for the erosion threshold of cohesive soils is proposed and verified by the published data of the erosion threshold the proposed model for the erosion threshold was compared with the kranenburg model 1994 and the son and hsu model 2009 the proposed model for the erosion threshold was better matching with the experimental data than both the kranenburg model and the son and hsu model 2 fractal aggregates cohesive soils are primarily and mainly composed of clay minerals clay minerals are the most electrochemically active portion of cohesive soils cohesive soil particles tend to form aggregates due to cohesive or adhesive forces among clay particles the aggregates of cohesive soils have a fractal structure i e a fractal surface a fractal volume and a fractal mass kranenburg 1994 the number of the primary particles with similar diameters consisting in an aggregate may be given by 4 n k g d a d p d where n is the number of primary particles k g is the shape factor of aggregates d a is the aggregate diameter d p is the primary particle diameter and d is the fractal dimension the number of primary particles within an aggregate n is derived from the definition of n ϕ s d a d p 3 krone 1963 kranenburg 1994 here φ s is the solid volume fraction thus the solid volume fraction is given by 5 φ s k d a d p d 3 where φ s is the solid volume fraction k is a constant the porosity of an aggregate given by the definition as φ 1 φ s can be written as 6 φ 1 φ s 1 k d a d p d 3 where φ is the aggregate porosity the aggregate density is defined as the weighted average density of particles and water and can be calculated as 7 ρ a ρ p φ s 1 φ s ρ w rearranging eq 7 aggregate effective density ρ e ρ a ρ w is expressed as 8 ρ a ρ w ρ p ρ w φ s k d a d p d 3 where ρ a is the aggregate density ρ p is the density of primary particle ρ w is the density of water in aggregates the fractal dimension of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates was determined from the solid volume fraction and the effective density respectively the physical properties of kunigel v1 bentonite are listed in table 1 the bentonite aggregates are produced by swelling deformation tests the swelling deformation of kunigel v1 bentonite was conducted on a modified oedometer the specimen was produced by compaction and was set up on the test apparatus silicone grease was applied to the inner cell wall to reduce friction between the specimen and cell wall after applying the prescribed vertical pressure to specimen the distilled water was supplied to the specimen the change in the specimen height and weight were measured after testing the initial height of compacted specimen is 10 mm the solid volume fraction of compacted kunigel v1 bentonite after swelling deformation tests is calculated by 9 φ s 1 e 2 1 e 2 where e 2 is the void ratio of specimen after swelling deformation test and expressed by 10 e 2 g s ρ d 2 1 where g s is the specific gravity of bentonite ρ d2 is the dry density of specimen after swelling deformation test ρ d2 m s v 2 m s and v 2 are the solid mass and the volume of specimen after swelling deformation test experimental data of the relationship between the solid volume fraction and the specimen size of kunigel v1 bentonite were shown in fig 1 where the aggregate size is replaced by the specimen height the fractal dimension of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates was 2 15 obtained from fig 1 the relationship between the effective density and the specimen diameter of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates was shown in fig 2 the effective density of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates after swelling deformation tests is calculated by ρ e ρ a ρ w ρ a m 2 v 2 m 2 and v 2 are the mass and volume of specimen after swelling deformation tests the fractal dimension of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates was 2 15 obtained from the relationship between the effective density and the specimen diameter in fig 2 the fractal dimension of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates obtained from the solid volume fraction is consistent with that from the effective density the solid volume fraction and the effective density were calculated independently from the physical properties of kunigel v1 bentonite specimens after swelling deformation tests the verification of eq 5 and eq 8 was conducted by the results of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates shown in figs 1 and 2 the experimental data for the solid volume fraction and the effective density of aggregates which can be collected in literature were shown in fig 3 in fig 3 the regression lines are used to replace the experimental data in order to clearly display the fractal characteristics of aggregates all data in fig 3 manifested that cohesive soils had a fractal volume and fractal mass the fractal dimension of cohesive soils whose diameters widely span four grades and range from 10 3mm 10 mm valued from 1 0 to 3 0 and mainly stayed at 2 0 or so the difference of the fractal dimension is due to the difference in the aggregate structure the aggregates shown in fig 3 are produced for different cohesive materials thus their structures are different and their fractal dimensions are different 3 erosion threshold erosion of cohesive soil consists of three separate processes sanford 2008 first is the separation detachment or initiation of motion of soil aggregates from among neighboring aggregates second is the transport of these detached aggregates and third is an increase in the particle transport rate along a surface flow path that results in removal of aggregates from the soil surface the stability of soil aggregates in an aquatic environment is dependent on the balance between hydrodynamic forces that cause erosion and inter particle attraction within soils that resist it erosion occurs when hydrodynamic forces that cause erosion exceed the resistive forces inter particle attraction within soils the resistive forces inter particle attraction refers to the attraction of clay colloids by electro chemical forces israelachvili 1991 gave an expression for the inter particle attraction of van der waals between two particles 11 f h a h d 1 d 2 12 d 1 d 2 d i 2 where a h is the hamaker constant and a h 10 20j d 1 and d 2 are the particle diameters d i is the inter particle distance the distance d i between the centers of two particles is in proportion to the particle diameter ternat et al 2008 12 d i k d p where k is a constant the aggregates in cohesive soils are loosely in contact with each other especially in the process of the surface erosion ternat et al 2008 thus the inter particle distance has the considerable value of the particle diameters it is observed that aggregates are often disaggregated into two roughly equal sized aggregates in erosion tsai and hwang 1995 hence it is assumed here that during the aggregate erosion an aggregate is divided by the plane which contains the center of aggregates as the two daughter aggregates have the same size after erosion it is assumed that d 1 d 2 d i kd p eq 11 changes to 13 f h a h 24 k 2 1 d p according to eq 13 the erosion threshold can be written as 14 τ c f h π d a 2 4 a h 6 π k 2 d p 1 d a 2 equation 14 is the same equation as the yield strength equation eq 2 proposed by kranenburg 1994 the number of primary particles in the erosion plane should be a function of the aggregate size and its fractal dimension consequently an equation for the number of primary particles n in the plane crossing the center of aggregates can be derived as son and hsu 2009 15 n f a d a d p 2 d 3 where f a is a shape constant the magnitude of resistive forces is the product of the number of primary particles within an aggregate and the magnitude of the cohesive force between primary particles i e f a n f h thus the resistive force against erosion of an aggregate is presented as follows 16 f a a h f a 24 k 2 1 d p d a d p 2 d 3 for a fractal aggregate the area of the erosion plane equals a a π n d p 2 4 is given by 17 a a c a d a d p d where c a is a constant and c a π k g d p 2 4 the erosion threshold of an aggregate can be given by dividing the resistive forces by the area of erosion plane and is written as follows 18 τ c α a d a d p κ where α a a h f a 24 k 2 c a d p κ d 3 the erosion threshold can be expressed by the solid volume fraction φ s and the aggregate effective density ρ e and is written as follows 19 τ c β a ϕ s λ τ c β b ρ e λ where β a and β b are constants λ d 3 3 d 4 verification of the erosion threshold the verification of the proposed model was conducted by comparing with the experimental data of the erosion threshold the verification contains two parts one is determination of the fractal dimension of the cohesive soils from the experimental data of the aggregate effective density and two is model verification using the experimental data of the erosion threshold experimental data of graneros soil osorno soil and pemehue soil was given by seguel and horn 2006 these three soils were sampled from different places of the central valley of chile graneros soil was a mollisol osorno soil was a characteristic volcanic ash soil from south chile pemehue soil was a very young andisol both osorno soil and pemehue soil are dominated by allophane samples of these three soils were collected at the depth of 0 15 cm soil aggregates were separated softly at field water content followed by complete water saturation soil aggregates were equilibrated in a pressure plate extractor at different suction pf 1 78 2 70 and 4 48 bulk density was measured by cylinders taken at field water content the indirect tensile strength was measured using crushing tests the aggregate sample size ranged from 0 5 x202f cm to 4 x202f cm twenty five aggregate samples were conducted under per suction seguel and horn 2006 gave the experimental data of the bulk density of cohesive soils the bulk density was defined as 20 ρ b m s v s v p where ρ b is the bulk density m s is the mass of the soil particles v s and v p are the volumes of the soil particles and the pore volume in the soil samples the relationship between the bulk density and the aggregate density is given by 21 ρ a m s m w v s v p ρ b φ ρ w where ρ a is the aggregate density m w is the mass of the pore water φ is the soil porosity the soil porosities are 0 691 0 744 and 0 767 for graneros soil osorno soil and pemehue soil respectively the effective density ρ e ρ a ρ w can be calculated from eq 21 using the bulk density of cohesive soils the relationship between the effective density and the aggregate size was shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the relationship between the effective density and the aggregate size manifested a linear regression in log log plane according to eq 9 the fractal dimension can be determined from the linear regressions the aggregate fractal dimensions of graneros soil osorno soil and pemehue soil are 2 76 2 83 and 2 85 respectively predictions of the proposed model eq 18 were compared with the experimental data of the erosion threshold for graneros soil osorno soil and pemehue soil in fig 5 the parameter α a is calculated from the regression of the experimental data and is written as follows 22 α a i 1 n τ c i d a d p i κ n the parameters in prediction of eq 18 are listed in table 2 in fig 5 pf is the matric suction the more is the matric suction the larger is the erosion threshold based on eq 18 the slopes in fig 5 were calculated using the aggregate fractal dimension aggregates in a soil have only one fractal dimension the erosion threshold of a cohesive soil has different value for the samples with different matric suction the predictions of the erosion threshold well matched with the experimental data for three different matric suctions it meant that the proposed model had a high accuracy to predict the erosion threshold 5 comparison with the kranenburg model the proposed model for the erosion threshold on base of the fractal aggregates is different from that proposed by kranenburg 1994 the kranenburg model can be written as another form 23 τ c d a 2 experimental data on the erosion threshold of cohesive soils were shown in fig 6 fig 6a showed the experimental data of the erosion thresholds and characteristics which were given by thomsen and gust 2000 the cohesive soil cores were taken from the western european continental margin under water depth of 212 4940 m the median diameter of soil aggregates ranges 0 125 2 403 mm the slope of the regression line was 0 43 and corresponding to the fractal dimension of 1 29 in fig 6a fig 6b showed the experimental results on the erosion threshold characteristics of cohesive soil mixtures containing silt the cohesive soils consisted of clay in proportions varying from 10 to 50 by weight the slope of the regression line was 0 60 corresponding to the fractal dimension of 1 80 in fig 6b the fractal dimension of cohesive soils obtained from fig 6 lied in the range of 0 3 0 which was the value range for the fractal dimension of aggregates this meant that the proposed model can be used to predict the erosion threshold of cohesive soils the slopes of the regression lines in log log plane were far less than 2 in fig 6 the regression results showed that the experimental data deviated from the kranenburg model thus the kranenburg model cannot be used to predict the relationship between the erosion threshold and the aggregate diameter 6 comparison with the son and hsu model according to eqs 3 and 8 the son and hsu model can be written as follows 24 τ c ϕ s 2 3 ρ a ρ w ρ p ρ w 2 3 equation 24 is different from the proposed model eq 18 for the erosion threshold on base of the fractal aggregates fig 7 showed the experimental data of the erosion threshold expressed by the solid volume fraction the relationship between the compressive strength and the solid volume fraction of kaolinite aggregates was shown in fig 7a given by nasser and james 2006 the slopes of the regression lines in fig 7a were 5 78 6 58 6 81 7 08 6 07 and 6 66 respectively for a100 a130 a130 lmw c492 c496 and c446 the fractal dimensions of a100 a130 a130 lmw c492 c496 and c446 were 2 84 2 86 2 86 2 87 2 84 and 2 86 respectively mills et al 1991 employed polystyrene latex as a model aggregate and gave the compressive yield stress fig 7b the slopes of the regression lines in fig 7b were 1 34 and 1 35 respectively for freshly coagulated aggregates and extensively coagulated aggregates the fractal dimensions of both freshly coagulated aggregates and extensively coagulated aggregates were 2 40 predictions of the proposed model were compared with that of the son and hsu model in fig 7 the slopes of the regression lines in log log plane were not 2 3 in fig 7 the regression results showed that the experimental data deviated from the son and hsu model thus the son and hsu model cannot be used to predict the relationship between the erosion threshold and the aggregate effective density fig 8 showed the experimental data of the erosion threshold expressed by the aggregate effective density krone 1963 gave the erosion threshold characteristics for estuarial aggregates at different harbors in fig 8a the slopes of the regression lines in fig 8a were 2 85 1 89 2 78 and 2 02 respectively for the estuarial aggregates in san francisco wilmington district brunswick harbour and gulfport harbour the fractal dimensions of estuarial aggregates in san francisco wilmington district brunswick harbour and gulfport harbour were 2 69 2 55 2 68 and 2 56 respectively the critical erosion threshold in cohesive sediments was measured at 11 stations along the axis of the tamar estuary and at a single station in a tributary of the tamar at st john s ford and was shown in fig 8b bale et al 2006 2007 the slope of the regression line in fig 8b was 1 03 for the cohesive sediments at the tamar estuary and the st john s ford the fractal dimension of for the cohesive sediments was 2 26 comparisons between the proposed model and the son and hsu model were shown in fig 8 the slopes of the regression lines in log log plane were not 2 3 in fig 8 the predictions of the son and hsu model deviated from the experimental data in fig 8 the proposed model can be used to express the erosion threshold and the aggregate effective density 7 conclusions in this paper we proposed a fractal framework for the erosion threshold characteristics of cohesive soils and effort to relate the erosion threshold to the aggregate size the aggregate effective density and the solid volume fraction the proposed method can be used to predict the erosion threshold of cohesive soils with accuracy we also compared the proposed method with the kranenburg model and son and hsu model we found that both the kranenburg model and son and hsu model deviated from the experimental data of the erosion threshold of cohesive soils the kranenburg model cannot predict the relationship between the erosion threshold and the aggregate size the son and hsu model cannot predict the

mm the solid volume fraction of compacted kunigel v1 bentonite after swelling deformation tests is calculated by 9 φ s 1 e 2 1 e 2 where e 2 is the void ratio of specimen after swelling deformation test and expressed by 10 e 2 g s ρ d 2 1 where g s is the specific gravity of bentonite ρ d2 is the dry density of specimen after swelling deformation test ρ d2 m s v 2 m s and v 2 are the solid mass and the volume of specimen after swelling deformation test experimental data of the relationship between the solid volume fraction and the specimen size of kunigel v1 bentonite were shown in fig 1 where the aggregate size is replaced by the specimen height the fractal dimension of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates was 2 15 obtained from fig 1 the relationship between the effective density and the specimen diameter of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates was shown in fig 2 the effective density of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates after swelling deformation tests is calculated by ρ e ρ a ρ w ρ a m 2 v 2 m 2 and v 2 are the mass and volume of specimen after swelling deformation tests the fractal dimension of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates was 2 15 obtained from the relationship between the effective density and the specimen diameter in fig 2 the fractal dimension of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates obtained from the solid volume fraction is consistent with that from the effective density the solid volume fraction and the effective density were calculated independently from the physical properties of kunigel v1 bentonite specimens after swelling deformation tests the verification of eq 5 and eq 8 was conducted by the results of kunigel v1 bentonite aggregates shown in figs 1 and 2 the experimental data for the solid volume fraction and the effective density of aggregates which can be collected in literature were shown in fig 3 in fig 3 the regression lines are used to replace the experimental data in order to clearly display the fractal characteristics of aggregates all data in fig 3 manifested that cohesive soils had a fractal volume and fractal mass the fractal dimension of cohesive soils whose diameters widely span four grades and range from 10 3mm 10 mm valued from 1 0 to 3 0 and mainly stayed at 2 0 or so the difference of the fractal dimension is due to the difference in the aggregate structure the aggregates shown in fig 3 are produced for different cohesive materials thus their structures are different and their fractal dimensions are different 3 erosion threshold erosion of cohesive soil consists of three separate processes sanford 2008 first is the separation detachment or initiation of motion of soil aggregates from among neighboring aggregates second is the transport of these detached aggregates and third is an increase in the particle transport rate along a surface flow path that results in removal of aggregates from the soil surface the stability of soil aggregates in an aquatic environment is dependent on the balance between hydrodynamic forces that cause erosion and inter particle attraction within soils that resist it erosion occurs when hydrodynamic forces that cause erosion exceed the resistive forces inter particle attraction within soils the resistive forces inter particle attraction refers to the attraction of clay colloids by electro chemical forces israelachvili 1991 gave an expression for the inter particle attraction of van der waals between two particles 11 f h a h d 1 d 2 12 d 1 d 2 d i 2 where a h is the hamaker constant and a h 10 20j d 1 and d 2 are the particle diameters d i is the inter particle distance the distance d i between the centers of two particles is in proportion to the particle diameter ternat et al 2008 12 d i k d p where k is a constant the aggregates in cohesive soils are loosely in contact with each other especially in the process of the surface erosion ternat et al 2008 thus the inter particle distance has the considerable value of the particle diameters it is observed that aggregates are often disaggregated into two roughly equal sized aggregates in erosion tsai and hwang 1995 hence it is assumed here that during the aggregate erosion an aggregate is divided by the plane which contains the center of aggregates as the two daughter aggregates have the same size after erosion it is assumed that d 1 d 2 d i kd p eq 11 changes to 13 f h a h 24 k 2 1 d p according to eq 13 the erosion threshold can be written as 14 τ c f h π d a 2 4 a h 6 π k 2 d p 1 d a 2 equation 14 is the same equation as the yield strength equation eq 2 proposed by kranenburg 1994 the number of primary particles in the erosion plane should be a function of the aggregate size and its fractal dimension consequently an equation for the number of primary particles n in the plane crossing the center of aggregates can be derived as son and hsu 2009 15 n f a d a d p 2 d 3 where f a is a shape constant the magnitude of resistive forces is the product of the number of primary particles within an aggregate and the magnitude of the cohesive force between primary particles i e f a n f h thus the resistive force against erosion of an aggregate is presented as follows 16 f a a h f a 24 k 2 1 d p d a d p 2 d 3 for a fractal aggregate the area of the erosion plane equals a a π n d p 2 4 is given by 17 a a c a d a d p d where c a is a constant and c a π k g d p 2 4 the erosion threshold of an aggregate can be given by dividing the resistive forces by the area of erosion plane and is written as follows 18 τ c α a d a d p κ where α a a h f a 24 k 2 c a d p κ d 3 the erosion threshold can be expressed by the solid volume fraction φ s and the aggregate effective density ρ e and is written as follows 19 τ c β a ϕ s λ τ c β b ρ e λ where β a and β b are constants λ d 3 3 d 4 verification of the erosion threshold the verification of the proposed model was conducted by comparing with the experimental data of the erosion threshold the verification contains two parts one is determination of the fractal dimension of the cohesive soils from the experimental data of the aggregate effective density and two is model verification using the experimental data of the erosion threshold experimental data of graneros soil osorno soil and pemehue soil was given by seguel and horn 2006 these three soils were sampled from different places of the central valley of chile graneros soil was a mollisol osorno soil was a characteristic volcanic ash soil from south chile pemehue soil was a very young andisol both osorno soil and pemehue soil are dominated by allophane samples of these three soils were collected at the depth of 0 15 cm soil aggregates were separated softly at field water content followed by complete water saturation soil aggregates were equilibrated in a pressure plate extractor at different suction pf 1 78 2 70 and 4 48 bulk density was measured by cylinders taken at field water content the indirect tensile strength was measured using crushing tests the aggregate sample size ranged from 0 5 x202f cm to 4 x202f cm twenty five aggregate samples were conducted under per suction seguel and horn 2006 gave the experimental data of the bulk density of cohesive soils the bulk density was defined as 20 ρ b m s v s v p where ρ b is the bulk density m s is the mass of the soil particles v s and v p are the volumes of the soil particles and the pore volume in the soil samples the relationship between the bulk density and the aggregate density is given by 21 ρ a m s m w v s v p ρ b φ ρ w where ρ a is the aggregate density m w is the mass of the pore water φ is the soil porosity the soil porosities are 0 691 0 744 and 0 767 for graneros soil osorno soil and pemehue soil respectively the effective density ρ e ρ a ρ w can be calculated from eq 21 using the bulk density of cohesive soils the relationship between the effective density and the aggregate size was shown in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that the relationship between the effective density and the aggregate size manifested a linear regression in log log plane according to eq 9 the fractal dimension can be determined from the linear regressions the aggregate fractal dimensions of graneros soil osorno soil and pemehue soil are 2 76 2 83 and 2 85 respectively predictions of the proposed model eq 18 were compared with the experimental data of the erosion threshold for graneros soil osorno soil and pemehue soil in fig 5 the parameter α a is calculated from the regression of the experimental data and is written as follows 22 α a i 1 n τ c i d a d p i κ n the parameters in prediction of eq 18 are listed in table 2 in fig 5 pf is the matric suction the more is the matric suction the larger is the erosion threshold based on eq 18 the slopes in fig 5 were calculated using the aggregate fractal dimension aggregates in a soil have only one fractal dimension the erosion threshold of a cohesive soil has different value for the samples with different matric suction the predictions of the erosion threshold well matched with the experimental data for three different matric suctions it meant that the proposed model had a high accuracy to predict the erosion threshold 5 comparison with the kranenburg model the proposed model for the erosion threshold on base of the fractal aggregates is different from that proposed by kranenburg 1994 the kranenburg model can be written as another form 23 τ c d a 2 experimental data on the erosion threshold of cohesive soils were shown in fig 6 fig 6a showed the experimental data of the erosion thresholds and characteristics which were given by thomsen and gust 2000 the cohesive soil cores were taken from the western european continental margin under water depth of 212 4940 m the median diameter of soil

characteristics of cohesive soil mixtures containing silt the cohesive soils consisted of clay in proportions varying from 10 to 50 by weight the slope of the regression line was 0 60 corresponding to the fractal dimension of 1 80 in fig 6b the fractal dimension of cohesive soils obtained from fig 6 lied in the range of 0 3 0 which was the value range for the fractal dimension of aggregates this meant that the proposed model can be used to predict the erosion threshold of cohesive soils the slopes of the regression lines in log log plane were far less than 2 in fig 6 the regression results showed that the experimental data deviated from the kranenburg model thus the kranenburg model cannot be used to predict the relationship between the erosion threshold and the aggregate diameter 6 comparison with the son and hsu model according to eqs 3 and 8 the son and hsu model can be written as follows 24 τ c ϕ s 2 3 ρ a ρ w ρ p ρ w 2 3 equation 24 is different from the proposed model eq 18 for the erosion threshold on base of the fractal aggregates fig 7 showed the experimental data of the erosion threshold expressed by the solid volume fraction the relationship between the compressive strength and the solid volume fraction of kaolinite aggregates was shown in fig 7a given by nasser and james 2006 the slopes of the regression lines in fig 7a were 5 78 6 58 6 81 7 08 6 07 and 6 66 respectively for a100 a130 a130 lmw c492 c496 and c446 the fractal dimensions of a100 a130 a130 lmw c492 c496 and c446 were 2 84 2 86 2 86 2 87 2 84 and 2 86 respectively mills et al 1991 employed polystyrene latex as a model aggregate and gave the compressive yield stress fig 7b the slopes of the regression lines in fig 7b were 1 34 and 1 35 respectively for freshly coagulated aggregates and extensively coagulated aggregates the fractal dimensions of both freshly coagulated aggregates and extensively coagulated aggregates were 2 40 predictions of the proposed model were compared with that of the son and hsu model in fig 7 the slopes of the regression lines in log log plane were not 2 3 in fig 7 the regression results showed that the experimental data deviated from the son and hsu model thus the son and hsu model cannot be used to predict the relationship between the erosion threshold and the aggregate effective density fig 8 showed the experimental data of the erosion threshold expressed by the aggregate effective density krone 1963 gave the erosion threshold characteristics for estuarial aggregates at different harbors in fig 8a the slopes of the regression lines in fig 8a were 2 85 1 89 2 78 and 2 02 respectively for the estuarial aggregates in san francisco wilmington district brunswick harbour and gulfport harbour the fractal dimensions of estuarial aggregates in san francisco wilmington district brunswick harbour and gulfport harbour were 2 69 2 55 2 68 and 2 56 respectively the critical erosion threshold in cohesive sediments was measured at 11 stations along the axis of the tamar estuary and at a single station in a tributary of the tamar at st john s ford and was shown in fig 8b bale et al 2006 2007 the slope of the regression line in fig 8b was 1 03 for the cohesive sediments at the tamar estuary and the st john s ford the fractal dimension of for the cohesive sediments was 2 26 comparisons between the proposed model and the son and hsu model were shown in fig 8 the slopes of the regression lines in log log plane were not 2 3 in fig 8 the predictions of the son and hsu model deviated from the experimental data in fig 8 the proposed model can be used to express the erosion threshold and the aggregate effective density 7 conclusions in this paper we proposed a fractal framework for the erosion threshold characteristics of cohesive soils and effort to relate the erosion threshold to the aggregate size the aggregate effective density and the solid volume fraction the proposed method can be used to predict the erosion threshold of cohesive soils with accuracy we also compared the proposed method with the kranenburg model and son and hsu model we found that both the kranenburg model and son and hsu model deviated from the experimental data of the erosion threshold of cohesive soils the kranenburg model cannot predict the relationship between the erosion threshold and the aggregate size the son and hsu model cannot predict the

23049,offshore wind turbines are influenced not only by environmental loads such as the wind and waves but also by various harmonic excitations and have always been considered as complex coupled vibration systems under operational conditions generally the proposed excitations and corresponding vibration sources have a direct relationship with the structural operational safety of the offshore wind turbine and can be reflected by the vibration responses nevertheless existing studies in this area mainly focus on understanding the effect of environmental excitations on the structural vibrations of offshore wind turbines and identifying the dynamic parameters the research on the identification of the vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution of offshore wind turbine structures based on the observation data have not yet been carried out therefore using the measured vibration responses of an offshore wind turbine prototype an identification technology based on optimized spectral kurtosis osk and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd methods which is capable of determining both the structural vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution was presented for the first time it can be demonstrated that the structural vibration sources changed from environmental excitations to forced harmonic loads when the rotating speed and power of the turbine increased at the same time the main vibration energy underwent a transformation from random vibration energy to harmonic vibration energy with a change in the operational factors furthermore it is suggested that the relationship between the rotating frequency and structural modal frequencies in the structural operational safety assessment of offshore wind turbines should be further investigated keywords offshore wind turbine field measurement vibration source identification vibration energy optimized spectral kurtosis ensemble empirical mode decomposition 1 introduction the offshore wind turbine structure has always been considered as a coupled system comprising a generator nacelle blades tower and foundation it primarily reflects the coupling vibration between the generator and support structures which include the tower and foundation because of the complex operational environment it may be induced concurrently through a variety of external dynamic excitations including the wind and waves which generate structural random vibrations in turn the operating generator may lead to various harmonic excitations and cause the wind turbine to vibrate periodically the excitation distribution of the offshore wind turbine structure under normal operational conditions is illustrated in fig 1 in practical engineering environmental excitations can usually be considered as stationary random excitations hansen et al 2006 however the harmonic excitations resulting from rotating blades and the operational excitations induced by the generator and electromagnetic equipment exhibit periodic time variant characteristics under normal operational conditions due to varying wind and rotor speed it is well known that the characteristics of excitation process which mainly leads to structural vibration may be reflected in the measured dynamic responses and the structural vibration mechanism can also be discussed and identified using an appropriate feedback analysis method understanding the structural vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution is also essential because they have a direct relationship with the structural operational safety of the offshore wind turbines however considering the complexity of the operational environment there may be obvious limitations in the simulation of structural vibrations using only theoretical and numerical methods therefore it is imperative to monitor the vibration responses of the entire wind turbine liu et al 2010 and focus on the technique used to identify the structural vibration sources and the corresponding energy based on the measured data due to slow development in offshore wind power there has been a wider implementation on structural monitoring of onshore wind turbines to obtain the structural vibration characteristics and modal parameters from measured data swartz swartz et al 2008 abstracted the acceleration and strain data of three wind turbines using a wireless sensor system and carried out a preliminary analysis on the structural modal parameters bassett bassettrupp and ting 2010 measured the acceleration of a 2 3 mw wind turbine to acquire the vibration characteristics using the wavelet decomposition method under startup and steady operational conditions adams adams et al 2011 established an identification method of operational excitations and structural damage comprising data acquisition a statistical model for discrimination feature extraction and operational evaluation he performed a sensitivity analysis of the structural model and vibration modes resulting from blade damage with the development of relevant techniques and methods more feedback studies on structural damage fatigue assessment and safety evaluation systems have been undertaken with the help of measured data in recent years benedetti benedetti et al 2011 carried out the damage identification and fatigue assessment of the tower based on measured dynamic strain data according to the correlation of the observed data yang yang et al 2013 proposed an effective structural monitoring technique and performed a safety evaluation of wind turbines under different operational conditions schlechtingen schlechtingen et al 2013 schlechtingen and santos 2014 studied a new adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system model to obtain different monitoring signals based on the supervisory control and data acquisition system scada in addition a supervised event server health monitoring system seshms was also established for application in structural health assessment of wind turbines using wireless sensors kilic and unluturk 2015 the earliest study on the structural dynamic information of the offshore wind turbines using measured vibration data was performed by g h james 1994 who successfully distinguished between the actual modal parameters of different 100 kw offshore wind turbines and the harmonic information using the next method recently häckell häckell and rofles 2013 used a 5 mw offshore wind turbine as an example and employed the data driven ssi and vector auto regressive methods to obtain the structural modal and operational condition parameters research on fatigue damage prediction yeter et al 2015 and reliability analysis dong and sang 2015 of offshore wind turbines based on dynamic simulation methods was also carried out to ensure structural operational safety hu hu et al 2015a 2015b focused on a resonance phenomenon to establish the environmental and operational influence on the structural dynamic properties of a 5 mw wind turbine system under normal operational conditions based on dynamic signals acquired from a tubular tower continuously for two years iliopoulos iliopoulos et al 2016 employed a modal decomposition and expansion algorithm in order to predict the unknown position responses of offshore wind turbine structures with limited measured data as previously mentioned few studies have been conducted on the vibration safety monitoring of the entire offshore wind turbine structures and the excitations that induce the structure to vibrate under the various operational conditions moreover the vibration mechanism of offshore wind turbine structures remains unclear therefore a method is hoped to be proposed to determine the structural vibration sources and demonstrate the energy distribution regularity of different vibration sources based on measured vibration responses this method mainly includes two key steps one is to decompose the original measured signals into simple component with a single frequency or frequency domain information the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method which was proposed by norden e huang was selected to achieve above purpose in this paper because it is effective to overcome the problem of the modal mixture phenomenon in the traditional empirical mode decomposition emd process wu and huang 2009 it was used to obtain the actual fluctuations or trends in different scales of the original measured signals based on the important statistical characteristics of noise and the scale separation principle of the emd method asr et al 2017 additionally compared with the wavelet method zhang et al 2016 the eemd method has better ability in processing non stationary signal and adaptive decomposition thus the number of decomposed signals can be determined according to the characteristics of the measured signals the other step is considered to identify harmonic or random characteristics of these decomposed signals thus to confirm the structural vibration source type and vibration energy distribution generally speaking the original spectral kurtosis sk theory can be used to complete the work vrabie et al 2003 however selecting the segments of the response signals has a major effect on the calculation accuracy of the spectral kurtosis method to reduce the influence resulted from the measured signal data length and the block division using the spectral kurtosis method a more novel approach called optimized spectral kurtosis osk dion et al 2012 was applied in this research to distinguish the harmonic and random information reflected in the measured data finally the above methods of osk and eemd were both utilized to determine the structural vibration sources and energy distribution in this research this paper consists of six sections including introduction and conclusions an overview of the project and the types of vibration sources of the offshore wind turbines under consideration are introduced in part 2 a combination theoretical method is proposed in part 3 to determine the types of vibration sources and evaluate the vibration energy distribution additionally an identification study on the vibration sources of offshore wind turbines under typical operational conditions that was carried out to explain the effectiveness of the proposed method is described in part 4 lastly in part 5 the main vibration sources and corresponding energy distribution of offshore wind turbines based on the measured responses are detailed systematically 2 project overview 2 1 project introduction and measurement arrangement the measured offshore wind turbine is located in the yellow sea adjacent to the jiangsu province of china a new foundation called the composite bucket foundation which can be installed by structural self weight and suction penetration lian et al 2011 was used as the experiment prototype the fan is a 2 5 mw direct drive generator with a rated speed of 18 rpm and a three bladed impeller having a diameter of 93 4 m wang et al 2018 the tower which has work platforms between the nacelle and upper tower or two adjacent towers was installed in three parts as shown in fig 2 five observation points were arranged inside the tower along its height taking the midpoint of each structural reciprocating motion as the reference point three vibration displacement sensors with the lowest frequency of 0 1 hz in each measured station were used to acquire the low frequency and multi directional structural dynamic signals further the responses of the reference point are always measured to be zero based on the test principle of the selected vibration displacement sensors the x and z directions are horizontal while the y direction is vertical moreover a stable measured time of 60 s with a sampling frequency of 200 hz was selected under each chosen operational condition in this field measurement dong et al 2014 the test instrument and sensors are illustrated in fig 3 in order to clearly illustrate the variation law of vibration sources for the offshore wind turbine structure measured data from more than seventy operational conditions was selected and divided into three regions to cover the entire power range namely the low power area 0 0 8 mw medium power area 0 8 1 7 mw and high power area 1 7 2 5 mw before the data analysis the original measured responses under these selected conditions were processed by noise reduction in order to ensure that the data is of good quality using various colours to represent the different levels of power the relationship between the measured wind speed rotating speed and power is shown in fig 4 the power shows a clear rising trend with the increase of wind speed and rotating speed it is also evident that there is a strictly positive correlation between the measured wind speed and rotating speed and this trend is in accordance with the characteristics of a direct drive wind turbine hence power will be selected as the referenced operational factor in this study owing to the similar changes in the wind speed and rotating speed 2 2 vibration source characteristics of offshore wind turbines 2 2 1 vibration source induced by environmental excitations the vibration mechanism of the wind turbine excited by environmental loads is divided into two categories on one hand the external persistent excitations always lead to structural random vibrations in the along wind direction while on the other hand the structure may exhibit across wind vibrations due to a change in the reynolds number when the wind flows around the tower in the former case the structural modal information can be obtained by the vibrational response of an offshore wind turbine in the low frequency range feyzollahzadeh et al 2016 based on the literature dong et al 2018 the first modal frequency of the measured wind turbine is expressed as follows 1 f 1 0 32 0 37 hz in the latter case the aerodynamic force induced by the flow of the wind around the tower has an evident relationship with the reynolds number re in the across wind vibration of the wind turbine structure raghavan and bernitsas 2011 it is possible that the flow around the tower may generate a stable vortex at a specific frequency and result in the vibration of a wind turbine in accordance with the corresponding vortex frequency detailed descriptions of the vortex phenomenon of the tower for different ranges of reynolds number are listed in table 1 generally a dimensionless parameter known as the strouhal number s r is used to describe the vortex shedding frequency deng et al 2011 as follows 2 s r n s d v where n s refers to the vortex shedding frequency d is the diameter of the wind turbine tower and v is the average wind speed in air the reynolds number re can be represented as follows 3 re ρ v d ν where ρ and ν represent the air density and dynamic viscosity coefficient with the values of 1 293 kg m3 and 1 46 10 5 m2 s respectively under standard conditions considering the example of the tower top which may reflect the across wind vibration easily and obviously the reynolds number corresponding to this part of the structure approaches the transcritical regime calculated using eq 3 when the wind speed reaches approximately 13 4 m s and the wind turbine tower may be influenced by periodic loads as described in fig 5 in addition it can be shown that the range of the wind speed which may induce vertex vibrations in the tower top of the wind turbine is approximately 13 4 14 6 m s in this measurement as the maximum measured wind speed is 14 6 m s the vertex vibration frequency can be computed by using eq 2 hence the wind induced vertex vibration frequency which can be considered as one potential excitation frequency for the tower top in the transcritical regime is obtained when the strouhal number is considered to be 0 3 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 4 f 2 1 37 1 49 hz 2 2 2 vibration source induced by operational excitations of the wind turbine the vibration source frequencies generated by operational excitations are closely related to specified rotating frequencies of the blades the reason is that the structural vibration is closely linked to the normal operation of the wind turbine as shown in fig 1 the operational and harmonic excitations affect the nacelle and tower respectively and always occur with equal excitation frequency at the same time hence these two loads can be collectively referred to as harmonic excitations in this study due to their shared harmonic characteristics the corresponding vibration frequencies can be expressed in the unified form as follows lian et al 2007 5 f 3 k n 60 hz where n is the range of the measured rotating speed 7 18 rpm and k 1 3 6 represents the multiples of the rotating frequency such as 1p 3p 6p therefore the frequency range of the vibration source is approximately 0 12 0 30 hz when k is considered to be 1 2 2 3 vibration source induced by electromagnetic excitations the electromagnetic excitation frequency of the offshore wind turbine under consideration can be initially identified as follows dion chevallieret al 2013 6 f 4 50 100 hz 3 theoretical methods and background 3 1 optimized spectral kurtosis osk kurtosis which reflects the distribution characteristic of vibration signals is traditionally defined as the normalised fourth order central moment of random variables accordingly spectral kurtosis sk can be considered as a set of kurtosis corresponding to each frequency component in the signal the kurtosis of a continuous random signal x t is given by 7 k x t x 4 p x d x σ 4 where x t is the random vibration response and x p x and σ are the average value probability density and standard deviation of x t respectively eq 7 can also be written in the discretisation form as follows 8 k 1 n i 1 n x i x σ t 4 where x i is the discrete vibration response n represents the sampling length of the response signals and σ t is the standard deviation of x i if the discrete fourier transform of the measured discrete random signals x t is defined as x f then the spectral kurtosis of x t can be correspondingly described as the kurtosis of the complex random variable x f in each frequency component f and calculated as follows vrabie et al 2003 9 s k f k 4 x f x f x f x f k 2 x f x f 2 x where x f x f x f x f is a complex conjugate form of x f and k r represents the r th order cumulant by considering x t as a stationary random process the conjugate components of the non zero cumulants of x f can be the same as the corresponding disconjugate components as the frequency domain x f can be represented by cyclical complex random variables in each frequency component f eq 9 can be rewritten as follows 10 s k f k 4 x f x f x f x f k 2 x f x f 2 x based on the cyclicity of the complex random variable the kurtosis value of each frequency component can be described in the form of expectation as follows 11 s k x f e x f 4 2 e x f 2 2 e x f 2 2 e x f 4 e x f 2 2 2 in practical applications the measured discrete data x t of length l is always divided into m non overlapping signal areas by determining a time window of a certain data length n in the time domain such that m n l subsequently the vibration signals in different time intervals can be obtained by moving the time window along the entire time axis the acquisition of the corresponding frequency spectra can also be achieved based on the independent discrete fourier transform x n f for n points of the segmented signals moreover the statistics of kurtosis values of the fourier spectra in different frequency bands provide a description of the spectral kurtosis for the entire measured vibration responses hence the unbiased estimator of the spectral kurtosis in the entire frequency domain of the discrete signal x t can be written as follows rosa and muñoz 2008 12 s k x f m m 1 m 1 i 1 m x n i f 4 i 1 m x n i f 2 2 2 in addition eq 12 can be represented in terms of the cumulants and moments as follows 13 s k x f c 4 x f s 2 x 2 f s 4 x f s 2 x 2 f 2 where c m x f and s m x f are the m th order cumulant and moment respectively of a large number of realisations m for the signal x t the spectral kurtosis of the above stationary stochastic processes may reflect the distribution characteristics of different vibration response signals however the mode of selection of the segments of the response signals has a major effect on the accuracy of calculation of the sk method more segments may lead to fewer signal data in each non overlapping area hence an inaccurate reflection of the vibration characteristics in the target frequency may probably occur because of enlarging frequency bandwidth after performing the discrete fourier transform whereas fewer non overlapping areas will result in poor accuracy of the kurtosis values due to insufficient circulation number of the spectral kurtosis consequently it is not easy to ensure a sufficient number of blocks and avoid inaccuracy in the sk method especially for the measured signals in a shorter sampling length hence a more effective realisation approach called optimized spectral kurtosis osk was proposed dion et al 2012 to reduce the influence of the calculation accuracy resulting from the length of the measured signal data and the block division using the sk method the main features of this method are as follows 1 the entire frequency domain of signal x t should be discretized into several frequency ranges appropriately using a narrow band bandpass filter based on the requirements of the measured data analysis so a number of filtered signals are obtained 14 x t i 1 n d i t where n is number of frequency ranges divided from the original signal x t d t is each divided signal in one frequency range 2 the kurtosis values of the vibration responses in each frequency range k i can be solved based on the basic definition of kurtosis 15 k i 1 m j 1 m d i d σ 4 where d is the discrete vibration response in one frequency range m represents the sampling length of the divided response d and σ is the mean value and standard deviation of d 3 the acquired kurtosis values in the entire frequency domain will be distributed to obtain the sk and the osk can also be described according to the calculated k i theoretically when the frequency range is narrower the calculated kurtosis values and the sk information are closer to the actual vibration characteristics of the signals the criteria of the osk which are applied to distinguish the random from the harmonic components in the vibration responses can be explained as follows dion et al 2012 steinwolf et al 2014 1 when s k x f 3 0 the signal x t does not contain the harmonic frequency components and the signals are only considered as random responses induced by environmental excitations 2 when s k x f 1 5 the signal x t contains the harmonic components with constant frequencies and amplitudes 3 2 eemd method and vibration energy extraction 3 2 1 eemd on the signal decomposition the procedure of the eemd method is described as follows wu and huang 2009 1 by assuming the original signal as x t a new composite signal y t can be obtained by adding a white noise signal ω t into the signal as follows 16 y t x t ω t 2 each corresponding intrinsic mode function imf c j and residual r n can be acquired after performing the emd on the new combined signal y t as follows 17 y t j 1 n c j t r n t where n is number of imfs 3 similarly the normal white noise ω i t can be added in different scales to x t and the above two steps can be repeated as follows 18 y i t x t ω i t 4 the emd can be performed on each new composite signal y i t and the imf component groups c i j t can be obtained as follows 19 y i t j 1 n c i j t r i n t 5 the average value of relevant imfs can be selected as the final imf c j t 20 c j t 1 m lim n i 1 n c i j t where m represents the overall average number in the eemd algorithm and n is the number of imfs when limited noise was added to the original signals in the eemd method the average value of each order components may be maintained within the normal range of the dynamic filter window this is because the added white noise signals can counterbalance each other after an overall averaging of the sufficient test number it is beneficial to significantly reduce the aliasing in the time frequency distribution of the signals resulting from the disturbances or interruptions in an indefinite form in the emd process by using and effectively retaining the dynamic characteristics of the signals hence each decomposed component will theoretically reflect clear and specific frequency domain characteristics based on the eemd method as this modified approach not only retains the signal decomposition ability of the emd method but also avoids the modal mixture phenomenon during the signal decomposition procedure 3 2 2 structural vibration energy extraction in this study it is assumed that the offshore wind turbine is a linear structural vibration system thus the corresponding structural vibration responses include the vibrations induced by the environmental excitations as well as the forced vibrations influenced by the harmonic excitations in addition certain noise disturbances interfere with the measured signals consequently the vibration responses of the offshore wind turbine can be denoted as follows dion chevallieret al 2013 21 v t v r t v h t v n t where v t is the total vibration response of the offshore wind turbine and v r t v h t and v n t represent the structural random vibration response induced by the environmental excitations harmonic vibration response induced by the harmonic excitations and noise component mixed in the measured response respectively the vibration responses v r t and v h t in different properties can denote the composite signals including various frequency components by considering the corresponding measured signal of each frequency as a stationary process with zero average value the entire vibration response of the wind turbine v t can also be written as the cumulative sum of several vibration responses of a single frequency with the noise measurement information as follows 22 v t i 1 n γ f i t ϕ i ω i t j 1 m ψ q j t φ j σ j t where γ and ψ are the structural random signal v r t and harmonic signal v h t respectively n and m are the frequency numbers contained in the random signal v r t and harmonic signal v h t respectively f i and q j represent the corresponding single frequency information of the vibrations in the two types of responses ϕ i and φ j express the phase angle corresponding to each frequency of the vibrations in the two types of responses and ω i t and σ j t are the noise components mixed in the random and harmonic vibration response signals respectively of each frequency the eemd method can be used to decompose the original measured signal v t owing to its ability of resisting the modal mixture phenomenon from each order component of the decomposition signals yeh and shieh 2010 based on a reasonable white noise scale added to the signal the standard deviation of the added white noise is always chosen as 0 2 times the standard deviation of the original vibration response wu and huang 2009 and a sufficient number of ensemble averages k k n m signals v r i t and v h j t which contain a definite single frequency information and noise can be obtained theoretically in the low frequency range each v r i t and v h j t may be considered to be a decomposed component of the random signal v r t and harmonic component v h t of the measured vibration signal respectively 23 v r i t γ f i t ϕ i ω i t γ i t ω i t and v h j t ψ q j t φ j σ j t ψ j t σ j t in eq 23 γ i t and ψ j t represent useful information of each signal in the low frequency component after the decomposition of the random signal v r t and harmonic signal v h t after the signal decomposition using the eemd method and the corresponding post processing procedure wu and huang 2009 the acquired standard imf components can be arrayed from high to low frequency and the signals can be denoted by different frequency scales contained in the original measured vibration response hence v r i t and v h j t in eq 23 should correspond with each order component obtained from the eemd method and the total vibration response v t of the offshore wind turbine can be determined based on the form of each order decomposed component as follows 24 v t l 1 k c l t r t where k is the number of included frequency components and the frequency range after signal decomposition c l t represents each order signal component and r t represents the remaining residual signal after performing the signal decomposition the vibration signal energy theory is introduced to further indicate the energy distribution characteristics of each order decomposed signal for the original measured signal of the wind turbine v t the total vibration energy contained in the response can be expressed as the time integral of the square of the signal amplitude as follows yu et al 2006 25 e v t 2 d t based on the measured discrete signal eq 25 can be written as follows 26 e s 1 n v s t 2 where s is the discrete data number of the signal v t s 1 2 n e is the total energy of the original signal and v s t is the data point of the corresponding signal based on eq 24 the vibration energy e l of the each order decomposed component c l t in the measured signal can be calculated as follows mingliang et al 2015 27 e l c l t 2 d t s 1 n c l s t 2 due to the orthogonality of the imf components after the signal decomposition an identically equal relationship should exist between each order signal energy and the total energy of the original signal as follows 28 e l 1 k e l 2 by defining the energy weight of each order signal component w l the energy distribution characteristics of the vibration signal of the offshore wind turbine structure in the different frequency domains can be written as follows 29 w l e l e 3 3 identification process of the vibration source and structural energy based on the theories previously introduced a method combining the osk with eemd method was proposed to accurately identify the vibration sources and energy distribution of the offshore wind turbine structure the corresponding implementation process is introduced and described in fig 6 firstly the measured response signals under the selected typical operational conditions are analysed by both spectral analysis and the osk method to determine the main frequency characteristics and properties of the corresponding vibration sources i e random and harmonic secondly after applying the eemd process to the original signals the kurtosis value of each order decomposed component is calculated to determine the random or harmonic vibration characteristics of each vibration response furthermore the type of vibration source and the vibration property of each decomposed signal can be confirmed by comparing the main frequency information of the decomposed signal with the excitation frequency of the potential vibration source mentioned in section 2 2 lastly the energy percentage of the various vibration sources in the measured vibration responses can be obtained by the energy calculation of each order decomposed signal at different frequencies and frequency domains by using the structural vibration energy extraction method 4 engineering verification of the proposed method 4 1 main vibration source identification in order to prove that the proposed method is suitable for the identification of structural vibration sources and energy distribution of the offshore wind turbine two typical conditions are selected and the operational parameters are displayed as follows 1 condition 1 wind speed 7 5 m s rotating speed 11 rpm and power 0 65 mw 2 condition 2 wind speed 11 3 m s rotating speed 18 rpm and power 2 4 mw based on the theories outlined in section 3 1 two composite diagrams comprising the time history frequency spectrum and spectral kurtosis of two measured signals are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 a that there are two types of main vibration frequencies present in the measured signal the first is the rotating frequency at 0 183 hz corresponding to the rotating speed of 11 rpm it reflects the harmonic vibration component with the corresponding kurtosis value at 1 79 close to 1 50 the second that can be considered as the first order structural modal frequency of 0 35 hz represents the random vibration component as its peak at 3 35 in spectral kurtosis is close to 3 0 hence the vibration response includes both the random and harmonic vibration characteristics under operational condition 1 moreover the conclusion that the rotating blades have an apparent influence on the vibration of the wind turbine structure can be verified in fig 7 b as the main frequency only remains stable at 0 30 hz which is consistent with the rotating frequency in operational condition 2 at the same time it can be shown that the frequency of 0 30 hz in the measured response reflects the steady harmonic vibration due to the kurtosis value of 1 68 which corresponds to the apparent downward spikes of the main vibration frequency and is close to 1 50 the main vibration source can be considered to be due to the harmonic excitations resulting from the operating blades 4 2 structural vibration source and energy identification to determine the main vibration source of the above signals the measured responses under two typical conditions were decomposed using the eemd method to obtain information about the decomposed vibration of different frequencies or frequency domains the frequency spectra and kurtosis values of each order signal are illustrated in fig 8 and the main frequencies frequency properties and energy proportions of the decomposed signals are listed in table 2 so that the structural vibration source of the offshore wind turbine and the corresponding energy can be specifically identified it can be seen from fig 8 that the each order signal decomposed by the eemd method retains clearer information of the frequency moreover the wind turbine structure vibrates at a low frequency because the decomposed signals of the 7th to 9th order with a range less than 1 hz reflect the maximum vibration energy in the frequency spectra furthermore the signal property harmonic or random of each order imf is defined by calculating the osk value of the decomposed measured response therefore the energy proportion of different vibration sources contained in the structural responses can be summed up based on the corresponding energy weight obtained from the signals with the same vibration property specifically the original response signal under the above conditions can be represented by the 9 imfs obtained by the decomposition of the measured response because the sum of the energy proportions is equal to 98 72 and 98 22 i e both are close to 100 0 considering the example of condition 1 the 7th and 9th order signal components demonstrate the harmonic vibration characteristics as the kurtosis values of the relevant decomposed signals approach 1 50 moreover it is extremely probable that the vibration in two of the cases mentioned above results from the operating blades because the main frequencies of the 7th and 9th order signal components are consistent with the 1p frequency of 0 183 hz and the 3p frequency of 0 55 hz however the 8th order signal should reflect the random vibration property induced by the environmental excitations as its kurtosis value is close to 3 00 further the main frequency of the decomposed response is similar to the first order modal frequency at 0 35 hz hence the main energy proportion induced by the harmonic and random vibration sources may be computed to be 68 30 and 23 63 respectively based on the same principle the energy proportion of the harmonic and random vibration sources under condition 2 are obtained as 89 54 and 0 39 respectively 5 vibration source identification and influence on the offshore wind turbine 5 1 vibration source identification of the offshore wind turbine based on the various conditions mentioned in section 2 1 the identification process of the structural vibration sources reflected in the signals was carried out by using the combined method proposed in section 3 and the frequency distributions of the corresponding vibration sources are listed in table 3 based on the frequencies of the theoretical vibration sources calculated in section 2 2 the vibration sources of the offshore wind turbine mainly include the environmental and harmonic excitations according to the frequency properties of the vibration responses the two vibration sources can also be called random and harmonic in particular the frequencies in the range of 0 16 hz to 0 30 hz can be identified as the rotating frequencies 1p frequencies resulting from the harmonic excitations correspondingly the rotating blades of the wind turbine may induce 3p frequencies such as 0 41 hz to 0 60 hz and 0 79 hz to 0 93 hz at the same time the identified frequency ranges of 0 32 hz to 0 37 hz 1 32 hz to 1 35 hz and 2 51 hz to 2 57 hz reflect the three orders of the modal frequencies of the wind turbine resulting from the continuous influence of environmental excitations moreover the very few frequencies from 1 37 hz to 1 49 hz may be considered as the frequencies produced by the wind induced vertex vibration under higher wind speed conditions 5 2 influences on the main vibration source induced by operational factors the frequency distribution of the main vibration sources with the variation of power at measured point 1 is shown in fig 9 and the statistical frequency distribution of the main vibration sources at different measured points in the various power ranges is shown in fig 10 the component of the harmonic frequency obtained by the osk method is represented by the solid points in the two images whereas the open points provide information about the structural modal frequency of the offshore wind turbine as shown in fig 8 the rotating frequency indicates a clear increasing trend with the change of power shown as black solid blocks and solid lines which represent the distribution of the rotating frequencies and its fitting curve the red solid and open circles represent the information about the modal characteristics and harmonic frequencies respectively the frequencies of the main vibration sources are obtained from the vibration source analysis using the osk method under different power conditions initially the first order modal frequency can be considered as the main vibration source frequency in the low power range and the frequencies gradually change from the modal frequency to the rotating frequency with an increase in the rotating speed and power the vibration source frequency does not completely transform into the rotating frequency until the power reaches its rated power as shown in fig 10 a the main vibration source of the wind turbine are the environmental excitations because only one prominent frequency peak can be found in the frequency range of 0 33 hz to 0 36 hz at 5 measured points this is because the slower rotating speeds have a weak influence on the structural vibration even though there is one inconspicuous frequency peak at 0 21 hz at 1 measured point this result agrees with the first order modal frequency of the offshore wind turbine structure in a low power range it should be noted that some of the main frequencies in the range of 0 16 hz to 0 28 hz and 0 41 hz to 0 55 hz which reflect deterministic harmonic properties have also been obtained at various observed stations and maintain a close relationship with the rotating frequencies and corresponding frequency multiplications of the wind turbine with an increase of power the influence of the harmonic excitations on the vibration of the wind turbine gradually increases based on the apparent distribution peak of the main vibration source frequency in the range of 0 23 hz to 0 28 hz which is close to the harmonic frequencies induced by the rotating blades under the middle power conditions however harmonic excitations are not the only source of structural vibration as another frequency peak can be observed in the range of 0 33 hz to 0 34 hz shown in fig 10 b which is close to the first order modal frequency of the offshore wind turbine it can be seen that the structural vibration energy of the wind turbine results from external environmental as well as harmonic excitations when the power exceeds 1 7 mw there is only one frequency peak near 0 29 hz in the main frequency distribution of the structural vibration which is approximately similar to the rotating frequency at 0 30 hz under the rated operational condition as described in fig 10 c however the occurrence of frequency at 0 33 hz which reflects the first order modal frequency of the wind turbine decreases significantly hence it can be inferred that the harmonic excitation caused by the rotating blades becomes the main vibration source of the wind turbine and an increase in the power has an apparent influence on the structural vibration however the effect due to the environmental excitations is found to be negligible in summary with the increase in power the variation law of the main vibration source is followed from the single environmental excitation to the mixed excitations combining the environment with harmonic loads and eventually leading completely to the operational harmonic excitations correspondingly the structural vibration of the offshore wind turbine changes from the vibration with the structural modal frequency resulting from the environmental excitations under the low power conditions to the mixed vibration induced by both the environmental and harmonic excitations under the medium power conditions and lastly to the pure forced vibrations under high power conditions 5 3 vibration source variation with a change of operational factors the vibration energy of the two main structural vibration sources at the measured point 1 under 26 typical conditions was studied to explain the basic regularity of the variation in the different vibration source energies due to an increase in the power as shown in fig 11 the black and red rectangles represent the proportions of the harmonic and random vibration sources respectively in the vibration energy they constitute most of the vibration energy with an energy proportion close to 1 0 at full power the blue circle depicts the proportion of other structural vibration sources at less than 10 in the vibration energy it is indicated that the proportion of the vibration energy induced by the environmental excitations decreases gradually in the low or medium power range whereas the harmonic vibration energy of the structure shows an apparent increasing trend in particular most of the vibration energy is dominated by the structural vibrations resulting from the rotating blades when the power exceeds 1 5 mw in the case of the other structural vibration sources the average value of the proportion of the vibration energy in the first power range ave1 i e a range less than 1 2 mw which includes both random and harmonic vibration energies is recorded at 6 32 and is greater than that in the second power range ave2 i e a higher power range which mostly includes the harmonic energy that is recorded at 4 48 this shows that the harmonic excitations resulting from the rotating blades have a more effective influence on the structural vibration compared with the environmental excitations the proportions of various structural vibration sources constituting the vibration energy at different measurement points of the offshore wind turbine are illustrated in fig 12 a black square red circle and blue triangle are used to represent the proportions of the random and harmonic vibration sources of the structural vibration energy at 1 2 and 4 measured points respectively the black red and blue solid lines indicate the corresponding change in the proportion symbols of the vibration energy due to a change in the power it can be seen from fig 12 that the variation law of the proportions of vibration energy induced by the two main vibration sources namely the environmental and harmonic excitations remains broadly consistent over the full power range of the offshore wind turbine under different operational conditions overall it is seen that the proportion of the harmonic energy rises with an increase in the power at each measured point however the structural random vibration energy associated with the environmental excitations indicates an apparent downward trend with a change in the same operational factor the reason for the above trend can be summarised as follows when the wind turbine operates in the lower power range less than 0 5 mw the slower rotating speed may result in a limited influence of the harmonic excitations on the structure thus the vibration of the wind turbine structure is induced primarily by the environmental excitations and the structural modal information is reflected in the measured responses with an increase in power the influence of the operating blades on the structure begins to gradually increase and must be considered at this stage the random vibrations resulting from the environmental loads as well as the periodic forced vibrations induced by the harmonic excitations are evident the proportions of the two main vibration sources are in equilibrium in the power range of 0 5 to 1 2 mw as shown in fig 12 as the power continues to increase and exceeds 1 2 mw the harmonic excitations become the main structural vibration source the influence of environmental excitations on the structure is negligible as their relevant proportion in the vibration energy is minor and close to zero 5 4 vibration source variation with a change of measured positions the distribution of the energy proportion of the two main vibration sources at various measured points for varying power is shown in fig 13 under the typical operating conditions mentioned in section 5 3 different colours represent the energy proportion of the main vibration sources at each measured point under the operational conditions of the full power range the red colour represents higher energy whereas the blue colour represents lower energy the same regularity in the variations of energy of the harmonic and random vibration sources which was proposed in section 5 3 is further verified three power conditions viz 0 2 mw 0 9 mw and 2 3 mw represented by the red dotted lines at a b and c respectively are selected to illustrate the variation in the various vibration sources with the change in the measured position as shown in figs 14 16 the energy proportions of four vibration sources namely harmonic vibration source hvs random vibration source rvs electromagnetic vibration source evs and other vibration sources ovs were identified and examined at the measured points 1 2 and 4 at the operational conditions of 0 2 mw and 2 3 mw more than ninety percent of the structural vibration energy is dominated by the random vibration source induced by the environmental excitations and the harmonic vibration source resulting from the rotating blades of the wind turbine respectively at a lower measured point the energy proportions of both the main vibration sources at the above two conditions reflect a slow increase with a variation in the energy proportion from 92 0 to 98 1 and 95 0 to 96 3 however the harmonic energy proportion at 0 2 mw and the random energy proportion at 2 3 mw show a small change in the trend i e from 6 10 to 1 20 and 0 30 to 3 10 respectively hence it is indicated that a variation in the position of the measured point has a minor influence on the proportion of the vibration energy of the two main vibration sources in both the low and high power ranges when the power of the wind turbine reaches 0 9 mw in the middle power range the environmental and harmonic excitations have a simultaneous influence on the offshore wind turbine structure the effect of the harmonic excitations on the wind turbine gradually decrease based on the corresponding energy proportion decreasing from 79 1 at the measured point 1 at the top of the tower to 40 3 at the measured point 4 at the bottom of the tower it can be explained that the harmonic vibration source induced by the rotating blades has a predominant influence on the vibration of the upper structure in the operational process however minor effects caused by the same vibration source are found on the bottom structure due to the greater distance between the generator and the measured point the variation in the position of the measured point also results in an apparent increase in the energy proportion of the random vibration along with an increase in the relevant parameter from 12 9 to 58 0 the electromagnetic and other vibration sources may be considered as weak vibration sources compared to the harmonic and random vibration sources as the corresponding vibration energy is less than 10 of the total energy in the full power range 5 5 harmonic vibration source variation with a change of operational factors the harmonic excitations resulting from the operational wind turbine can be further divided into the 1p harmonic excitation in the rotating frequency and multiple harmonics that are typically considered as the 3p harmonic excitations in order to examine the properties of the 1p and 3p harmonic vibration source energies the total harmonic energy is further decomposed and the changing trend of the 1p and 3p harmonic vibration sources with a variation in the measured wind speed is shown in fig 17 the black blocks and red circles represent the 1p and 3p harmonic energy proportions respectively and the measured power and theoretical power curves are represented by the blue cross line and blue solid line respectively it can be seen from fig 17 that the energy proportion of the 1p harmonic vibration source represented by the black blocks increases rapidly with a change in the operational wind speed and reaches a balanced state close to 1 when the operational factor equals the rated wind speed however the added power does not result in a significant regular variation in the energy proportion of the 3p harmonic vibration source represented by the red circles which exhibits lower values five measured conditions marked a to e are selected for analysis to further explain the above mentioned energy variation property the energy proportions corresponding to the various vibration sources are listed in table 4 it is seen that the wind speed reaches the cut in speed of 3 0 m s under condition a as shown in fig 17 and the slow rotating speed has a weak influence on the wind turbine hence the main vibration source is the environmental excitations with an energy proportion of 96 12 and the 1p and 3p harmonic energies constitute only 0 97 and 0 11 respectively of the main vibration source when the wind speed increases to 6 6 m s at the stable operational condition b the proportion of the harmonic vibration energy which includes the 1p and 3p harmonic energy proportions at 34 28 and 0 44 respectively clearly surpasses the same parameter of the random vibration source at the increased rotating speed although the energy proportion of the harmonic frequency multiplication excitation has increased compared to the conditions at the low wind speed the energy gap between the 1p and 3p widens further in addition the offshore wind turbine may also operate under the rated condition when the wind speed reaches 11 7 m s condition c which is close to the rated wind speed of 12 5 m s and 22 0 m s condition d close to the cut out wind speed of 25 0 m s the 1p harmonic energies of 96 80 and 98 58 under the two conditions stated above resulting from the rotating blades constitute nearly all of the structural vibration energy therefore the 3p harmonic energies of 0 24 and 0 12 can be ignored thus the main vibration source of the wind turbine may be considered to be the 1p harmonic excitation under a high rotating speed whereas the 3p harmonic excitation has only a weak effect on the structure lastly a typhoon condition known as haikui with a wind speed of more than 26 0 m s is considered as condition e the offshore wind turbine is affected only by the environmental excitations resulting from the typhoon and the vibration energy due to the harmonic vibration source no longer exists based on the above research it is suggested that additional attention may be given to the relationship between the rotating frequency and the first order modal frequency during the operational safety evaluation of the wind turbine this is because the influence of the 1p harmonic excitation on the offshore wind turbine structure clearly reflects an intense trend with the increase of operational factors due to the limited effects of multiple frequency harmonics on the operational structure the safety standard between the 3p harmonic frequency and modal frequency can be appropriately increased to provide the wind turbine with a wider safety frequency domain range between the 1p frequency and modal frequency therefore this study on the 1p and 3p harmonic vibration sources allows the engineers to strengthen the stiffness of the entire wind turbine and ensures that the first modal frequency is far from the rotating frequency this approach will not result in a negative influence on the operational safety stability and offers a theoretical basis for the optimisation design on a new rigid foundation structure of an offshore wind turbine 6 conclusions based on a combination of osk and eemd methods the variation law of main structural vibration source and the corresponding vibration energy of the offshore wind turbines was studied systematically under various operational conditions subsequently five principal conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the main vibration sources of offshore wind turbines are of two types namely environmental excitations which induce the structure to vibrate at the modal frequency and harmonic excitations which result from the rotating blades and reflect the periodic forced vibrations 2 with an increase in power the main structural vibration source changes from single environmental excitations to harmonic excitations that are induced by the operating generator 3 the variation law of vibration energy proportion induced by the two main vibration sources remains broadly consistent in the full power range of the offshore wind turbine under different operational factors overall the harmonic energy proportion resulting from the rotating blades increases with an increase in power at each measured point however the structural vibration energy associated with the environmental excitations indicates an apparent downward trend when the operational factor changes 4 harmonic excitations have an important effect on the upper structure of offshore wind turbines because the relevant vibration energy proportion decreases gradually with a decrease in the position of the measured point however the structural random vibration energy increases under the same condition 5 the harmonic excitations in the rotating frequency 1p frequency have a significant influence on the structural vibration of offshore wind turbines considering an apparent increasing trend with a change of the operational factor however using an accurate decomposition of the harmonic vibration source energy the vibration energy induced by the 3p frequency is found to be insignificant hence it is suggested that the relationship between the 1p harmonic frequency and structural modal frequencies should receive more attention in the operational safety assessment of offshore wind turbine structures acknowledgements the authors would like to

23049,offshore wind turbines are influenced not only by environmental loads such as the wind and waves but also by various harmonic excitations and have always been considered as complex coupled vibration systems under operational conditions generally the proposed excitations and corresponding vibration sources have a direct relationship with the structural operational safety of the offshore wind turbine and can be reflected by the vibration responses nevertheless existing studies in this area mainly focus on understanding the effect of environmental excitations on the structural vibrations of offshore wind turbines and identifying the dynamic parameters the research on the identification of the vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution of offshore wind turbine structures based on the observation data have not yet been carried out therefore using the measured vibration responses of an offshore wind turbine prototype an identification technology based on optimized spectral kurtosis osk and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd methods which is capable of determining both the structural vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution was presented for the first time it can be demonstrated that the structural vibration sources changed from environmental excitations to forced harmonic loads when the rotating speed and power of the turbine increased at the same time the main vibration energy underwent a transformation from random vibration energy to harmonic vibration energy with a change in the operational factors furthermore it is suggested that the relationship between the rotating frequency and structural modal frequencies in the structural operational safety assessment of offshore wind turbines should be further investigated keywords offshore wind turbine field measurement vibration source identification vibration energy optimized spectral kurtosis ensemble empirical mode decomposition 1 introduction the offshore wind turbine structure has always been considered as a coupled system comprising a generator nacelle blades tower and foundation it primarily reflects the coupling vibration between the generator and support structures which include the tower and foundation because of the complex operational environment it may be induced concurrently through a variety of external dynamic excitations including the wind and waves which generate structural random vibrations in turn the operating generator may lead to various harmonic excitations and cause the wind turbine to vibrate periodically the excitation distribution of the offshore wind turbine structure under normal operational conditions is illustrated in fig 1 in practical engineering environmental excitations can usually be considered as stationary random excitations hansen et al 2006 however the harmonic excitations resulting from rotating blades and the operational excitations induced by the generator and electromagnetic equipment exhibit periodic time variant characteristics under normal operational conditions due to varying wind and rotor speed it is well known that the characteristics of excitation process which mainly leads to structural vibration may be reflected in the measured dynamic responses and the structural vibration mechanism can also be discussed and identified using an appropriate feedback analysis method understanding the structural vibration sources and the corresponding energy distribution is also essential because they have a direct relationship with the structural operational safety of the offshore wind turbines however considering the complexity of the operational environment there may be obvious limitations in the simulation of structural vibrations using only theoretical and numerical methods therefore it is imperative to monitor the vibration responses of the entire wind turbine liu et al 2010 and focus on the technique used to identify the structural vibration sources and the corresponding energy based on the measured data due to slow development in offshore wind power there has been a wider implementation on structural monitoring of onshore wind turbines to obtain the structural vibration characteristics and modal parameters from measured data swartz swartz et al 2008 abstracted the acceleration and strain data of three wind turbines using a

turbine system under normal operational conditions based on dynamic signals acquired from a tubular tower continuously for two years iliopoulos iliopoulos et al 2016 employed a modal decomposition and expansion algorithm in order to predict the unknown position responses of offshore wind turbine structures with limited measured data as previously mentioned few studies have been conducted on the vibration safety monitoring of the entire offshore wind turbine structures and the excitations that induce the structure to vibrate under the various operational conditions moreover the vibration mechanism of offshore wind turbine structures remains unclear therefore a method is hoped to be proposed to determine the structural vibration sources and demonstrate the energy distribution regularity of different vibration sources based on measured vibration responses this method mainly includes two key steps one is to decompose the original measured signals into simple component with a single frequency or frequency domain information the ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd method which was proposed by norden e huang was selected to achieve above purpose in this paper because it is effective to overcome the problem of the modal mixture phenomenon in the traditional empirical mode decomposition emd process wu and huang 2009 it was used to obtain the actual fluctuations or trends in different scales of the original measured signals based on the important statistical characteristics of noise and the scale separation principle of the emd method asr et al 2017 additionally compared with the wavelet method zhang et al 2016 the eemd method has better ability in processing non stationary signal and adaptive decomposition thus the number of decomposed signals can be determined according to the characteristics of the measured signals the other step is considered to identify harmonic or random characteristics of these decomposed signals thus to confirm the structural vibration source type and vibration energy distribution generally speaking the original spectral kurtosis sk theory can be used to complete the work vrabie et al 2003 however selecting the segments of the response signals has a major effect on the calculation accuracy of the spectral kurtosis method to reduce the influence resulted from the measured signal data length and the block division using the spectral kurtosis method a more novel approach called optimized spectral kurtosis osk dion et al 2012 was applied in this research to distinguish the harmonic and random information reflected in the measured data finally the above methods of osk and eemd were both utilized to determine the structural vibration sources and energy distribution in this research this paper consists of six sections including introduction and conclusions an overview of the project and the types of vibration sources of the offshore wind turbines under consideration are introduced in part 2 a combination theoretical method is proposed in part 3 to determine the types of vibration sources and evaluate the vibration energy distribution additionally an identification study on the vibration sources of offshore wind turbines under typical operational conditions that was carried out to explain the effectiveness of the proposed method is described in part 4 lastly in part 5 the main vibration sources and corresponding energy distribution of offshore wind turbines based on the measured responses are detailed systematically 2 project overview 2 1 project introduction and measurement arrangement the measured offshore wind turbine is located in the yellow sea adjacent to the jiangsu province of china a new foundation called the composite bucket foundation which can be installed by structural self weight and suction penetration lian et al 2011 was used as the experiment prototype the fan is a 2 5 mw direct drive generator with a rated speed of 18 rpm and a three bladed impeller having a diameter of 93 4 m wang et al 2018 the tower which has work platforms between the nacelle and upper tower or two adjacent towers was installed in three parts as shown in fig 2 five observation points were arranged inside the tower along its height taking the midpoint of each structural reciprocating motion as the reference point three vibration displacement sensors with the lowest frequency of 0 1 hz in each measured station were used to acquire the low frequency and multi directional structural dynamic signals further the responses of the reference point are always measured to be zero based on the test principle of the selected vibration displacement sensors the x and z directions are horizontal while the y direction is vertical moreover a stable measured time of 60 s with a sampling frequency of 200 hz was selected under each chosen operational condition in this field measurement dong et al 2014 the test instrument and sensors are illustrated in fig 3 in order to clearly illustrate the variation law of vibration sources for the offshore wind turbine structure measured data from more than seventy operational conditions was selected and divided into three regions to cover the entire power range namely the low power area 0 0 8 mw medium power area 0 8 1 7 mw and high power area 1 7 2 5 mw before the data analysis the original measured responses under these selected conditions were processed by noise reduction in order to ensure that the data is of good quality using various colours to represent the different levels of power the relationship between the measured wind speed rotating speed and power is shown in fig 4 the power shows a clear rising trend with the increase of wind speed and rotating speed it is also evident that there is a strictly positive correlation between the measured wind speed and rotating speed and this trend is in accordance with the characteristics of a direct drive wind turbine hence power will be selected as the referenced operational factor in this study owing to the similar changes in the wind speed and rotating speed 2 2 vibration source characteristics of offshore wind turbines 2 2 1 vibration source induced by environmental excitations the vibration mechanism of the wind turbine excited by environmental loads is divided into two categories on one hand the external persistent excitations always lead to structural random vibrations in the along wind direction while on the other hand the structure may exhibit across wind vibrations due to a change in the reynolds number when the wind flows around the tower in the former case the structural modal information can be obtained by the vibrational response of an offshore wind turbine in the low frequency range feyzollahzadeh et al 2016 based on the literature dong et al 2018 the first modal frequency of the measured wind turbine is expressed as follows 1 f 1 0 32 0 37 hz in the latter case the aerodynamic force induced by the flow of the wind around the tower has an evident relationship with the reynolds number re in the across wind vibration of the wind turbine structure raghavan and bernitsas 2011 it is possible that the flow around the tower may generate a stable vortex at a specific frequency and result in the vibration of a wind turbine in accordance with the corresponding vortex frequency detailed descriptions of the vortex phenomenon of the tower for different ranges of reynolds number are listed in table 1 generally a dimensionless parameter known as the strouhal number s r is used to describe the vortex shedding frequency deng et al 2011 as follows 2 s r n s d v where n s refers to the vortex shedding frequency d is the diameter of the wind turbine tower and v is the average wind speed in air the reynolds number re can be represented as follows 3 re ρ v d ν where ρ and ν represent the air density and dynamic viscosity coefficient with the values of 1 293 kg m3 and 1 46 10 5 m2 s respectively under standard conditions considering the example of the tower top which may reflect the across wind vibration easily and obviously the reynolds number corresponding to this part of the structure approaches the transcritical regime calculated using eq 3 when the wind speed reaches approximately 13 4 m s and the wind turbine tower may be influenced by periodic loads as described in fig 5 in addition it can be shown that the range of the wind speed which may induce vertex vibrations in the tower top of the wind turbine is approximately 13 4 14 6 m s in this measurement as the maximum measured wind speed is 14 6 m s the vertex vibration frequency can be computed by using eq 2 hence the wind induced vertex vibration frequency which can be considered as one potential excitation frequency for the tower top in the transcritical regime is obtained when the strouhal number is considered to be 0 3 raghavan and bernitsas 2011 4 f 2 1 37 1 49 hz 2 2 2 vibration source induced by operational excitations of the wind turbine the vibration source frequencies generated by operational excitations are closely related to specified rotating frequencies of the blades the reason is that the structural vibration is closely linked to the normal operation of the wind turbine as shown in fig 1 the operational and harmonic excitations affect the nacelle and tower respectively and always occur with equal excitation frequency at the same time hence these two loads can be collectively referred to as harmonic excitations in this study due to their shared harmonic characteristics the corresponding vibration frequencies can be expressed in the unified form as follows lian et al 2007 5 f 3 k n 60 hz where n is the range of the measured rotating speed 7 18 rpm and k 1 3 6 represents the multiples of the rotating frequency such as 1p 3p 6p therefore the frequency range of the vibration source is approximately 0 12 0 30 hz when k is considered to be 1 2 2 3 vibration source induced by electromagnetic excitations the electromagnetic excitation frequency of the offshore wind turbine under consideration can be initially identified as follows dion chevallieret al 2013 6 f 4 50 100 hz 3 theoretical methods and background 3 1 optimized spectral kurtosis osk kurtosis which reflects the distribution characteristic of vibration signals is traditionally defined as the normalised fourth order central moment of random variables accordingly spectral kurtosis sk can be considered as a set of kurtosis corresponding to each frequency component in the signal the kurtosis of a continuous random signal x t is given by 7 k x t x 4 p x d x σ 4 where x t is the random vibration response and x p x and σ are the average value probability density and standard deviation of x t respectively eq 7 can also be written in the discretisation form as follows 8 k 1 n i 1 n x i x σ t 4 where x i is the discrete vibration response n represents the sampling length of the response signals and σ t is the standard deviation of x i if the discrete fourier transform of the measured discrete random signals x t is defined as x f then the spectral kurtosis of x t can be correspondingly described as the kurtosis of the complex random variable x f in each frequency component f and calculated as follows vrabie et al 2003 9 s k f k 4 x f x f x f x f k 2 x f x f 2 x where x f x f x f x f is a complex conjugate form of x f and k r represents the r th order cumulant by considering x t as a stationary random process the conjugate components of the non zero cumulants of x f can be the same as the corresponding disconjugate components as the frequency domain x f can be represented by cyclical complex random variables in each frequency component f eq 9 can be rewritten as follows 10 s k f k 4 x f x f x f x f k 2 x f x f 2 x based on the cyclicity of the complex random variable the kurtosis value of each frequency component can be described in the form of expectation as follows 11 s k x f e x f 4 2 e x f 2 2 e x f 2 2 e x f 4 e x f 2 2 2 in practical applications the measured discrete data x t of length l is always divided into m non overlapping signal areas by determining a time window of a certain data length n in the time domain such that m n l subsequently the vibration signals in different time intervals can be obtained by moving the time window along the entire time axis the acquisition of the corresponding frequency spectra can also be achieved based on the independent discrete fourier transform x n f for n points of the segmented signals moreover the statistics of kurtosis values of the fourier spectra in different frequency bands provide a description of the spectral kurtosis for the entire measured vibration responses hence the unbiased estimator of the spectral kurtosis in the entire frequency domain of the discrete signal x t can be written as follows rosa and muñoz 2008 12 s k x f m m 1 m 1 i 1 m x n i f 4 i 1 m x n i f 2 2 2 in addition eq 12 can be represented in terms of the cumulants and moments as follows 13 s k x f c 4 x f s 2 x 2 f s 4 x f s 2 x 2 f 2 where c m x f and s m x f are the m th order cumulant and moment respectively of a large number of realisations m for the signal x t the spectral kurtosis of the above stationary stochastic processes may reflect the distribution characteristics of different vibration response signals however the mode of selection of the segments of the response signals has a major effect on the accuracy of calculation of the sk method more segments may lead to fewer signal data in each non overlapping area hence an inaccurate reflection of the vibration characteristics in the target frequency may probably occur because of enlarging frequency bandwidth after performing the discrete fourier transform whereas fewer non overlapping areas will result in poor accuracy of the kurtosis values due to insufficient circulation number of the spectral kurtosis consequently it is not easy to ensure a sufficient number of blocks and avoid inaccuracy in the sk method especially for the measured signals in a shorter sampling length hence a more effective realisation approach called optimized spectral kurtosis osk was proposed dion et al 2012 to reduce the influence of the calculation accuracy resulting from the length of the measured signal data and the block division using the sk method the main features of this method are as follows 1 the entire frequency domain of signal x t should be discretized into several frequency ranges appropriately using a narrow band bandpass filter based on the requirements of the measured data analysis so a number of filtered signals are obtained 14 x t i 1 n d i t where n is number of frequency ranges divided from the original signal x t d t is each divided signal in one frequency range 2 the kurtosis values of the vibration responses in each frequency range k i can be solved based on the basic definition of kurtosis 15 k i 1 m j 1 m d i d σ 4 where d is the discrete vibration response in one frequency range m represents the sampling length of the divided response d and σ is the mean value and standard deviation of d 3 the acquired kurtosis values in the entire frequency domain will be distributed to obtain the sk and the osk can also be described according to the calculated k i theoretically when the frequency range is narrower the calculated kurtosis values and the sk information are closer to the actual vibration characteristics of the signals the criteria of the osk which are applied to distinguish the random from the harmonic components in the vibration responses can be explained as follows dion et al 2012 steinwolf et al 2014 1 when s k x f 3 0 the signal x t does not contain the harmonic frequency components and the signals are only considered as random responses induced by environmental excitations 2 when s k x f 1 5 the signal x t contains the harmonic components with constant frequencies and amplitudes 3 2 eemd method and vibration energy extraction 3 2 1 eemd on the signal decomposition the procedure of the eemd method is described as follows wu and huang 2009 1 by assuming the original signal as x t a new composite signal y t can be obtained by adding a white noise signal ω t into the signal as follows 16 y t x t ω t 2 each corresponding intrinsic mode function imf c j and residual r n can be acquired after performing the emd on the new combined signal y t as follows 17 y t j 1 n c j t r n t where n is number of imfs 3 similarly the normal white noise ω i t can be added in different scales to x t and the above two steps can be repeated as follows 18 y i t x t ω i t 4 the emd can be performed on each new composite signal y i t and the imf component groups c i j t can be obtained as follows 19 y i t j 1 n c i j t r i n t 5 the average value of relevant imfs can be selected as the final imf c j t 20 c j t 1 m lim n i 1 n c i j t where m represents the overall average number in the eemd algorithm and n is the number of imfs when limited noise was added to the original signals in the eemd method the average value of each order components may be maintained within the normal range of the dynamic filter window this is because the added white noise signals can counterbalance each other after an overall averaging of the sufficient test number it is beneficial to significantly reduce the aliasing in the time frequency distribution of the signals resulting from the disturbances or interruptions in an indefinite form in the emd process by using and effectively retaining the dynamic characteristics of the signals hence each decomposed component will theoretically reflect clear and specific frequency domain characteristics based on the eemd method as this modified approach not only retains the signal decomposition ability of the emd method but also avoids the modal mixture phenomenon during the signal decomposition procedure 3 2 2 structural vibration energy extraction in this study it is assumed that the offshore wind turbine is a linear structural vibration system thus the corresponding structural vibration responses include the vibrations induced by the environmental excitations as well as the forced vibrations influenced by the harmonic excitations in addition certain noise disturbances interfere with the measured signals consequently the vibration responses of the offshore wind turbine can be denoted as follows dion chevallieret al 2013 21 v t v r t v h t v n t where v t is the total vibration response of the offshore wind turbine and v r t v h t and v n t represent the structural random vibration response induced by the environmental excitations harmonic vibration response induced by the harmonic excitations and noise component mixed in the measured response respectively the vibration responses v r t and v h t in different properties can denote the composite signals including various frequency components by considering the corresponding measured signal of each frequency as a stationary process with zero average value the entire vibration response of the wind turbine v t can also be written as the cumulative sum of several vibration responses of a single frequency with the noise measurement information as follows 22 v t i 1 n γ f i t ϕ i ω i t j 1 m ψ q j t φ j σ j t where γ and ψ are the structural random signal v r t and harmonic signal v h t respectively n and m are the frequency numbers contained in the random signal v r t and harmonic signal v h t respectively f i and q j represent the corresponding single frequency information of the vibrations in the two types of responses ϕ i and φ j express the phase angle corresponding to each frequency of the vibrations in the two types of responses and ω i t and σ j t are the noise components mixed in the random and harmonic vibration response signals respectively of each frequency the eemd method can be used to decompose the original measured signal v t owing to its ability of resisting the modal mixture phenomenon from each order component of the decomposition signals yeh and shieh 2010 based on a reasonable white noise scale added to the signal the standard deviation of the added white noise is always chosen as 0 2 times the standard deviation of the original vibration response wu and huang 2009 and a sufficient number of ensemble averages k k n m signals v r i t and v h j t which contain a definite single frequency information and noise can be obtained theoretically in the low frequency range each v r i t and v h j t may be considered to be a decomposed component of the random signal v r t and harmonic component v h t of the measured vibration signal respectively 23 v r i t γ f i t ϕ i ω i t γ i t ω i t and v h j t ψ q j t φ j σ j t ψ j t σ j t in eq 23 γ i t and ψ j t represent useful information of each signal in the low frequency component after the decomposition of the random signal v r t and harmonic signal v h t after the signal decomposition using the eemd method and the corresponding post processing procedure wu and huang 2009 the acquired standard imf components can be arrayed from high to low frequency and the signals can be denoted by different frequency scales contained in the original measured vibration response hence v r i t and v h j t in eq 23 should correspond with each order component obtained from the eemd method and the total vibration response v t of the offshore wind turbine can be determined based on the form of each order decomposed component as follows 24 v t l 1 k c l t r t where k is the number of included frequency components and the frequency range after signal decomposition c l t represents each order signal component and r t represents the remaining residual signal after performing the signal decomposition the vibration signal energy theory is introduced to further indicate the energy distribution characteristics of each order decomposed signal for the original measured signal of the wind turbine v t the total vibration energy contained in the response can be expressed as the time integral of the square of the signal amplitude as follows yu et al 2006 25 e v t 2 d t based on the measured discrete signal eq 25 can be written as follows 26 e s 1 n v s t 2 where s is the discrete data number of the signal v t s 1 2 n e is the total energy of the original signal and v s t is the data point of the corresponding signal based on eq 24 the vibration energy e l of the each order decomposed component c l t in the measured signal can be calculated as follows mingliang et al 2015 27 e l c l t 2 d t s 1 n c l s t 2 due to the orthogonality of the imf components after the signal decomposition an identically equal relationship should exist between each order signal energy and the total energy of the original signal as follows 28 e l 1 k e l 2 by defining the energy weight of each order signal component w l the energy distribution characteristics of the vibration signal of the offshore wind turbine structure in the different frequency domains can be written as follows 29 w l e l e 3 3 identification process of the vibration source and structural energy based on the theories previously introduced a method combining the osk with eemd method was proposed to accurately identify the vibration sources and energy distribution of the offshore wind turbine structure the corresponding implementation process is introduced and described in fig 6 firstly the measured response signals under the selected typical operational conditions are analysed by both spectral analysis and the osk method to determine the main frequency characteristics and properties of the corresponding vibration sources i e random and harmonic secondly after applying the eemd process to the original signals the kurtosis value of each order decomposed component is calculated to determine the random or harmonic vibration characteristics of each vibration response furthermore the type of vibration source and the vibration property of each decomposed signal can be confirmed by comparing the main frequency information of the decomposed signal with the excitation frequency of the potential vibration source mentioned in section 2 2 lastly the energy percentage of the various vibration sources in the measured vibration responses can be obtained by the energy calculation of each order decomposed signal at different frequencies and frequency domains by using the structural vibration energy extraction method 4 engineering verification of the proposed method 4 1 main vibration source identification in order to prove that the proposed method is suitable for the identification of structural vibration sources and energy distribution of the offshore wind turbine two typical conditions are selected and the operational parameters are displayed as follows 1 condition 1 wind speed 7 5 m s rotating speed 11 rpm and power 0 65 mw 2 condition 2 wind speed 11 3 m s rotating speed 18 rpm and power 2 4 mw based on the theories outlined in section 3 1 two composite diagrams comprising the time history frequency spectrum and spectral kurtosis of two measured signals are shown in fig 7 it can be seen from fig 7 a that there are two types of main vibration frequencies present in the measured signal the first is the rotating frequency at 0 183 hz corresponding to the rotating speed of 11 rpm it reflects the harmonic vibration component with the corresponding kurtosis value at 1 79 close to 1 50 the second that can be considered as the first order structural modal frequency of 0 35 hz represents the random vibration component as its peak at 3 35 in spectral kurtosis is close to 3 0 hence the vibration response includes both the random and harmonic vibration characteristics under operational condition 1 moreover the conclusion that the rotating blades have an apparent influence on the vibration of the wind turbine structure can be verified in fig 7 b as the main frequency only remains stable at 0 30 hz which is consistent with the rotating frequency in operational condition 2 at the same time it can be shown that the frequency of 0 30 hz in the measured response reflects the steady harmonic vibration due to the kurtosis value of 1 68 which corresponds to the apparent downward spikes of the main vibration frequency and is close to 1 50 the main vibration source can be considered to be due to the harmonic excitations resulting from the operating blades 4 2 structural vibration source and energy identification to determine the main vibration source of the above signals the measured responses under two typical conditions were decomposed using the eemd method to obtain information about the decomposed vibration of different frequencies or frequency domains the frequency spectra and kurtosis values of each order signal are illustrated in fig 8 and the main frequencies frequency properties and energy proportions of the decomposed signals are listed in table 2 so that the structural vibration source of the offshore wind turbine and the corresponding energy can be specifically identified it can be seen from fig 8 that the each order signal decomposed by the eemd method retains clearer information of the frequency moreover the wind turbine structure vibrates at a low frequency because the decomposed signals of the 7th to 9th order with a range less than 1 hz reflect the maximum vibration energy in the frequency spectra furthermore the signal property harmonic or random of each order imf is defined by calculating the osk value of the decomposed measured response therefore the energy proportion of different vibration sources contained in the structural responses can be summed up based on the corresponding energy weight obtained from the signals with the same vibration property specifically the original response signal under the above conditions can be represented by the 9 imfs obtained by the decomposition of the measured response because the sum of the energy proportions is equal to 98 72 and 98 22 i e both are close to 100 0 considering the example of condition 1 the 7th and 9th order signal components demonstrate the harmonic vibration characteristics as the kurtosis values of the relevant decomposed signals approach 1 50 moreover it is extremely probable that the vibration in two of the cases mentioned above results from the operating blades because the main frequencies of the 7th and 9th order signal components are consistent with the 1p frequency of 0 183 hz and the 3p frequency of 0 55 hz however the 8th order signal should reflect the random vibration property induced by the environmental excitations as its kurtosis value is close to 3 00 further the main frequency of the decomposed response is similar to the first order modal frequency at 0 35 hz hence the main energy proportion induced by the harmonic and random vibration sources may be computed to be 68 30 and 23 63 respectively based on the same principle the energy proportion of the harmonic and random vibration sources under condition 2 are obtained as 89 54 and 0 39 respectively 5 vibration source identification and influence on the offshore wind turbine 5 1 vibration source identification of the offshore wind turbine based on the various conditions mentioned in section 2 1 the identification process of the structural vibration sources reflected in the signals was carried out by using the combined method proposed in section 3 and the frequency distributions of the corresponding vibration sources are listed in table 3 based on the frequencies of the theoretical vibration sources calculated in section 2 2 the vibration sources of the offshore wind turbine mainly include the environmental and harmonic excitations according to the frequency properties of the vibration responses the two vibration sources can also be called random and harmonic in particular the frequencies in the range of 0 16 hz to 0 30 hz can be identified as the rotating frequencies 1p frequencies resulting from the harmonic excitations correspondingly the rotating blades of the wind turbine may induce 3p frequencies such as 0 41 hz to 0 60 hz and 0 79 hz to 0 93 hz at the same time the identified frequency ranges of 0 32 hz to 0 37 hz 1 32 hz to 1 35 hz and 2 51 hz to 2 57 hz reflect the three orders of the modal frequencies of the wind turbine resulting from the continuous influence of environmental excitations moreover the very few frequencies from 1 37 hz to 1 49 hz may be considered as the frequencies produced by the wind induced vertex vibration under higher wind speed conditions 5 2 influences on the main vibration source induced by operational factors the frequency distribution of the main vibration sources with the variation of power at measured point 1 is shown in fig 9 and the statistical frequency distribution of the main vibration sources at different measured points in the various power ranges is shown in fig 10 the component of the harmonic frequency obtained by the osk method is represented by the solid points in the two images whereas the open points provide information about the structural modal frequency of the offshore wind turbine as shown in fig 8 the rotating frequency indicates a clear increasing trend with the change of power shown as black solid blocks and solid lines which represent the distribution of the rotating frequencies and its fitting curve the red solid and open circles represent the information about the modal characteristics and harmonic frequencies respectively the frequencies of the main vibration sources are obtained from the vibration source analysis using the osk method under different power conditions initially the first order modal frequency can be considered as the main vibration source frequency in the low power range and the frequencies gradually change from the modal frequency to the rotating frequency with an increase in the rotating speed and power the vibration source frequency does not completely transform into the rotating frequency until the power reaches its rated power as shown in fig 10 a the main vibration source of the wind turbine are the environmental excitations because only one prominent frequency peak can be found in the frequency range of 0 33 hz to 0 36 hz at 5 measured points this is because the slower rotating speeds have a weak influence on the structural vibration even though there is one inconspicuous frequency peak at 0 21 hz at 1 measured point this result agrees with the first order modal frequency of the offshore wind turbine structure in a low power range it should be noted that some of the main frequencies in the range of 0 16 hz to 0 28 hz and 0 41 hz to 0 55 hz which reflect deterministic harmonic properties have also been obtained at various observed stations and maintain a close relationship with the rotating frequencies and corresponding frequency multiplications of the wind turbine with an increase of power the influence of the harmonic excitations on the vibration of the wind turbine gradually increases based on the apparent distribution peak of the main vibration source frequency in the range of 0 23 hz to 0 28 hz which is close to the harmonic frequencies induced by the rotating blades under the middle power conditions however harmonic excitations are not the only source of structural vibration as another frequency peak can be observed in the range of 0 33 hz to 0 34 hz shown in fig 10 b which is close to the first order modal frequency of the offshore wind turbine it can be seen that the structural vibration energy of the wind turbine results from external environmental as well as harmonic excitations when the power exceeds 1 7 mw there is only one frequency peak near 0 29 hz in the main frequency distribution of the structural vibration which is approximately similar to the rotating frequency at 0 30 hz under the rated operational condition as described in fig 10 c however the occurrence of frequency at 0 33 hz which reflects the first order modal frequency of the wind turbine decreases significantly hence it can be inferred that the harmonic excitation caused by the rotating blades becomes the main vibration source of the wind turbine and an increase in the power has an apparent influence on the structural vibration however the effect due to the environmental excitations is found to be negligible in summary with the increase in power the variation law of the main vibration source is followed from the single environmental excitation to the mixed excitations combining the environment with harmonic loads and eventually leading completely to the operational harmonic excitations correspondingly the structural vibration of the offshore wind turbine changes from the vibration with the structural modal frequency resulting from the environmental excitations under the low power conditions to the mixed vibration induced by both the environmental and harmonic excitations under the medium power conditions and lastly to the pure forced vibrations under high power conditions 5 3 vibration source variation with a change of operational factors the vibration energy of the two main structural vibration sources at the measured point 1 under 26 typical conditions was studied to explain the basic regularity of the variation in the different vibration source energies due to an increase in the power as shown in fig 11 the black and red rectangles represent the proportions of the harmonic and random vibration sources respectively in the vibration energy they constitute most of the vibration energy with an energy proportion close to 1 0 at full power the blue circle depicts the proportion of other structural vibration sources at less than 10 in the vibration energy it is indicated that the proportion of the vibration energy induced by the environmental excitations decreases gradually in the low or medium power range whereas the harmonic vibration energy of the structure shows an apparent increasing trend in particular most of the vibration energy is dominated by the structural vibrations resulting from the rotating blades when the power exceeds 1 5 mw in the case of the other structural vibration sources the average value of the proportion of the vibration energy in the first power range ave1 i e a range less than 1 2 mw which includes both random and harmonic vibration energies is recorded at 6 32 and is greater than that in the second power range ave2 i e a higher power range which mostly includes the harmonic energy that is recorded at 4 48 this shows that the harmonic excitations resulting from the rotating blades have a more effective influence on the structural vibration compared with the environmental excitations the proportions of various structural vibration sources constituting the vibration energy at different measurement points of the offshore wind turbine are illustrated in fig 12 a black square red circle and blue triangle are used to represent the proportions of the random and harmonic vibration sources of the structural vibration energy at 1 2 and 4 measured points respectively the black red and blue solid lines indicate the corresponding change in the proportion symbols of the vibration energy due to a change in the power it can be seen from fig 12 that the variation law of the proportions of vibration energy induced by the two main vibration sources namely the environmental and harmonic excitations remains broadly consistent over the full power range of the offshore wind turbine under different operational conditions overall it is seen that the proportion of the harmonic energy rises with an increase in the power at each measured point however the structural random vibration energy associated with the environmental excitations indicates an apparent downward trend with a change in the same operational factor the reason for the above trend can be summarised as follows when the wind turbine operates in the lower power range less than 0 5 mw the slower rotating speed may result in a limited influence of the harmonic excitations on the structure thus the vibration of the wind turbine structure is induced primarily by the environmental excitations and the structural modal information is reflected in the measured responses with an increase in power the influence of the operating blades on the structure begins to gradually increase and must be considered at this stage the random vibrations resulting from the environmental loads as well as the periodic forced vibrations induced by the harmonic excitations are evident the proportions of the two main vibration sources are in equilibrium in the power range of 0 5 to 1 2 mw as shown in fig 12 as the power continues to increase and exceeds 1 2 mw the harmonic excitations become the main structural vibration source the influence of environmental excitations on the structure is negligible as their relevant proportion in the vibration energy is minor and close to zero 5 4 vibration source variation with a change of measured positions the distribution of the energy proportion of the two main vibration sources at various measured points for varying power is shown in fig 13 under the typical operating conditions mentioned in section 5 3 different colours represent the energy proportion of the main vibration sources at each measured point under the operational conditions of the full power range the red colour represents higher energy whereas the blue colour represents lower energy the same regularity in the variations of energy of the harmonic and random vibration sources which was proposed in section 5 3 is further verified three power conditions viz 0 2 mw 0 9 mw and 2 3 mw represented by the red dotted lines at a b and c respectively are selected to illustrate the variation in the various vibration sources with the change in the measured position as shown in figs 14 16 the energy proportions of four vibration sources namely harmonic vibration source hvs random vibration source rvs electromagnetic vibration source evs and other vibration sources ovs were identified and examined at the measured points 1 2 and 4 at the operational conditions of 0 2 mw and 2 3 mw more than ninety percent of the structural vibration energy is dominated by the random vibration source induced by the environmental excitations and the harmonic vibration source resulting from the rotating blades of the wind turbine respectively at a lower measured point the energy proportions of both the main vibration sources at the above two conditions reflect a slow increase with a variation in the energy proportion from 92 0 to 98 1 and 95 0 to 96 3 however the harmonic energy proportion at 0 2 mw and the random energy proportion at 2 3 mw show a small change in the trend i e from 6 10 to 1 20 and 0 30 to 3 10 respectively hence it is indicated that a variation in the position of the measured point has a minor influence on the proportion of the vibration energy of the two main vibration sources in both the low and high power ranges when the power of the wind turbine reaches 0 9 mw in the middle power range the environmental and harmonic excitations have a simultaneous influence on the offshore wind turbine structure the effect of the harmonic excitations on the wind turbine gradually decrease based on the corresponding energy proportion decreasing from 79 1 at the measured point 1 at the top of the tower to 40 3 at the measured point 4 at the bottom of the tower it can be explained that the harmonic vibration source induced by the rotating blades has a predominant influence on the vibration of the upper structure in the operational process however minor effects caused by the same vibration source are found on the bottom structure due to the greater distance between the generator and the measured point the variation in the position of the measured point also results in an apparent increase in the energy proportion of the random vibration along with an increase in the relevant parameter from 12 9 to 58 0 the electromagnetic and other vibration sources may be considered as weak vibration sources compared to the harmonic and random vibration sources as the corresponding vibration energy is less than 10 of the total energy in the full power range 5 5 harmonic vibration source variation with a change of operational factors the harmonic excitations resulting from the operational wind turbine can be further divided into the 1p harmonic excitation in the rotating frequency and multiple harmonics that are typically considered as the 3p harmonic excitations in order to examine the properties of the 1p and 3p harmonic vibration source energies the total harmonic energy is further decomposed and the changing trend of the 1p and 3p harmonic vibration sources with a variation in the measured wind speed is shown in fig 17 the black blocks and red circles represent the 1p and 3p harmonic energy proportions respectively and the measured power and theoretical power curves are represented by the blue cross line and blue solid line respectively it can be seen from fig 17 that the energy proportion of the 1p harmonic vibration source represented by the black blocks increases rapidly with a change in the operational wind speed and reaches a balanced state close to 1 when the operational factor equals the rated wind speed however the added power does not result in a significant regular variation in the energy proportion of the 3p harmonic vibration source represented by the red circles which exhibits lower values five measured conditions marked a to e are selected for analysis to further explain the above mentioned energy variation property the energy proportions corresponding to the various vibration sources are listed in table 4 it is seen that the wind speed reaches the cut in speed of 3 0 m s under condition a as shown in fig 17 and the slow rotating speed has a weak influence on the wind turbine hence the main vibration source is the environmental excitations with an energy proportion of 96 12 and the 1p and 3p harmonic energies constitute only 0 97 and 0 11 respectively of the main vibration source when the wind speed increases to 6 6 m s at the stable operational condition b the proportion of the harmonic vibration energy which includes the 1p and 3p harmonic energy proportions at 34 28 and 0 44 respectively clearly surpasses the same parameter of the random vibration source at the increased rotating speed although the energy proportion of the harmonic frequency multiplication excitation has increased compared to the conditions at the low wind speed the energy gap between the 1p and 3p widens further in addition the offshore wind turbine may also operate under the rated condition when the wind speed reaches 11 7 m s condition c which is close to the rated wind speed of 12 5 m s and 22 0 m s condition d close to the cut out wind speed of 25 0 m s the 1p harmonic energies of 96 80 and 98 58 under the two conditions stated above resulting from the rotating blades constitute nearly all of the structural vibration energy therefore the 3p harmonic energies of 0 24 and 0 12 can be ignored thus the main vibration source of the wind turbine may be considered to be the 1p harmonic excitation under a high rotating speed whereas the 3p harmonic excitation has only a weak effect on the structure lastly a typhoon condition known as haikui with a wind speed of more than 26 0 m s is considered as condition e the offshore wind turbine is affected only by the environmental excitations resulting from the typhoon and the vibration energy due to the harmonic vibration source no longer exists based on the above research it is suggested that additional attention may be given to the relationship between the rotating frequency and the first order modal frequency during the operational safety evaluation of the wind turbine this is because the influence of the 1p harmonic excitation on the offshore wind turbine structure clearly reflects an intense trend with the increase of operational factors due to the limited effects of multiple frequency harmonics on the operational structure the safety standard between the 3p harmonic frequency and modal frequency can be appropriately increased to provide the wind turbine with a wider safety frequency domain range between the 1p frequency and modal frequency therefore this study on the 1p and 3p harmonic vibration sources allows the engineers to strengthen the stiffness of the entire wind turbine and ensures that the first modal frequency is far from the rotating frequency this approach will not result in a negative influence on the operational safety stability and offers a theoretical basis for the optimisation design on a new rigid foundation structure of an offshore wind turbine 6 conclusions based on a combination of osk and eemd methods the variation law of main structural vibration source and the corresponding vibration energy of the offshore wind turbines was studied systematically under various operational conditions subsequently five principal conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the main vibration sources of offshore wind turbines are of two types namely environmental excitations which induce the structure to vibrate at the modal frequency and harmonic excitations which result from the rotating blades and reflect the periodic forced vibrations 2 with an increase in power the main structural vibration source changes from single environmental excitations to harmonic excitations that are induced by the operating generator 3 the variation law of vibration energy proportion induced by the two main vibration sources remains broadly consistent in the full power range of the offshore wind turbine under different operational factors overall the harmonic energy proportion resulting from the rotating blades increases with an increase in power at each measured point however the structural vibration energy associated with the environmental excitations indicates an apparent downward trend when the operational factor changes 4 harmonic excitations have an important effect on the upper structure of offshore wind turbines because the relevant vibration energy proportion decreases gradually with a decrease in the position of the measured point however the structural random vibration energy increases under the same condition 5 the harmonic excitations in the rotating frequency 1p frequency have a significant influence on the structural vibration of offshore wind turbines considering an apparent increasing trend with a change of the operational factor however using an accurate decomposition of the harmonic vibration source energy the vibration energy induced by the 3p frequency is found to be insignificant hence it is suggested that the relationship between the 1p harmonic frequency and structural modal frequencies should receive more attention in the operational safety assessment of offshore wind turbine structures acknowledgements the authors would like to
