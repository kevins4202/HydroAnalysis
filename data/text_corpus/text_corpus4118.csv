20590,mooring lines are widely used to connect offshore platforms to anchors embedded in the seabed the configuration of the inverse catenary formed by mooring lines influences the installation of the anchors the load capacity and the anchors failure mode for this reason a proper understanding of the soil chain interaction is a requirement for an accurate prediction of the configuration of the inverse catenary this paper presents the main results of a laboratory investigation program carried out on a scale reduced model to study the interaction mechanism between clay and the steel chain of different diameters lengths and stiffness some aspects related to the inverse catenary and tension distribution such as the shaft and base resistances adhesion and bearing capacity factors effective width in sliding strain softening and displacement at the maximum load were extensively discussed herein comparisons between these results and the background experimental data used to support general engineering practice have been made for the different aspects investigated the chain geometry stiffness direction of chain displacement and soil properties influence the behavior of the measured curves and consequently the corresponding soil chain interaction from a practical point of view the results presented are beneficial for understanding the chain soil interaction and show an explicit potential to contribute to the optimization of the offshore foundation engineering involving inverse catenary design problems keywords model tests mooring lines clay soil foundation soil chain

and the anchors embedded in the seabed oliveira 2009 a significant stretch of mooring lines embedded in marine soil assumes inverse catenary configuration either during the installation of the anchors or during the pre tensioning process due to the soil resistances therefore the load capacity required to stabilize platforms becomes the result not only of the soil anchor interaction but also of the mooring chain soil interaction conceptually the frictional resistances generated during the chain soil interaction contribute to the reduction of the force applied to the anchor degenkamp and dutta 1989 neubecker and randolph 1995a in addition the inverse catenary induced by normal soil resistance affects the embedment capacity and the anchor s failure mode neubecker and randolph 1995a nie and zimmerman 2010 most literature contributions addressing the chain soil interaction fall in the categories of i analytical and numerical integration methods ii laboratory studies and iii numerical studies by finite element methods the pioneers of the first category reese 1973 gault and cox 1974 vivatrat et al 1982 degenkamp and dutta 1989 neubecker and randolph 1995a and wang et al 2010 proposed and thus explained different methods based on the equilibrium equations of forces acting in the embedded chain after these pioneering works investigations were undertaken to properly understand the chain soil interaction neubecker and randolph 1995b 1996 zhang et al 2013 liu et al 2013 2014 and 2019 presented simplified expressions avoiding the numerical iteration process required in previous works laboratory studies include physical modeling using both reduced scale and centrifuge model tests considerable investigations have already been carried out in the related field of research amongst the significant contributions the works of degenkamp and dutta 1989 bang et al 1996 2000 and 2001 rocha 2014 lee et al 2014 rocha et al 2016 frankenmolen et al 2016 sampa 2015 2016 2019 are worthy of note recently a few numerical investigations by means of coupled eulerian lagrangian analysis have been developed by zhao and liu 2016 zhao et al 2016 dou and yu 2018 sun et al 2019 and others at a fundamental level there have been useful advances in the interaction mechanism of the chain in the soil however the mechanism is still not completely understood and many important questions remain unanswered such as i the magnitude of the chain displacement necessary to mobilize the maximum and the residual loads ii the influence of the strain softening behavior on the inverse catenary configuration and the load applied to the anchors and iii the influence of chain stiffness and the direction of forces applied to the interaction mechanisms of the chain in soft clay at its core as described by bergado and chai 1994 the mobilization process of the pullout resistance is rarely investigated however the correct interpretation of this process is important because some structures do not always work at a limit equilibrium condition thus the design of offshore foundations should be compatible with the deformation condition in other words it is not reasonable to directly apply the assumptions established in onshore practice to the offshore design of systems subject to large deformations liu et al 2019 also pointed out that the mooring line has a slender structure with a very large ratio of length to diameter moving in the seabed at a long distance requiring large deformation analyzes in the numerical simulation in large deformations the performance of structures embedded in soft clay is intrinsically related to its strain softening behavior in fact according to sun et al 2019 limited consideration has been given involving the strain softening effects on the shear strength and thus on soil resistance for the problem of the tensioning process of an embedded mooring line xiong et al 2017 also corroborate this previous statement saying that an explicit treatment of the soil softening with repeated loading has not yet been presented in the literature nevertheless current methods for assessing embedded chain behavior are based on static or quasi static analyses disregarding the dynamic effects specifically the cyclic nature of the load applied at the fairlead in addition sun et al 2019 argued that the assumption that the ultimate capacities normal and frictional resistances are fully mobilized simultaneously does not take account of the resistance reduction due to the strain softening effect of the soil since their values are generally calculated from the undisturbed soil strength chatterjee et al 2012 have discussed the influence of the strain softening behavior on the vertical penetration resistance of seabed pipeline zhou and randolph 2009 have considered the influence of the strain softening behavior on the resistance during repeated penetration and extraction of the penetrometers including t bar and ball penetrometer in soft clay complementary studies by xiao et al 2016 reported the influence of the strain softening behavior on the post cyclic capacity of shallow foundations whereas sun et al 2019 specifically addressed the effect of strain softening on the behavior of embedded mooring chains by numerical simulations as for purposefulness despite the important role played by mooring lines of offshore platforms their interaction mechanisms with the soil are not fully understood hence limiting the confidence on the analytical and numerical studies that require the use of appropriate parameters estimated through experimental studies an overview of the previous works demonstrates that further experimental investigations are required to precisely describe the interaction mechanisms between chain and soil and to estimate the parameters necessary for analytical and numerical modeling in this paper we outline the results of a detailed experimental program and the discussion of the fundamental aspects related to the interaction mechanisms adhesion factor bearing capacity factors effective width in sliding strain softening and the magnitude of the chain displacements required to mobilize the maximum pullout force in order to corroborate previous studies this paper also presents different dimensionless relations for direct applications in practice the issues discussed here are essential and can be useful for the design of offshore foundations and numerical and analytical modeling hence the primary goal of the work reported herein is to extend the theoretical approach related to the studies previously developed by rocha 2014 sampa 2015 2019 and rocha et al 2016 at the federal university of rio grande do sul 2 experimental investigation 2 1 experimental setup and chain installation the laboratory model tests were conducted in two testing apparatus described by sampa 2019 a schematic view of the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 showing an acrylic chamber with internal dimensions of l 1 52 m w 0 24 m h 0 80 m the loading frame was devised to allow careful load application on steel chains and metal tubes which are embedded in the soil in predefined positions during sample preparation these metal elements are then connected to a pullout device through a thin steel cable allowing to perform both vertical and horizontal pullout tests under static conditions three steel configurations corresponding to i free non welded studless chains fc ii welded studless chains wc and iii metal tubes mt embedded in saturated clay and tested under tension were investigated in order to obtain the welded studless chains the links of the free studless chains were constrained through the welding process of gas metal arc welding the nominal diameters of both chains configurations are 3 mm 4 mm and 5 mm because of the acrylic chamber dimension the length of welded chains varies from 100 to 500 mm while the length of free chains varies from 50 to 500 mm the chain with a nominal diameter of 3 mm is similar in scale 1 40 to those used by petrobras as mooring lines in offshore operations in addition to chains 100 mm 300 mm and 500 mm long metal tubes having an outside diameter of 25 55 mm were used for comparison because their circular cross sectional area simplifies interpretation and allows direct comparisons with pile foundations the testing preparation for vertical pullout tests follows three main steps i positioning and tensioning six vertical chains inside an empty acrylic tank with the chains spaced 225 mm apart along the length of the tank to avoid any influence during the subsequent load application on the steel chain ii mixing the slurry and carefully filling the tank with soil up to 720 mm and iii relieving the tension on the chains and assuming the equilibrium condition inside the soil before testing the preparation of horizontal pullout tests is similar except for the procedure adopted for positioning the chains inside the acrylic chamber the chamber is initially filled with slurry to a pre established height in which two chains are laid horizontally and tensioned through a steel wire welded to the first link before re start filling with slurry to the final height of the sample chains were embedded in four different depths corresponding to 0 60 m 0 45 m 0 30 m and 0 15 m immediately after the sample preparation a water constant head of 50 mm was placed above the soil surface to keep the water content constant the slurry was then set to rest for 24 h before starting the test during this period there was neither self weight consolidation nor monitoring of the chains settlement there was no drainage at the bottom of the acrylic chamber 2 2 sample preparation and characterization the slurry used in all of the tests was reconstituted from a mix of 85 of kaolin 15 of sodium bentonite and tap water the air dried kaolin and bentonite powders were supplied by industrial manufacturers in brazil initially dry weights of kaolin and bentonite were measured in a precise weighing scale and mixed on a plastic receptacle until obtaining a uniform color of the mixture the mixture was then hydrated using tap water in a heavy duty slurry mixer for 20 min to attain a homogeneous sample at a water content of 120 1 12 wl finally the slurry was poured into the acrylic chamber considered to be of prime importance this process was repeated seven times due to the small capacity of the mixer in comparison to the large size of the acrylic chamber the profile of the undrained shear strength measured with a miniature vane apparatus at a rate of about 0 015 rpm 5 4 min presents a typical range from 0 75 kpa to 2 kpa showing a tendency to increase with depth and over thixotropic time thus characterizing thixotropic behavior even at a very short time after mixing the sensitivity of the clay varies slightly with depth with the mean and standard deviation corresponding to 1 85 and 0 14 respectively both compressibility and shearing strength are greatly affected by the interparticle forces as referred by lambe 1960 and sridharan et al 1971 representing the behavior of an ultrasoft plastic clay with low undrained shear strength and high plasticity and compressibility sampa 2019 presents a detailed pullout test procedure and physical chemical mechanical analysis of this slurry 3 results and discussion 3 1 maximum and residual loads typical laboratory model test results carried out to investigate the interaction mechanism are shown in fig 2 in which load displacement curves and their respective normalization illustrate both viscoelastic and strain softening behaviors for a more convenient analysis of the measured loads it was used two different approaches the first approach considers a linear regression analysis lra to calibrate the parameters through the relationship between the measured and estimated loads eq 1 the second approach given by eq 2 is an algebraic analysis deducted from dimensionless parameters of the buckingham theorem without the need for a statistical program 1 q m a x α d 0 l s u d z n c s u d 2 2 π 1 f π 2 constant q m a x s u d ² α l d n c where q m a x is the maximum load s u the undrained shear strength l the chain length d the effective chain diameter and α the soil adhesion parameters α α β π and n c 4 n c ζ π are mean adhesion factor and bearing capacity factor respectively where β and ζ are parameters that take into account the shape of the failure surface different from circular failure surface considering that the unit shear area and the base area depend on the effective chain diameter d fig 3 presents the relationship between the estimated and measured maximum loads obtained from the first approach for the second approach fig 4 illustrates the relationship between the dimensionless parameters q m a x s u d ² l d both figures show the best fit values of α and n c factors obtained from the respective experimental curves a good agreement can be seen in the comparison shown in fig 3 represented by points distributed around the ideal 1 1 line and confined inside a narrow prediction interval the high values of r2 shown in fig 4 corroborate the good agreement between the dimensionless parameters and highlights the good quality of the calibrated α and n c factors required to estimate the shaft and base resistances a comparison between the factors estimated from both approaches and the percentage of their differences have been outlined in table 1 for all tests table 1 shows α values lower than 1 and a small difference between the results of approaches 1 and 2 which leads to the conclusion that both approaches are suitable to estimate the shaft resistance this observation reflects the fact that the pullout of the chains totally embedded in the soil creates a mechanism of soil mobilization that is completely different from the one observed in piles driven in normally consolidated clay for pile foundations in normally consolidated clay dennis and olson 1983 api 2006 karlsrud et al 2005 presented slightly different relationships between α and undrained shear strength but all expressions indicate α values approaching unity in very soft clays the comparison between α values of free and welded chains helps understating the shear mechanisms free chains show higher α values 0 81 that are attributed to their flexibility and tendency to accommodate the irregular shape of a chain laid in the soil before the start of the test as a consequence of this accommodation when a free chain is displaced the circumscribed diameter of the shear zone tends to be larger than the effective diameter resulting in larger shear areas and higher mobilized lateral resistances for larger displacements the circumscribed diameter gradually decreases to a constant diameter with the complete formation of the shear zone in contrast tests performed with vertical metal tubes vmt presented the lowest α values 0 40 as discussed by kraft et al 1981 and lemos and vaughan 2000 the shear resistance mobilized at the soil metal interface is usually lower than the internal resistance of the clay and for this reason lower α values should be expected in tests carried out with metal tubes it is therefore concluded that the configuration of the chain links impacts the α values of the chains depending on both the soil soil and the soil chain interactions the same assumptions and approaches previously made to estimate α at the corresponding maximum loads were used to determine the α r e s at the residual loads table 2 compares the mean values of the adhesion factor derived from the maximum and the residual loads showing α r e s values of free chains consistently lower than those obtained for welded chains note that α r e s follows an opposite trend from the one observed in α values at maximum load a possible explanation is that the length of the welded chains remains constant during a pullout test whereas in free chains the initial length is reduced slightly given to the relaxation of the chain when releasing the tension loads after soil preparation relaxation induces a re accommodation of the chain geometry to a shorter length which may explain the higher α r e s values of welded chains in both cases metal tubes have the lowest mobilized α r e s values when dividing α by α res we found that the ratio of the welded chains vwc 1 75 and hwc 1 63 is of the same order of magnitude as the clay sensitivity 1 85 but less than the ratios of the free chains vfc 2 53 and hfc 3 04 and metal tubes vmt 2 16 once the adhesion factor is determined the effective width in sliding ews can be derived according to eq 3 3 e w s q f d l s u α d d where q f is the lateral shaft resistance from this relationship it is shown that ews depends on the adhesion factor α α π β and the ratio between the effective d and nominal d chain diameters fig 5 illustrates the variation of ews with the normalized length and table 3 summarizes the mean values of ews ranging from 8 04 to 10 83 regardless of the test condition ews values tend to decrease with the increase of the nominal diameter d for a given effective chain diameter greater ews values are expected in chains with smaller nominal diameters a detailed discussion in respect to ews is reported in degenkamp and dutta 1989 the bearing capacity factor n c was investigated and a comparison between the average values from approaches 1 and 2 is shown in table 4 unlike approach 1 which considers the undrained shear strength mobilized along the shaft and at the base when estimating the maximum load approach 2 uses the same undrained shear strength to calculate both shaft and base resistances as a consequence of the simplification in approach 2 a significant difference was observed when comparing the results of vertically embedded chains conversely the difference between the results of the horizontally embedded chain is small since the undrained shear strength is constant in the horizontal plane the difference observed in vertical chains is insignificant in longer chains since the shaft resistance is a dominant part of the measured loads indicating the potential use of both approaches to separately estimate the base and the shaft resistances the results presented in table 4 show the influence of the stiffness and the embedment direction on the n c values and consequently on the base resistances for both free and welded chains the n c values of the vertically embedded chains vfc and vwc are lower than those of the horizontally embedded chains hfc and hwc the values related to the vertically embedded chains varied from 1 82 to 4 86 while the values of horizontally embedded chains ranged from 5 73 to 9 68 furthermore for both vertical and horizontal embedment directions n c values of free chains vfc and hfc are lower than those of the welded chains vwc and hwc respectively the discrepancy in the n c values related to the embedment direction is mainly due to the difference in the mobilization mechanism of the soil resistance the stress field mobilized in the tests with horizontal chains which approaches a cylindrical cavity expansion in front of the first link is distinct from the one that acts on a vertical chain that is represented by spherical cavity expansion sampa 2019 discussed in detail the influence of the embedment direction on the interaction mechanism of the chain in the soft clay soil for a better investigation of the evolution of the bearing capacity factor with the increase in displacement table 5 compares n c derived from the maximum load with n c r e s of the residual load even for large displacements the embedment direction still plays an important role in the mechanism of soil mobilization resulting in lower n c r e s values in vertically embedded chains when compared to horizontally embedded chains for all tested conditions the bearing capacity factors tend to increase with the increase of chain displacement indicating that the mobilized base area also increases with the increase of chain displacement these observations lead to the conclusion that the bearing capacity factor is influenced by the geometry of the embedded element chain or tube the displacement direction vertical or horizontal and the magnitude of the chain displacement a significant decrease in the ratio q b q m a x with increasing l d is shown in fig 6 and is described by eq 4 4 q b q m a x a l d b as previously introduced the influence of the base resistance q b on the measured load reduces non linearly as the chain length increases in longer chains lateral resistances are dominant and constitute the largest portion of the measured load for the same l d value and the embedment direction base resistances are more significant in welded chains than in free chains the ratio q b q m a x of the vwc is 2 57 times higher than the ratio of the vfc and the ratio q b q m a x of the hwc is 1 11 times higher than the ratio of the hfc for the same l d in addition an analysis of the residual condition was produced fig 7 for comparison with the analysis of the peak condition fig 7 shows a different behavior from the one observed in fig 6 for the same l d value and embedment direction the base resistances are more significant in free chains than in welded chains however the horizontally embedded chains still present the highest mobilized values of base resistances a direct comparison between these figures clearly shows the q b r e s q r e s ratio as being greater than q b q m a x ratio for the same l d q b r e s is the base resistance at the residual condition and q r e s is the total residual resistance based on experimental results we conclude that the base resistance is influenced by the geometry of the embedded element chain or tube the displacement direction vertical or horizontal and the magnitude of the chain displacement although the base resistance tends to increase with the increase of chain displacement the shaft resistances remain as the main portion of the measured load controlling the strain softening behavior discussed in the following item 3 2 strain softening an extensive and detailed discussion on the influence of strain softening behavior on the design of offshore foundations can be found in zhou and randolph 2009 chatterjee et al 2012 xiao et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 sun et al 2019 although the parameters related to the maximum and residual loads were estimated in the preceding discussion this section presents rather a detailed analysis of their relationship to quantify the strain softening behavior shown in fig 2 a non linear reduction of the q r e s q m a x ratio with increasing normalized length is shown in fig 8 and described by eq 5 5 q r e s q m a x a l d 1 b the behavior observed in these curves indicates a clear relationship between the strain softening and the degradation of the soil resistance along the chain length it is interesting to note that the q r e s q m a x ratio of the shorter chains tends to 0 95 in which there is practically no decrease of the measured load nevertheless for shorter chains the base resistance tends to be dominant and controls the interaction mechanism and the magnitude of the measured loads the influence of stiffness can be seen through the strain softening behavior of the clay a more intensive strain softening behavior occurs in free chains that are embedded within the soil accommodated and stretched during the first pullout loading stages producing an initially stiffer shear response that gradually decreases with the chain displacement another factor that could contribute to the reduction of the residual resistance and consequently to the increase in the strain softening of the free chains is the tendency to reduce both the area of shearing and the chain length with increasing displacements the q r e s q m a x ratio of the hfc is 1 05 times greater than the one of the vfc there is an overlap of the curves of the tests with welded chains vwc and hwc indicating that for a given l d the displacement direction is not influencing the strain softening behavior for further discussion and analysis on strain softening behavior fig 9 illustrates the variation of normalized resistance with l d using eq 6 6 q m a x q r e s d 2 s u a l d the results of fig 9 are in agreement with the earlier conclusions that strain softening is more significant in free chains besides the results show a linear trend of the normalized resistance with the normalized length confirming that the amount of the degraded resistance is proportional to the chain configuration 3 3 displacement at the maximum load different criteria have been used in the literature to estimate the ultimate vertical static pile compression capacity nevertheless one of the most used criteria adopted at an international level is the one that defines the ultimate capacity at the displacement corresponding to 10 of the pile diameter e g salgado 2008 the relative displacement of 10 is necessary to cause loss of operational or structural collapse considering that the pile reaches its ultimate state well after reaching the limit state at this point given the mechanism observed in the chain soil interaction it is anticipated that design principles applied to piles may have to be adapted to chain soil interaction problems therefore there is a need to investigate the displacement required to mobilize the maximum load during pullout tests fig 10 shows that the normalized displacements δ q m a x d of free chains increase linearly with increasing l d while the normalized displacements of welded chains and metal tubes tend to be independent of the l d the load versus displacement curve and consequently the magnitude of displacement corresponding to the maximum load depends on the chain stiffness for welded chains the maximum loads are mobilized at the same displacement regardless of the length of the chain on the other hand the flexibility of free chains causes the progressive mobilization of the links during chain displacement contributing to the linear increase of δ q m a x d with increasing l d it is therefore possible to postulate that the mobilization of shear resistance along the free chain progresses from the first to the last link as the shear displacement is gradually mobilized for free chains the link is considered rigid but the connections between links are free to move and rotate independently before the entire length of the chain starts to be fully mobilized yet some interesting patterns emerged from this set of experimental data for shorter chain lengths the displacements at the maximum load of the welded chains were slightly greater than those of free chains as the pile length increases there is a given l d corresponding to point a for vertical chains and b for horizontal chains for which the free chains begin to show greater values of normalized displacement when compared to those of welded chains further studies are required to clarify and explain this mechanism comparing free chains with the same l d it is observed that the vertically embedded chains require greater displacements to mobilize the maximum load in comparison to horizontally embedded chains in welded chains the difference in displacements is negligible since the normalized displacements corresponding to the maximum load of hwc 0 39 and vwc 0 36 are practically the same extrapolating the curves of the free chains to the origin of the horizontal axis l d 0 the normalized displacement tends to 0 2 regardless of the direction of the chain displacement this observation indicates that the minimum displacement required to mobilize the maximum load of free chains corresponds to 20 of the chain effective diameter which is less than the 36 and the 39 required in vwc and hwc respectively the curves corresponding to the metallic tubes show that the maximum loads are mobilized on average in displacements corresponding to 14 of the effective diameter regardless of the length of the tube the failure mechanism of piles subjected to pullout loads in clay is therefore different from that observed for mobilizing shaft resistance in chains values of δ q m a x d measured in the chain tests are generally greater than the value of 0 10 the threshold value adopted to characterize ultimate conditions in piles under compression or pullout loading in contrast normalized displacements of the vertical metal tubes 0 14 are within the range presented by murthy 2007 and tomlinson and woodward 2008 the large displacement required to mobilize the maximum load is due to the high plasticity of the clay and the geometry of the chains and it is expected to be controlled by the internal shear resistance of the soil full mobilization of undrained shear strength requires fairly large displacements as observed in the results of mini vane tests carried out in this study showing the peak s u mobilized in rotation angles between 6 and 12 corresponding to linear displacements between 0 11d and 0 21d where d is the vane diameter in contrast the soil pile interaction requires less displacement to mobilize the maximum load as experimentally demonstrated by kanji 1974 martins 1983 and lemos and vaughan 2000 in comparison to previous studies carried out with free chains for the mobilization of the maximum pullout forces the following results have been shown δ q m a x d 0 9 in chains embedded in clay yen and tofani 1984 δ q m a x d 0 24 in 100 mm long chains and δ q m a x d 0 95 in 300 mm long chains embedded in the sand choi et al 2014 and δ q m a x d 1 68 and 1 90 in chains embedded in the sand abongo et al 2010a 2010b 2010b the results presented by choi et al 2014 also show that the values of δ q m a x d increase as l d increases 4 conclusions this paper presents the results of a series of scale reduced laboratory model tests carried out to investigate the interaction mechanism between soil and studless chain through this study specific considerations are given in respect to adhesion and bearing capacity factors required for bearing capacity calculations as well as the understanding of many aspects related to the chain soil interaction from the experimental investigations two approaches have been proposed to accurately estimate the adhesion factor and shaft resistance the adhesion factors of the free and welded chains depend on the complex interaction taking place at the soil chain interface and within the clay surrounding the chain when mobilizing the undrained shear resistance average values for adhesion factors are 0 80 and 0 72 for free and welded chains respectively which are in general agreement with the values previously published in the literature the adhesion factor of metallic tubes is equal to 0 40 and depends only on the interaction at the soil tube interface the effective width in sliding ews estimated from the adhesion factor tends to decrease with increasing of the nominal diameter d regardless of the test condition the ews values range from 8 04 to 10 83 and higher ews values are expected in chains with smaller nominal diameters the bearing capacity factor n c and the base resistance depend on the chain stiffness the chain geometry the embedment direction and the magnitude of the chain displacement for both free and welded chains the bearing capacity factor of vertically embedded chains varies from 1 82 to 4 86 while the values of horizontally embedded chains range from 5 73 to 9 68 being within the range used in the design of offshore foundations furthermore for both vertical and horizontal embedment directions n c values of free chains are lower than those of welded chains for all tested conditions the bearing capacity factors tend to increase with increasing chain displacement indicating that the mobilized base area also increases with displacements it has also been shown that for the same chain geometry and embedment direction welded chains tend to present higher values of base resistances by analyzing the ratio between the base resistance q b and the maximum resistance q m a x we have found that the q b q m a x ratio of the vwc is 2 55 times higher than ratio of the vfc and that the ratio q b q m a x of the hwc is 1 11 times higher than the one for hfc in longer chains shaft resistance is dominant and constitutes the largest portion of the measured load nevertheless for shorter chains the base resistance tends to control the interaction mechanism and the magnitude of the measured loads the base resistance tends to increase with the increase of chain displacement whereas the shaft resistance is controlled by the strain softening response the strain softening depends essentially on the degradation of the soil resistance along the chain length the chain geometry and the chain stiffness the highest values of strain softening were observed in free chains and in longer chains the load versus displacement curve and consequently the magnitude of displacement corresponding to the maximum load depend on the chain stiffness regardless of the length of the welded chains the maximum loads are mobilized at the same chain displacement whilst the flexibility of free chains causes a progressive mobilization of the links during the chain displacement contributing to the linear growth of δ q m a x d with l d the large displacements required to mobilize the maximum load are dictated by the high plasticity of the clay and the geometry of the chains the experimental results show an explicit potential for application of the model test results in analytical and numerical methods applied in the design of offshore foundations which are of considerable interest to the offshore industry further studies are encouraged to investigate the influence of the chain displacement rate on the soil chain interaction in both soft and firm clays credit authorship contribution statement

20590,mooring lines are widely used to connect offshore platforms to anchors embedded in the seabed the configuration of the inverse catenary formed by mooring lines influences the installation of the anchors the load capacity and the anchors failure mode for this reason a proper understanding of the soil chain interaction is a requirement for an accurate prediction of the configuration of the inverse catenary this paper presents the main results of a laboratory investigation program carried out on a scale reduced model to study the interaction mechanism between clay and the steel chain of different diameters lengths and stiffness some aspects related to the inverse catenary and tension distribution such as the shaft and base resistances adhesion and bearing capacity factors effective width in sliding strain softening and displacement at the maximum load were extensively discussed herein comparisons between these results and the background experimental data used to support general engineering practice have been made for the different aspects investigated the chain geometry stiffness direction of chain displacement and soil properties influence the behavior of the measured

and the anchors embedded in the seabed oliveira 2009 a significant stretch of mooring lines embedded in marine soil assumes inverse catenary configuration either during the installation of the anchors or during the pre tensioning process due to the soil resistances therefore the load capacity required to stabilize platforms becomes the result not only of the soil anchor interaction but also of the mooring chain soil interaction conceptually the frictional resistances generated during the chain soil interaction contribute to the reduction of the force applied to the anchor degenkamp and dutta

2019 are worthy of note recently a few numerical investigations by means of coupled eulerian lagrangian analysis have been developed by zhao and liu 2016 zhao et al 2016 dou and yu 2018 sun et al 2019 and others at a fundamental level there have been useful advances in the interaction mechanism of the chain in the soil however the mechanism is still not completely understood and many important questions remain unanswered such as i the magnitude of the chain displacement necessary to mobilize the maximum and the residual loads ii the influence of the strain softening behavior on the inverse catenary configuration and the load applied to the anchors and iii the influence of chain stiffness and the direction of forces applied to the interaction mechanisms of the chain in soft clay at its core as described by bergado and chai 1994 the mobilization process of the pullout resistance is rarely investigated however the correct interpretation of this process is important because some structures do not always work at a limit equilibrium condition thus the design of offshore foundations should be compatible with the deformation condition in other words it is not reasonable to directly apply the assumptions established in onshore practice to the offshore design of systems subject to large deformations liu et al 2019 also pointed out that the mooring line has a slender structure with a very large ratio of length to diameter moving in the seabed at a long distance requiring large deformation analyzes in the numerical simulation in large deformations the performance of structures embedded in soft clay is intrinsically related to its strain softening behavior in fact according to sun et al 2019 limited consideration has been given involving the strain softening effects on the shear strength and thus on soil resistance for the problem of the tensioning process of an embedded mooring line xiong et al 2017 also corroborate this previous statement saying that an explicit treatment of the soil softening with repeated loading has not yet been presented in the literature nevertheless current methods for assessing embedded chain behavior are based on static or quasi static analyses disregarding the dynamic effects specifically the cyclic nature of the load applied at the fairlead in addition sun et al 2019 argued that the assumption that the ultimate capacities normal and frictional resistances are fully mobilized simultaneously does not take account of the resistance reduction due to the strain softening effect of the soil since their values are generally calculated from the undisturbed soil strength chatterjee et al 2012 have discussed the influence of the strain softening behavior on the vertical penetration resistance of seabed pipeline zhou and randolph 2009 have considered the influence of the strain softening behavior on the resistance during repeated penetration and extraction of the penetrometers including t bar and ball penetrometer in soft clay complementary studies by xiao et al 2016 reported the influence of the strain softening behavior on the post cyclic capacity of shallow foundations whereas sun et al 2019 specifically addressed the effect of strain softening on the behavior of embedded mooring chains by numerical simulations as for purposefulness despite the important role played by mooring lines of offshore platforms their interaction mechanisms with the soil are not fully understood hence limiting the confidence on the analytical and numerical studies that require the use of appropriate parameters estimated through experimental studies an overview of the previous works demonstrates that further experimental investigations are required to precisely describe the interaction mechanisms between chain and soil and to estimate the parameters necessary for analytical and numerical modeling in this paper we outline the results of a detailed experimental program and the discussion of the fundamental aspects related to the interaction mechanisms adhesion factor bearing capacity factors effective width in sliding strain softening and the magnitude of the chain displacements required to mobilize the maximum pullout force in order to corroborate previous studies this paper also presents different dimensionless relations for direct applications in practice the issues discussed here are essential and can be useful for the design of offshore foundations and numerical and analytical modeling hence the primary goal of the work reported herein is to extend the theoretical approach related to the studies previously developed by rocha 2014 sampa 2015 2019 and rocha et al 2016 at the federal university of rio grande do sul 2 experimental investigation 2 1 experimental setup and chain installation the laboratory model tests were conducted in two testing apparatus described by sampa 2019 a schematic view of the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 showing an acrylic chamber with internal dimensions of l 1 52 m w 0 24 m h 0 80 m the loading frame was devised to allow careful load application on steel chains and metal tubes which are embedded in the soil in predefined positions during sample preparation these metal elements are then connected to a pullout device through a thin steel cable allowing to perform both vertical and horizontal pullout tests under static conditions three steel configurations corresponding to i free non welded studless chains fc ii welded studless chains wc and iii metal tubes mt embedded in saturated clay and tested under tension were investigated in order to obtain the welded studless chains the links of the free studless chains were constrained through the welding process of gas metal arc welding the nominal diameters of both chains configurations are 3 mm 4 mm and 5 mm because of the acrylic chamber dimension the length of welded chains varies from 100 to 500 mm while the length of free chains varies from 50 to 500 mm the chain with a nominal diameter of 3 mm is similar in scale 1 40 to those used by petrobras as mooring lines in offshore operations in addition to chains 100 mm 300 mm and 500 mm long metal tubes having an outside diameter of 25 55 mm were used for comparison because their circular cross sectional area simplifies interpretation and allows direct comparisons with pile foundations the testing preparation for vertical pullout tests follows three main steps i positioning and tensioning six vertical chains inside an empty acrylic tank with the chains spaced 225 mm apart along the length of the tank to avoid any influence during the subsequent load application on the steel chain ii mixing the slurry and carefully filling the tank with soil up to 720 mm and iii relieving the tension on the chains and assuming the equilibrium condition inside the soil before testing the preparation of horizontal pullout tests is similar except for the procedure adopted for positioning the chains inside the acrylic chamber the chamber is initially filled with slurry to a pre established height in which two chains are laid horizontally and tensioned through a steel wire welded to the first link before re start filling with slurry to the final height of the sample chains were embedded in four different depths corresponding to 0 60 m 0 45 m 0 30 m and 0 15 m immediately after the sample preparation a water constant head of 50 mm was placed above the soil surface to keep the water content constant the slurry was then set to rest for 24 h before starting the test during this period there was neither self weight consolidation nor monitoring of the chains settlement there was no drainage at the bottom of the acrylic chamber 2 2 sample preparation and characterization the slurry used in all of the tests was reconstituted from a mix of 85 of kaolin 15 of sodium bentonite and tap water the air dried kaolin and bentonite powders were supplied by industrial manufacturers in brazil initially dry weights of kaolin and bentonite were measured in a precise weighing scale and mixed on a plastic receptacle until obtaining a uniform color of the mixture the mixture was then hydrated using tap water in a heavy duty slurry mixer for 20 min to attain a homogeneous sample at a water content of 120 1 12 wl finally the slurry was poured into the acrylic chamber considered to be of prime importance this process was repeated seven times due to the small capacity of the mixer in comparison to the large size of the acrylic chamber the profile of the undrained shear strength measured with a miniature vane apparatus at a rate of about 0 015 rpm 5 4 min presents a typical range from 0 75 kpa to 2 kpa showing a tendency to increase with depth and over thixotropic time thus characterizing thixotropic behavior even at a very short time after mixing the sensitivity of the clay varies slightly with depth with the mean and standard deviation corresponding to 1 85 and 0 14 respectively both compressibility and shearing strength are greatly affected by the interparticle forces as referred by lambe 1960 and sridharan et al 1971 representing the behavior of an ultrasoft plastic clay with low undrained shear strength and high plasticity and compressibility sampa 2019 presents a detailed pullout test procedure and physical chemical mechanical analysis of this slurry 3 results and discussion 3 1 maximum and residual loads typical laboratory model test results carried out to investigate the interaction mechanism are shown in fig 2 in which load displacement curves and their respective normalization illustrate both viscoelastic and strain softening behaviors for a more convenient analysis of the measured loads it was used two different approaches the first approach considers a linear regression analysis lra to calibrate the parameters through the relationship between the measured and estimated loads eq 1 the second approach given by eq 2 is an algebraic analysis deducted from dimensionless parameters of the buckingham theorem without the need for a statistical program 1 q m a x α d 0 l s u d z n c s u d 2 2 π 1 f π 2 constant q m a x s u d ² α l d n c where q m a x is the maximum load s u the undrained shear strength l the chain length d the effective chain diameter and α the soil adhesion parameters α α β π and n c 4 n c ζ π are mean adhesion factor and bearing capacity factor respectively where β and ζ are parameters that take into account the shape of the failure surface different from circular failure surface considering that the unit shear area and the base area depend on the effective chain diameter d fig 3 presents the relationship between the estimated and measured maximum loads obtained from the first approach for the second approach fig 4 illustrates the relationship between the dimensionless parameters q m a x s u d ² l d both figures show the best fit values of α and n c factors obtained from the respective experimental curves a good agreement can be seen in the comparison shown in fig 3 represented by points distributed around the ideal 1 1 line and confined inside a narrow prediction interval the high values of r2 shown in fig 4 corroborate the good agreement between the dimensionless parameters and highlights the good quality of the calibrated α and n c factors required to estimate the shaft and base resistances a comparison between the factors estimated from both approaches and the percentage of their differences have been outlined in table 1 for all tests table 1 shows α values lower than 1 and a small difference between the results of approaches 1 and 2 which leads to the conclusion that both approaches are suitable to estimate the shaft resistance this observation reflects the fact that the pullout of the chains totally embedded in the soil creates a mechanism of soil mobilization that is completely different from the one observed in piles driven in normally consolidated clay for pile foundations in normally consolidated clay dennis and olson 1983 api 2006 karlsrud et al 2005 presented slightly different relationships between α and undrained shear strength but all expressions indicate α values approaching unity in very soft clays the comparison between α values of free and welded chains helps understating the shear mechanisms free chains show higher α values 0 81 that are attributed to their flexibility and tendency to accommodate the irregular shape of a chain laid in the soil before the start of the test as a consequence of this accommodation when a free chain is displaced the circumscribed diameter of the shear zone tends to be larger than the effective diameter resulting in larger shear areas and higher mobilized lateral resistances for larger displacements the circumscribed diameter gradually decreases to a constant diameter with the complete formation of the shear zone in contrast tests performed with vertical metal tubes vmt presented the lowest α values 0 40 as discussed by kraft et al 1981 and lemos and vaughan 2000 the shear resistance mobilized at the soil metal interface is usually lower than the internal resistance of the clay and for this reason lower α values should be expected in tests carried out with metal tubes it is therefore concluded that the configuration of the chain links impacts the α values of the chains depending on both the soil soil and the soil chain interactions the same assumptions and approaches previously made to estimate α at the corresponding maximum loads were used to determine the α r e s at the residual loads table 2 compares the mean values of the adhesion factor derived from the maximum and the residual loads showing α r e s values of free chains consistently lower than those obtained for welded chains note that α r e s follows an opposite trend from the one observed in α values at maximum load a possible explanation is that the length of the welded chains remains constant during a pullout test whereas in free chains the initial length is reduced slightly given to the relaxation of the chain when releasing the tension loads after soil preparation relaxation induces a re accommodation of the chain geometry to a shorter length which may explain the higher α r e s values of welded chains in both cases metal tubes have the lowest mobilized α r e s values when dividing α by α res we found that the ratio of the welded chains vwc 1 75 and hwc 1 63 is of the same order of magnitude as the clay sensitivity 1 85 but less than the ratios of the free chains vfc 2 53 and hfc 3 04 and metal tubes vmt 2 16 once the adhesion factor is determined the effective width in sliding ews can be derived according to eq 3 3 e w s q f d l s u α d d where q f is the lateral shaft resistance from this relationship it is shown that ews depends on the adhesion factor α α π β and the ratio between the effective d and nominal d chain diameters fig 5 illustrates the variation of ews with the normalized length and table 3 summarizes the mean values of ews ranging from 8 04 to 10 83 regardless of the test condition ews values tend to decrease with the increase of the nominal diameter d for a given effective chain diameter greater ews values are expected in chains with smaller nominal diameters a detailed discussion in respect to ews is reported in degenkamp and dutta 1989 the bearing capacity factor n c was investigated and a comparison between the average values from approaches 1 and 2 is shown in table 4 unlike approach 1 which considers the undrained shear strength mobilized along the shaft and at the base when estimating the maximum load approach 2 uses the same undrained shear strength to calculate both shaft and base resistances as a consequence of the simplification in approach 2 a significant difference was observed when comparing the results of vertically embedded chains conversely the difference between the results of the horizontally embedded chain is small since the undrained shear strength is constant in the horizontal plane the difference observed in vertical chains is insignificant in longer chains since the shaft resistance is a dominant part of the measured loads indicating the potential use of both approaches to separately estimate the base and the shaft resistances the results presented in table 4 show the influence of the stiffness and the embedment direction on the n c values and consequently on the base resistances for both free and welded chains the n c values of the vertically embedded chains vfc and vwc are lower than those of the horizontally embedded chains hfc and hwc the values related to the vertically embedded chains varied from 1 82 to 4 86 while the values of horizontally embedded chains ranged from 5 73 to 9 68 furthermore for both vertical and horizontal embedment directions n c values of free chains vfc and hfc are lower than those of the welded chains vwc and hwc respectively the discrepancy in the n c values related to the embedment direction is mainly due to the difference in the mobilization mechanism of the soil resistance the stress field mobilized in the tests with horizontal chains which approaches a cylindrical cavity expansion in front of the first link is distinct from the one that acts on a vertical chain that is represented by spherical cavity expansion sampa 2019 discussed in detail the influence of the embedment direction on the interaction mechanism of the chain in the soft clay soil for a better investigation of the evolution of the bearing capacity factor with the increase in displacement table 5 compares n c derived from the maximum load with n c r e s of the residual load even for large displacements the embedment direction still plays an important role in the mechanism of soil mobilization resulting in lower n c r e s values in vertically embedded chains when compared to horizontally embedded chains for all tested conditions the bearing capacity factors tend to increase with the increase of chain displacement indicating that the mobilized base area also increases with the increase of chain displacement these observations lead to the conclusion that the bearing capacity factor is influenced by the geometry of the embedded element chain or tube the displacement direction vertical or horizontal and the magnitude of the chain displacement a significant decrease in the ratio q b q m a x with increasing l d is shown in fig 6 and is described by eq 4 4 q b q m a x a l d b as previously introduced the influence of the base resistance q b on the measured load reduces non linearly as the chain length increases in longer chains lateral resistances are dominant and constitute the largest portion of the measured load for the same l d value and the embedment direction base resistances are more significant in welded chains than in free chains the ratio q b q m a x of the vwc is 2 57 times higher than the ratio of the vfc and the ratio q b q m a x of the hwc is 1 11 times higher than the ratio of the hfc for the same l d in addition an analysis of the residual condition was produced fig 7 for comparison with the analysis of the peak condition fig 7 shows a different behavior from the one observed in fig 6 for the same l d value and embedment direction the base resistances are more significant in free chains than in welded chains however the horizontally embedded chains still present the highest mobilized values of base resistances a direct comparison between these figures clearly shows the q b r e s q r e s ratio as being greater than q b q m a x ratio for the same l d q b r e s is the base resistance at the residual condition and q r e s is the total residual resistance based on experimental results we conclude that the base resistance is influenced by the geometry of the embedded element chain or tube the displacement direction vertical or horizontal and the magnitude of the chain displacement although the base resistance tends to increase with the increase of chain displacement the shaft resistances remain as the main portion of the measured load controlling the strain softening behavior discussed in the following item 3 2 strain softening an extensive and detailed discussion on the influence of strain softening behavior on the design of offshore foundations can be found in zhou and randolph 2009 chatterjee et al 2012 xiao et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 sun et al 2019 although the parameters related to the maximum and residual loads were estimated in the preceding discussion this section presents rather a detailed analysis of their relationship to quantify the strain softening behavior shown in fig 2 a non linear reduction of the q r e s q m a x ratio with increasing normalized length is shown in fig 8 and described by eq 5 5 q r e s q m a x a l d 1 b the behavior observed in these curves indicates a clear relationship between the strain softening and the degradation of the soil resistance along the chain length it is interesting to note that the q r e s q m a x ratio of the shorter chains tends to 0 95 in which there is practically no decrease of the measured load nevertheless for shorter chains the base resistance tends to be dominant and controls the interaction mechanism and the magnitude of the measured loads the influence of stiffness can be seen through the strain softening behavior of the clay a more intensive strain softening behavior occurs in free chains that are embedded within the soil accommodated and stretched during the first pullout loading stages producing an initially stiffer shear response that gradually decreases with the chain displacement another factor that could contribute to the reduction of the residual resistance and consequently to the increase in the strain softening of the free chains is the tendency to reduce both the area of shearing and the chain length with increasing displacements the q r e s q m a x ratio of the hfc is 1 05 times greater than the one of the vfc there is an overlap of the curves of the tests with welded chains vwc and hwc indicating that for a given l d the displacement direction is not influencing the strain softening behavior for further discussion and analysis on strain softening behavior fig 9 illustrates the variation of normalized resistance with l d using eq 6 6 q m a x q r e s d 2 s u a l d the results of fig 9 are in agreement with the earlier conclusions that strain softening is more significant in free chains besides the results show a linear trend of the normalized resistance with the normalized length confirming that the amount of the degraded resistance is proportional to the chain configuration 3 3 displacement at the maximum load different criteria have been used in the literature to estimate the ultimate vertical static pile compression capacity nevertheless one of the most used criteria adopted at an international level is the one that defines the ultimate capacity at the displacement corresponding to 10 of the pile diameter e g salgado 2008 the relative displacement of 10 is necessary to cause loss of operational or structural collapse considering that the pile reaches its ultimate state well after reaching the limit state at this point given the mechanism observed in the chain soil interaction it is anticipated that design principles applied to piles may have to be adapted to chain soil interaction problems therefore there is a need to investigate the displacement required to mobilize the maximum load during pullout tests fig 10 shows that the normalized displacements δ q m a x d of free chains increase linearly with increasing l d while the normalized displacements of welded chains and metal tubes tend to be independent of the l d the load versus displacement curve and consequently the magnitude of displacement corresponding to the maximum load depends on the chain stiffness for welded chains the maximum loads are mobilized at the same displacement regardless of the length of the chain on the other hand the flexibility of free chains causes the progressive mobilization of the links during chain displacement contributing to the linear increase of δ q m a x d with increasing l d it is therefore possible to postulate that the mobilization of shear resistance along the free chain progresses from the first to the last link as the shear displacement is gradually mobilized for free chains the link is considered rigid but the connections between links are free to move and rotate independently before the entire length of the chain starts to be fully mobilized yet some interesting patterns emerged from this set of experimental data for shorter chain lengths the displacements at the maximum load of the welded chains were slightly greater than those of free chains as the pile length increases there is a given l d corresponding to point a for vertical chains and b for horizontal chains for which the free chains begin to show greater values of normalized displacement when compared to those of welded chains further studies are required to clarify and explain this mechanism comparing free chains with the same l d it is observed that the vertically embedded chains require greater displacements to mobilize the maximum load in comparison to horizontally embedded chains in welded chains the difference in displacements is negligible since the normalized displacements corresponding to the maximum load of hwc 0 39 and vwc 0 36 are practically the same extrapolating the curves of the free chains to the origin of the horizontal axis l d 0 the normalized displacement tends to 0 2 regardless of the direction of the chain displacement this observation indicates that the minimum displacement required to mobilize the maximum load of free chains corresponds to 20 of the chain effective diameter which is less than the 36 and the 39 required in vwc and hwc respectively the curves corresponding to the metallic tubes show that the maximum loads are mobilized on average in displacements corresponding to 14 of the effective diameter regardless of the length of the tube the failure mechanism of piles subjected to pullout loads in clay is therefore different from that observed for mobilizing shaft resistance in chains values of δ q m a x d measured in the chain tests are generally greater than the value of 0 10 the threshold value adopted to characterize ultimate conditions in piles under compression or pullout loading in contrast normalized displacements of the vertical metal tubes 0 14 are within the range presented by murthy 2007 and tomlinson and woodward 2008 the large displacement required to mobilize the maximum load is due to the high plasticity of the clay and the geometry of the chains and it is expected to be controlled by the internal shear resistance of the soil full mobilization of undrained shear strength requires fairly large displacements as observed in the results of mini vane tests carried out in this study showing the peak s u mobilized in rotation angles between 6 and 12 corresponding to linear displacements between 0 11d and 0 21d where d is the vane diameter in contrast the soil pile interaction requires less displacement to mobilize the maximum load as experimentally demonstrated by kanji 1974 martins 1983 and lemos and vaughan 2000 in comparison to previous studies carried out with free chains for the mobilization of the maximum pullout forces the following results have been shown δ q m a x d 0 9 in chains embedded in clay yen and tofani 1984 δ q m a x d 0 24 in 100 mm long chains and δ q m a x d 0 95 in 300 mm long chains embedded in the sand choi et al 2014 and δ q m a x d 1 68 and 1 90 in chains embedded in the sand abongo et al 2010a 2010b 2010b the results presented by choi et al 2014 also show that the values of δ q m a x d increase as l d increases 4 conclusions this paper presents the results of a series of scale reduced laboratory model tests carried out to investigate the interaction mechanism between soil and studless chain through this study specific considerations are given in respect to adhesion and bearing capacity factors required for bearing capacity calculations as well as the understanding of many aspects related to the chain soil interaction from the experimental investigations two approaches have been proposed to accurately estimate the adhesion factor and shaft resistance the adhesion factors of the free and welded chains depend on the complex interaction taking place at the soil chain interface and within the clay surrounding the chain when mobilizing the undrained shear resistance average values for adhesion factors are 0 80 and 0 72 for free and welded chains respectively which are in general agreement with the values previously published in the literature the adhesion factor of metallic tubes is equal to 0 40 and depends only on the interaction at the soil tube interface the effective width in sliding ews estimated from the adhesion factor tends to decrease with increasing of the nominal diameter d regardless of the test condition the ews values range from 8 04 to 10 83 and higher ews values are expected in chains with smaller nominal diameters the bearing capacity factor n c and the base resistance depend on the chain stiffness the chain geometry the embedment direction and the magnitude of the chain displacement for both free and welded chains the bearing capacity factor of vertically embedded chains varies from 1 82 to 4 86 while the values of horizontally embedded chains range from 5 73 to 9 68 being within the range used in the design of offshore foundations furthermore for both vertical and horizontal embedment directions n c values of free chains are lower than those of welded chains for all tested conditions the bearing capacity factors tend to increase with increasing chain displacement indicating that the mobilized base area also increases with displacements it has also been shown that for the same chain geometry and embedment direction welded chains tend to present higher values of base resistances by analyzing the ratio between the base resistance q b and the maximum resistance q m a x we have found that the q b q m a x ratio of the vwc is 2 55 times higher than ratio of the vfc and that the ratio q b q m a x of the hwc is 1 11 times higher than the one for hfc in longer chains shaft resistance is dominant and constitutes the largest portion of the measured load nevertheless for shorter chains the base resistance tends to control the interaction mechanism and the magnitude of the measured loads the base resistance tends to increase with the increase of chain displacement whereas the shaft resistance is controlled by the strain softening response the strain softening depends essentially on the degradation of the soil resistance along the chain length the chain geometry and the chain stiffness the highest values of strain softening were observed in free chains and in longer chains the load versus displacement curve and consequently the magnitude of displacement corresponding to the maximum load depend on the chain stiffness regardless of the length of the welded chains the maximum loads are mobilized at the same chain displacement whilst the flexibility of free chains causes a progressive mobilization of the links during the chain displacement contributing to the linear growth of δ q m a x d with l d the large displacements required to mobilize the maximum load are dictated by the high plasticity of the clay and the geometry of the chains the experimental results show an explicit potential for application of the model test results in analytical and numerical methods applied in the design of offshore foundations which are of considerable interest to the offshore industry further studies are encouraged to investigate the influence of the chain displacement rate on the soil chain interaction in both soft and firm clays credit authorship contribution statement

reduction a decrease in water depth downstream due to power conversion and an increase in depth further downstream due to the wake reaching the surface few river tests are also mentioned kirke 2011 summarized data of helical and straight blade darrieus turbines with and without a variable pitch system with the use of a diffuser he observed the enhancement of the power output by a factor of three compared to the same turbine without the diffuser patel et al 2019 tested a savonius turbine in different canal geometries showing improvements in turbine performance by increasing the kinetic energy upstream of the turbine this was achieved by enhancing the bottom height of the canal or reducing the side wall s distance according to these experiences our attempt focused on the maximization of power conversion by choosing a turbine shape capable of generating a high blockage ratio and selecting a blade geometry reducing tip losses unlike kirke no pitch mechanism was used according to myers bahaj s work we decided to measure the variation in water depth upstream of the turbine to examine the extent of backwater profiles in the perspective of future investigations anyi and kirke 2010 reviewed experiences of several teams in australia south america and uk related to different solidity axial flow turbines for 1 2 kw electrical power generation in rivers for off grid purposes they described installation details of various rotors showing how turbines can be suspended from the bank of small rivers using a pivot arm or from jetties bridges using a long pole with cross flow turbines we point out that construction details of the support structure should be inspected attentively due to high thrust and vibrations generated at the shaft therefore a welded steel structure anchored to the banks was adopted for this work as illustrated in section 2 3 a benchmark of cross flow rotors in table 1 resumes some experimental tests indicating power coefficient and thrust coefficient this work is similar to the report of battisti et al 2018 on vertical axis wind turbines however only comparable parameters have been collected for cross flow rotors besides the different blockage ratios generated at each facility apart from the partial data availability of blockage and loading this report illustrates a multitude of experiences including those related to ducted rotors e g the squirrel cage rotor with full or partial chasing shown by shimokawa in this case a letter d as ducted has been indicated next to the rotor type this turbine shows higher performance than others due to the high exploitation of the kinetic energy in turn obtained from a small dam alike facility birjandi s data are illustrated only for the maximum performance condition the power coefficient is defined as the ratio of the power extracted to the available kinetic power of a streamflow the parameter identifying the axial load to the total drag of the current is the thrust coefficient c t in addition the torque coefficient c q is introduced to investigate the effects of the periodic behavior of the forces acting on the blades according to our nomenclature u represents the far field uniform velocity ρ is the water density t is the axial thrust q is the mechanical torque p is the power converted a t is the turbine swept area and r is the rotor radius note that t q and p represent average quantities based on the number of observations that ensured after rotor speed changes a quasi steady state of the flow more details are reported in section 3 1 c t t 1 2 ρ a t

enhancement represents conceptually the advantage of hydrokinetic in blocked channels even though axial loads rise hence loading and power conversion are affected by the confinement and the far field depth and velocity in turn parametrized by the blockage ratio b and the froude number fr respectively the blockage is the ratio of the turbine swept area a t to the channel cross sectional area a c while the froude number fr states the ratio of inertial forces to weight forces in rectangular channels fr is a function of the average velocity u and the hydrostatic depth d while in non rectangular channels d must be substituted by the hydraulic depth d h i e the ratio of the channel cross sectional area a c to the free surface width w 4 b a t a c 5 f r u g d the state of the art of micro hydropower employs basin plants or run off plants in locations where a certain static head exists in rivers traditional solutions imply large flooded areas per unit of power output in both cases civil works require large investments with a noticeable environmental impact also in small plants in addition the interruption of the natural dynamics of the streams may heavily alter the ecosystem on the contrary the deployment of hydrokinetic ensures the minimum environmental impact as civil infrastructures like those in the classic basin and run off plants dams flooded area etc are not required the structural support can be realized with anchorages on the canal bank or floating platforms reducing the investment cost and enhancing their reuse in case of relocation elsewhere the deployment of a multi turbine transversal fence can be mounted on a single supporting structure allowing a consistent rise in the power of the whole system promoted by the increase of the canal blockage a phenomenon well known in wind tunnel tests kirke 2011 indicated that the turbine purchase and the execution of the civil works could generate a high cost per kwh however additional studies are desired to demonstrate the feasibility due to cost and technical limitations with extensive analysis of the profitability over the long term accounting for transport installation and maintenance expenses the selection of suitable canals is a complex task since different requirements must be fulfilled concerning flow rate velocity and depth data during the year canals with a sufficiently regular flow to generate electricity at a high capacity factor and current velocities higher than 1 5 m s are uncommon depth must be sufficient to host a single turbine or more turbines sufficient clearance between the turbines height and the channel bed or free surface therefore only a few canals used for irrigation purposes are suitable we remark that the main candidates are typically devoted to water adduction discharge to existent conventional hydropower plants of a large size as they ensure greater exploitation of the resource during the year according to liu and packey 2014 the author explored the attractive combination of hydrokinetic power production and conventional hydropower facilities to generate additional power cost effectively the turbine testing is often performed in facilities that allow lower installation costs than those required for mounting a support structure on riverbanks important to mention also that fewer authorizations are required although test facilities ensure faster results their longitudinal length may limit the identification of flow transient phenomena that are briefly discussed in this work furthermore most of the listed references describe the behavior of rotors in terms of performance and load but the placement of turbines in real canals produces important free surface effects such as backwater profiles is this a mild effect or can it stress significantly far upstream cross sections with this work we provide preliminary data although testing of the turbine performance was feasible only for a single flow condition our investigation allowed the introduction of aspects such as flow transients and backwater issues that will be soon discussed in other works related to power canals the next sections illustrate an experimental campaign on a smooth prismatic canal where a cross flow hydrokinetic turbine was deployed after accurate flow measurements generating a heavily blocked environment section 2 illustrates the experimental canal characteristics and turbine features the test bench and the probes used providing a complete picture of procedural steps section 3 shows the upstream free surface variation at each rotor speed and resumes the main outcomes of thrust mechanical torque and mechanical power at the rotor in addition to the computation of c t c q and c p the visualization of wide torque fluctuations leads us to the definition of the torque ripple factor describing the torque ripple phenomenon a common concern appearing in vertical axis wind and hydrokinetic turbines finally the last section resumes our main findings that we deem appropriate to introduce a wide experimental activity in italy on a larger power canal of equal cross sectional shape 2 experimental setup a cross flow hydro turbine was designed manufactured and assembled with its test bench for deployment in a narrow artificial canal data of bending moment torque and rotor speed were recorded at different rotor speeds free surface effects such as the backwater profile towards upstream including the hydrostatic pressure rise at the turbine proximity and the water depth drop caused by the turbine rotation were visualized all measurements were executed at a single flow condition due to the impossibility of modifying the current velocity and depth parameters 2 1 the hydrokinetic turbine the turbine in fig 1 and fig 2 is a straight blade and self starting cross flow hydrokinetic turbine based on the h darrieus concept which rotor consists of three straight and equally spaced blades with a zero pitch offset angle manufactured with a numerically controlled cutter in aluminum alloy the fluid dynamics and the structural design of the rotor were carried out by the staff of the turbomachinery laboratory of the university of trento to maximize the performance of the machine the multiple rings geometry of the blades confers high solidity to the rotor 6 where n is the number of blades c is the chord length and r is the turbine radius 6 σ n c 2 r its shape guarantees a tip loss reduction which for vertical axis turbines represents a critical factor the blades were designed with a naca 0021 profile to reduce the number of aluminum molds thus inevitably reducing the rotor manufacturing cost in table 2 the geometrical features of the rotor are summarized the size of the rotor was chosen to generate a significant blockage ratio in the canal based on the maximum value foreseen for a larger scale experiment not described in this work 2 2 canal description and flow characterization the canal illustrated in fig 3 is a prismatic waterway of a trapezoidal shape with an additional trapezoidal bottom whose flow is subcritical it is located in italy in the municipality of dro near the city of trento the canal consists of cement slabs laying on gently sloping terrain and is hydraulically supplied from the river sarca to guarantee the vital inflow of a neighboring trout farm a part of the whole flow rate is collected towards a mini hydropower plant the mean geometric slope s 0 of the bottom cement slabs is approximately 0 1 at the measuring station a density ρ 999 1 was assumed after the measurement of temperature the turbine generated a blockage ratio of 0 23 in the canal i e approximately a quarter of the canal s cross sectional area the planimetric arrangement of the turbine and probes is shown in fig 4 whereas a detailed description of probes is presented in section 2 3 before the turbine deployment accurate tests of the undisturbed current velocity were performed using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv a with accuracy 0 01 m s a grid of 5 7 velocity points was acquired from which cross sectional iso velocity curves were modeled fig 5 additional measurements were done with a propeller type current meter m at the canal centerline data of water depth were collected from two pressure probes p during the turbine operation at an upstream station and at the turbine proximity aiming to check to which extent the turbine have altered the flow further measurements were taken into the wake respectively at 1 5d and 2 5d downstream of the rotor c through data analysis we realized that measurements of the downstream turbine wake velocities did not match the operating conditions summarized in section 3 unfortunately this happened due to a reduced access time to the privately owned site upon authorization the average cross sectional velocity of the flow u describing the non dimensional parameters was modeled through an entropy maximization method entropy models have proven to be accurate especially near the bottom and below the free surface where most of the existing measuring devices face problems mohanty 2013 this is considered an accurate alternative to the most popular velocity area approach stosic et al 2016 or multi variable regression analyses khuntia et al 2018 chiu and hsu 2006 derived the cross sectional average velocity u f u max m as a linear function 7 of the maximum velocity u max on the vertical z axis and the entropy dimensionless parameter m which is a section constant for each channel this equation describes the variation of velocity in two dimensions with the maximum velocity occurring on or below the free surface hence the function φ m was obtained using equation 8 7 u φ m u m a x 8 φ m e m e m 1 1 m since no historical records of m were available velocity samples were collected on the z axis to estimate the location of u max giving h d in turn h represents the depth of u max point below the free surface the m value was derived from an empirical relationship with h d chiu and hsu 2006 chiu 1987 chiu and said 1995 chiu and tung 2002 concerning methods estimating the constant m a valuable work was published by farina et al 2014 with a maximum velocity u max of 1 44 m s and m of 3 62 the output of the average velocity was u 1 078 m s an absolute error of 7 04 was ascertained by accounting for the averaging error calculated to the output of a multi regression analysis and the adv uncertainty a test with hec ras v5 07 u s army corps of engineers was performed to calibrate the manning s coefficient n demonstrating a result consistent with smooth channel values according to chow 1985 all hydraulic parameters in table 3 are referred to the far field cross section of the canal including a reynolds number of 3 71 e5 note that the hydraulic radius r h in equation 9 was assumed as the characteristic length for the canal 9 r e f ρ u r h μ for unsteady flow characterization the far field upstream turbulence was investigated after the measurement of the velocity components in x y and z directions at 50 hz turbulent fluctuations u x u y and u z attached in fig 6 exhibited an anisotropic behavior and a reduced oscillation on the third component the estimates of turbulence intensity and time averaged velocity at the center of the cross section are 6 6 and 1 25 m s respectively 2 3 test bench and probes the test bench for this experimental campaign was manufactured to measure the values of torque and thrust acting on the rotor at different rotor speeds the test bench in fig 7 was essentially provided by dc motor generator with nominal power 0 61 kw and nominal speed 1000 rpm electronic drive for the speed regulation of the dc motor controller network of probes data acquisition system structural support i e a tilting frame made of welded steel pipes anchored to the canal banks including a vertical translation system to adjust the immersion depth of the rotor the structural support of the test bench is a tilting frame that was laid on canal banks allowing the lifting and the submersion of the turbine the probes on the test bench the range of signals and the measurement accuracy are shown in table 4 the signals from the probes were sampled at the frequency of 2 khz with a national instrument s compact rio 9082 the torque was measured with a torque meter with an integrated encoder mod kistler 4503a with accuracy 0 1 nm data were continuously displayed and stored in text files 2 4 torque and bending calibration previously torque was calibrated with laboratory tests to cancel the effects of drive train friction including viscous losses at the shaft bearings at an increasing rotor speed thus achieving only the effective torque generated at the blades two strain gauge full bridges were applied on the shaft of the turbine after calibration the measurement of the bending moment was translated into the calculation of the axial thrust this was attained from the linear relation between the load applied to the center of the rotor and the voltage at the output of the strain gauge bridges 3 results and comments the differences in water depth between the measurements at the stations p in fig 4 to the average undisturbed depth are shown in fig 8 both measurements were acquired with a running turbine at each rotor speed and with the turbine off note that the undisturbed depth was assumed d 0 85 0 005 m this chart also shows the axial thrust computed from the bending moment measurements acquired with the strain gauge mounted on the test bench each rotor speed corresponded to different measurements of thrust and water depth the instrumental uncertainty was taken into account for the computation of the average experimental data and the propagation error was evaluated for all dimensionless parameters temporal measurements of the axial thrust result highly concentrated within approximately 10 n consistently with the low fluctuations of flow depth thus demonstrating high reliability of the test procedure data of upstream water depth shows a backwater profile propagating from the turbine station towards upstream at the highest rotor speed the water depth was measured at the upstream control station showing a maximum increase of 4 5 cm to the undisturbed depth value this test demonstrated that far field velocity and depth measurements should not be executed near the turbine but at an undisturbed cross section i e where the turbine drag force does not affect the flow we observed that the flow is still affected by backwater profiles at twenty eight diameters upstream of the rotor additional tests were completed to verify whether a supercritical flow condition could appear at a high turbine load the velocity of the flow was measured with the adv at the downstream crossbars c fig 4 but no hydraulic jump occurred even at high rotor speed hence we demonstrated that the water profile at the upstream cross sections of the canal remains within the safety threshold at the maximum power extracted and blockage ratio 0 23 although extended longitudinally this phenomenon proved to be of a limited magnitude in this canal despite the high geometric blockage ratio generated in the cross sectional area as expected the depth upstream of the rotor increased progressively and proportionally to the axial thrust on the turbine shaft at each step in the rotor speed water depth and velocity were measured after each rotor speed change outlining flow transients ending with the attainment of a new flow equilibrium which was recognized as a new quasi steady state unsteadiness was referred to as the cause of a decreasing mechanical torque at each operational condition transients lasted at least 10 min and measurements were discarded attentively within this time interval averaged thrust torque and power were then calculated at each rotor speed for the remaining dataset and they are shown from fig 9 to fig 11 with respect to the rotor speed uncertainties are specified for rotor speed and thrust in table 4 whereas for power the error interval varies from 1 16 w at 90 18 rpm to 2 04 w at 190 9 rpm with a mean value of 1 53 w the maximum mechanical power of 127 42 w is achieved at the optimum rotor speed of 110 22 rpm under the same operating condition axial thrust and mechanical torque result 238 29 n and 11 04 nm respectively see fig 9 and fig 10 thrust torque and power coefficient calculated according to 1 3 are illustrated from fig 12 to fig 14 with respect to the tip speed ratio λ i e the peripheral speed of the rotor divided by the undisturbed velocity 10 the reynolds number 11 of the blade chord ranges between 1 081e5 and 2 297e5 for the optimal tip speed ratio λ 2 68 see fig 13 10 λ ω r u 11 r e ρ w c μ at the optimum a thrust coefficient of 1 64 is shown whereas the power coefficient surpasses the lanchester betz limit at 0 81 although evidently this limit represents a meaningless threshold in confined flows the denominator of all dimensionless coefficients accounts for an averaged velocity which over simplifies the characterization of the canal flow which in fact is non uniform the free surface variation generated by the operation of the turbine is completely ignored in equation 3 as remarked by kirke 2019 and mcadam et al 2013 the energy extraction from a subcritical flow is a variation of total head instead of a simple extraction of kinetic flux therefore the ratio of the rotor power to the total energy removed from the flow represents the channel efficiency unfortunately there was no chance to include rotor losses and downstream losses due to mixing between wake and bypass flows to conclude the power coefficient does not represent a reliable measure for the hydrodynamic efficiency of the rotor but indicates the apparent performance concerning the far field kinetic power however the traditional definition of c p can still be used to compare the ability of different machines to exploit the available resource in a hypothetical unconfined flow finally the comparison of dimensional parameters represents a more effective solution than dimensionless parameters alone the error intervals estimate is even more explanatory the error propagation analysis was performed with a differential logarithmic method this accounts for the instrumental uncertainty of adv torque meter strain gauge and encoder and the modeling error on the far field velocity compared to the uncertainty on machine measurements the mean absolute error on the dimensionless parameters is large 0 237 for c t 0 033 for c q 0 141 for c p and 0 210 for λ this is due to the large influence of the velocity estimate error on other quantities evidence of this is observed in the non negligible uncertainty of the tip speed ratio an example of torque and axial thrust over a complete revolution is presented in fig 15 referring to the optimum tip speed ratio of 2 68 an evident torque ripple appeared along with high shaft vibrations phenomena that are typically associated with dynamic stall issues especially at low λ at this rotor speed the torque ripple induced high axial thrust fluctuations we remark that this stress level may accelerate fatigue failure reuter and worstell 1978 winchester and quayle 2011 the torque ripple produces also a wide fluctuation of mechanical power converted and rotor speed that cannot be adequately regulated by the pi control this solicitation may be eventually reduced by increasing substantially the blade number according to battisti et al 2018 but this would lead to a further increase in solidity another option may be the design of helical blades however a feasible solution may be the use of a phase angle between two coupled rotors mounted on the same shaft as implemented by he powergreen srl on a two bladed cross flow rotor https www he powergreen 2021 but this will be illustrated in a future publication this solution would guarantee a drop in the torque ripple whereas the solidity is kept constant different methods to evaluate torque fluctuations were previously published reuter and worstell 1978 however according to the works of winchester and quayle 2011 marsh et al 2015 and similarly to shiono et al 2002 the maximum torque ripple factor trf 12 was investigated a parameter tracing the trend of the torque ripple phenomenon 12 t r f c q m a x c q m i n the torque ripple is characterized by pulsating lift forces on the blades alternating from positive to negative values our experience shows that the trf is maximum at the starting tip speed ratio and a change in curvature is obtained at the optimum operating point λ 2 68 where the mean torque coefficient c q peaks the trf decreases as the rotor speed rises and this fits well with the dynamic stall effect related to a drop in the lift force at low rotor speeds fig 16 demonstrates that the effect of the trf reduces only at a high rotor speed and far from the optimality where mechanical torque and power extracted drop significantly 4 conclusion this study analyses the rotor interference on the flow and the turbine power conversion in a narrow artificial canal since no significant change in flow rate or depth was observed before the placement of the turbine an average cross sectional velocity was calculated to describe the subcritical flow in this waterway the construction features of the support structure and turbine are illustrated in detail showing accuracy but also some gaps that occurred during the experimental campaign some observations may be useful for future experiments to be conducted on larger channels and with numerous turbine arrays during the turbine operation a backwater phenomenon was observed and measured from the rotor station towards the first crossbar showing no risks of overflowing from the canal banks however it demonstrated that the measurement of the undisturbed velocity cannot be performed in the vicinity of the turbine no critical flow nor hydraulic jump occurred downstream even at a high rotor speed the measurements were affected by unsteady phenomena due to the hydraulic disturbance produced after each rotor speed change therefore axial thrust and mechanical torque data were collected only as the flow equilibrium was ascertained after transients the power conversion maximization was achieved by the rotor whereas the power coefficient surpassed the lanchester betz limit due to a large blockage ratio nevertheless we remark that the traditional definition of power coefficient does not account for the total head variation occurring in confined flows although c p represents a current measure for comparing turbines converting power it can be considered as an apparent performance further evidence of this depends on the fact that the lanchester betz limit does not apply in this environment torque ripple shaft vibrations and varying bending moment on the support structure were observed at such a high blockage indeed the torque ripple is a phenomenon occurring in cross flow rotors due to a pulsating lift force on the blades often coupled with the dynamic stall our tests demonstrated that the torque ripple and vibrations were excessive at the optimality and the torque ripple factor trf confirmed the drop of these phenomena at an increasing tip speed ratio credit authorship contribution statement l cacciali methodology investigation formal analysis writing

20591,the performance of a high solidity h darrieus cross flow hydrokinetic turbine was tested in the subcritical flow of a narrow artificial canal turbine shape and swept area were selected to generate high blockage into the flow for mechanical power maximization although a high axial thrust on the blades was attained a detailed description of the support structure probes and the turbine is provided as a first step of further in depth studies after measurements of the undisturbed flow velocity with an acoustic doppler velocimeter the turbine was submerged to operate at different rotor speeds while measurements of torque thrust and rotor speed were acquired the water depth at another crossbar was measured continuously to check the backwater profile spreading towards upstream showing no flooding risk at each rotor speed experimental data were analyzed for the torque ripple investigation and high sensitivity to low tip speed ratios was demonstrated keywords hydrokinetic turbines blockage cross flow turbine h darrieus turbine 1 introduction among recent hydropower conversion technologies much of the scientific community s interest is addressed to hydrokinetic turbines i e low environmentally invasive devices exploiting an ultra low head variation this market is almost entirely oriented to large scale applications with a high variety of rotors and technical solutions for a safe and efficient operation in tidal currents some enthusiasm is also spreading around river hydrokinetics whereby extensive research persists this new category can be addressed as micro hydropower due to the peak power limited within some tens of kws with turbines generating electricity as long as running water is available tanbhirhoq et al 2011 and without dams vermaak et al 2014 according to riglin et al 2016a micro hydrokinetic turbines have a limited capacity to produce a large amount of power in rivers due to limitations in cross sectional area but hydrokinetic arrays will be essential

2013 studied a two bladed squirrel cage turbine at different depths and re in a partially submerged position the turbine demonstrated evident drops in performance for all re investigated this issue was due to extensive stall caused by air drawing from the suction side of the blade numerical predictions based on whelan s theory whelan et al 2009 demonstrated a realistic turbine performance drop but also a 100 discrepancy with experimental data bahaj et al 2007 studied the power coefficient and thrust coefficient of a 0 8 m diameter horizontal axis marine turbine in a cavitation tunnel for different flow conditions showing a peak power coefficient of 0 46 at a yaw angle of 20 and flow speed of 1 7 m s a significant drop in performance was shown for shallow tip immersion mcadam et al 2013 performed extensive tests on hydrodynamic performance and structural loading of a transverse horizontal axis water turbine as a variant of a cross flow darrieus type turbine these were executed at a varying tip speed ratio and for several blockage ratios solidities fixed offset pitch angles and flow directions a solidity reduction and a rise in blockage ratio exhibited an increase in power converted channel efficiency and structural loading the fixed pitch offset of rotor blades allowed power coefficient and channel efficiency to increase accordingly with a drop in the operating tip speed ratio this device constantly exceeded the lanchester betz limit ross and polagye 2020 investigated a cross flow rotor in two different test flumes at two blockage ratios with interesting contour plots the authors demonstrated the assumptions of higher bypass flow velocities around the rotor reduced wake size increased turbulence intensity and viscous dissipation rate downstream of the turbine bachant and wosnik 2015 analyzed a cylindrical helical turbine intended for free flows and a spherical cross flow turbine designed to operate in circular gravity flow pipes or channels their power coefficients were 0 35 and 0 24 respectively the authors justified the low performance of the spherical turbine as it was developed to operate in a higher blockage environment kirke 2016 explored pitching systems on two cross flow rotors a 1 m diameter turbine with a passive eccentric mechanism tested in open water at 1 m s and a 0 5 m diameter turbine with a cam driven pitch to reduce the dynamic stall phenomenon tested in a towing tank at 0 5 m s two dimensional modeling demonstrated an overprediction of the power coefficient from 45 to 49 since parasitic drag losses reducing the power output and due to the pitch mechanism affecting low re operation were ignored shimokawa et al 2012 analyzed a four bladed darrieus turbine with different chasings at the outlet of a duct as a dam type rotor showing a power coefficient higher than the lanchester betz limit at each flow condition finally myers and bahaj 2007 tested a 0 4 m diameter horizontal axis marine turbine in a water channel and discussed the phenomena occurring upstream and downstream of the turbine during the power conversion process i e an increase in water depth upstream of the rotor with a flow speed reduction a decrease in water depth downstream due to power conversion and an increase in depth further downstream due to the wake reaching the surface few river tests are also mentioned kirke 2011 summarized data of helical and straight blade darrieus turbines with and without a variable pitch system with the use of a diffuser he observed the enhancement of the power output by a factor of three compared to the same turbine without the diffuser patel et al 2019 tested a savonius turbine in different canal geometries showing improvements in turbine performance by increasing the kinetic energy upstream of the turbine this was achieved by enhancing the bottom height of the canal or reducing the side wall s distance according to these experiences our attempt focused on the maximization of power conversion by choosing a turbine shape capable of generating a high blockage ratio and selecting a blade geometry reducing tip losses unlike kirke no pitch mechanism was used according to myers bahaj s work we decided to measure the variation in water depth upstream of the turbine to examine the extent of backwater profiles in the perspective of future investigations anyi and kirke 2010 reviewed experiences of several teams in australia south america and uk related to different solidity axial flow turbines for 1 2 kw electrical power generation in rivers for off grid purposes they described installation details of various rotors showing how turbines can be suspended from the bank of small rivers using a pivot arm or from jetties bridges using a long pole with cross flow turbines we point out that construction details of the support structure should be inspected attentively due to high thrust and vibrations generated at the shaft therefore a welded steel structure anchored to the banks was adopted for this work as illustrated in section 2 3 a benchmark of cross flow rotors in table 1 resumes some experimental tests indicating power coefficient and thrust coefficient this work is similar to the report of battisti et al 2018 on vertical axis wind turbines however only comparable parameters have been collected for cross flow rotors besides the different blockage ratios generated at each facility apart from the partial data availability of blockage and loading this report illustrates a multitude of experiences including those related to ducted rotors e g the squirrel cage rotor with full or partial chasing shown by shimokawa in this case a letter d as ducted has been indicated next to the rotor type this turbine shows higher performance than others due to the high exploitation of the kinetic energy in turn obtained from a small dam alike facility birjandi s data are illustrated only for the maximum performance condition the power

enhancement represents conceptually the advantage of hydrokinetic in blocked channels even though axial loads rise hence loading and power conversion are affected by the confinement and the far field depth and velocity in turn parametrized by the blockage ratio b and the froude number fr respectively the blockage is the ratio of the turbine swept area a t to the channel cross sectional area a c while the froude number fr states the ratio of inertial forces to weight forces in rectangular channels fr is a function of the average velocity u and the hydrostatic depth d while in non rectangular

hydropower employs basin plants or run off plants in locations where a certain static head exists in rivers traditional solutions imply large flooded areas per unit of power output in both cases civil works require large investments with a noticeable environmental impact also in small plants in addition the interruption of the natural dynamics of the streams may heavily alter the ecosystem on the contrary the deployment of hydrokinetic ensures the minimum environmental impact as civil infrastructures like those in the classic basin and run off plants dams flooded area etc are not required the structural support can be realized with anchorages on the canal bank or floating platforms reducing the investment cost and enhancing their reuse in case of relocation elsewhere the deployment of a multi turbine transversal fence can be mounted on a single supporting structure allowing a consistent rise in the power of the whole system promoted by the increase of the canal blockage a phenomenon well known in wind tunnel tests kirke 2011 indicated that the turbine purchase and the execution of the civil works could generate a high cost per kwh however additional studies are desired to demonstrate the feasibility due to cost and technical limitations with extensive analysis of the profitability over the long term accounting for transport installation and maintenance expenses the selection of suitable canals is a complex task since different requirements must be fulfilled concerning flow rate velocity and depth data during the year canals with a sufficiently regular flow to generate electricity at a high capacity factor and current velocities higher than 1 5 m s are uncommon depth must be sufficient to host a single turbine or more turbines sufficient clearance between the turbines height and the channel bed or free surface therefore only a few canals used for irrigation purposes are suitable we remark that the main candidates are typically devoted to water adduction discharge to existent conventional hydropower plants of a large size as they ensure greater exploitation of the resource during the year according to liu and packey 2014 the author explored the attractive combination of hydrokinetic power production and conventional hydropower facilities to generate additional power cost effectively the turbine testing is often performed in facilities that allow lower installation costs than those required for mounting a support structure on riverbanks important to mention also that fewer authorizations are required although test facilities ensure faster results their longitudinal length may limit the identification of flow transient phenomena that are briefly discussed in this work furthermore most of the listed references describe the behavior of rotors in terms of performance and load but the placement of turbines in real canals produces important free surface effects such as backwater profiles is this a mild effect or can it stress significantly far upstream cross sections with this work we provide preliminary data although testing of the turbine performance was feasible only for a single flow condition our investigation allowed the introduction of aspects such as flow transients and backwater issues that will be soon discussed in other works related to power canals the next sections illustrate an experimental campaign on a smooth prismatic canal where a cross flow hydrokinetic turbine was deployed after accurate flow measurements generating a heavily blocked environment section 2 illustrates the experimental canal characteristics and turbine features the test bench and the probes used providing a complete picture of procedural steps section 3 shows the upstream free surface variation at each rotor speed and resumes the main outcomes of thrust mechanical torque and mechanical power at the rotor in addition to the computation of c t c q and c p the visualization of wide torque fluctuations leads us to the definition of the torque ripple factor describing the torque ripple phenomenon a common concern appearing in vertical axis wind and hydrokinetic turbines finally the last section resumes our main findings that we deem appropriate to introduce a wide experimental activity in italy on a larger power canal of equal cross sectional shape 2 experimental setup a cross flow hydro turbine was designed manufactured and assembled with its test bench for deployment in a narrow artificial canal data of bending moment torque and rotor speed were recorded at different rotor speeds free surface effects such as the backwater profile towards upstream including the hydrostatic pressure rise at the turbine proximity and the water depth drop caused by the turbine rotation were visualized all measurements were executed at a single flow condition due to the impossibility of modifying the current velocity and depth parameters 2 1 the hydrokinetic turbine the turbine in fig 1 and fig 2 is a straight blade and self starting cross flow hydrokinetic turbine based on the h darrieus concept which rotor consists of three straight and equally spaced blades with a zero pitch offset angle manufactured with a numerically controlled cutter in aluminum alloy the fluid dynamics and the structural design of the rotor were carried out by the staff of the turbomachinery laboratory of the university of trento to maximize the performance of the machine the multiple rings geometry of the blades confers high solidity to the rotor 6 where n is the number of blades c is the chord length and r is the turbine radius 6 σ n c 2 r its shape guarantees a tip loss reduction which for vertical axis turbines represents a critical factor the blades were designed with a naca 0021 profile to reduce the number of aluminum molds thus inevitably reducing the rotor manufacturing cost in table 2 the geometrical features of the rotor are summarized the size of the rotor was chosen to generate a significant blockage ratio in the canal based on the maximum value foreseen for a larger scale experiment not described in this work 2 2 canal description and flow characterization the canal illustrated in fig 3 is a prismatic waterway of a trapezoidal shape with an additional trapezoidal bottom whose flow is subcritical it is located in italy in the municipality of dro near the city of trento the canal consists of cement slabs laying on gently sloping terrain and is hydraulically supplied from the river sarca to guarantee the vital inflow of a neighboring trout farm a part of the whole flow rate is collected towards a mini hydropower plant the mean geometric slope s 0 of the bottom cement slabs is approximately 0 1 at the measuring station a density ρ 999 1 was assumed after the measurement of temperature the turbine generated a blockage ratio of 0 23 in the canal i e approximately a quarter of the canal s cross sectional area the planimetric arrangement of the turbine and probes is shown in fig 4 whereas a detailed description of probes is presented in section 2 3 before the turbine deployment accurate tests of the undisturbed current velocity were performed using an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv a with accuracy 0 01 m s a grid of 5 7 velocity points was acquired from which cross sectional iso velocity curves were modeled fig 5 additional measurements were done with a propeller type current meter m at the canal centerline data of water depth were collected from two pressure probes p during the turbine operation at an upstream station and at the turbine proximity aiming to check to which extent the turbine have altered the flow further measurements were taken into the wake respectively at 1 5d and 2 5d downstream of the rotor c through data analysis we realized that measurements of the downstream turbine wake velocities did not match the operating conditions summarized in section 3 unfortunately this happened due to a reduced access time to the privately owned site upon authorization the average cross sectional velocity of the flow u describing the non dimensional parameters was modeled through an entropy maximization method entropy models have proven to be accurate especially near the bottom and below the free surface where most of the existing measuring devices face problems mohanty 2013 this is considered an accurate alternative to the most popular velocity area approach stosic et al 2016 or multi variable regression analyses khuntia et al 2018 chiu and hsu 2006 derived the cross sectional average velocity u f u max m as a linear function 7 of the maximum velocity u max on the vertical z axis and the entropy dimensionless parameter m which is a section constant for each channel this equation describes the variation of velocity in two dimensions with the maximum velocity occurring on or below the free surface hence the function φ m was obtained using equation 8 7 u φ m u m a x 8 φ m e m e m 1 1 m since no historical records of m were available velocity samples were collected on the z axis to estimate the location of u max giving h d in turn h represents the depth of u max point below the free surface the m value was derived from an empirical relationship with h d chiu and hsu 2006 chiu 1987 chiu and said 1995 chiu and tung 2002 concerning methods estimating the constant m a valuable work was published by farina et al 2014 with a maximum velocity u max of 1 44 m s and m of 3 62 the output of the average velocity was u 1 078 m s an absolute error of 7 04 was ascertained by accounting for the averaging error calculated to the output of a multi regression analysis and the adv uncertainty a test with hec ras v5 07 u s army corps of engineers was performed to calibrate the manning s coefficient n demonstrating a result consistent with smooth channel values according to chow 1985 all hydraulic parameters in table 3 are referred to the far field cross section of the canal including a reynolds number of 3 71 e5 note that the hydraulic radius r h in equation 9 was assumed as the characteristic length for the canal 9 r e f ρ u r h μ for unsteady flow characterization the far field upstream turbulence was investigated after the measurement of the velocity components in x y and z directions at 50 hz turbulent fluctuations u x u y and u z attached in fig 6 exhibited an anisotropic behavior and a reduced oscillation on the third component the estimates of turbulence intensity and time averaged velocity at the center of the cross section are 6 6 and 1 25 m s respectively 2 3 test bench and probes the test bench for this experimental campaign was manufactured to measure the values of torque and thrust acting on the rotor at different rotor speeds the test bench in fig 7 was essentially provided by dc motor generator with nominal power 0 61 kw and nominal speed 1000 rpm electronic drive for the speed regulation of the dc motor controller network of probes data acquisition system structural support i e a tilting frame made of welded steel pipes anchored to the canal banks including a vertical translation system to adjust the immersion depth of the rotor the structural support of the test bench is a tilting frame that was laid on canal banks allowing the lifting and the submersion of the turbine the probes on the test bench the range of signals and the measurement accuracy are shown in table 4 the signals from the probes were sampled at the frequency of 2 khz with a national instrument s compact rio 9082 the torque was measured with a torque meter with an integrated encoder mod kistler 4503a with accuracy 0 1 nm data were continuously displayed and stored in text files 2 4 torque and bending calibration previously torque was calibrated with laboratory tests to cancel the effects of drive train friction including viscous losses at the shaft bearings at an increasing rotor speed thus achieving only the effective torque generated at the blades two strain gauge full bridges were applied on the shaft of the turbine after calibration the measurement of the bending moment was translated into the calculation of the axial thrust this was attained from the linear relation between the load applied to the center of the rotor and the voltage at the output of the strain gauge bridges 3 results and comments the differences in water depth between the measurements at the stations p in fig 4 to the average undisturbed depth are shown in fig 8 both measurements were acquired with a running turbine at each rotor speed and with the turbine off note that the undisturbed depth was assumed d 0 85 0 005 m this chart also shows the axial thrust computed from the bending moment measurements acquired with the strain gauge mounted on the test bench each rotor speed corresponded to different measurements of thrust and water depth the instrumental uncertainty was taken into account for the computation of the average experimental data and the propagation error was evaluated for all dimensionless parameters temporal measurements of the axial thrust result highly concentrated within approximately 10 n consistently with the low fluctuations of flow depth thus demonstrating high reliability of the test procedure data of upstream water depth shows a backwater profile propagating from the turbine station towards upstream at the highest rotor speed the water depth was measured at the upstream control station showing a maximum increase of 4 5 cm to the undisturbed depth value this test demonstrated that far field velocity and depth measurements should not be executed near the turbine but at an undisturbed cross section i e where the turbine drag force does not affect the flow we observed that the flow is still affected by backwater profiles at twenty eight diameters upstream of the rotor additional tests were completed to verify whether a supercritical flow condition could appear at a high turbine load the velocity of the flow was measured with the adv at the downstream crossbars c fig 4 but no hydraulic jump occurred even at high rotor speed hence we demonstrated that the water profile at the upstream cross sections of the canal remains within the safety threshold at the maximum power extracted and blockage ratio 0 23 although extended longitudinally this phenomenon proved to be of a limited magnitude in this canal despite the high geometric blockage ratio generated in the cross sectional area as expected the depth upstream of the rotor increased progressively and proportionally to the axial thrust on the turbine shaft at each step in the rotor speed water depth and velocity were measured after each rotor speed change outlining flow transients ending with the attainment of a new flow equilibrium which was recognized as a new quasi steady state unsteadiness was referred to as the cause of a decreasing mechanical torque at each operational condition transients lasted at least 10 min and measurements were discarded attentively within this time interval averaged thrust torque and power were then calculated at each rotor speed for the remaining dataset and they are shown from fig 9 to fig 11 with respect to the rotor speed uncertainties are specified for rotor speed and thrust in table 4 whereas for power the error interval varies from 1 16 w at 90 18 rpm to 2 04 w at 190 9 rpm with a mean value of 1 53 w the maximum mechanical power of 127 42 w is achieved at the optimum rotor speed of 110 22 rpm under the same operating condition axial thrust and mechanical torque result 238 29 n and 11 04 nm respectively see fig 9 and fig 10 thrust torque and power coefficient calculated according to 1 3 are illustrated from fig 12 to fig 14 with respect to the tip speed ratio λ i e the peripheral speed of the rotor divided by the undisturbed velocity 10 the reynolds number 11 of the blade chord ranges between 1 081e5 and 2 297e5 for the optimal tip speed ratio λ 2 68 see fig 13 10 λ ω r u 11 r e ρ w c μ at the optimum a thrust coefficient of 1 64 is shown whereas the power coefficient surpasses the lanchester betz limit at 0 81 although evidently this limit represents a meaningless threshold in confined flows the denominator of all dimensionless coefficients accounts for an averaged velocity which over simplifies the characterization of the canal flow which in fact is non uniform the free surface variation generated by the operation of the turbine is completely ignored in equation 3 as remarked by kirke 2019 and mcadam et al 2013 the energy extraction from a subcritical flow is a variation of total head instead of a simple extraction of kinetic flux therefore the ratio of the rotor power to the total energy removed from the flow represents the channel efficiency unfortunately there was no chance to include rotor losses and downstream losses due to mixing between wake and bypass flows to conclude the power coefficient does not represent a reliable measure for the hydrodynamic efficiency of the rotor but indicates the apparent performance concerning the far field kinetic power however the traditional definition of c p can still be used to compare the ability of different machines to exploit the available resource in a hypothetical unconfined flow finally the comparison of dimensional parameters represents a more effective solution than dimensionless parameters alone the error intervals estimate is even more explanatory the error propagation analysis was performed with a differential logarithmic method this accounts for the instrumental uncertainty of adv torque meter strain gauge and encoder and the modeling error on the far field velocity compared to the uncertainty on machine measurements the mean absolute error on the dimensionless parameters is large 0 237 for c t 0 033 for c q 0 141 for c p and 0 210 for λ this is due to the large influence of the velocity estimate error on other quantities evidence of this is observed in the non negligible uncertainty of the tip speed ratio an example of torque and axial thrust over a complete revolution is presented in fig 15 referring to the optimum tip speed ratio of 2 68 an evident torque ripple appeared along with high shaft vibrations phenomena that are typically associated with dynamic stall issues especially at low λ at this rotor speed the torque ripple induced high axial thrust fluctuations we remark that this stress level may accelerate fatigue failure reuter and worstell 1978 winchester and quayle 2011 the torque ripple produces also a wide fluctuation of mechanical power converted and rotor speed that cannot be adequately regulated by the pi control this solicitation may be eventually reduced by increasing substantially the blade number according to battisti et al 2018 but this would lead to a further increase in solidity another option may be the design of helical blades however a feasible solution may be the use of a phase angle between two coupled rotors mounted on the same shaft as implemented by he powergreen srl on a two bladed cross flow rotor https www he powergreen 2021 but this will be illustrated in a future publication this solution would guarantee a drop in the torque ripple whereas the solidity is kept constant different methods to evaluate torque fluctuations were previously published reuter and worstell 1978 however according to the works of winchester and quayle 2011 marsh et al 2015 and similarly to shiono et al 2002 the maximum torque ripple factor trf 12 was investigated a parameter tracing the trend of the torque ripple phenomenon 12 t r f c q m a x c q m i n the torque ripple is characterized by pulsating lift forces on the blades alternating from positive to negative values our experience shows that the trf is maximum at the starting tip speed ratio and a change in curvature is obtained at the optimum operating point λ 2 68 where the mean torque coefficient c q peaks the trf decreases as the rotor speed rises and this fits well with the dynamic stall effect related to a drop in the lift force at low rotor speeds fig 16 demonstrates that the effect of the trf reduces only at a high rotor speed and far from the optimality where mechanical torque and power extracted drop significantly 4 conclusion this study analyses the rotor interference on the flow and the turbine power conversion in a narrow artificial canal since no significant change in flow rate or depth was observed before the placement of the turbine an average cross sectional velocity was calculated to describe the subcritical flow in this waterway the construction features of the support structure and turbine are illustrated in detail showing accuracy but also some gaps that occurred during the experimental campaign some observations may be useful for future experiments to be conducted on larger channels and with numerous turbine arrays during the turbine operation a backwater phenomenon was observed and measured from the rotor station towards the first crossbar showing no risks of overflowing from the canal banks however it demonstrated that the measurement of the undisturbed velocity cannot be performed in the vicinity of the turbine no critical flow nor hydraulic jump occurred downstream even at a high rotor speed the measurements were affected by unsteady phenomena due to the hydraulic disturbance produced after each rotor speed change therefore axial thrust and mechanical torque data were collected only as the flow equilibrium was ascertained after transients the power conversion maximization was achieved by the rotor whereas the power coefficient surpassed the lanchester betz limit due to a large blockage ratio nevertheless we remark that the traditional definition of power coefficient does not account for the total head variation occurring in confined flows although c p represents a current measure for comparing turbines converting power it can be considered as an apparent performance further evidence of this depends on the fact that the lanchester betz limit does not apply in this environment torque ripple shaft vibrations and varying bending moment on the support structure were observed at such a high blockage indeed the torque ripple is a phenomenon occurring in cross flow rotors due to a pulsating lift force on the blades often coupled with the dynamic stall our tests demonstrated that the torque ripple and vibrations were excessive at the optimality and the torque ripple factor trf confirmed the drop of these phenomena at an increasing tip speed ratio credit authorship contribution statement l cacciali methodology investigation formal analysis writing

20592,in this paper the methodology for the real time tracing of riser profile and bending moment by multiple inclinometers along the riser is presented with the assumption that its top by gps global positioning system and bottom anchoring points are known the riser is modelled as a series of slender beam segments and at each time step the riser nodal points are progressively traced for riser x y z displacement and bending moment tracing quadratic and cubic interpolation functions for each line element between two neighboring bi axial inclinometers are employed with respect to the global and generalized coordinate systems analytical solutions are derived for the instantaneous riser profile and bending moment at each line s mid point to validate the developed riser monitoring algorithms a fpso floating production storage offloading system with scr steel catenary riser or slwr steel lazy wave riser was simulated for 1 yr and 50 yr collinear wind wave current storm conditions with 45 deg

predicted and actual values the developed method is validated the methodology can be applied to any kinds and shapes of lines and cables too keywords riser profile tracing monitoring algorithm inclinometer bending moment quadratic cubic polynomial 1 introduction due to world economic growth the global consumption of oil and gas has continuously been increased many experts expect that this long term trend will not be changed in the near future in the oil gas production offshore structures have played an important role as a significant energy supply source the monitoring and maintenance of those offshore structures will continuously be a very critical issue in the offshore oil gas industry especially riser is a deeply submerged elastic pipeline to transfer oil and gas from well to platform so its safety is critically important therefore many researchers have investigated riser s structural health monitoring by using sensors and other methods chezhian et al 2006 investigated various riser monitoring methodologies currently available to the industry as part of ndp norwegian deepwater program furthermore cook et al 2006 analyzed the procedure for risk based integrity management applied to pipeline systems or top side equipments similarly integrity management systems that are currently employed in 17 offshore facilities are introduced by edwards et al 2005 also goldsmith et al 2007 described the development of alert levels and roles of monitoring for riser system failure and its impact on effective management system generally the monitoring methodology for the riser can be categorized into two approaches sensor based method and ndt non destructive testing method anderson 1987 the former analyzes sensor s signal by post processing after retrieval to find any malfunction or inherent structural problems the latter uses mri magnetic resonance image acoustic devices and underwater cameras with rovs remotely operated vehicles andersen et al 2001 the ndt methods are more direct but usually much more expensive than the sensor based method one of the critical drawbacks of the ndt approach is that continuous observation and monitoring of profile and stress are not possible which is especially very important for the estimation of accumulated fatigue damage and life time extension so far many sensor based monitoring methodologies were researched and reported ziegler and muskulus 2016 researched the advantages of sensor based monitoring technology using accelerometer inclinometer and strain gages the monitoring method based on localized strain and dynamic response measurement was reported by karayaka et al 2009 o donnell et al 2015 published the results that included scaled model tests and sensor measurement strategies with floating wind turbines and wave energy converters also li et al 2014 evaluated deep water risers fatigue by riser viv vortex induced vibration mcneill et al 2014 proposed a decision making process of quasi static angles along the riser applying the combination of acceleration and angular information furthermore morikawa et al 2010 proposed novel techniques for the integrity monitoring relying on optical fiber sensors with wire to transfer measured strain data in real time additionally peng and zhi 2012 researched various structure health monitoring methodologies like sensing technology optimal sensor arrangement and early warning along with their difficulties and advantages the sensor signals can be transmitted in real time through electrical lines acoustic telemetry li et al 2014 and optical signals andersen et al 2001 pipa et al 2010 otherwise the sensor signals should be stored and retrieved at the end of battery life for post processing for the post processing oma operational modal analysis for example can be used for the structural health monitoring kim et al 2019 the continuous energy supply for the sensor can be another important area to be researched for the long term structural health monitoring of risers for example the power supplying method using piezoelectric converters has been tested for subsea sensors jahangiri et al 2016 park et al 2008 investigated the energy harvesting related to low power embedded monitoring when only a small number of sensors are used machine learning algorithms can play a role in the structural health monitoring kim et al 2018 sohn et al 2001 in the present paper the algorithms for the real time tracing of riser profiles and internal stresses are developed by using multiple inclinometers along the riser since accelerometers are not used double time integration is not necessary to obtain riser s real time displacements as a result the profile tracing method is much more robust than the accelerometer based approach in addition the real time estimation of internal stresses and accumulated fatigue damages are also possible which has rarely been reported in the open literature to validate the developed algorithms riser dynamics of a fpso under typical sea environments are simulated by using a commercial software orcaflex then numerical inclinometers are distributed along the riser and they provide sensor signals like physical sensors subsequently the inputted sensor signals are applied to the developed algorithms to enable the real time prediction of instantaneous riser profiles and internal stresses lastly the real time predicted profiles and internal stresses are compared with the originally generated ones to validate the accuracy of the developed methodologies and algorithms 2 methodology riser profile tracing 2 1 derivation of curved line length equation in 3d in this section an analytical algorithm for tracing riser s instantaneous nodal displacements by using inclinometers along the riser is presented first let s consider the derivation of the curved line length equation in 3d space as shown in fig 1 the entire curve line length l p a p b can be calculated by the summation of linearized small segment l i lengths as 1 l p a p b i 1 n p i 1 p i the linearized small segment length can be expressed as 2 l i p i 1 p i x i 1 x i 2 y i 1 y i 2 z i 1 z i 2 δ x i 2 δ y i 2 δ z i 2 by applying the mean value theorem eq 3 with the decomposed quadratic interpolation functions fig 2 in the x z and x y planes the small segment length equation eq 2 can be re written as eq 4 3 m e a n v a l u e t h e o r e m δ y i f x i δ x i where x i in x i 1 x i δ z i g x i δ x i where x i in x i 1 x i 4 p i 1 p i δ x i 2 δ y i 2 δ z i 2 δ x i δ x i 2 f x i δ x i δ x i δ x i 2 f x i δ x i δ x i δ x i 2 f x i δ x i 2 g x i δ x i 2 1 f x i 2 g x i 2 δ x i by substituting derivative of arbitrary quadratic interpolation function eq 5 into eq 4 small segment length equation eq 2 can be re arranged including arbitrary coefficients eq 6 5 f x i 2 q 1 x i q 2 g x i 2 r 1 x i r 2 q 1 q 2 r 1 r 2 are arbitary coefficients 6 p i 1 p i 1 a x i 2 b x i c δ x i where a 4 q 1 2 r 1 2 b 4 q 1 q 2 r 1 r 2 c q 2 2 r 2 2 a b c are also arbitary coefficients the resulting integral can be done analytically as 7 l p a p b lim δ x 0 i 1 n p i 1 p i lim δ x 0 i 1 n 1 a x i 2 b x i c δ x a b 1 2 a x b 2 d x a b are also arbitary coefficients the analytically determined 3d curved line length equation will be used in the next section to sequentially solve for the entire instantaneous node displacements the axial elongation of riser by line tension is infinitesimally small and thus not included in the curved line length equation in the present algorithm x will represent a generalized coordinate s along the riser 2 2 node displacements calculation usually in fem finite element method beam theory displacements along the beam can be represented by the sum of elements with interpolation functions and it can be solved with given typically four boundary conditions therefore the riser node displacements can straightforwardly be traced if the four boundary conditions displacement and slope at both ends are given at each time step however in the present case only slopes are given at the inclinometer locations and thus typical fe formulas cannot be used on the other hand the displacements at the bottom and top points of a riser are to be known the bottom point is fixed at the seabed connection anchoring position the top point connection to surface platform is given in case of fixed platforms and can be real time traced by gps system in case of floating platforms additional accelerometers along the riser can also be employed to determine the instantaneous nodal displacements however simpler and cheaper solutions without additional accelerometer are of course better furthermore the accelerations need to be integrated twice to obtain the corresponding displacements which may be problematic in the presence of sensor noises choi and kim 2018 with the given information we derive the algorithm how all nodal displacements in 3d can be real time traced by using only the bi axial inclinometers as follows as shown in fig 3 it is assumed that sensors are attached along the entire riser arc length with an equal interval in this paper of course variable intervals can also be used by using the same algorithm the interpolation functions and boundary conditions are tabulated in table 1 also eq 8 shows interpolation functions used and their spatial derivatives with respect to the global coordinate system 8 f x z x a x z x 2 b x z x c x z d f x z d x 2 a x z x b x z by applying the boundary conditions at the first segment from the top hang off junction the third coefficient c of the interpolation function can be derived as 9 f x z x x a f x z x 0 0 c x z 0 continually with the combination of eq 8 and third boundary condition the second coefficient b of the interpolation function can be estimated as 10 d f x z d x x x a 0 θ x z a b x z θ x z a now one more condition is required to obtain the first coefficient of the interpolation function a as explained previously with fourth boundary condition eq 11 the equation for curved line length eq 12 between two points sensor interval can be applied here in the curve length equation the corresponding elastic elongation is so small that it can be neglected 11 d f x z d x x x b θ x z b 2 a x z x b b x z θ x z b 2 a x z x b θ x z a θ x z b 12 l x a x b 1 a x z x b x z 2 d x 0 x b 1 a x z x θ x z b 2 d x by using the equation of curved line length eq 12 and fourth boundary condition eq 11 the first coefficient of interpolation function a can finally be obtained as 13 f x z x a x z x 2 b x z x c x z w h e r e a x z 1 4 l θ x z b 2 1 θ x z b sinh 1 θ x z b θ x z a 2 1 θ x z a sinh 1 θ x z a b x z θ x z a c x z 0 the quadratic interpolation is employed to get the closed form length equation then the interpolation function can be expressed as a function of only inclinations θ x z a θ x z b as in eq 13 as a result the displacements x a n d z of the bottom point of the top element can be obtained as 14 x b θ x z b θ x z a 2 a x z z b f x z x b a x z x b 2 b x z x b c x z similarly we can repeat the same process with respect to the y direction so that the coefficients for y directional interpolation functions and nodal displacements can be obtained as in eq 15 and eq 16 15 f x y x a x y x 2 b x y x c x y w h e r e a x y 1 4 l θ x y b 2 1 θ x y b sinh 1 θ x y b θ x y a 2 1 θ x y a sinh 1 θ x y a b x y θ x y a c x y 0 16 y b f x y x b a x y x b 2 b x y x b c x y then the same procedure can be applied to the next elements and the process can be sequentially continued until the last elements finally the entire riser profile at a given time step can be produced from the given inputs from sensors in the case of structural health monitoring and accumulated fatigue damage assessment the real time estimation of riser internal stresses is important for that even if the instantaneous riser profile is obtained by a series of quadratic interpolation functions we still need to determine the distributions of bending moments and bending stresses through double spatial derivatives of the quadratic interpolation functions which may be problematic therefore in the next section we present an alternative approach regarding how the bending moment distribution along the riser can be obtained directly from the inclinometer signals 3 methodology riser bending moment in this section the analytical solution for riser bending moment estimation will be explained as explained previously if the quadratic interpolation function is used the curvature which is double spatial derivative of the interpolation function becomes constant therefore it cannot be used for proper bending moment distribution continuous at each nodal point thus the cubic interpolation function with respect to the generalized s coordinate system with directional cosine angles θ x a θ x b is employed eq 17 here with corresponding boundary conditions eq 18 chung et al 2019 this is possible since all the instantaneous nodal positions can be determined as explained in the previous section 17 v x s f v x a v x b θ x a θ x b s a 0 a 1 s a 2 s 2 a 3 s 3 18 v x s s a 0 v x a v x s s b l v x b d v d s s s a 0 θ x a d v d s s s b l θ x b applying boundary conditions eq 18 to the third order polynomial equation eq 17 the eq 17 can be re written as 19 v x s 1 3 s 2 l a b 2 2 s 3 l a b 3 v x a s 2 s 2 l a b s 3 l a b 2 θ x a 3 s 2 l a b 2 2 s 3 l a b 3 v x b s 3 l a b 2 s 2 l a b θ x b the third order polynomial equation can be re constructed as matrix form as 20 v x s n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 v x a θ x a v x b θ x b n ξ where n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 represent shape functions and ξ expresses the nodal displacements and inclinations by substituting eq 20 to normal stress for beam bending eq 21 eq 22 is derived 21 σ x s m x y max i y max e d 2 n d s 2 ξ 22 σ x s y max e 12 s l a b 3 6 l a b 2 v x a 6 s l a b 2 4 l a b θ x a 6 l a b 2 12 s l a b 3 v x b 6 s l a b 2 2 l a b θ x b then the beam bending moment equation can be derived as 23 m x ei 12 s l a b 3 6 l a b 2 v x a 6 s l a b 2 4 l a b θ x a 6 l a b 2 12 s l a b 3 v x b 6 s l a b 2 2 l a b θ x b eq 23 represents the distribution of bending moment along the line it is interesting to see that the bending moment at the mid point of each element can be obtained in a greatly simplified form by inputting s l a b 0 5 to eq 23 as 24 m x e i 1 l a b θ x b θ x a m y e i 1 l a b θ y b θ y a m z e i 1 l a b θ z b θ z a for those points other than the mid length point the second spatial derivative curvature of the cubic shape function can be used in the following section we will prove whether the derived analytical solutions for node displacements and bending moments can actually be used for the real time tracing of riser profile and bending moment from inclinometer signals only in the present numerical experiment the actual riser profile and bending moment were taken from the time domain system simulation by the commercial program orcaflex widely adapted in oil gas industry then the numerical riser inclination signals at the inclinometer locations were taken and inputted with the given top point from gps to the developed algorithm to see whether it can actually reproduce the actual riser profile and bending moment or stress at each time step the numerical experiment closely emulates the real situation except that the physical sensor is replaced by the numerical sensor the potentially detrimental effect of small physical sensor noise is also investigated in this study presented in the appendix a it was shown by authors choi and kim 2018 that the present algorithm is much more robust against sensor noises than the accelerometer based method since double time integration is not needed at each time step 4 explanation of target structure fpso with scr and slwr as a target structure fpso floating production storage and offloading system with scr steel catenary riser or slwr steel lazy wave riser is adopted in this paper it is well known that the scr may experience local dynamic buckling near touch down zone under extreme storm conditions kim and kim 2015 to circumvent the problem lazy wave risers are frequently employed fig 4 and fig 5 present the configuration of the fpso system with scr or slwr under 100 m water depth wd100 the sensor distribution along the riser with 10 m interval is presented in fig 6 as a floater the default fpso given by orcaflex was selected with the corresponding added mass radiation damping and first and second order wave loads orcina 2006 furthermore a total of 12 spread mooring lines with four groups are employed for the station keeping in 100 m water depth each mooring line consists of all chain components for entire arc length for the scr and slwr steel tube pipe with 356 mm outer diameter is used in the slwr case buoyancy modules are attached to make a lazy wave shape along the riser at arc length 100 m 110 m the details of the mooring and riser properties and slwr buoyancy modules are tabulated in table 2 table 3 and table 4 for scr and slwr line segment modeling each segment length of 0 1 m was used for orcaflex furthermore to represent seabed for the seabed touching riser elements the seabed stiffness of 50 kn m2 is considered for simplicity the seabed induced coulomb friction and damping effect are not considered in the numerical simulations for the boundary conditions at the hang off and anchor points frictionless hinged boundary condition b c is used as a typical condition of the riser the 1 yr and 50 yr storm conditions with a co linear wwc wind wave current heading of 45 are considered as detailed in table 5 for the wave and wind spectra jonswap wave and api wind spectra are adopted for the corresponding current profile 1 7 power law is applied as shown in eq 25 to demonstrate the prediction capability all the results are plotted for 200 s simulation duration 25 v v s b v s f v s b z z s b z s f z s b

depth 100 m case wd100 in this section various comparisons between the predicted and actual profiles and bending moments will be presented and discussed it is assumed that the bi axial inclinometers are attached uniformly along the entire riser arc length furthermore two different sensor intervals compact interval 2 m coarse interval 10 m are selected to show the sensor interval effect for both scr and slwr under 100 m water depth the fpso system with the respective riser is simulated first by the orcaflex computer program with the given inputs and parameters then the inclination and azimuthal angle signals are collected from the sensor locations next the developed algorithms are run by using the numerical sensor signals to trace the instantaneous riser profile and bending moments at any location along the riser finally the reconstructed riser profiles and bending moments are compared with the actual values at the respective time steps to assess the capability of the developed algorithms in section 5 the possible sensor noises are not considered however their effects are separately evaluated in appendix a also in author s independent study choi and kim 2018 the use of inclinometers is much less sensitive to sensor noises compared to accelerometer based tracing method in the following several example cases are explained and discussed first the riser profile tracing capability by the presently developed algorithm for the scr case is discussed for the time history of riser displacements four representative locations from top to bottom are selected i e 30 m upper 70 m middle 100 m lower and 130 m on seabed as specified by blue dots in fig 6 also based on the simulation results the tdp touch down point varied with time in the range of 120 m 130 m under 50 yr storm condition in fig 7 and fig 8 the respective x y z locations time histories for both compact int 2 m and coarse int 10 m sensor intervals are plotted and the averaged differences between the predicted algorithm and target orcaflex values are tabulated in appendix b both 1 yr and 50 yr storms are employed and both algorithm predicted and actual profiles are compared for both storm conditions the predicted riser movements at the upper middle lower locations excellently agree with the actual movements for both coarse and compact riser arrangements this implies that longer than 10 m interval can also be used for practical applications depending on the level of target accuracy at arc length 130 m location which is laid down on the seabed the profile tracing accuracy is still good even for 10 m sensor interval in the case of scr on the seabed the seabed stiffness causes the sudden change of riser curvature near the tdp and thus the accuracy of the prediction algorithm is affected to further explain this the same scr cases without seabed stiffness are presented in fig 9 and the differences between the predicted algorithm and target orcaflex values are tabulated in appendix b it is confirmed that there is almost no difference between the predicted and actual profiles regardless of the sensor interval since the curvature of the scr smoothly changes with hanging profile below seabed if seabed stiffness is not considered fig 9 this is true even for the case of sparse sensor interval therefore the sensors need to be arranged with smaller spacing when the curvature changes rapidly and high accuracy is needed in fig 10 and fig 11 the corresponding bending moment comparisons at the middle point and off middle point of each element s l 0 5 and 0 75 are presented similarly the averaged differences between the predicted algorithm and target orcaflex values are given in appendix b for each figure the results for mid arc length point at 75 m and 3 near touch down locations are plotted since the tdp near the arc length of about 124 m is the most critical region in view of bending stress three locations near tdp are selected arc length 115 m 125 m and 135 m as was pointed out in the theoretical description simple analytical results are available for the bending moment at the middle of each sensor interval while for other locations the bending moment can be obtained by differentiating twice the cubic shape function of riser profile in all cases we observe the excellent recovery of actual bending moments at both the middle s l 0 5 and off mid locations s l 0 75 by the developed algorithm as can intuitively be expected the compact interval produces more accurate prediction than sparse interval more interestingly even the sparse cases give good recovery of actual values which is very important in practical applications for saving budget for both 1 yr and 50 yr storms the predicted bending moments by the developed algorithm reasonably well follow the actual bending moments the prediction accuracy of the coarse interval case near tdp and on seabed is slightly worse than that of other upper locations as was already seen in the displacement tracing examples that can be attributed to the sudden change of line curvature at the tdp to double check this another set of simulations without seabed stiffness were conducted in fig 12 in this case the agreement between the predicted and actual bending moments is excellent even for 10 m sensor interval regardless of the locations and storm conditions in appendix b the differences between the predicted algorithm and target orcaflex values are presented next let us consider the slwr instead of scr the scr may experience local dynamic buckling problem when hull heave pitch motions are excessive kim and kim 2015 in this case to avoid that kind of problem slwr needs to be used although it is more expensive and problematic in flow assurance since the developed algorithms can be applied to any types of line shapes the prediction capability for a slwr is also examined in the following intuitively it is required that the sensors should be arranged densely around the highly curve reversed lazy wave zone arc length 100 m 110 m to have good prediction accuracy the same algorithms and sensor intervals are applied to the slwr movements and the results are compared at four locations i e at arc length 30 m 70 m 100 m and 120 m with compact and coarse sensor distributions the corresponding time histories are presented in fig 13 compact interval 2 m and fig 14 coarse interval 10 m and the errors are tabulated in appendix b due to the geometric characteristic of the lazy wave shape the dynamic motions of the slwr in x y and z directions near concave and tdp at 90 m and 128 m are significantly reduced compared to those of scr at 124 m also the compact interval case can follow the rapid change of riser curvature in the lazy wave zone much better than the course interval case as for the upper portion above the lazy wave zone even the coarse interval case can predict the overall shape very well therefore sensor distribution can be coarse for the upper portion but needs to be denser around the lazy wave zone to achieve high accuracy in the case of coarse sensor interval if a point of inflection exists within the element the representation of line by quadratic shape function may not be accurate therefore adjusted sensor arrangement may be needed near the lazy wave zone with double reverse curvature in this regard the case of optimal sensor arrangement with variable intervals is also presented by green dashed line for 100 m and 120 m arc lengths in the adjusted sensor arrangement 10 m interval is used except for near the lazy wave zone arc length 90 m 110 m for which 2 m interval is applied as can be seen in the same figure fig 14 the adjusted sensor location green dashed line can produce satisfactorily high accuracy since the bottom touching portion of the slwr is small the modeling of the seabed stiffness in this case is not an important issue finally the bending moment time histories of the slwr at three locations arc length 55 m 85 m and 105 m are presented in fig 15 and fig 16 also the mean values of errors are summarized in appendix b fig 15 is for the mid point of the respective elements and fig 16 is for the 3 4 point of each element off middle both figures show the comparisons for compact and coarse intervals the 85 m and 105 m locations are around the lazy wave zone since it is the most critical region in view of high bending stresses since the curvature variation of the lazy wave zone is relatively large so denser sensor arrangement is needed there to capture the rapid change and improve the prediction accuracy green dashed line as shown in figs 15 and 16 however for the upper portions of the slwr even the coarse sensor arrangement gives good enough prediction accuracy which helps the sensor designers to devise the most cost effective sensor based monitoring methodology so far the tracing of riser profile and bending stress along the riser by using multiple bi axial inclinometers was presented for the monitoring of accumulated fatigue of risers axial tension is additionally needed the tension along the riser can be traced by using tension sensor at its top with a proper algorithm as explained in kim et al 2021 the developed algorithms can in principle also be applied when additional riser motion complexity exists due to viv finally fig 17 shows several snapshots of scr and slwr profiles with 10 m sensor interval for scr and optimized interval for slwr under 50 yr storm at different time steps it demonstrates that the whole profile can reliably be traced in real time by the developed algorithms 5 2 water depth 1000 m case wd1000 in this section the algorithm is additionally tested for the case of fpso with scr in deepwater 1000 m fig 18 shows the configuration of the system and its sensor arrangement the mooring line consists of chain polyester rope chain and their respective arc lengths are 200 m 1000 m 200 m the same riser properties are employed to build the riser model although the developed algorithm is generic and not influenced by the riser properties for profile tracing 15 bi axial inclinometers are attached along the riser total length 1500 m with 100 m interval in this case the sensor interval is ten times larger than the previous wd100 case as an environmental loading the same 50 yr storm condition is used fig 19 shows the time histories of scr node displacements and the differences between the predicted and target values are tabulated in appendix b like the previous cases four nodal points along the riser arc length are selected for node displacement tracing several snapshots of the entire riser profile are also plotted in fig 20 overall it is confirmed that the developed algorithm can still predict the scr motion very well even with 100 m interval next the corresponding comparisons of bending moments are plotted in fig 21 and the averaged differences are also summarized in appendix b since the most critical region of the riser monitoring is around tdp arc length 1200 m 1300 m the bending moments at those three locations near tdp as well as one additional location at mid length 750 m are compared as it is shown the differences between the predicted and target values are small even with 100 m sensor spacing thus it is confirmed that the developed algorithm can still be applied to deep water system with sufficiently large spacing also the computational time for the algorithm is minimal so that the real time riser monitoring is possible since the developed algorithm is general it can be applied to any types of risers mooring lines and cables too 6 conclusions to monitor or predict riser dynamic responses and the corresponding bending moments by using multiple inclinometer signals unique algorithms were developed based on the high order rod element fe formulas and analytic curve length equation in 3d the top and bottom points were assumed to be known for riser x y z displacement tracing quadratic interpolation functions for each line element between two neighboring bi axial inclinometers were employed with respect to the global coordinate system then from the analytic solutions with given angle sensor inputs the node positions along the riser were sequentially obtained node by node at each time step as for bending moments cubic interpolation function with respect to the generalized coordinate system was employed to allow double spatial derivative of shape function with the given scheme a simplified analytic formula for the bending moment at the mid point of each riser segment can be obtained furthermore through double spatial derivative of the shape function the bending moments or stresses at any points along the riser can be obtained at each time step to validate the developed real time riser monitoring algorithms a fpso system with scr or slwr was simulated for 1 yr and 50 yr collinear wind wave current conditions with 45 deg heading and the corresponding numerical sensor signals were inputted to the algorithms for reproducing the real time riser profiles and bending moments or stresses for the target value simulation orcaflex widely adopted commercial program was used two different sensor intervals compact int 2 m and coarse int 10 m under 100 m water depth were tested for cross checking also an additional deepwater water deep 1000 m case was tested to further check the applicability of the developed algorithm with much larger sensor interval 100 m several conclusions can be drawn based on the presented results as below overall the real time prediction of riser profiles and bending moments or stresses by using the inclinometer signals with the developed algorithms agrees well with the actual values for both scr and slwr regardless of sea environmental conditions the coarse sensor interval performed well compared to the compact sensor interval if riser shape varies smoothly along the arc length if there is an inflection point within the interval around which curvature rapidly changes high accuracy is not necessarily warranted in this case adjusted sensor arrangement is recommended for the high curvature varying region the bending moments and bending stresses can be predicted equally well as the riser profiles when proper sensor arrangement is used deepwater 1000 m scr with much larger sensor interval also produced reliable results the developed algorithms also turned out to be robust against typical sensor noises credit authorship contribution statement woo chul chung conceptualization methodology

artificial sensor noise in this appendix the effect of artificial sensor noise is investigated to make it closer to physical sensors in the real system as a target structure fpso with scr at 100 m water depth is considered for 50 yr storm condition same as that in section 5 1 here the previous numerical sensor signals are superposed with artificially generated random noises with a given standard deviation value three different standard deviations of noise are considered table 6 the first case is typical noise standard deviation provided by a sensor manufacturer kim et al 2021 while the second and third cases have larger sensor noises than that to check the overall robustness of the developed algorithm against larger sensor noises the angle sensor signals with the three different noise levels are plotted in fig 22 as expected the greater the standard deviation of sensor noise the larger the fluctuation of sensing signal the corresponding predictions of node displacements and bending moments are presented in figs 23 and 24 it is shown that the prediction capability of the developed algorithm is good enough even with sensor noises unless noise level is unrealistically large case 3 even in the worst case the predictions of displacements and bending moments are still good if high fluctuations are filtered which means that the developed algorithm is robust against physical

20592,in this paper the methodology for the real time tracing of riser profile and bending moment by multiple inclinometers along the riser is presented with the assumption that its top by gps global positioning system and bottom anchoring points are known the riser is modelled as a series of slender beam segments and at each time step the riser nodal points are progressively traced for riser x y z displacement and bending moment tracing quadratic and cubic interpolation functions for each line element between two neighboring bi axial inclinometers are employed with respect to the global and generalized coordinate systems analytical solutions are derived for the instantaneous riser profile and bending moment at each line s mid point to validate the developed riser monitoring algorithms a fpso floating production storage offloading system with scr steel catenary riser or slwr steel lazy wave riser was simulated for 1 yr and 50 yr collinear wind wave current storm conditions with 45 deg heading and the corresponding numerical sensor signals were inputted to the algorithms for reproducing the real time riser profiles and bending stresses based on the comparisons between the algorithm predicted and actual values the developed method is validated the methodology can be applied to any kinds and shapes of lines and cables too keywords riser profile tracing monitoring algorithm inclinometer bending moment quadratic cubic polynomial 1 introduction due to world economic growth the global consumption of oil and gas has continuously been increased many experts expect that this long term trend will not be changed in the near future in the oil gas production offshore structures have played an important role as a significant energy supply source the monitoring and maintenance of those offshore structures will continuously be a very critical issue in the offshore oil gas industry especially riser is a deeply submerged elastic pipeline to transfer oil and gas from well to platform so its safety is critically important therefore many researchers have investigated riser s structural health monitoring by using sensors and other methods chezhian et al 2006 investigated various riser monitoring methodologies currently available to the industry as part of ndp norwegian deepwater program furthermore cook et al 2006 analyzed the procedure for risk based integrity management applied to pipeline systems or top side equipments similarly integrity management systems that are currently employed in 17 offshore facilities are introduced by edwards et al 2005 also goldsmith et al 2007 described the development of alert levels and roles of monitoring for riser system failure and its impact on effective management system generally the monitoring methodology for the riser can be categorized into two approaches sensor based method and ndt non destructive testing method anderson 1987 the former analyzes sensor s signal by post processing after retrieval to find any malfunction or inherent structural problems the latter uses mri magnetic resonance image acoustic devices and underwater cameras with rovs remotely operated vehicles andersen et al 2001 the ndt methods are more direct but usually much more expensive than the sensor based method one of the critical drawbacks of the ndt approach is that continuous observation and monitoring of profile and stress are not possible which is especially very important for the estimation of accumulated fatigue damage and life time extension so far many sensor based monitoring methodologies were researched and reported ziegler and muskulus 2016 researched the advantages of sensor based monitoring technology using accelerometer inclinometer and strain gages the monitoring method based on localized strain and dynamic response measurement was reported by karayaka et al 2009 o donnell et al 2015 published the results that included scaled model tests and sensor measurement strategies with floating wind turbines and wave energy converters also li et al 2014 evaluated deep water risers fatigue by riser viv vortex induced vibration mcneill et al 2014 proposed a decision making process of quasi static angles along the riser applying the combination of acceleration and angular information furthermore morikawa et al 2010 proposed novel techniques for the integrity monitoring relying on optical fiber sensors with wire to transfer measured strain data in real time additionally peng and zhi 2012 researched various structure health monitoring methodologies like sensing technology optimal sensor arrangement and early warning along with their difficulties and advantages the sensor signals can be transmitted in real time through electrical lines acoustic telemetry li et al 2014 and optical signals andersen et al 2001 pipa et al 2010 otherwise the sensor signals should be stored and retrieved at the end of battery life for post processing for the post processing oma operational modal analysis for example can be used for the structural health monitoring kim et al 2019 the continuous energy supply for the sensor can be another important area to be researched for the long term structural health monitoring of risers for example the power supplying method using piezoelectric converters has been tested for subsea sensors jahangiri et al 2016 park et al 2008 investigated the energy harvesting related to low power embedded monitoring when only a small number of sensors are used machine learning algorithms can play a role in the structural health monitoring kim et al 2018 sohn et al 2001 in the present paper the algorithms for the real time tracing of riser profiles and internal stresses are developed by using multiple inclinometers along the riser since accelerometers are not used double time integration is not necessary to obtain riser s real time displacements as a result the profile tracing method is much more robust than the accelerometer based approach in addition the real time estimation of internal stresses and accumulated fatigue damages are also possible which has rarely been reported in the open literature to validate the developed algorithms riser dynamics of a fpso under typical sea environments are simulated by using a commercial software orcaflex then numerical inclinometers are distributed along the riser and they provide sensor signals like physical sensors subsequently the inputted sensor signals are applied to the developed algorithms to enable the real time prediction of instantaneous riser profiles and internal stresses lastly the real time predicted profiles and internal stresses are compared with the originally generated ones to validate the accuracy of the developed methodologies and algorithms 2 methodology riser profile tracing 2 1 derivation of curved line length equation in 3d in this section an analytical algorithm for tracing riser s instantaneous nodal displacements by using inclinometers along the riser is presented first let s consider the derivation of the curved line length equation in 3d space as shown in fig 1 the entire curve line length l p a p b can be calculated by the summation of linearized small segment l i lengths as 1 l p a p b i 1 n p i 1 p i the linearized small segment length can be expressed as 2 l i p i 1 p i x i 1 x i 2 y i 1 y i 2 z i 1 z i 2 δ x i 2 δ y i 2 δ z i 2 by applying the mean value theorem eq 3 with the decomposed quadratic interpolation functions fig 2 in the x z and x y planes the small segment length equation eq 2 can be re written as eq 4 3 m e a n v a l u e t h e o r e m δ y i f x i δ x i where x i in x i 1 x i δ z i g x i δ x i where x i in x i 1 x i 4 p i 1 p i δ x i 2 δ y i 2 δ z i 2 δ x i δ x i 2 f x i δ x i δ x i δ x i 2 f x i δ x i δ x i δ x i 2 f x i δ x i 2 g x i δ x i 2 1 f x i 2 g x i 2 δ x i by substituting derivative of arbitrary quadratic interpolation function eq 5 into eq 4 small segment length equation eq 2 can be re arranged including arbitrary coefficients eq 6 5 f x i 2 q 1 x i q 2 g x i 2 r 1 x i r 2 q 1 q 2 r 1 r 2 are arbitary coefficients 6 p i 1 p i 1 a x i 2 b x i c δ x i where a 4 q 1 2 r 1 2 b 4 q 1 q 2 r 1 r 2 c q 2 2 r 2 2 a b c are also arbitary coefficients the resulting integral can be done analytically as 7 l p a p b lim δ x 0 i 1 n p i 1 p i lim δ x 0 i 1 n 1 a x i 2 b x i c δ x a b 1 2 a x b 2 d x a b are also arbitary coefficients the analytically determined 3d curved line length equation will be used in the next section to sequentially solve for the entire instantaneous node displacements the axial elongation of riser by line tension is infinitesimally small and thus not included in the curved line length equation in the present algorithm x will represent a generalized coordinate s along the riser 2 2 node displacements calculation usually in fem finite element method beam theory displacements along the beam can be represented by the sum of elements with interpolation functions and it can be solved with given typically four boundary conditions therefore the riser node displacements can straightforwardly be traced if the four boundary conditions displacement and slope at both ends are given at each time step however in the present case only slopes are given at the inclinometer locations and thus typical fe formulas cannot be used on the other hand the displacements at the bottom and top points of a riser are to be known the bottom point is fixed at the seabed connection anchoring position the top point connection to surface platform is given in case of fixed platforms and can be real time traced by gps system in case of floating platforms additional accelerometers along the riser can also be employed to determine the instantaneous nodal displacements however simpler and cheaper solutions without additional accelerometer are of course better furthermore the accelerations need to be integrated twice to obtain the corresponding displacements which may be problematic in the presence of sensor noises choi and kim 2018 with the given information we derive the algorithm how all nodal displacements in 3d can be real time traced by using only the bi axial inclinometers as follows as shown in fig 3 it is assumed that sensors are attached along the entire riser arc length with an equal interval in this paper of course variable intervals can also be used by using the same algorithm the interpolation functions and boundary conditions are tabulated in table 1 also eq 8 shows interpolation functions used and their spatial derivatives with respect to the global coordinate system 8 f x z x a x z x 2 b x z x c x z d f x z d x 2 a x z x b x z by applying the boundary conditions at the first segment from the top hang off junction the third coefficient c of the interpolation function can be derived as 9 f x z x x a f x z x 0 0 c x z 0 continually with the combination of eq 8 and third boundary condition the second coefficient b of the interpolation function can be estimated as 10 d f x z d x x x a 0 θ x z a b x z θ x z a now one more condition is required to obtain the first coefficient of the interpolation function a as explained previously with fourth boundary condition eq 11 the equation for curved line length eq 12 between two points sensor interval can be applied here in the curve length equation the corresponding elastic elongation is so small that it can be neglected 11 d f x z d x x x b θ x z b 2 a x z x b b x z θ x z b 2 a x z x b θ x z a θ x z b 12 l x a x b 1 a x z x b x z 2 d x 0 x b 1 a x z x θ x z b 2 d x by using the equation of curved line length eq 12 and fourth boundary condition eq 11 the first coefficient of interpolation function a can finally be obtained as 13 f x z x a x z x 2 b x z x c x z w h e r e a x z 1 4 l θ x z b 2 1 θ x z b sinh 1 θ x z b θ x z a 2 1 θ x z a sinh 1 θ x z a b x z θ x z a c x z 0 the quadratic interpolation is employed to get the closed form length equation then the interpolation function can be expressed as a function of only inclinations θ x z a θ x z b as in eq 13 as a result the displacements x a n d z of the bottom point of the top element can be obtained as 14 x b θ x z b θ x z a 2 a x z z b f x z x b a x z x b 2 b x z x b c x z similarly we can repeat the same process with respect to the y direction so that the coefficients for y directional interpolation functions and nodal displacements can be obtained as in eq 15 and eq 16 15 f x y x a x y x 2 b x y x c x y w h e r e a x y 1 4 l θ x y b 2 1 θ x y b sinh 1 θ x y b θ x y a 2 1 θ x y a sinh 1 θ x y a b x y θ x y a c x y 0 16 y b f x y x b a x y x b 2 b x y x b c x y then the same procedure can be applied to the next elements and the process can be sequentially continued until the last elements finally the entire riser profile at a given time step can be produced from the given inputs from sensors in the case of structural health monitoring and accumulated fatigue damage assessment the real time estimation of riser internal stresses is important for that even if the instantaneous riser profile is obtained by a series of quadratic interpolation functions we still need to determine the distributions of bending moments and bending stresses through double spatial derivatives of the quadratic interpolation functions which may be problematic therefore in the next section we present an alternative approach regarding how the bending moment distribution along the riser can be obtained directly from the inclinometer signals 3 methodology riser bending moment in this section the analytical solution for riser bending moment estimation will be explained as explained previously if the quadratic interpolation function is used the curvature which is double spatial derivative of the interpolation function becomes constant therefore it cannot be used for proper bending moment distribution continuous at each nodal point thus the cubic interpolation function with respect to the generalized s coordinate system with directional cosine angles θ x a θ x b is employed eq 17 here with corresponding boundary conditions eq 18 chung et al 2019 this is possible since all the instantaneous nodal positions can be determined as explained in the previous section 17 v x s f v x a v x b θ x a θ x b s a 0 a 1 s a 2 s 2 a 3 s 3 18 v x s s a 0 v x a v x s s b l v x b d v d s s s a 0 θ x a d v d s s s b l θ x b applying boundary conditions eq 18 to the third order polynomial equation eq 17 the eq 17 can be re written as 19 v x s 1 3 s 2 l a b 2 2 s 3 l a b 3 v x a s 2 s 2 l a b s 3 l a b 2 θ x a 3 s 2 l a b 2 2 s 3 l a b 3 v x b s 3 l a b 2 s 2 l a b θ x b the third order polynomial equation can be re constructed as matrix form as 20 v x s n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 v x a θ x a v x b θ x b n ξ where n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 represent shape functions and ξ expresses the nodal displacements and inclinations by substituting eq 20 to normal stress for beam bending eq 21 eq 22 is derived 21 σ x s m x y max i y max e d 2 n d s 2 ξ 22 σ x s y max e 12 s l a b 3 6 l a b 2 v x a 6 s l a b 2 4 l a b θ x a 6 l a b 2 12 s l a b 3 v x b 6 s l a b 2 2 l a b θ x b then the beam bending moment equation can be derived as 23 m x ei 12 s l a b 3 6 l a b 2 v x a 6 s l a b 2 4 l a b θ x a 6 l a b 2 12 s l a b 3 v x b 6 s l a b 2 2 l a b θ x b eq 23 represents the distribution of bending moment along the line it is interesting to see that the bending moment at the mid point of each element can be obtained in a greatly simplified form by inputting s l a b 0 5 to eq 23 as 24 m x e i 1 l a b θ x b θ x a m y e i 1 l a b θ y b θ y a m z e i 1 l a b θ z b θ z a for those points other than the mid length point the second spatial derivative curvature of the cubic shape function can be used in the following section we will prove whether the derived analytical solutions for node displacements and bending moments can actually be used for the real time tracing of riser profile and bending moment from inclinometer signals only in the present numerical experiment the actual riser profile and bending moment were taken from the time domain system simulation by the commercial program orcaflex widely adapted in oil gas industry then the numerical riser inclination signals at the inclinometer locations were taken and inputted with the given top point from gps to the developed algorithm to see whether it can actually reproduce the actual riser profile and bending moment or stress at each time step the numerical experiment closely emulates the real situation except that the physical sensor is replaced by the numerical sensor the potentially detrimental effect of small physical sensor noise is also investigated in this study presented in the appendix a it was shown by authors choi and kim 2018 that the present algorithm is much more robust against sensor noises than the accelerometer based method since double time integration is not needed at each time step 4 explanation of target structure fpso with scr and slwr as a target structure fpso floating production storage and offloading system with scr steel catenary riser or slwr steel lazy wave riser is adopted in this paper it is well known that the scr may experience local dynamic buckling near touch down zone under extreme storm conditions kim and kim 2015 to circumvent the problem lazy wave risers are frequently employed fig 4 and fig 5 present the configuration of the fpso system with scr or slwr under 100 m water depth wd100 the sensor distribution along the riser with 10 m interval is presented in fig 6 as a floater the default fpso given by orcaflex was selected with the corresponding added mass radiation damping and first and second order wave loads orcina 2006 furthermore a total of 12 spread mooring lines with four groups are employed for the station keeping in 100 m water depth each mooring line consists of all chain components for entire arc length for the scr and slwr steel tube pipe with 356 mm outer diameter is used in the slwr case buoyancy modules are attached to make a lazy wave shape along the riser at arc length 100 m 110 m the details of the mooring and riser properties and slwr buoyancy modules are tabulated in table 2 table 3 and table 4 for scr and slwr line segment modeling each segment length of 0 1 m was used for orcaflex furthermore to represent seabed for the seabed touching riser elements the seabed stiffness of 50 kn m2 is considered for simplicity the seabed induced coulomb friction and damping effect are not considered in the numerical simulations for the boundary conditions at the hang off and anchor points frictionless hinged boundary condition b c is used as a typical condition of the riser the 1 yr and 50 yr storm conditions with a co linear wwc wind wave current heading of 45 are considered as detailed in table 5 for the wave and wind spectra jonswap wave and api wind spectra are adopted for the corresponding current profile 1 7 power law is applied as shown in eq 25 to demonstrate the prediction capability all the results are plotted for 200 s simulation duration 25 v v s b v s f v s b z z s b z s f z s b

depth 100 m case wd100 in this section various comparisons between the predicted and actual profiles and bending moments will be presented and discussed it is assumed that the bi axial inclinometers are attached uniformly along the entire riser arc length furthermore two different sensor intervals compact interval 2 m coarse interval 10 m are selected to show the sensor interval effect for both scr and slwr under 100 m water depth the fpso system with the respective riser is simulated first by the orcaflex computer program with the given inputs and parameters then the inclination and azimuthal angle signals are collected from the sensor locations next the developed algorithms are run by using the numerical sensor signals to trace the instantaneous riser profile and bending moments at any location along the riser finally the reconstructed riser profiles and bending moments are compared with the actual values at the respective time steps to assess the capability of the developed algorithms in section 5 the possible sensor noises are not considered however their effects are separately evaluated in appendix a also in author s independent study choi and kim 2018 the use of inclinometers is much less sensitive to sensor noises compared to accelerometer based tracing method in the following several example cases are explained and discussed first the riser profile tracing capability by the presently developed algorithm for the scr case is discussed for the time history of riser displacements four representative locations from top to bottom are selected i e 30 m upper 70 m middle 100 m lower and 130 m on seabed as specified by blue dots in fig 6 also based on the simulation results the tdp touch down point varied with time in the range of 120 m 130 m under 50 yr storm condition in fig 7 and fig 8 the respective x y z locations time histories for both compact int 2 m and coarse int 10 m sensor intervals are plotted and the averaged differences between the predicted algorithm and target orcaflex values are tabulated in appendix b both 1 yr and 50 yr storms are employed and both algorithm predicted and actual profiles are compared for both storm conditions the predicted riser movements at the upper middle lower locations excellently agree with the actual movements for both coarse and compact riser arrangements this implies that longer than 10 m interval can also be used for practical applications depending on the level of target accuracy at arc length 130 m location which is laid down on the seabed the profile tracing accuracy is still good even for 10 m sensor interval in the case of scr on the seabed the seabed stiffness causes the sudden change of riser curvature near the tdp and thus the accuracy of the prediction algorithm is affected to further explain this the same scr cases without seabed stiffness are presented in fig 9 and the differences between the predicted algorithm and target orcaflex values are tabulated in appendix b it is confirmed that there is almost no difference between the predicted and actual profiles regardless of the sensor interval since the curvature of the scr smoothly changes with hanging profile below seabed if seabed stiffness is not considered fig 9 this is true even for the case of sparse sensor interval therefore the sensors need to be arranged with smaller spacing when the curvature changes rapidly and high accuracy is needed in fig 10 and fig 11 the corresponding bending moment comparisons at the middle point and off middle point of each element s l 0 5 and 0 75 are presented similarly the averaged differences between the predicted algorithm and target orcaflex values are given in appendix b for each figure the results for mid arc length point at 75 m and 3 near touch down locations are plotted since the tdp near the arc length of about 124 m is the most critical region in view of bending stress three locations near tdp are selected arc length 115 m 125 m and 135 m as was pointed out in the theoretical description simple analytical results are available for the bending moment at the middle of each sensor interval while for other locations the bending moment can be obtained by differentiating twice the cubic shape function of riser profile in all cases we observe the excellent recovery of actual bending moments at both the middle s l 0 5 and off mid locations s l 0 75 by the developed algorithm as can intuitively be expected the compact interval produces more accurate prediction than sparse interval more interestingly even the sparse cases give good recovery of actual values which is very important in practical applications for saving budget for both 1 yr and 50 yr storms the predicted bending moments by the developed algorithm reasonably well follow the actual bending moments the prediction accuracy of the coarse interval case near tdp and on seabed is slightly worse than that of other upper locations as was already seen in the displacement tracing examples that can be attributed to the sudden change of line curvature at the tdp to double check this another set of simulations without seabed stiffness were conducted in fig 12 in this case the agreement between the predicted and actual bending moments is excellent even for 10 m sensor interval regardless of the locations and storm conditions in appendix b the differences between the predicted algorithm and target orcaflex values are presented next let us consider the slwr instead of scr the scr may experience local dynamic buckling problem when hull heave pitch motions are excessive kim and kim 2015 in this case to avoid that kind of problem slwr needs to be used although it is more expensive and problematic in flow assurance since the developed algorithms can be applied to any types of line shapes the prediction capability for a slwr is also examined in the following intuitively it is required that the sensors should be arranged densely around the highly curve reversed lazy wave zone arc length 100 m 110 m to have good prediction accuracy the same algorithms and sensor intervals are applied to the slwr movements and the results are compared at four locations i e at arc length 30 m 70 m 100 m and 120 m with compact and coarse sensor distributions the corresponding time histories are presented in fig 13 compact interval 2 m and fig 14 coarse interval 10 m and the errors are tabulated in appendix b due to the geometric characteristic of the lazy wave shape the dynamic motions of the slwr in x y and z directions near concave and tdp at 90 m and 128 m are significantly reduced compared to those of scr at 124 m also the compact interval case can follow the rapid change of riser curvature in the lazy wave zone much better than the course interval case as for the upper portion above the lazy wave zone even the coarse interval case can predict the overall shape very well therefore sensor distribution can be coarse for the upper portion but needs to be denser around the lazy wave zone to achieve high accuracy in the case of coarse sensor interval if a point of inflection exists within the element the representation of line by quadratic shape function may not be accurate therefore adjusted sensor arrangement may be needed near the lazy wave zone with double reverse curvature in this regard the case of optimal sensor arrangement with variable intervals is also presented by green dashed line for 100 m and 120 m arc lengths in the adjusted sensor arrangement 10 m interval is used except for near the lazy wave zone arc length 90 m 110 m for which 2 m interval is applied as can be seen in the same figure fig 14 the adjusted sensor location green dashed line can produce satisfactorily high accuracy since the bottom touching portion of the slwr is small the modeling of the seabed stiffness in this case is not an important issue finally the bending moment time histories of the slwr at three locations arc length 55 m 85 m and 105 m are presented in fig 15 and fig 16 also the mean values of errors are summarized in appendix b fig 15 is for the mid point of the respective elements and fig 16 is for the 3 4 point of each element off middle both figures show the comparisons for compact and coarse intervals the 85 m and 105 m locations are around the lazy wave zone since it is the most critical region in view of high bending stresses since the curvature variation of the lazy wave zone is relatively large so denser sensor arrangement is needed there to capture the rapid change and improve the prediction accuracy green dashed line as shown in figs 15 and 16 however for the upper portions of the slwr even the coarse sensor arrangement gives good enough prediction accuracy which helps the sensor designers to devise the most cost effective sensor based monitoring methodology so far the tracing of riser profile and bending stress along the riser by using multiple bi axial inclinometers was presented for the monitoring of accumulated fatigue of risers axial tension is additionally needed the tension along the riser can be traced by using tension sensor at its top with a proper algorithm as explained in kim et al 2021 the developed algorithms can in principle also be applied when additional riser motion complexity exists due to viv finally fig 17 shows several snapshots of scr and slwr profiles with 10 m sensor interval for scr and optimized interval for slwr under 50 yr storm at different time steps it demonstrates that the whole profile can reliably be traced in real time by the developed algorithms 5 2 water depth 1000 m case wd1000 in this section the algorithm is additionally tested for the case of fpso with scr in deepwater 1000 m fig 18 shows the configuration of the system and its sensor arrangement the mooring line consists of chain polyester rope chain and their respective arc lengths are 200 m 1000 m 200 m the same riser properties are employed to build the riser model although the developed algorithm is generic and not influenced by the riser properties for profile tracing 15 bi axial inclinometers are attached along the riser total length 1500 m with 100 m interval in this case the sensor interval is ten times larger than the previous wd100 case as an environmental loading the same 50 yr storm condition is used fig 19 shows the time histories of scr node displacements and the differences between the predicted and target values are tabulated in appendix b like the previous cases four nodal points along the riser arc length are selected for node displacement tracing several snapshots of the entire riser profile are also plotted in fig 20 overall it is confirmed that the developed algorithm can still predict the scr motion very well even with 100 m interval next the corresponding comparisons of bending moments are plotted in fig 21 and the averaged differences are also summarized in appendix b since the most critical region of the riser monitoring is around tdp arc length 1200 m 1300 m the bending moments at those three locations near tdp as well as one additional location at mid length 750 m are compared as it is shown the differences between the predicted and target values are small even with 100 m sensor spacing thus it is confirmed that the developed algorithm can still be applied to deep water system with sufficiently large spacing also the computational time for the algorithm is minimal so that the real time riser monitoring is possible since the developed algorithm is general it can be applied to any types of risers mooring lines and cables too 6 conclusions to monitor or predict riser dynamic responses and the corresponding bending moments by using multiple inclinometer signals unique algorithms were developed based on the high order rod element fe formulas and analytic curve length equation in 3d the top and bottom points were assumed to be known for riser x y z displacement tracing quadratic interpolation functions for each line element between two neighboring bi axial inclinometers were employed with respect to the global coordinate system then from the analytic solutions with given angle sensor inputs the node positions along the riser were sequentially obtained node by node at each time step as for bending moments cubic interpolation function with respect to the generalized coordinate system was employed to allow double spatial derivative of shape function with the given scheme a simplified analytic formula for the bending moment at the mid point of each riser segment can be obtained furthermore through double spatial derivative of the shape function the bending moments or stresses at any points along the riser can be obtained at each time step to validate the developed real time riser monitoring algorithms a fpso system with scr or slwr was simulated for 1 yr and 50 yr collinear wind wave current conditions with 45 deg heading and the corresponding numerical sensor signals were inputted to the algorithms for reproducing the real time riser profiles and bending moments or stresses for the target value simulation orcaflex widely adopted commercial program was used two different sensor intervals compact int 2 m and coarse int 10 m under 100 m water depth were tested for cross checking also an additional deepwater water deep 1000 m case was tested to further check the applicability of the developed algorithm with much larger sensor interval 100 m several conclusions can be drawn based on the presented results as below overall the real time prediction of riser profiles and bending moments or stresses by using the inclinometer signals with the developed algorithms agrees well with the actual values for both scr and slwr regardless of sea environmental conditions the coarse sensor interval performed well compared to the compact sensor interval if riser shape varies smoothly along the arc length if there is an inflection point within the interval around which curvature rapidly changes high accuracy is not necessarily warranted in this case adjusted sensor arrangement is recommended for the high curvature varying region the bending moments and bending stresses can be predicted equally well as the riser profiles when proper sensor arrangement is used deepwater 1000 m scr with much larger sensor interval also produced reliable results the developed algorithms also turned out to be robust against typical sensor noises credit authorship contribution statement woo chul chung conceptualization methodology

artificial sensor noise in this appendix the effect of artificial sensor noise is investigated to make it closer to physical sensors in the real system as a target structure fpso with scr at 100 m water depth is considered for 50 yr storm condition same as that in section 5 1 here the previous numerical sensor signals are superposed with artificially generated random noises with a given standard deviation value three different standard deviations of noise are considered table 6 the first case is typical noise standard deviation provided by a sensor manufacturer kim et al 2021 while the second and third cases have larger sensor noises than that to check the overall robustness of the developed algorithm against larger sensor noises the angle sensor signals with the three different noise levels are plotted in fig 22 as expected the greater the standard deviation of sensor noise the larger the fluctuation of sensing signal the corresponding predictions of node displacements and bending moments are presented in figs 23 and 24 it is shown that the prediction capability of the developed algorithm is good enough even with sensor noises unless noise level is unrealistically large case 3 even in the worst case the predictions of displacements and bending moments are still good if high fluctuations are filtered which means that the developed algorithm is robust against physical

20593,in order to mitigate the maximum displacement and stress in the lateral buckling of subsea pipelines triggered by the sleeper lateral constraint can be installed at the end of the sleeper to restrict the deflection of the buckled pipeline in this study the lateral buckling of subsea pipelines triggered by a sleeper with lateral constraint is analysed with considering the contact between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint the mathematical model is validated through comparing the analytical solutions with finite element results and test data the influence of the sleeper length on the buckled configurations and post buckling behaviour is investigated focusing on the process after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the amplitudes of deflection and stress along the buckled pipeline are compared to determine the maximum deflection and the maximum stress a parametric analysis is carried out to show the effect of sleeper length on the amplitude of deflection extrema of stress and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the results show that both the maximum deflection and maximum stress along the buckled pipeline become smaller compared to the case without lateral constraint after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint keywords sleeper with lateral constraint subsea pipeline lateral buckling buckle initiation technique 1 introduction for subsea pipelines operating under high pressure and high temperature conditions lateral buckling can jeopardize the structural integrity of the pipeline if it is not properly controlled sleeper as one of the main buckle initiation techniques sinclair et al 2009 is usually used to trigger lateral buckling of subsea pipelines both symmetric and antisymmetric buckling modes can be triggered when a sleeper is employed sinclair et al 2009 wang and tang 2020a when the symmetric buckling mode is triggered both the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress locate at the sleeper thus lateral constraints such as concrete mattresses can be designed to be installed at the ends of the sleeper to avoid a possible pipeline fall off the sleeper and a possible structural failure solano et al 2014 in this study analytical formulations are proposed to study the lateral buckling behaviour triggered by a sleeper with lateral constraints to date extensive research has been conducted to investigate the mechanism of global buckling the first analytical studies about lateral and upheaval buckling of ideal pipelines may have been carried out by hobbs 1984 through assuming the specified mode shapes taylor and gan 1986 studied the influence of the initial imperfection on the upheaval and lateral buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines croll 1997 proposed a simplified analytical model to investigate upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines with initial imperfections the lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines was investigated by karampour et al 2013 they compared the lateral and upheaval responses of a subsea pipeline shi et al 2013 carried out the research about the influence of seabed resistance on upheaval buckling for a pipeline on a plastic soft seabed liu and co authors hong et al 2015 liu and wang 2018 used analytical methods to study high order lateral buckling for a pipeline with a single arch symmetric and a two arch anti symmetric initial imperfection taking nonlinear pipe soil interaction model into account localised lateral and upheaval buckling for unburied and buried subsea ideal pipelines were studied in wang and van der heijden 2017 2020a wang et al 2018d they discussed the influences of breakout resistance and buried depth on the buckling behaviour upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines on the step imperfection seabed was investigated through analytical and finite element method in chen et al 2020 wang and van der heijden 2020b moreover the finite element method has also been widely employed to study lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines in recent years liu and li 2018 liu et al 2014 xu and lin 2017 zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018 as for the research about buckle initiation techniques simple analytical solutions were derived for lateral buckling triggered by a single buoyancy two equal buoyancies or distributed buoyancy with a specific length peek and yun 2007 the critical load of lateral buckling triggered by a single buoyancy was also investigated by shi and wang 2015 for lateral buckling triggered by single distributed buoyancy section analytical solutions were derived by li et al 2016 and wang et al 2018a 2017b they found that both the minimum critical temperature difference and the maximum stress would reduce when the submerged weight of the distributed buoyancy section decreased chee et al 2018 2019 investigated another method to trigger the lateral buckling in which the pipeline is pre deformed continuously with sinusoidal shape prior to the installation furthermore analytical solutions of lateral buckling triggered by dual distributed buoyancy sections were derived by wang and tang 2020b c comparisons between symmetric and antisymmetric buckling modes triggered by the same dual distributed buoyancy sections were discussed they found that symmetric mode was prone to be triggered for relative small spacing between dual distributed buoyancy sections the symmetric mode was more dangerous than the antisymmetric mode for most situations however the antisymmetric mode was more dangerous only when the weight ratio coefficient was small enough with respect to lateral buckling triggered by sleeper the experiments were carried out by silva junior et al 2008 and de oliveira cardoso and solano 2015 lateral buckling triggered by dual sleepers was investigated by bai et al 2009 through finite element method based on the finite element results and the genetic algorithms some empirical formulas for lateral buckling triggered by single sleeper were derived by wang et al 2017a moreover analytical solutions for symmetric and antisymmetric buckling modes triggered by single sleeper were derived by wang et al 2020a 2018b 2018c they found that the symmetric buckling mode preferred to occur for smaller sleeper friction or smaller sleeper height however the antisymmetric mode was prone to take place for larger sleeper friction and larger sleeper height hong and liu studied the feature of lifting deformation for a pipeline laid on a sleeper through finite element method hong and liu 2020 from our previous study wang et al 2018c both the displacement amplitude and maximum stress along the buckled pipeline locate at the sleeper when symmetric buckling mode is triggered by sleeper the direct way to control the displacement amplitude and maximum stress is to restrict the deflection at the sleeper thus in this study a simple and efficient method is proposed to control the displacement amplitude and maximum stress in an acceptable level which is to install some constraints at the ends of the sleeper after the buckled pipeline touches the constraint both the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress will be restricted therefore the main aim of this study is to propose a mathematical model to simulate the buckling behaviour after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper the analytical solutions are compared with finite element results and experimental results to verify the mathematical model employing the derived analytical solutions the influence of the temperature difference and sleeper length on the buckled configurations and post buckling behaviour is discussed the locations of displacement amplitude and the maximum stress are determined through comparing different extrema of deflection and stress along the buckled pipeline a parametric analysis is carried out to show the influence of sleeper length on the amplitude of deflection extrema of stress axial compressive force and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint 2 analytical solution in order to obtain the analytical solutions the following assumptions are made 1 buckling mode 3 in the classification of hobbs 1984 is assumed for lateral deflection 2 the euler bernoulli beam theory is used to simulate the subsea pipeline 3 lateral and axial soil resistances are assumed to be constant 4 the seabed is assumed to be rigid 5 the axial compressive force within the buckled region is assumed to be constant when solving the buckled configuration both symmetric and antisymmetric buckling modes may be triggered when the sleeper is used as the buckle initiation technique sinclair et al 2009 when a symmetric buckling mode is triggered both the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress locate at the sleeper therefore the pipe section at the sleeper may fail first in order to improve the integrity of the pipeline the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress at the sleeper should be effectively controlled in this study a sleeper with lateral constraints installed at the ends of the sleeper is employed to trigger lateral buckling the pipeline can only move on the sleeper within the two lateral constraints at the end of the sleeper when it buckles and deforms laterally the deflection of the buckled pipeline will be restricted when the buckled pipeline contacts with the constraint at the end of the sleeper thus both the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress will reduce compared to the case of sleeper without constraint in this section the analytical solution of pipeline buckling triggered by the sleeper with lateral constraints is derived the pipeline will buckle when the axial compressive force denoted by p 0 induced by temperature difference reaches the critical value due to the suspended pipe section introduced by the sleeper the critical load for the pipe segment at the sleeper is lower than other locations so that the buckle prefers to occur at the location of sleeper after the buckle takes place a small pipe section will deflect laterally see fig 1 b the axial compressive force see fig 2 reduces because the additional pipe coming from thermal expansion feeds into the buckle beyond the buckled section the axial compressive force accumulates due to the axial soil resistance at some points the requirement of additional pipe length introduced by the lateral displacement is satisfied by the thermal expansion where the axial compressive force increases to the force p 0 and there is no axial deflection fig 2 shows the typical compressive force variation the length of total feed in region is denoted by 2 l s the deformed shape and load distribution of the lateral buckling triggered by sleeper with lateral constraints at the end of the sleeper are illustrated in fig 1 the deflections of the subsea pipeline in the vertical and horizontal directions are denoted by v and w respectively in the analytical formulations presented in this section the euler bernoulli beam theory is employed to simulate the pipeline we consider the deformations in the vertical and horizontal directions separately which are only coupled by the contact force and friction for a pipeline on the sleeper the solutions of vertical deflection see fig 1 a were derived by wang et al 2018b 2018c the contact concentrated forces between the pipeline and sleeper f s and between the pipeline and seabed at the touchdown point f t respectively are 1 f s 4 3 q l 1 a n d f t 1 3 q l 1 where q is the submerged weight per unit length of the pipeline and l 1 is the half length of the free span which can be obtained by 2 l 1 72 e i v

section in eq 5 the axial force within the buckled section l 1 x l 3 is assumed constant and equal to the force p at the centre of the buckle when we calculate the lateral deflections an error analysis was conducted to show this assumption is acceptable wang et al 2018a b now let 6 λ 2 p e i the general solutions of eq 5 are 7 w 1 x b 1 cos λ x b 2 sin λ x b 3 x b 4 0 x l 1 w 2 x b 5 cos λ

the sleeper the slope of the deflection w 1 at x 0 is always zero due to symmetry which is expressed as 8 d w 1 d x 0 0 before the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper the shear force f o w μ s f s 2 at the sleeper is induced by the friction force 2 f o w between pipeline and sleeper the corresponding boundary condition is 9 d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 f o w e i 0 after the contact between the buckled pipeline and the sleeper the lateral deflection is restricted the friction force between pipeline and sleeper vanishes and transfers to the contact force between the buckled pipeline and the sleeper so that the corresponding boundary conditions are 10 w 1 0 d d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 f d 2 e i 0 where d is the distance that the pipe can move laterally on the sleeper from the original unbuckled state so that the total sleeper length is 2 d d and f d is the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint and can be calculated by 11 f d 2 e i d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 at the end of the buckled section the displacement slope and moment at x l 3 are zero the corresponding boundary conditions at x l 3 are 12 w 3 l 3 0 d w 3 d x l 3 0 d 2 w 3 d x 2 l 3 0 the displacement slope and bending moment are continuous at x l 1 while a lateral concentrated friction force f t μ l f t exists at x l 1 resulting from f t at l 1 so there is a jump in the shear force at x l 1 therefore the following matching conditions are required at x l 1 13 w 1 l 1 w 2 l 1 d w 1 d x l 1 d w 2 d x l 1 d 2 w 1 d x 2 l 1 d 2 w 2 d x 2 l 1 d 3 w 1 d x 3 l 1 d 3 w 2 d x 3 l 1 f t e i in addition the displacement slope moment and shear force are continuous at x l 2 and the displacement at x l 2 must be zero so the following matching conditions at x l 2 are imposed 14

thermal expansion and lateral deflection which is written as 15 u 1 u 2 where u 1 is the axial expansion within the half feed in region 0 x l s and u 2 is the additional length required to form the lateral deflection u 1 is calculated by 16 u 1 0 l s δ p x e a d x where δ p x p 0 p x is the reduction of axial compressive force and a is the cross sectional area of the pipe meanwhile u 2 is given

coefficient of linear thermal expansion and t 0 is here the total temperature difference between the fluid flowing inside the pipe and the environment the bending moment m along the buckled pipe is calculated by 19 m e i d 2 w d x 2 where w stands for either w 1 w 2 or w 3 the bending stress σ m along the pipeline can be obtained by 20 σ m m d 2 i where d is the external diameter of the pipe the maximum stress σ m is 21 σ m σ p σ m m where the stresses σ p and σ m m resulted from the axial force p and the maximum bending moment m m respectively are 22 σ p p a σ m m m m d 2 i 3 analytical results lateral buckling of a typical pipeline triggered by a sleeper with lateral constraint at the sleeper end is investigated the deformed shapes and bending stresses along the buckled pipeline with different temperature differences and sleeper lengths are analysed and the method to determine the amplitude of deflection and bending stress is explained the effect of lateral constraint on the typical buckling behaviour is discussed which focuses on the evolution of the results after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper moreover the influence of sleeper length on the amplitude of deflection w m extrema of stress σ m axial compressive force p and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint f d under specific temperature differences is discussed in detail the results in this section are obtained by using the analytical formulation developed in section 2 taking the parameters in table 1 3 1 validation in order to validate the analytical formulations a finite element model of the subsea pipeline with a sleeper underneath is proposed through abaqus harper 2009 the beam element pipe32h in abaqus is suitable for the simulation of pipeline wang et al 2015 the seabed is assumed to be a rigid surface which is the same assumption in the analytical method rigid surface elements r3d4 element in abaqus are selected to simulate the seabed the sleeper is also assumed to be a rigid surface with a semi circle section which is laid under the pipeline both ends of the pipeline are pinned the total model length of the pipeline is 2000 m half model length is denoted by l a i e l a 1000 m a local initial imperfection with the wavelength of 50 m and the amplitude of 0 2 m is introduced at the centre of the pipeline to initiate the lateral buckle the implicit dynamic method is selected as the calculation method to simulate the lateral buckling response of subsea pipeline the parameters listed in table 1 are used in finite element analyses when l s is smaller than l a then all the formulae derived in section 2 can be applied when l s is larger than l a the formula for axial force should be modified due to the limit of the length of the axial feed in region in that case by axial force balance the following equation can be obtained 23 p a p f a t f a l a l 1 where p a is the axial force at the end of the pipeline and the axial expansion within 0 x l a is modified to 24 u 1 0 l a δ p x e a d x where δ p x p 0 p x the comparison between analytical solutions and fea results is showed in fig 3 for the results obtained by fea both the displacement amplitude w m and maximum stress σ m increase with temperature difference gradually due to the existence of the initial imperfection the axial force p obtained by fea increases with temperature difference along the path p 0 e a α t 0 until the temperature difference reaches t n then it reduces with temperature difference for analytical solutions no initial imperfection is considered and two branches exist denoted by m b and m c respectively the temperature difference corresponding to state m is called the minimum critical temperature difference t m the branches m b and m c are stable and unstable respectively wang et al 2018c from fig 3 the discrepancy of w m between analytical solutions and fea becomes larger along the stable buckling path m b however the discrepancies of σ m and p between analytical solutions and fea are small along the stable buckling path m b taking t 0 50 c for instance the displacement amplitudes w m of analytical solutions and fea are 5 512 m and 4 545 m respectively the discrepancy between which is 17 54 the maximum stress σ m of analytical solutions and fea at t 0 50 c are 401 701 mpa and 411 242 mpa respectively the discrepancy between which is 2 37 the axial force p of analytical solutions and fea results at t 0 50 c are 0 153 mn and 0 158 mn respectively the discrepancy between which is 3 27 even though the discrepancy of displacement amplitude between analytical solutions and fea is large the differences of maximum stress and axial force are in an acceptable level there are two main reasons leading to this discrepancy on one hand the discrepancy comes from different methods to simulate seabed resistance in the analytical modelling the resistance provided by the seabed is assumed constant however in fea it is simulated by the interaction between pipeline and seabed through surface to surface contact on the other hand the discrepancy may come from the initial imperfections in the fea and the assumption of lateral deflection in the analytical modelling to verify which method to simulate seabed resistance is better the experimental investigation or site survey should be carried out therefore the comparison between the analytical results obtained in this paper and test data obtained by the reduced scale model test de oliveira cardoso and solano 2015 is presented in fig 4 the test parameters used in the reduced scale model test in de oliveira cardoso and solano 2015 are listed in table 2 the analytical results in fig 4 are also calculated by the parameters in table 2 the total pipe length in de oliveira cardoso and solano 2015 was 195 m three sleepers with equal spacing of 2 l a 65 m were installed to trigger lateral buckling the results from model test and analytical method are compared in fig 4 where the displacement amplitude w m is displayed the present analytical results appear to agree very well with the test data 3 2 buckled configuration in fig 5 the effect of temperature difference on the buckled configurations is illustrated from fig 5 a the amplitudes of the deflection in the positive and negative directions are denoted by w m 1 and w m 2 respectively from fig 5 b the bending stress at the centre of the buckled pipeline is denoted by σ m 0 where the sleeper locates a minimum of bending stress close to the centre denoted by σ m 1 exists after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the maxima of bending stress in the positive direction is denoted by σ m 2 the locations of amplitudes of the deflection and extrema of bending stress along the buckled pipeline denoted by x w m 1 x w m 2 x σ m 0 x σ m 1 and x σ m 2 see fig 5 are determined by d w d x 0 and d 3 w d x 3 0 respectively from fig 5 a for t 0 30 c the deflection at the sleeper doesn t reach the lateral constraint so that the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper has no influence on the buckled pipeline for this case the buckled lobe at the centre is much larger than the adjacent lobes away from the centre the amplitude of the deflection in the positive direction w m 1 is much larger than that in the negative direction w m 2 from fig 5 b for t 0 30 c an extremum of bending stress locates at the centre of the buckled pipeline which absolute value is larger than other extrema of bending stress from fig 5 a the buckled pipeline reaches the end of the sleeper and contacts with the lateral constraint when the temperature difference increases up to 40 c after the contact between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint appears the central lobe is restrained due to the existence of the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper however the lobes in the opposite direction enlarge with increasing temperature difference from fig 5 b the bending stress at the centre of the buckled pipeline σ m 0 increases with increasing temperature difference before the buckled pipeline touches the lateral constraint which is barely affected by the temperature difference after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint after the contact the minima of bending stress σ m 1 appears at the location close to the centre which increases slightly with increasing temperature difference the maxima of bending stress in the positive direction σ m 2 also becomes larger for larger temperature difference the effect of temperature difference on σ m 2 is much larger than that on σ m 1 the effect of sleeper length on the buckled configurations under t 0 40 c is shown in fig 6 the total sleeper length is 2 d d so that d will be used to represent the sleeper length during the discussion from fig 6 a for the case of no lateral constraint i e the sleeper length is infinite or large enough the buckled pipeline does not reach the end of the sleeper thus the lateral constraint has no effect on the buckled pipeline for this case the central buckled lobe in the positive direction is much larger than the rest lobes in the negative direction when the value of d is smaller than the value of the deflection at the sleeper for the case of no lateral constraint the buckled pipeline will be restricted by the lateral constraint taking d 15 d as an example the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the central lobe at the sleeper shrinks due to the restriction of the lateral constraint while the lobes in the opposite direction enlarge for smaller sleeper length the central buckled lobe at the sleeper shrinks further while the buckled lobes in the opposite direction enlarge further for d 5 d the amplitude of the deflection in the negative direction w m 2 absolute value becomes larger than that in the positive direction at the sleeper from fig 6 b the bending stress along the buckled pipeline is not affected by the lateral constraint before the buckled pipeline reaches the end of the sleeper after the contact between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the bending stress at the sleeper σ m 0 reduces and two extra extrema of bending stress appear close to the centre of the buckled pipeline both σ m 0 and σ m 1 become smaller for smaller sleeper length however the maxima of bending stress in the positive direction σ m 2 become larger when the sleeper length decreases for d 5 d the value of σ m 2 becomes larger than that of σ m 0 and σ m 1 absolute value 3 3 typical buckling behaviour in fig 7 the influence of sleeper length on the typical buckling behaviour is illustrated the cases of d in fig 7 represent the situation that the sleeper length is long enough so that the buckled pipeline can t reach the end of the sleeper in this case there is no contact between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper for d the buckled pipeline behaves like there is no lateral constraint for d two cases of friction coefficient between sleeper and pipeline are considered i e μ s 0 and μ s 0 1 before the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the buckled pipeline will move on the sleeper with increasing temperature difference in this situation the friction between the buckled pipeline and sleeper will be mobilised which should be implemented into the analytical model i e using μ s 0 1 for d μ s 0 1 the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint f d as shown in fig 7 f is constant and represents the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper the buckled pipeline will stop at the end of the sleeper after it contacts with the lateral constraint in this situation the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper will vanish the case of d μ s 0 is a reference state where both the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint and the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper are zero as shown in fig 7 f from fig 7 the pipeline will buckle when the temperature difference increases up to the minimum critical temperature difference t m with further increase of the temperature difference the pipeline will evolve along the path m b 1 both the amplitudes of deflection w m 1 and w m 2 and the extrema of stress σ m 0 σ m 1 and σ m 2 increase along the path m b 1 with increasing temperature difference see fig 7 a d the axial compressive force p decreases along the path m b 1 with increasing temperature difference see fig 7 e the value of f d is constant along the path m b 1 and represents the friction force between the buckled pipeline and sleeper as shown in fig 7 f with further increase of the temperature difference all the results shown in fig 7 develop along the path b 1 b 2 when the sleeper length is long enough in this case the buckled pipeline can t reach the end of the sleeper along the whole path m b 2 the friction force between the buckled pipeline and sleeper should be taken into account since the buckled pipeline moves on the sleeper with increasing temperature difference however for small sleeper length such as d 10 d the buckled pipeline will reach the end of the sleeper and contact with the lateral constraint at a certain temperature difference once the buckled pipeline arrives at the end of the sleeper the buckled pipeline will stop to move so that the friction force between the buckled pipeline and sleeper will vanish at the same time this friction force will convert into the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint i e at the state b 1 shown in fig 7 f taking d 10 d as an example the amplitude of the deflection at the sleeper w m 1 will keep constant along the path b 1 b 3 due to the restriction of lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper see fig 7 a however the amplitude of the deflection in the negative direction w m 2 increases in a faster speed along the path b 1 b 3 with increasing temperature difference see fig 7 b the reason is that the central lobe in the positive direction is restrained by the lateral constraint so that the lobes in the opposite direction enlarge with increasing temperature difference see fig 5 a under the same temperature difference the amplitude of the deflection in the negative direction w m 2 is larger for smaller sleeper length after the contact between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the comparison of the amplitudes of the deflection in the positive and negative directions is shown in fig 8 a for the case of d i e the sleeper length is long enough the value of w m 1 is always larger than that of w m 2 under the same temperature difference which means that the amplitude of the deflection at the sleeper is always larger than other amplitudes of the deflection however when the sleeper length is not long enough the buckled pipeline will be restricted by the lateral constraint after the contact the value of w m 1 keeps constant while the value of w m 2 increases with increasing temperature difference when the temperature difference increases to t 0 c 1 the value of w m 1 is equal to w m 2 for t 0 t 0 c 1 the value of w m 2 is larger than that of w m 1 from fig 7 c for a specific sleeper length the extremum of stress at the sleeper σ m 0 is barely affected by temperature difference after the contact between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the extremum of stress σ m 1 increases with increasing temperature difference however its increasing rate is smaller than that of σ m 0 for the case of d under the same temperature difference both the values of σ m 0 and σ m 1 are larger for larger sleeper length from fig 7 d for a specific sleeper length after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint σ m 2 increases with increasing temperature difference along the path b 1 b 3 whose increasing rate is larger than that for the case of d the comparison of the extrema of the stress in the positive and negative directions is shown in fig 8 b for the case of d the stress at the sleeper σ m 0 is always larger than that of σ m 2 under the same temperature difference this means that the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline always locates at the sleeper before the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the extremum of stress σ m 1 close to the sleeper appears and is larger than σ m 0 under the same temperature difference therefore the extremum of stress σ m 0 at the sleeper can t become the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint after the contact the increasing rate of σ m 2 is larger than that of σ m 1 with increasing temperature difference for t 0 t 0 c 2 the value of σ m 1 is the largest thus the stress σ m 1 is the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline for t 0 t 0 c 2 the value of σ m 2 is the largest so the stress σ m 2 is the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline thus during the design process it s better to calculate the extrema of stress in both positive and negative directions the maximum stress can be determined after comparing all the extrema of stress along the buckled pipeline from fig 7 e when the temperature difference increases up to t 0 b 1 the buckled pipeline starts to contact with the lateral constraint with further increasing temperature difference the deflection at the sleeper is restricted by the sleeper see fig 7 a the axial compressive force p first increases slightly due to the restriction of lateral constraint then it decreases with increasing temperature difference along the path b 1 b 3 the axial compressive force p is larger for smaller sleeper length from fig 7 f when the temperature difference increases up to t 0 b 1 the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper converts into the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint then with further increasing temperature difference the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint f d increases with increasing temperature difference along the path b 1 b 3 the contact concentrated force f d is larger for smaller sleeper length during the design process the resistance on sleeper provided by the soil foundation should be larger than f d the sleeper may slide horizontally when f d is larger than the resistance on sleeper provided by the soil foundation 3 4 parametric analysis on the influence of sleeper length a detailed parametric analysis on the influence of sleeper length under specific temperature differences is illustrated in fig 9 from fig 9 a for t 0 50 c the amplitude of deflection at the sleeper w m 1 increases linearly while w m 2 decreases linearly with increasing sleeper length for d d e 2 in fact the buckled pipeline always contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper for d d e 2 since the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint f d is larger than zero see fig 9 d both the stresses σ m 0 and σ m 1 increase while σ m 2 decreases with increasing sleeper length for d d e 2 the stress σ m 2 is the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline for d d e 1 while σ m 1 is the maximum stress for d e 1 d d e 2 the stress σ m 0 is the maximum stress for d d e 2 with increasing sleeper length for d d e 2 the restriction of the lateral constraint on the deflection reduces so that both the axial compressive force p and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint f d decrease when the value of d increases up to d e 2 the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint f d converts into the friction force between the pipeline and the sleeper suddenly and reduces to zero with further increasing sleeper length all the results are not affected and keep constant since the buckled pipeline doesn t contact with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper anymore 4 conclusions a sleeper with end constraint is introduced to trigger lateral buckling and to control the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline the mathematical model is proposed and analytical solutions are derived through considering the contact between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint at the end of sleeper the analytical solutions are compared with finite element results and test data to validate the mathematical model the influence of the lateral constraint on the buckled configuration and typical buckling behaviour is discussed the amplitudes of deflection and extrema of stress along the buckled pipelines are compared to determine the maximum deflection and the maximum stress a parametric analysis is performed to show the effect of sleeper length on the amplitude of deflection extrema of stress axial compressive force and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the findings are summarised as follows i before the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of sleeper the central lobe around the sleeper is much larger than other lobes the maximum deflection and the maximum bending stress along the buckled pipeline locate at the sleeper after the contact the central lobe is restrained by the lateral constraint while other adjacent lobes enlarge with increasing temperature difference after the contact another extremum of bending stress close to the sleeper appears which is larger than the bending stress at the sleeper ii under the same temperature difference for smaller sleeper length the central lobe around the sleeper shrinks and the adjacent lobes in the opposite direction enlarge thus both the amplitude of deflection and extrema of bending stress around the sleeper reduce which in the opposite direction increase iii when the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper disappears while the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint appears and it increases with increasing temperature difference with further increase of the temperature difference both the deflection and the stress at the sleeper are almost not affected however the amplitudes of deflection and stress in the opposite direction increase all the amplitudes of deflection and stress are smaller than that for the case without lateral constraint the axial compressive force first increases and then decreases with increasing temperature difference after the contact iv for a specific temperature difference the amplitude of deflection at the sleeper increases linearly while the amplitude of deflection on the opposite side decreases linearly with increasing sleeper length the extrema of stresses around the sleeper increase while the extrema of stress away from the sleeper decrease with increasing sleeper length both the axial compressive force and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint decrease with increasing sleeper length when the sleeper length reaches a critical value the buckled pipeline will not contact with the lateral constraint so that the results will not be affected by the sleeper with further increasing sleeper length v both the maximum deflection and maximum stress become smaller compared to the case without lateral constraint after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint credit authorship contribution statement jie zhang formal analysis

20593,in order to mitigate the maximum displacement and stress in the lateral buckling of subsea pipelines triggered by the sleeper lateral constraint can be installed at the end of the sleeper to restrict the deflection of the buckled pipeline in this study the lateral buckling of subsea pipelines triggered by a sleeper with lateral constraint is analysed with considering the contact between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint the mathematical model is validated through comparing the analytical solutions with finite element results and test data the influence of the sleeper length on the buckled configurations and post buckling behaviour is investigated focusing on the process after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the amplitudes of deflection and stress along the buckled pipeline are compared to determine the maximum deflection and the maximum stress a parametric analysis is carried out to show the effect of sleeper length on the amplitude of deflection extrema of stress and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the results show that both the maximum deflection and maximum stress along the buckled pipeline become smaller compared to the case without lateral constraint after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint keywords sleeper with lateral constraint subsea pipeline lateral buckling buckle initiation technique 1 introduction for subsea pipelines operating under high pressure and high temperature conditions lateral buckling can jeopardize the structural integrity of the pipeline if it is not properly controlled sleeper as one of the main buckle initiation techniques sinclair et al 2009 is usually used to trigger lateral buckling of subsea pipelines both symmetric and antisymmetric buckling modes can be triggered when a sleeper is employed sinclair et al 2009 wang and tang 2020a when the symmetric buckling mode is triggered both the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress locate at the sleeper thus lateral constraints such as concrete mattresses can be designed to be installed at the ends of the sleeper to avoid a possible pipeline fall off the sleeper and a possible structural failure solano et al 2014 in this study analytical formulations are proposed to study the lateral buckling behaviour triggered by a sleeper with lateral constraints to date extensive research has been conducted to investigate the mechanism of global buckling the first analytical studies about lateral and upheaval buckling of ideal pipelines may have been carried out by hobbs 1984 through assuming the specified mode shapes taylor and gan 1986 studied the influence of the initial imperfection on the upheaval and lateral buckling behaviour of subsea pipelines croll 1997 proposed a simplified analytical model to investigate upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines with initial imperfections the lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines was investigated by karampour et al 2013 they compared the lateral and upheaval responses of a subsea pipeline shi et al 2013 carried out the research about the influence of seabed resistance on upheaval buckling for a pipeline on a plastic soft seabed liu and co authors hong et al 2015 liu and wang 2018 used analytical methods to study high order lateral buckling for a pipeline with a single arch symmetric and a two arch anti symmetric initial imperfection taking nonlinear pipe soil interaction model into account localised lateral and upheaval buckling for unburied and buried subsea ideal pipelines were studied in wang and van der heijden 2017 2020a wang et al 2018d they discussed the influences of breakout resistance and buried depth on the buckling behaviour upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines on the step imperfection seabed was investigated through analytical and finite element method in chen et al 2020 wang and van der heijden 2020b moreover the finite element method has also been widely employed to study lateral and upheaval buckling of subsea pipelines in recent years liu and li 2018 liu et al 2014 xu and lin 2017 zhang and duan 2015 zhang et al 2018 as for the research about buckle initiation techniques simple analytical solutions were derived for lateral buckling triggered by a single buoyancy two equal buoyancies or distributed buoyancy with a specific length peek and yun 2007 the critical load of lateral buckling triggered by a single buoyancy was also investigated by shi and wang 2015 for lateral buckling triggered by single distributed buoyancy section analytical solutions were derived by li et al 2016 and wang et al 2018a 2017b they found that both the minimum critical temperature difference and the maximum stress would reduce when the submerged weight of the distributed buoyancy section decreased chee et al 2018 2019 investigated another method to trigger the lateral buckling in which the pipeline is pre deformed continuously with sinusoidal shape prior to the installation furthermore analytical solutions of lateral buckling triggered by dual distributed buoyancy sections were derived by wang and tang 2020b c comparisons between symmetric and antisymmetric buckling modes triggered by the same dual distributed buoyancy sections were discussed they found that symmetric mode was prone to be triggered for relative small spacing between dual distributed buoyancy sections the symmetric mode was more dangerous than the antisymmetric mode for most situations however the antisymmetric mode was more dangerous only when the weight ratio coefficient was small enough with respect to lateral buckling triggered by sleeper the experiments were carried out by silva junior et al 2008 and de oliveira cardoso and solano 2015 lateral buckling triggered by dual sleepers was investigated by bai et al 2009 through finite element method based on the finite element results and the genetic algorithms some empirical formulas for lateral buckling triggered by single sleeper were derived by wang et al 2017a moreover analytical solutions for symmetric and antisymmetric buckling modes triggered by single sleeper were derived by wang et al 2020a 2018b 2018c they found that the symmetric buckling mode preferred to occur for smaller sleeper friction or smaller sleeper height however the antisymmetric mode was prone to take place for larger sleeper friction and larger sleeper height hong and liu studied the feature of lifting deformation for a pipeline laid on a sleeper through finite element method hong and liu 2020 from our previous study wang et al 2018c both the displacement amplitude and maximum stress along the buckled pipeline locate at the sleeper when symmetric buckling mode is triggered by sleeper the direct way to control the displacement amplitude and maximum stress is to restrict the deflection at the sleeper thus in this study a simple and efficient method is proposed to control the displacement amplitude and maximum stress in an acceptable level which is to install some constraints at the ends of the sleeper after the buckled pipeline touches the constraint both the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress will be restricted therefore the main aim of this study is to propose a mathematical model to simulate the buckling behaviour after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper the analytical solutions are compared with finite element results and experimental results to verify the mathematical model employing the derived analytical solutions the influence of the temperature difference and sleeper length on the buckled configurations and post buckling behaviour is discussed the locations of displacement amplitude and the maximum stress are determined through comparing different extrema of deflection and stress along the buckled pipeline a parametric analysis is carried out to show the influence of sleeper length on the amplitude of deflection extrema of stress axial compressive force and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint 2 analytical solution in order to obtain the analytical solutions the following assumptions are made 1 buckling mode 3 in the classification of hobbs 1984 is assumed for lateral deflection 2 the euler bernoulli beam theory is used to simulate the subsea pipeline 3 lateral and axial soil resistances are assumed to be constant 4 the seabed is assumed to be rigid 5 the axial compressive force within the buckled region is assumed to be constant when solving the buckled configuration both symmetric and antisymmetric buckling modes may be triggered when the sleeper is used as the buckle initiation technique sinclair et al 2009 when a symmetric buckling mode is triggered both the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress locate at the sleeper therefore the pipe section at the sleeper may fail first in order to improve the integrity of the pipeline the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress at the sleeper should be effectively controlled in this study a sleeper with lateral constraints installed at the ends of the sleeper is employed to trigger lateral buckling the pipeline can only move on the sleeper within the two lateral constraints at the end of the sleeper when it buckles and deforms laterally the deflection of the buckled pipeline will be restricted when the buckled pipeline contacts with the constraint at the end of the sleeper thus both the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress will reduce compared to the case of sleeper without constraint in this section the analytical solution of pipeline buckling triggered by the sleeper with lateral constraints is derived the pipeline will buckle when the axial compressive force denoted by p 0 induced by temperature difference reaches the critical value due to the suspended pipe section introduced by the sleeper the critical load for the pipe segment at the sleeper is lower than other locations so that the buckle prefers to occur at the location of sleeper after the buckle takes place a small pipe section will deflect laterally see fig 1 b the axial compressive force see fig 2 reduces because the additional pipe coming from thermal expansion feeds into the buckle beyond the buckled section the axial compressive force accumulates due to the axial soil resistance at some points the requirement of additional pipe length introduced by the lateral displacement is satisfied by the thermal expansion where the axial compressive force increases to the force p 0 and there is no axial deflection fig 2 shows the typical compressive force variation the length of total feed in region is denoted by 2 l s the deformed shape and load distribution of the lateral buckling triggered by sleeper with lateral constraints at the end of the sleeper are illustrated in fig 1 the deflections of the subsea pipeline in the vertical and horizontal directions are denoted by v and w respectively in the analytical formulations presented in this section the euler bernoulli beam theory is employed to simulate the pipeline we consider the deformations in the vertical and horizontal directions separately which are only coupled by the contact force and friction for a pipeline on the sleeper the solutions of vertical deflection see fig 1 a were derived by wang et al 2018b 2018c the contact concentrated forces between the pipeline and sleeper f s and between the pipeline and seabed at the touchdown point f t respectively are 1 f s 4 3 q l 1 a n d f t 1 3 q l 1 where q is the submerged weight per unit length of the pipeline and l 1 is the half length of the free span which can be obtained by 2 l 1 72 e i v o m q 4 where e is the elastic modulus i is the moment of inertia and v o m is the sleeper height according to fig 2 the axial compressive force distribution p x is written as 3 p x p 0 x l 1 p f a t f a x l 1 l 1 x l s where p is the axial compressive force within the free span zone f a t μ a f t is the axial concentrated friction force induced by f t at x l 1 f a μ a q is the axial soil resistance per unit length and μ a is the axial friction coefficient between pipeline and seabed the axial force balance is 4 p l s p 0 p f a t f a l s l 1 in the lateral buckling response the rigid plastic pipe soil interaction model i e constant lateral soil resistance is assumed the constant lateral soil resistance is f μ l q μ l is the lateral friction coefficient the buckling mode 3 in the classification of hobbs 1984 is employed for the buckled configuration the governing equations for the horizontal deformation are 5 e i d 4 w 1 d x 4 p d 2 w 1 d x 2 0 0 x l 1 e i d 4 w 2 d x 4 p d 2 w 2 d x 2 f l 1 x l 2 e i d 4 w 3 d x 4 p d 2 w 3 d x 2 f l 2 x l 3 where due to the symmetry in the lateral direction half model length is considered here and l 3 is the half length of the buckled section in eq 5 the axial force within the buckled section l 1 x l 3 is assumed constant and equal to the force p at the centre of the buckle when we calculate the lateral deflections an error analysis was conducted to show this assumption is acceptable wang et al 2018a b now let 6 λ 2 p e i the general solutions of eq 5 are 7 w 1 x b 1 cos λ x b 2 sin λ x b 3 x b 4 0 x l 1 w 2 x b 5 cos λ

the sleeper the slope of the deflection w 1 at x 0 is always zero due to symmetry which is expressed as 8 d w 1 d x 0 0 before the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper the shear force f o w μ s f s 2 at the sleeper is induced by the friction force 2 f o w between pipeline and sleeper the corresponding boundary condition is 9 d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 f o w e i 0 after the contact between the buckled pipeline and the sleeper the lateral deflection is restricted the friction force between pipeline and sleeper vanishes and transfers to the contact force between the buckled pipeline and the sleeper so that the corresponding boundary conditions are 10 w 1 0 d d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 f d 2 e i 0 where d is the distance that the pipe can move laterally on the sleeper from the original unbuckled state so that the total sleeper length is 2 d d and f d is the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint and can be calculated by 11 f d 2 e i d 3 w 1 d x 3 0 at the end of the buckled section the displacement slope and moment at x l 3 are zero the corresponding boundary conditions at x l 3 are 12 w 3 l 3 0 d w 3 d x l 3 0 d 2 w 3 d x 2 l 3 0 the displacement slope and bending moment are continuous at x l 1 while a lateral concentrated friction force f t μ l f t exists at x l 1 resulting from f t at l 1 so there is a jump in the shear force at x l 1 therefore the following matching conditions are required at x l 1 13 w 1 l 1 w 2 l 1 d w 1 d x l 1 d w 2 d x l 1 d 2 w 1 d x 2 l 1 d 2 w 2 d x 2 l 1 d 3 w 1 d x 3 l 1 d 3 w 2 d x 3 l 1 f t e i in addition the displacement slope moment and shear force are continuous at x l 2 and the displacement at x l 2 must be zero so the following matching conditions at x l 2 are imposed 14

thermal expansion and lateral deflection which is written as 15 u 1 u 2 where u 1 is the axial expansion within the half feed in region 0 x l s and u 2 is the additional length required to form the lateral deflection u 1 is calculated by 16 u 1 0 l s δ p x e a d x where δ p x p 0 p x is the reduction of axial compressive force and a is the cross sectional area of the pipe meanwhile u 2 is given

coefficient of linear thermal expansion and t 0 is here the total temperature difference between the fluid flowing inside the pipe and the environment the bending moment m along the buckled pipe is calculated by 19 m e i d 2 w d x 2 where w stands for either w 1 w 2 or w 3 the bending stress σ m along the pipeline can be obtained by 20 σ m m d 2 i where d is the external diameter of the pipe the maximum stress σ m is 21 σ m σ p σ m m where the stresses σ p and σ m m resulted from the axial force p and the maximum bending moment m m respectively are 22 σ p p a σ m m m m d 2 i 3 analytical results lateral buckling of a typical pipeline triggered by a sleeper with lateral constraint at the sleeper end is investigated the deformed shapes and bending stresses along the buckled pipeline with different temperature differences and sleeper lengths are analysed and the method to determine the amplitude of deflection and bending stress is explained the effect of lateral constraint on the typical buckling behaviour is discussed which focuses on the evolution of the results after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper moreover the influence of sleeper length on the amplitude of deflection w m extrema of stress σ m axial compressive force p and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint f d under specific temperature differences is discussed in detail the results in this section are obtained by using the analytical formulation developed in section 2 taking the parameters in table 1 3 1 validation in order to validate the analytical formulations a finite element model of the subsea pipeline with a sleeper underneath is proposed through abaqus harper 2009 the beam element pipe32h in abaqus is suitable for the simulation of pipeline wang et al 2015 the seabed is assumed to be a rigid surface which is the same assumption in the analytical method rigid surface elements r3d4 element in abaqus are selected to simulate the seabed the sleeper is also assumed to be a rigid surface with a semi circle section which is laid under the pipeline both ends of the pipeline are pinned the total model length of the pipeline is 2000 m half model length is denoted by l a i e l a 1000 m a local initial imperfection with the wavelength of 50 m and the amplitude of 0 2 m is introduced at the centre of the pipeline to initiate the lateral buckle the implicit dynamic method is selected as the calculation method to simulate the lateral buckling response of subsea pipeline the parameters listed in table 1 are used in finite element analyses when l s is smaller than l a then all the formulae derived in section 2 can be applied when l s is larger than l a the formula for axial force should be modified due to the limit of the length of the axial feed in region in that case by axial force balance the following equation can be obtained 23 p a p f a t f a l a l 1 where p a is the axial force at the end of the pipeline and the axial expansion within 0 x l a is modified to 24 u 1 0 l a δ p x e a d x where δ p x p 0 p x the comparison between analytical solutions and fea results is showed in fig 3 for the results obtained by fea both the displacement amplitude w m and maximum stress σ m increase with temperature difference gradually due to the existence of the initial imperfection the axial force p obtained by fea increases with temperature difference along the path p 0 e a α t 0 until the temperature difference reaches t n then it reduces with temperature difference for analytical solutions no initial imperfection is considered and two branches exist denoted by m b and m c respectively the temperature difference corresponding to state m is called the minimum critical temperature difference t m the branches m b and m c are stable and unstable respectively wang et al 2018c from fig 3 the discrepancy of w m between analytical solutions and fea becomes larger along the stable buckling path m b however the discrepancies of σ m and p between analytical solutions and fea are small along the stable buckling path m b taking t 0 50 c for instance the displacement amplitudes w m of analytical solutions and fea are 5 512 m and 4 545 m respectively the discrepancy between which is 17 54 the maximum stress σ m of analytical solutions and fea at t 0 50 c are 401 701 mpa and 411 242 mpa respectively the discrepancy between which is 2 37 the axial force p of analytical solutions and fea results at t 0 50 c are 0 153 mn and 0 158 mn respectively the discrepancy between which is 3 27 even though the discrepancy of displacement amplitude between analytical solutions and fea is large the differences of maximum stress and axial force are in an acceptable level there are two main reasons leading to this discrepancy on one hand the discrepancy comes from different methods to simulate seabed resistance in the analytical modelling the resistance provided by the seabed is assumed constant however in fea it is simulated by the interaction between pipeline and seabed through surface to surface contact on the other hand the discrepancy may come from the initial imperfections in the fea and the assumption of lateral deflection in the analytical modelling to verify which method to simulate seabed resistance is better the experimental investigation or site survey should be carried out therefore the comparison between the analytical results obtained in this paper and test data obtained by the reduced scale model test de oliveira cardoso and solano 2015 is presented in fig 4 the test parameters used in the reduced scale model test in de oliveira cardoso and solano 2015 are listed in table 2 the analytical results in fig 4 are also calculated by the parameters in table 2 the total pipe length in de oliveira cardoso and solano 2015 was 195 m three sleepers with equal spacing of 2 l a 65 m were installed to trigger lateral buckling the results from model test and analytical method are compared in fig 4 where the displacement amplitude w m is displayed the present analytical results appear to agree very well with the test data 3 2 buckled configuration in fig 5 the effect of temperature difference on the buckled configurations is illustrated from fig 5 a the amplitudes of the deflection in the positive and negative directions are denoted by w m 1 and w m 2 respectively from fig 5 b the bending stress at the centre of the buckled pipeline is denoted by σ m 0 where the sleeper locates a minimum of bending stress close to the centre denoted by σ m 1 exists after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the maxima of bending stress in the positive direction is denoted by σ m 2 the locations of amplitudes of the deflection and extrema of bending stress along the buckled pipeline denoted by x w m 1 x w m 2 x σ m 0 x σ m 1 and x σ m 2 see fig 5 are determined by d w d x 0 and d 3 w d x 3 0 respectively from fig 5 a for t 0 30 c the deflection at the sleeper doesn t reach the lateral constraint so that the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper has no influence on the buckled pipeline for this case the buckled lobe at the centre is much larger than the adjacent lobes away from the centre the amplitude of the deflection in the positive direction w m 1 is much larger than that in the negative direction w m 2 from fig 5 b for t 0 30 c an extremum of bending stress locates at the centre of the buckled pipeline which absolute value is larger than other extrema of bending stress from fig 5 a the buckled pipeline reaches the end of the sleeper and contacts with the lateral constraint when the temperature difference increases up to 40 c after the contact between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint appears the central lobe is restrained due to the existence of the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper however the lobes in the opposite direction enlarge with increasing temperature difference from fig 5 b the bending stress at the centre of the buckled pipeline σ m 0 increases with increasing temperature difference before the buckled pipeline touches the lateral constraint which is barely affected by the temperature difference after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint after the contact the minima of bending stress σ m 1 appears at the location close to the centre which increases slightly with increasing temperature difference the maxima of bending stress in the positive direction σ m 2 also becomes larger for larger temperature difference the effect of temperature difference on σ m 2 is much larger than that on σ m 1 the effect of sleeper length on the buckled configurations under t 0 40 c is shown in fig 6 the total sleeper length is 2 d d so that d will be used to represent the sleeper length during the discussion from fig 6 a for the case of no lateral constraint i e the sleeper length is infinite or large enough the buckled pipeline does not reach the end of the sleeper thus the lateral constraint has no effect on the buckled pipeline for this case the central buckled lobe in the positive direction is much larger than the rest lobes in the negative direction when the value of d is smaller than the value of the deflection at the sleeper for the case of no lateral constraint the buckled pipeline will be restricted by the lateral constraint taking d 15 d as an example the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the central lobe at the sleeper shrinks due to the restriction of the lateral constraint while the lobes in the opposite direction enlarge for smaller sleeper length the central buckled lobe at the sleeper shrinks further while the buckled lobes in the opposite direction enlarge further for d 5 d the amplitude of the deflection in the negative direction w m 2 absolute value becomes larger than that in the positive direction at the sleeper from fig 6 b the bending stress along the buckled pipeline is not affected by the lateral constraint before the buckled pipeline reaches the end of the sleeper after the contact between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the bending stress at the sleeper σ m 0 reduces and two extra extrema of bending stress appear close to the centre of the buckled pipeline both σ m 0 and σ m 1 become smaller for smaller sleeper length however the maxima of bending stress in the positive direction σ m 2 become larger when the sleeper length decreases for d 5 d the value of σ m 2 becomes larger than that of σ m 0 and σ m 1 absolute value 3 3 typical buckling behaviour in fig 7 the influence of sleeper length on the typical buckling behaviour is illustrated the cases of d in fig 7 represent the situation that the sleeper length is long enough so that the buckled pipeline can t reach the end of the sleeper in this case there is no contact between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper for d the buckled pipeline behaves like there is no lateral constraint for d two cases of friction coefficient between sleeper and pipeline are considered i e μ s 0 and μ s 0 1 before the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the buckled pipeline will move on the sleeper with increasing temperature difference in this situation the friction between the buckled pipeline and sleeper will be mobilised which should be implemented into the analytical model i e using μ s 0 1 for d μ s 0 1 the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint f d as shown in fig 7 f is constant and represents the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper the buckled pipeline will stop at the end of the sleeper after it contacts with the lateral constraint in this situation the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper will vanish the case of d μ s 0 is a reference state where both the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint and the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper are zero as shown in fig 7 f from fig 7 the pipeline will buckle when the temperature difference increases up to the minimum critical temperature difference t m with further increase of the temperature difference the pipeline will evolve along the path m b 1 both the amplitudes of deflection w m 1 and w m 2 and the extrema of stress σ m 0 σ m 1 and σ m 2 increase along the path m b 1 with increasing temperature difference see fig 7 a d the axial compressive force p decreases along the path m b 1 with increasing temperature difference see fig 7 e the value of f d is constant along the path m b 1 and represents the friction force between the buckled pipeline and sleeper as shown in fig 7 f with further increase of the temperature difference all the results shown in fig 7 develop along the path b 1 b 2 when the sleeper length is long enough in this case the buckled pipeline can t reach the end of the sleeper along the whole path m b 2 the friction force between the buckled pipeline and sleeper should be taken into account since the buckled pipeline moves on the sleeper with increasing temperature difference however for small sleeper length such as d 10 d the buckled pipeline will reach the end of the sleeper and contact with the lateral constraint at a certain temperature difference once the buckled pipeline arrives at the end of the sleeper the buckled pipeline will stop to move so that the friction force between the buckled pipeline and sleeper will vanish at the same time this friction force will convert into the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint i e at the state b 1 shown in fig 7 f taking d 10 d as an example the amplitude of the deflection at the sleeper w m 1 will keep constant along the path b 1 b 3 due to the restriction of lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper see fig 7 a however the amplitude of the deflection in the negative direction w m 2 increases in a faster speed along the path b 1 b 3 with increasing temperature difference see fig 7 b the reason is that the central lobe in the positive direction is restrained by the lateral constraint so that the lobes in the opposite direction enlarge with increasing temperature difference see fig 5 a under the same temperature difference the amplitude of the deflection in the negative direction w m 2 is larger for smaller sleeper length after the contact between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the comparison of the amplitudes of the deflection in the positive and negative directions is shown in fig 8 a for the case of d i e the sleeper length is long enough the value of w m 1 is always larger than that of w m 2 under the same temperature difference which means that the amplitude of the deflection at the sleeper is always larger than other amplitudes of the deflection however when the sleeper length is not long enough the buckled pipeline will be restricted by the lateral constraint after the contact the value of w m 1 keeps constant while the value of w m 2 increases with increasing temperature difference when the temperature difference increases to t 0 c 1 the value of w m 1 is equal to w m 2 for t 0 t 0 c 1 the value of w m 2 is larger than that of w m 1 from fig 7 c for a specific sleeper length the extremum of stress at the sleeper σ m 0 is barely affected by temperature difference after the contact between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the extremum of stress σ m 1 increases with increasing temperature difference however its increasing rate is smaller than that of σ m 0 for the case of d under the same temperature difference both the values of σ m 0 and σ m 1 are larger for larger sleeper length from fig 7 d for a specific sleeper length after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint σ m 2 increases with increasing temperature difference along the path b 1 b 3 whose increasing rate is larger than that for the case of d the comparison of the extrema of the stress in the positive and negative directions is shown in fig 8 b for the case of d the stress at the sleeper σ m 0 is always larger than that of σ m 2 under the same temperature difference this means that the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline always locates at the sleeper before the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the extremum of stress σ m 1 close to the sleeper appears and is larger than σ m 0 under the same temperature difference therefore the extremum of stress σ m 0 at the sleeper can t become the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint after the contact the increasing rate of σ m 2 is larger than that of σ m 1 with increasing temperature difference for t 0 t 0 c 2 the value of σ m 1 is the largest thus the stress σ m 1 is the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline for t 0 t 0 c 2 the value of σ m 2 is the largest so the stress σ m 2 is the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline thus during the design process it s better to calculate the extrema of stress in both positive and negative directions the maximum stress can be determined after comparing all the extrema of stress along the buckled pipeline from fig 7 e when the temperature difference increases up to t 0 b 1 the buckled pipeline starts to contact with the lateral constraint with further increasing temperature difference the deflection at the sleeper is restricted by the sleeper see fig 7 a the axial compressive force p first increases slightly due to the restriction of lateral constraint then it decreases with increasing temperature difference along the path b 1 b 3 the axial compressive force p is larger for smaller sleeper length from fig 7 f when the temperature difference increases up to t 0 b 1 the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper converts into the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint then with further increasing temperature difference the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint f d increases with increasing temperature difference along the path b 1 b 3 the contact concentrated force f d is larger for smaller sleeper length during the design process the resistance on sleeper provided by the soil foundation should be larger than f d the sleeper may slide horizontally when f d is larger than the resistance on sleeper provided by the soil foundation 3 4 parametric analysis on the influence of sleeper length a detailed parametric analysis on the influence of sleeper length under specific temperature differences is illustrated in fig 9 from fig 9 a for t 0 50 c the amplitude of deflection at the sleeper w m 1 increases linearly while w m 2 decreases linearly with increasing sleeper length for d d e 2 in fact the buckled pipeline always contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper for d d e 2 since the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint f d is larger than zero see fig 9 d both the stresses σ m 0 and σ m 1 increase while σ m 2 decreases with increasing sleeper length for d d e 2 the stress σ m 2 is the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline for d d e 1 while σ m 1 is the maximum stress for d e 1 d d e 2 the stress σ m 0 is the maximum stress for d d e 2 with increasing sleeper length for d d e 2 the restriction of the lateral constraint on the deflection reduces so that both the axial compressive force p and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint f d decrease when the value of d increases up to d e 2 the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint f d converts into the friction force between the pipeline and the sleeper suddenly and reduces to zero with further increasing sleeper length all the results are not affected and keep constant since the buckled pipeline doesn t contact with the lateral constraint at the end of the sleeper anymore 4 conclusions a sleeper with end constraint is introduced to trigger lateral buckling and to control the displacement amplitude and the maximum stress along the buckled pipeline the mathematical model is proposed and analytical solutions are derived through considering the contact between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint at the end of sleeper the analytical solutions are compared with finite element results and test data to validate the mathematical model the influence of the lateral constraint on the buckled configuration and typical buckling behaviour is discussed the amplitudes of deflection and extrema of stress along the buckled pipelines are compared to determine the maximum deflection and the maximum stress a parametric analysis is performed to show the effect of sleeper length on the amplitude of deflection extrema of stress axial compressive force and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint the findings are summarised as follows i before the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint at the end of sleeper the central lobe around the sleeper is much larger than other lobes the maximum deflection and the maximum bending stress along the buckled pipeline locate at the sleeper after the contact the central lobe is restrained by the lateral constraint while other adjacent lobes enlarge with increasing temperature difference after the contact another extremum of bending stress close to the sleeper appears which is larger than the bending stress at the sleeper ii under the same temperature difference for smaller sleeper length the central lobe around the sleeper shrinks and the adjacent lobes in the opposite direction enlarge thus both the amplitude of deflection and extrema of bending stress around the sleeper reduce which in the opposite direction increase iii when the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint the friction force between the pipeline and sleeper disappears while the contact concentrated force between the buckled pipeline and the lateral constraint appears and it increases with increasing temperature difference with further increase of the temperature difference both the deflection and the stress at the sleeper are almost not affected however the amplitudes of deflection and stress in the opposite direction increase all the amplitudes of deflection and stress are smaller than that for the case without lateral constraint the axial compressive force first increases and then decreases with increasing temperature difference after the contact iv for a specific temperature difference the amplitude of deflection at the sleeper increases linearly while the amplitude of deflection on the opposite side decreases linearly with increasing sleeper length the extrema of stresses around the sleeper increase while the extrema of stress away from the sleeper decrease with increasing sleeper length both the axial compressive force and the contact concentrated force between the pipeline and the lateral constraint decrease with increasing sleeper length when the sleeper length reaches a critical value the buckled pipeline will not contact with the lateral constraint so that the results will not be affected by the sleeper with further increasing sleeper length v both the maximum deflection and maximum stress become smaller compared to the case without lateral constraint after the buckled pipeline contacts with the lateral constraint credit authorship contribution statement jie zhang formal analysis

20594,hundreds of offshore platforms are approaching the end of their productive life and will require decommissioning within the next decade removal of a large offshore structure is a highly complex exercise that poses significant safety challenges in this paper we propose a new concept to remove large and heavy structures with a single lift utilizing three semi submerged vessels such a twin lift solution for decommissioning involves an operation of lifting of a topside structure carried on two semi submerged vessels to the third semi submerged vessel although the method appears simple it requires adequate stability using ballast tank and synchronized motion of moving vessels especially under environmental disturbances in order to ensure efficiency and safety we perform a wave tank test for such a twin lift decommissioning solution some aspects of an experimental facility set up for scaled model test with dynamic positioning dp system are described it includes the layout of the experiment and details of the deck mating dp and monitoring system preliminary experimental results are presented to reveal that a simple controller combined with dp system is able to produce a robust

the coming years fowler et al 2014 the decommissioning operation involves a variety of issues such as financial viability risk and safety management environmental protection and technical feasibility etc decom north sea zero waste scotland 2015 it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each removal methods and further develop a cost effective option topside removal is generally the reverse engineering of the installation there are a variety of approaches that can be taken to the remove platform topside the heavy lifting vessel hlv has been seen as the first option especially with regard to the platform topsides weighing less than 5000 tons however for a bigger and heavier topside the existing platform cranes have limited capability these topsides are usually pieced into smaller sections to facilitate the heavy lifting crane therefore there is increased time at sea and work associated with separation of the modules and the costs of conventional heavy lifting operation can be prohibitive single lift is the removal of the platform topsides in a single unit reducing the number of cuts needed therefore the single lift removal is preferable over the multiple piece decommissioning methods because it has smaller cost and less risk rassenfoss 2014 in 2010 the versabar s vb 10 000 heavy lift vessel was built to perform single piece removal with the lift capacity of 7500 tons versabar 2013 the vb 10 000 consists of dual truss frames mounted on the top of two barges forming a catamaran the mpu heavy lifter erling holm hannes ludescher 2008 which is equipped with a u shaped concrete hull and a pair of lifting frames makes it possible to enclose the platform and lift the topside up to 15 000 tons technip liu and li 2017 proposed a design for the decommissioning salvage installation vessel dsiv which has a catamaran configuration and is able to remove large topsides up to 25 000 tons in 2017 the brent delta topside 24 000 tons was successfully removed by a new twin hull vessel purpose built for single lift removal of large oil and gas platforms it took 12 h for the full operational cycle comprising the move in around the platform yoke connection pre tensioning de ballasting and fast lift imca 2017 however such a construction vessel is equipped with special purpose crane which will bring about the challenge of availability meanwhile it gives a little cost reduction on the overall decommissioning project cost when we account for the additional maintenance and worldwide mobilization costs ahiaga dagbui et al 2017 in order to squeeze out costs and safety the twin lift decommissioning method involving three semi submerged vessels is proposed in 2014 a new concept has been released to remove topside using two semi submerged vessels equipped with a set of giant cranes marine 2016 in this paper we propose an alternative approach using three semi submerged vessels compared with a giant twin hull vessel we can reduce the cost of mobilization to transfer the submerge vessels from shipyard to the decommissioning region moreover such a novel twin lift decommissioning operation is expected to complete in less than 8 h even without the special purpose crane therefore the twin lift decommissioning method is able to bring a significant cost savings to the decommissioning operation cosco 2019 specifically it uses the following procedure three semi submerged vessels two k class and one x class vessel arrive in the platform field and then set up on dp two k class vessels are ballasted to achieve a desired freeboard and heel angle two k class vessels approach the mating position until they are positioned either side of the jacket beneath the topside see fig 1 a these vessels are equipped with the deck mating units dmu see fig 1 b which comprise the stabbing cone receptor vertical elastomeric pad and horizontal elastomeric pad the dmus are designed to absorb the impact during operation and to provide adequate control of the synchronized motions of two k class vessels hu et al 2017 the topside offload is completely by de ballasting two k class vessels beneath the topside transferring the total topside weight from jacket to the k class vessels see fig 1 c two k class vessels carry the topside and move it into the x class vessel see fig 1 d till they slot into its appointed place transfer of the topsides to the x class vessel involved simultaneously ballasting two k class vessels and de ballasting x class vessel until the platform legs set down on the support stools see fig 1 e the novel twin lift decommissioning operation requires the synchronized motion of a fleet of vessels thus it is necessary to investigate the dp performance and formation control for the under actuated vehicles there is a lot of research work being done on the path following and trajectory tracking missions of marine vessels working in coordination in kyrkjebø and pettersen 2003 a closed loop method is proposed in which only position estimates of each vessel are needed to yield the semi global exponential convergence of relative position such a method is useful for the ship replenishment applying the lagrange multipliers to the control law for multiple vessels the authors ihle et al 2005 developed a formation control method considering the constraints between each vessels moreover the authors skjetne et al 2002 developed a decentralized formation control scheme by imposing a synchronization feedback function with a little inter vessel data transmission a fleet of vessels is able to follow a pre defined path the research arrichiello et al 2006 gives an extension of formation control method based on the null space behavioral control which also allows for the obstacle avoidance in the complex environments for the fully actuated vessels at low speed the applications of cooperative control method always involve the dp systems of multiple vessels accounting for the environmental loads on marine vehicles the cooperative dp controller is developed peng et al 2016 based on a modular design approach each vessel is able to reach the desired formation using the information of measured position of each vessel under the assumption that the relative position of each vessel is known to all the authors ianagui and tannuri 2019 proposed a synchronized position control scheme to achieve the desired cable loads between the towing vessel and tow disabled platform in queiroz filho and tannuri 2017 a method separates the formation control into the inner loop of dp system on each vessel and outer loop of cooperative controller for cooperative trajectory generation they performed a model test to demonstrate the control performance of the proposed combined controllers the experimental investigation on the given removal method have been presented to identify challenges associated with lift techniques and improve the sustainability of decommissioning an experimental framework of a novel decommissioning operation is described the motion capture control and monitoring system have been developed for and implemented on a scaled model of three semi submerged vessels we primarily focus on the functionality and implementation of each system required to achieve station keeping and low speed maneuvering capabilities on the twin lift decommissioning operation extensive wave tank tests have been completed to assess the performance of such a novel solution the rest of this paper is organized as follows at first the vessel model and thrust allocation algorithm are presented in section 2 then the experimental setup for scale model test in the wave tank are specified in section 3 finally experimental results are presented and the capability of the proposed controller are investigated conclusions are drawn at the end of this study 1 1 theoretical background consider the twin lift system with multiple rigid bodies two types of coordinate system are introduced as seen in fig 2 the global coordinate system defines the positions of vessels and topside structure in the wave tank we also construct the body fixed coordinate system for each rigid body with origin in the center of mass of each body these body fixed coordinate systems enable us to express the equation of angular motion and velocity in a simplest form zhang et al 2020 1 2 vessel model we develop and implement a 3dof surge sway and yaw marine craft equations of motion for the control system of each vessel fossen 2011 1 η t t η t v t 2 m v t d v t τ t τ e

actuators thrusters rudders etc the thrust acting on the vessel 10 τ t b α u where u u 1 u 2 u m t r m represents the magnitude of the force produced by each actuator for each thruster we use the quadratic dependence of the propeller thrust with respect to rotational speed n i 11 u i k i n i n i where the thrust constant k i can be obtained using thrust calibration test and then the above formula can be applied to estimate the thrust in the control system the angle vector α α 1 α 2 α m t r m is the azimuth of each actuator defining the direction of the thrust produced in the horizontal

efficiently boyd and vandenberghe 2004 singularity avoidance is also considered see johansen et al 2004 for the details we define the following qp min j δ α δ u s i 1 m d w i d u i u 0 i δ u i d 2 w i

allows the real time ta and generation of optimal control input namely rotational speed and azimuth then these commanded signal of thruster will be fed into the actuator to generate the desired force on each vessel 2 experimental setup the scale model test see fig 3 is designed as an experimental platform for control and monitoring systems used in twin lift decommissioning operation the experimental system see fig 4 comprises industry grade components including the observer control system industrial wireless local area network system wlan actuator system monitoring system and other decommissioning aids the observer and control system are implemented using c code including low pass filter and velocity estimator kalman filter a proportional integral derivative pid controller a ta algorithm etc such a c implementation called by dpdecom is developed and run on a 3 60 ghz intel core i7 7820x running debian 9 6 2 1 the 3dof vessel model the total mass matrix can be calculated

motion response is given at the center of gravity cog on each vessel 2 2 observer the optical motion capture system makes it possible to measure the position and rotation of multiple moving objects with high accuracy the motion capture cameras can easily identify 4 markers fixed on each vessel see fig 3 and then compute the 6dof motion data using the qualisys track manager qtm software the motion tracking can be done in real time on a 1 8 ghz intel xeon running windows 7 the processed real time 6dof data can be retrieved from qtm server over a tcp ip socket connection in real time in this model test the sample frequency of motion capture system is set to 50 hz we use moving average filter to eliminate the noise in the raw motion data which enables reliable estimates of velocity notice that the real time sample frequency of qtm can be lower than 50hz if the qtm cannot process all the camera data thus it is important to compute the real time sample time and then perform the velocity estimation after the moving average filter and velocity estimation the measured state x t x y ϕ u v r t are computed at the sample frequency of 10hz which could sufficiently handle the dynamics of twin lift system kjetil 2017 then the measured state is fed into the linear kalman filter mentioned in section 2 2 to give the optimal state estimation for linear state space model 2 3 heading normalization since the yaw angle retrieved from qtm will stay between 180 the estimated yaw angle may jump from 180 to 180 which is undesirable for control system such an issue has been resolved in the dpdecom when estimating the heading for the vessels or the difference between desired and estimated heading angle it is necessary to find the shortest path for rotation as the vessel heading are defined in the range of 180 the shortest path problems can be solved by normalizing the heading angle to 180 when the heading error calculation and heading estimation is needed 2 4 controller the controller consists of the setpoints generation and dp system the setpoint generation is responsible for generating a reference trajectory for each vessel while the dp system is used to stabilize the vessel motion based on the setpoints as the desired trajectory for multiple vessels is simple the setpoint generation for each vessel is independent without any information shared with each other the dp system for each vessel consists of a pid controller qp based ta a pid controller attempts to minimize the error e t as the difference between a desired setpoint x d t and a observed state x t this error is given by 17 e t x d t x t 18 τ p i d t k p e t k i 0 t e τ d τ k d d e t d t the implementation of the pid controller in the dpdecom is given by 19 τ p i d k k p e k k i i k n i k e i δ t k d v e k where v e denotes the estimated velocity from the observer n k the output saturation is considered in the pid controller according the thrust limit of each vessel table 2 lists the control limits of each vessel 2 5 actuator system each k class vessel has 2 bow thrusters and 2 twin azimuth thrusters the x class vessel has 2 bow thrusters and 2 ducted azimuth thrusters 2 main propellers and rudders for the application in the low speed motion control the thrust generated by main propeller and rudder are typically much larger than that of azimuth and tunnel thrusters this means that the servomotor equipped with the main propeller will operate at relatively low rotational speed which is undesirable for servomotor therefore the main propeller and rudder are not included in the ta and we treat 2 tunnel thruster as one thruster whose locations are listed in table 3 for each azimuth thruster the rate of rotation and the speed of response from zero to full thrust are used to compute the constraints on rotational speed and azimuth in the ta for each bow thruster the speed of response from full thrust port to full thrust starboard is also considered these actuator saturation limits are summarized in table 4 the actuator on each vessel consists of a programmable logic controller plc servomotor and servo drive gearbox and propeller see fig 5 the servo motors are capable of extremely precise speed position and torque control by means of plc based servo drives profinet which is an industry technical standard for data communication over industrial ethernet enables the servo drive to link plc and client module for industrial lan with integrated real time auto tuning and automatic suppression of machine resonances such an actuator system automatically optimizes itself to achieve high dynamic performance and smooth operation on each vessel we use 6 ac servomotors to enable the propeller to convert rotational motion into thrust four motors with incremental encoder are used for velocity control and two motors with absolute encoder are used for azimuth control the information about servomotors used in the model test are listed in table 5 2 6 industrial wlan in this model test the industrial wlan comprises one accessing point ap and three client modules as shown in fig 6 each vessel has one client module which could receive and send message to ap the profinet based industrial wlan is capable of real time data transfer with high priority with time delay less than 10 ms the industrial wlan makes it possible to monitor and display the real time performance of servomotors used on each vessel these performances include the power consumption rotational speed or angle and alarm signal of each servomotor 2 7 decommissioning aids and force monitoring system the decommissioning aids including the dmu and the leg separation unit lsu are designed to absorb energy due to the vertical and horizontal movement of the topsides leg stubs during the twin lift operation the horizontal and vertical stiffness of these units are calibrated based on their design specifications as seen in fig 7 though the dmu load on each vessel is significant the dp control treats these dmu loads as the external disturbance the force transducers are mounted on 4 dmus see fig 8 which enable us to measure the impact load on each dmu the force monitoring system comprises two parts see fig 7 b the industrial personal computer ipc are used to collect and save the impact force on the dmu while simultaneously it sends data using tcp ip socket the force monitoring software could receive and display the real time impact force all these monitoring activities can be done in real time on a 2 6 ghz intel i5 running windows 10 2 8 software structure the dpdecom is a multi threaded c application see fig 9 developed using qt 5 5 library for graphical user interface eigen 3 3 library for linear algebra mosek 7 library for convex optimization and sqlite3 for database there are three operating modes used to control each vessel manual control using gamepad heading only control and dynamic positioning the gui also incorporates easy switching between these operating modes 2 9 wave calibration the specified irregular waves were calibrated according to the jonswap spectra the wave calibration test was performed in the wave tank 50 m 30 m 0 7m equipped with a wave generator and wave absorber a wave absorber is a slope beach located at the end of basin to eliminate the wave deflection xiao et al 2016 it can be found in fig 10 that the experimental power spectral densities closely matched the corresponding target spectra this demonstrates that high quality wave generation was achieved based on the scale ratio 1 37 in the model test 3 results the wave tank test has been performed including the thrust measurement test and automatic control involving multiple vessels the experimental results are presented in the following section 3 1 thrust measurement to measure the thrust of each propeller we use a 3 component force transducer which enables dynamic force measurement in x y and z directions the rated capacity of such a force transducer is 500n when the a plane as seen in fig 11 is fixed with the hull and the b plane remains fixed thrust of each propeller could be acquired the experimental results of such a twin azimuth thruster configuration can be found in fig 12 demonstrating that the influence of the azimuth on thrust can be ignored and thus we use a constant thruster number for each azimuth thruster in the dpdecom as listed in table 6 3 2 case 1 dp test 4 corner box maneuver to test the dp system a 4 corner box maneuver test in random wave jonswap spectrum with h s 0 75 m t p 6 s θ 135 and constant wind v w 1 35 m s θ 135 has been adopted where the topside is carried by both k class i and ii vessels the details of pid controllers for each vessel can be found in table 7 we can find the overshoot in the trajectory of each vessel due to the controller saturation see fig 13 as the thrust in the sway direction must overcome the second order wave force and wind load it may bring about the controller saturation and thus the overshoot and undershoot in the transverse movement fig 14 and fig 15 illustrate the time series of planar motion of k class i and k class ii vessel respectively for the wave at θ 135 we have seen the great heading hold capability of each vessel with variation in heading angle less than 1 deg the relative distance between two k class vessels lies within the range of 2 42 m 2 44 m see fig 16 this reveals that it is relatively safe for two vessels to carry topside structure in case1 the control allocation algorithm works properly see fig 17 and is able to produce the generalized thrust almost the same as the desired thrust at every time instant it can be seen from fig 18 that there is an abrupt change in the commanded azimuth and rotation of k class ii vessel at t 5680 s even restricted by the limitation of each thruster the reason is that the sudden change occurs in the desired generalized force of k class ii vessel a simple solution could be averaging rotation and azimuth commands to provide a smooth time history the dmu load is closely associated with the roll and pitch motion of vessel therefore more intense roll motion of each vessel may result in larger impact load on dmu in the y direction see fig 19 the mean dmu load in the z direction is approximately 11 2 kg while the maximum and minimum values are 13 0 kg and 9 4 kg 3 3 case 2 dp test entry involving three vessels the model test for the entry operation has been carried out in the irregular wave jonswap spectrum with h s 1 25 m t p 6 s θ 180 and constant wind v w 1 65 m s θ 180 where the two k class vessels carry the topside into the x class vessel see fig 20 and table 8 it can be seen from figs 21 23 that the it involves the measurement noise and outliers in the raw data from motion capture server these noise and outliers may be caused by the marker reflection in water however fig 21 also demonstrates that the real time estimated data appears to be robust to the noise and outliers meanwhile the control algorithm is able to solve such a measurement problem and automatically maintain each vessel s position and heading under the environmental disturbance it can be seen from fig 24 that the relative distance lies in the range of 2 41 m 2 45 m however the variation on the relative distance in case 2 appears to be larger than that in case 1 especially for the time duration of entry this may be caused by the hydrodynamic coupling effect and the thruster interaction between multiple vessels it can be observed from fig 25 that the achieved generalized forces validate the accuracy and reliability of thrust allocation during maneuvering meanwhile the real time controller output in f x f y and m z appears to lie within the range of controller saturation in table 2 figs 26 and 27 shows that the resulting azimuth angle and rotation exhibit some chattering which can be handled by the servomotor and mechanical system on each vessel the hydrodynamic coupling effect between three vessel hull may result in the larger variation in the transverse movement of each vessel and also the dmu load in the y direction see figs 21 and 28 it is recommended that the sway fender between the vessel hull can be used to protect the vessels however it seems impossible that the k class vessel will collide against the x class vessel during the entrance as the two k class vessels carrying topside moves into the mating position around the x class vessel the mean value of vertical dmu load is approximately 11 0 kg while the maximum and minimum values are 12 5 kg and 9 2 kg 3 4 case3 stress test 4 corner box maneuver the performance of controller need to be validated by imposing some failures in one vessel it can be seen from fig 29 that control system on the k class i vessel fails to work on the upper right corner of trajectory showing a large overshoot in the sway motion such a failure lasts for about 10 s as shown in fig 30 however the control system on k class ii works properly allowing the twin lift system to follow the time varying setpoints in this case the heading angle of two vessels remain within the range of 179 181 demonstrating that short term failure in control system of one vessel will not bring about an inability to maintain heading control meanwhile it should be noted that a single failure test is insufficient to prove that the given controller can deal with a dp failure or miscommunication a more robust cooperative controller should be further studied which could consider the dp failure of other vessel and change the control law 4 conclusion the experimental system of a novel twin lift decommissioning operation has been immensely developed implemented and tested with wave tank test each vessel twin vessels and triple vessels are able to achieve station keeping and low speed maneuvering capabilities with the pid controller and optimization based thrust allocation the monitoring system has been also developed in order to ensure efficiency and safety of wave tank test and future operation the experimental results reveal some key conclusions 1 the control algorithms work properly on the model test of twin lift decommissioning system including independent setpoints generation and pid controller moving average filter and kalman filter as well as optimization based thrust allocation method 2 during the entry and exit involving three vessels the hydrodynamic coupling effect and thruster interaction are nonlinear and complicated it may result in a lower ability to maintain position or heading thus the sway fender is suggested to be installed on the two sides of x class vessel a limitation of this study is that the limited failure test that were presented and investigated for this more research is needed regarding the ability of the given controller to cope with dp failure and miscommunication credit authorship contribution statement weidong zhang supervision methodology

20594,hundreds of offshore platforms are approaching the end of their productive life and will require decommissioning within the next decade removal of a large offshore structure is a highly complex exercise that poses significant safety challenges in this paper we propose a new concept to remove large and heavy structures with a single lift utilizing three semi submerged vessels such a twin lift solution for decommissioning involves an operation of lifting of a topside structure carried on two semi submerged vessels to the third semi submerged vessel although the method appears simple it requires adequate stability using ballast tank and synchronized motion of moving vessels especially under environmental disturbances in order to ensure efficiency and safety we perform a wave tank test for such a twin lift decommissioning solution some aspects of an experimental facility set up for scaled model test with dynamic positioning dp system are described it includes the layout of the experiment and details of the deck mating dp and monitoring system preliminary experimental results are presented to reveal that a simple controller combined with dp system is able to produce a robust

the coming years fowler et al 2014 the decommissioning operation involves a variety of issues such as financial viability risk and safety management environmental protection and technical feasibility etc decom north sea zero waste scotland 2015 it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each removal methods and further develop a cost effective option topside removal is generally the reverse engineering of the installation there are a variety of approaches that can be taken to the remove platform topside the heavy lifting vessel hlv has been seen as the first option especially with regard to the platform topsides weighing less than 5000 tons however for a bigger and heavier topside the existing platform cranes have limited capability these topsides are usually pieced into smaller sections to facilitate the heavy lifting crane therefore there is increased time at sea and work associated with separation of the modules and the costs of conventional heavy lifting operation can be prohibitive single lift is the removal of the platform topsides in a single unit reducing the number of cuts needed therefore the single lift removal is preferable over the multiple piece decommissioning methods because it has smaller cost and less risk rassenfoss 2014 in 2010 the versabar s vb 10 000 heavy lift vessel was built to perform single piece removal with the lift capacity of 7500 tons versabar 2013 the vb 10 000 consists of dual truss frames mounted on the top of two barges forming a catamaran the mpu heavy lifter erling holm hannes ludescher 2008 which is equipped with a u shaped concrete hull and a pair of lifting frames makes it possible to enclose the platform and lift the topside up to 15 000 tons technip liu and li 2017 proposed a design for the decommissioning salvage installation vessel dsiv which has a catamaran configuration and is able to remove large topsides up to 25 000 tons in 2017 the brent delta topside 24 000 tons was successfully removed by a new twin hull vessel purpose built for single lift removal of large oil and gas platforms it took 12 h for the full operational cycle comprising the move in around the platform yoke connection pre tensioning de ballasting and fast lift imca 2017 however such a construction vessel is equipped with special purpose crane which will bring about the challenge of availability meanwhile it gives a little cost reduction on the overall decommissioning project cost when we account for the additional maintenance and worldwide mobilization costs ahiaga dagbui et al 2017 in order to squeeze out costs and safety the twin lift decommissioning method involving three semi submerged vessels is proposed in 2014 a new concept has been released to remove topside using two semi submerged vessels equipped with a set of giant cranes marine 2016 in this paper we propose an alternative approach using three semi submerged vessels compared with a giant twin hull vessel we can reduce the cost of mobilization to transfer the submerge vessels from shipyard to the decommissioning region moreover such a novel twin lift decommissioning operation is expected to complete in less than 8 h even without the special purpose crane therefore the twin lift decommissioning method is able to bring a significant cost savings to the decommissioning operation cosco 2019 specifically it uses the following procedure three semi submerged vessels two k class and one x class vessel arrive in the platform field and then set up on dp two k class vessels are ballasted to achieve a desired freeboard and heel angle two k class vessels approach the mating position until they are positioned either side of the jacket beneath the topside see fig 1 a these vessels are equipped with the deck mating units dmu see fig 1 b which comprise the stabbing cone receptor vertical elastomeric pad and horizontal elastomeric pad the dmus are designed to absorb the impact during operation and to provide adequate control of the synchronized motions of two k class vessels hu et al 2017 the topside offload is completely by de ballasting two k class vessels beneath the topside transferring the total topside weight from jacket to the k class vessels see fig 1 c two k class vessels carry the topside and move it into the x class vessel see fig 1 d till they slot into its appointed place transfer of the topsides to the x class vessel involved simultaneously ballasting two k class vessels and de ballasting x class vessel until the platform legs set down on the support stools see fig 1 e the novel twin lift decommissioning operation requires the synchronized motion of a fleet of vessels thus it is necessary to investigate the dp performance and formation control for the under actuated vehicles there is a lot of research work being done on the path following and trajectory tracking missions of marine vessels working in coordination in kyrkjebø and pettersen 2003 a closed loop method is proposed in which only position estimates of each vessel are needed to yield the semi global exponential convergence of relative position such a method is useful for the ship replenishment applying the lagrange multipliers to the control law for multiple vessels the authors ihle et al 2005 developed a formation control method considering the constraints between each vessels moreover the authors skjetne et al 2002 developed a decentralized formation control scheme by imposing a synchronization feedback function with a little inter vessel data transmission a fleet of vessels is able to follow a pre defined path the research arrichiello et al 2006 gives an extension of formation control method based on the null space behavioral control which also allows for the obstacle avoidance in the complex environments for the fully actuated vessels at low speed the applications of cooperative control method always involve the dp systems of multiple vessels accounting for the environmental loads on marine vehicles the cooperative dp controller is developed peng et al 2016 based on a modular design approach each vessel is able to reach the desired formation using the information of measured position of each vessel under the assumption that the relative position of each vessel is known to all the authors ianagui and tannuri 2019 proposed a synchronized position control scheme to achieve the desired cable loads between the towing vessel and tow disabled platform in queiroz filho and tannuri 2017 a method separates the formation control into the inner loop of dp system on each vessel and outer loop of cooperative controller for cooperative trajectory generation they performed a model test to demonstrate the control performance of the proposed combined controllers the experimental investigation on the given removal method have been presented to identify challenges associated with lift techniques and improve the sustainability of decommissioning an experimental framework of a novel decommissioning operation is described the motion capture control and monitoring system have been developed for and implemented on a scaled model of three semi submerged vessels we primarily focus on the functionality and implementation of each system required to achieve station keeping and low speed maneuvering capabilities on the twin lift decommissioning operation extensive wave tank tests have been completed to assess the performance of such a novel solution the rest of this paper is organized as follows at first the vessel model and thrust allocation algorithm are presented in section 2 then the experimental setup for scale model test in the wave tank are specified in section 3 finally experimental results are presented and the capability of the proposed controller are investigated conclusions are drawn at the end of this study 1 1 theoretical background consider the twin lift system with multiple rigid bodies two types of coordinate system are introduced as seen in fig 2 the global coordinate system defines the positions of vessels and topside structure in the wave tank we also construct the body fixed coordinate system for each rigid body with origin in the center of mass of each body these body fixed coordinate systems enable us to express the equation of angular motion and velocity in a simplest form zhang et al 2020 1 2 vessel model we develop and implement a 3dof surge sway and yaw marine craft equations of motion for the control system of each vessel fossen 2011 1 η t t η t v t 2 m v t d v t τ t τ e

regarding state estimation auger et al 2013 the discrete time state space model in equ 6 enables us to perform the real time kalman filtering bishop and welch 2001 as the state space model is linear a linear kalman filter is used to give more accurate and robust estimate of vessel motion given the estimated state x ˆ k 1 k 1 at time step k 1 7 x ˆ k k 1 a k x ˆ k 1 k 1 b k τ k p k k 1 a k p k 1 k 1

actuators thrusters rudders etc the thrust acting on the vessel 10 τ t b α u where u u 1 u 2 u m t r m represents the magnitude of the force produced by each actuator for each thruster we use the quadratic dependence of the propeller thrust with respect to rotational speed n i 11 u i k i n i n i where the thrust constant k i can be obtained using thrust calibration test and then the above formula can be applied to estimate the thrust in the control system the angle vector α α 1 α 2 α m t r m is the azimuth of each actuator defining the direction of the thrust produced in the horizontal plane the matrix b α r 3 m is given by 12 b α cos α 1 sin α 1 l x 1 sin α 1 l y 1 cos α 1 cos α 2 sin α 2 l x 2 sin α 2 l y 2 cos α 2 cos α m sin α m l x m sin α m l y m cos α m the location of the i th actuator is at l x i l y i in body in the model test control allocation problems are formulated as a quadratic programming qp with linear constraints which can be solved very reliably and efficiently boyd and vandenberghe 2004 singularity avoidance is also considered see johansen et al 2004 for the details we define the following qp min j δ α δ u s i 1 m d w i d u i u 0 i δ u i d 2 w i

allows the real time ta and generation of optimal control input namely rotational speed and azimuth then these commanded signal of thruster will be fed into the actuator to generate the desired force on each vessel 2 experimental setup the scale model test see fig 3 is designed as an experimental platform for control and monitoring systems used in twin lift decommissioning operation the experimental system see fig 4 comprises industry grade components including the observer control system industrial wireless local area network system wlan actuator system monitoring system and other decommissioning aids the observer and control system are implemented using c code including low pass filter and velocity estimator kalman filter a proportional integral derivative pid controller a ta algorithm etc such a c implementation called by dpdecom is developed and run on a 3 60 ghz intel core i7 7820x running debian 9 6 2 1 the 3dof vessel model the total mass matrix can be calculated based on the rigid body inertia matrix and added mass matrix in the model test the following mass matrix is used k class i vessel m 623 0 0 0 706 444 0 444 1298 d 17 0 0 0 20 0 0 0 100 k class ii vessel m 623 0 0 0 706 444 0 444 1298 d 17 0 0 0 20 0 0 0 100 x class vessel m 1157 0 0 0 1311 825 0 825 2411 d 34 0 0 0 40 0 0 0 200 the main particulars for each vessel are listed in table 1 the motion response is given at the center of gravity cog on each vessel 2 2 observer the optical motion capture system makes it possible to measure the position and rotation of multiple moving objects with high accuracy the motion capture cameras can easily identify 4 markers fixed on each vessel see fig 3 and then compute the 6dof motion data using the qualisys track manager qtm software the motion tracking can be done in real time on a 1 8 ghz intel xeon running windows 7 the processed real time 6dof data can be retrieved from qtm server over a tcp ip socket connection in real time in this model test the sample frequency of motion capture system is set to 50 hz we use moving average filter to eliminate the noise in the raw motion data which enables reliable estimates of velocity notice that the real time sample frequency of qtm can be lower than 50hz if the qtm cannot process all the camera data thus it is important to compute the real time sample time and then perform the velocity estimation after the moving average filter and velocity estimation the measured state x t x y ϕ u v r t are computed at the sample frequency of 10hz which could sufficiently handle the dynamics of twin lift system kjetil 2017 then the measured state is fed into the linear kalman filter mentioned in section 2 2 to give the optimal state estimation for linear state space model 2 3 heading normalization since the yaw angle retrieved from qtm will stay between 180 the estimated yaw angle may jump from 180 to 180 which is undesirable for control system such an issue has been resolved in the dpdecom when estimating the heading for the vessels or the difference between desired and estimated heading angle it is necessary to find the shortest path for rotation as the vessel heading are defined in the range of 180 the shortest path problems can be solved by normalizing the heading angle to 180 when the heading error calculation and heading estimation is needed 2 4 controller the controller consists of the setpoints generation and dp system the setpoint generation is responsible for generating a reference trajectory for each vessel while the dp system is used to stabilize the vessel motion based on the setpoints as the desired trajectory for multiple vessels is simple the setpoint generation for each vessel is independent without any information shared with each other the dp system for each vessel consists of a pid controller qp based ta a pid controller attempts to minimize the error e t as the difference between a desired setpoint x d t and a observed state x t this error is given by 17 e t x d t x t 18 τ p i d t k p e t k i 0 t e τ d τ k d d e t d t the implementation of the pid controller in the dpdecom is given by 19 τ p i d k k p e k k i i k n i k e i δ t k d v e k where v e denotes the estimated velocity from the observer n k the output saturation is considered in the pid controller according the thrust limit of each vessel table 2 lists the control limits of each vessel 2 5 actuator system each k class vessel has 2 bow thrusters and 2 twin azimuth thrusters the x class vessel has 2 bow thrusters and 2 ducted azimuth thrusters 2 main propellers and rudders for the application in the low speed motion control the thrust generated by main propeller and rudder are typically much larger than that of azimuth and tunnel thrusters this means that the servomotor equipped with the main propeller will operate at relatively low rotational speed which is undesirable for servomotor therefore the main propeller and rudder are not included in the ta and we treat 2 tunnel thruster as one thruster whose locations are listed in table 3 for each azimuth thruster the rate of rotation and the speed of response from zero to full thrust are used to compute the constraints on rotational speed and azimuth in the ta for each bow thruster the speed of response from full thrust port to full thrust starboard is also considered these actuator saturation limits are summarized in table 4 the actuator on each vessel consists of a programmable logic controller plc servomotor and servo drive gearbox and propeller see fig 5 the servo motors are capable of extremely precise speed position and torque control by means of plc based servo drives profinet which is an industry technical standard for data communication over industrial ethernet enables the servo drive to link plc and client module for industrial lan with integrated real time auto tuning and automatic suppression of machine resonances such an actuator system automatically optimizes itself to achieve high dynamic performance and smooth operation on each vessel we use 6 ac servomotors to enable the propeller to convert rotational motion into thrust four motors with incremental encoder are used for velocity control and two motors with absolute encoder are used for azimuth control the information about servomotors used in the model test are listed in table 5 2 6 industrial wlan in this model test the industrial wlan comprises one accessing point ap and three client modules as shown in fig 6 each vessel has one client module which could receive and send message to ap the profinet based industrial wlan is capable of real time data transfer with high priority with time delay less than 10 ms the industrial wlan makes it possible to monitor and display the real time performance of servomotors used on each vessel these performances include the power consumption rotational speed or angle and alarm signal of each servomotor 2 7 decommissioning aids and force monitoring system the decommissioning aids including the dmu and the leg separation unit lsu are designed to absorb energy due to the vertical and horizontal movement of the topsides leg stubs during the twin lift operation the horizontal and vertical stiffness of these units are calibrated based on their design specifications as seen in fig 7 though the dmu load on each vessel is significant the dp control treats these dmu loads as the external disturbance the force transducers are mounted on 4 dmus see fig 8 which enable us to measure the impact load on each dmu the force monitoring system comprises two parts see fig 7 b the industrial personal computer ipc are used to collect and save the impact force on the dmu while simultaneously it sends data using tcp ip socket the force monitoring software could receive and display the real time impact force all these monitoring activities can be done in real time on a 2 6 ghz intel i5 running windows 10 2 8 software structure the dpdecom is a multi threaded c application see fig 9 developed using qt 5 5 library for graphical user interface eigen 3 3 library for linear algebra mosek 7 library for convex optimization and sqlite3 for database there are three operating modes used to control each vessel manual control using gamepad heading only control and dynamic positioning the gui also incorporates easy switching between these operating modes 2 9 wave calibration the specified irregular waves were calibrated according to the jonswap spectra the wave calibration test was performed in the wave tank 50 m 30 m 0 7m equipped with a wave generator and wave absorber a wave absorber is a slope beach located at the end of basin to eliminate the wave deflection xiao et al 2016 it can be found in fig 10 that the experimental power spectral densities closely matched the corresponding target spectra this demonstrates that high quality wave generation was achieved based on the scale ratio 1 37 in the model test 3 results the wave tank test has been performed including the thrust measurement test and automatic control involving multiple vessels the experimental results are presented in the following section 3 1 thrust measurement to measure the thrust of each propeller we use a 3 component force transducer which enables dynamic force measurement in x y and z directions the rated capacity of such a force transducer is 500n when the a plane as seen in fig 11 is fixed with the hull and the b plane remains fixed thrust of each propeller could be acquired the experimental results of such a twin azimuth thruster configuration can be found in fig 12 demonstrating that the influence of the azimuth on thrust can be ignored and thus we use a constant thruster number for each azimuth thruster in the dpdecom as listed in table 6 3 2 case 1 dp test 4 corner box maneuver to test the dp system a 4 corner box maneuver test in random wave jonswap spectrum with h s 0 75 m t p 6 s θ 135 and constant wind v w 1 35 m s θ 135 has been adopted where the topside is carried by both k class i and ii vessels the details of pid controllers for each vessel can be found in table 7 we can find the overshoot in the trajectory of each vessel due to the controller saturation see fig 13 as the thrust in the sway direction must overcome the second order wave force and wind load it may bring about the controller saturation and thus the overshoot and undershoot in the transverse movement fig 14 and fig 15 illustrate the time series of planar motion of k class i and k class ii vessel respectively for the wave at θ 135 we have seen the great heading hold capability of each vessel with variation in heading angle less than 1 deg the relative distance between two k class vessels lies within the range of 2 42 m 2 44 m see fig 16 this reveals that it is relatively safe for two vessels to carry topside structure in case1 the control allocation algorithm works properly see fig 17 and is able to produce the generalized thrust almost the same as the desired thrust at every time instant it can be seen from fig 18 that there is an abrupt change in the commanded azimuth and rotation of k class ii vessel at t 5680 s even restricted by the limitation of each thruster the reason is that the sudden change occurs in the desired generalized force of k class ii vessel a simple solution could be averaging rotation and azimuth commands to provide a smooth time history the dmu load is closely associated with the roll and pitch motion of vessel therefore more intense roll motion of each vessel may result in larger impact load on dmu in the y direction see fig 19 the mean dmu load in the z direction is approximately 11 2 kg while the maximum and minimum values are 13 0 kg and 9 4 kg 3 3 case 2 dp test entry involving three vessels the model test for the entry operation has been carried out in the irregular wave jonswap spectrum with h s 1 25 m t p 6 s θ 180 and constant wind v w 1 65 m s θ 180 where the two k class vessels carry the topside into the x class vessel see fig 20 and table 8 it can be seen from figs 21 23 that the it involves the measurement noise and outliers in the raw data from motion capture server these noise and outliers may be caused by the marker reflection in water however fig 21 also demonstrates that the real time estimated data appears to be robust to the noise and outliers meanwhile the control algorithm is able to solve such a measurement problem and automatically maintain each vessel s position and heading under the environmental disturbance it can be seen from fig 24 that the relative distance lies in the range of 2 41 m 2 45 m however the variation on the relative distance in case 2 appears to be larger than that in case 1 especially for the time duration of entry this may be caused by the hydrodynamic coupling effect and the thruster interaction between multiple vessels it can be observed from fig 25 that the achieved generalized forces validate the accuracy and reliability of thrust allocation during maneuvering meanwhile the real time controller output in f x f y and m z appears to lie within the range of controller saturation in table 2 figs 26 and 27 shows that the resulting azimuth angle and rotation exhibit some chattering which can be handled by the servomotor and mechanical system on each vessel the hydrodynamic coupling effect between three vessel hull may result in the larger variation in the transverse movement of each vessel and also the dmu load in the y direction see figs 21 and 28 it is recommended that the sway fender between the vessel hull can be used to protect the vessels however it seems impossible that the k class vessel will collide against the x class vessel during the entrance as the two k class vessels carrying topside moves into the mating position around the x class vessel the mean value of vertical dmu load is approximately 11 0 kg while the maximum and minimum values are 12 5 kg and 9 2 kg 3 4 case3 stress test 4 corner box maneuver the performance of controller need to be validated by imposing some failures in one vessel it can be seen from fig 29 that control system on the k class i vessel fails to work on the upper right corner of trajectory showing a large overshoot in the sway motion such a failure lasts for about 10 s as shown in fig 30 however the control system on k class ii works properly allowing the twin lift system to follow the time varying setpoints in this case the heading angle of two vessels remain within the range of 179 181 demonstrating that short term failure in control system of one vessel will not bring about an inability to maintain heading control meanwhile it should be noted that a single failure test is insufficient to prove that the given controller can deal with a dp failure or miscommunication a more robust cooperative controller should be further studied which could consider the dp failure of other vessel and change the control law 4 conclusion the experimental system of a novel twin lift decommissioning operation has been immensely developed implemented and tested with wave tank test each vessel twin vessels and triple vessels are able to achieve station keeping and low speed maneuvering capabilities with the pid controller and optimization based thrust allocation the monitoring system has been also developed in order to ensure efficiency and safety of wave tank test and future operation the experimental results reveal some key conclusions 1 the control algorithms work properly on the model test of twin lift decommissioning system including independent setpoints generation and pid controller moving average filter and kalman filter as well as optimization based thrust allocation method 2 during the entry and exit involving three vessels the hydrodynamic coupling effect and thruster interaction are nonlinear and complicated it may result in a lower ability to maintain position or heading thus the sway fender is suggested to be installed on the two sides of x class vessel a limitation of this study is that the limited failure test that were presented and investigated for this more research is needed regarding the ability of the given controller to cope with dp failure and miscommunication credit authorship contribution statement weidong zhang supervision methodology
