17260,beaches along the great lakes shorelines are important recreational and economic resources however contamination at the beaches can threaten their usage during the swimming season potentially resulting in beach closures and or advisories thus understanding the dynamics that control nearshore water quality is integral to effective beach management there have been significant improvements in this effort including incorporating modeling empirical mechanistic in recent years mechanistic modeling frameworks can contribute to this understanding of dynamics by determining sources and interactions that substantially impact fecal indicator bacteria concentrations an index routinely used in water quality monitoring programs to simulate e coli concentrations at jeorse park beaches in southwest lake michigan a coupled hydrodynamic and wave current interaction model was developed that progressively added contaminant sources from river inputs avian presence bacteria sediment interactions and bacteria sand sediment interactions results indicated that riverine inputs affected e coli concentrations at jeorse park beaches only marginally while avian shoreline sand and sediment sources were much more substantial drivers of e coli contamination at the beach by including avian and riverine inputs as well as bacteria sand sediment interactions at the beach models can reasonably capture the variability in observed e coli concentrations in nearshore water and bed sediments at jeorse park beaches consequently it will be crucial to consider avian contamination sources and water sand sediment interactions in effective management of the beach for public health and as a recreational resource and to extend these findings to similar beaches affected by shoreline embayment graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction great lakes beaches are a substantial source of recreational and economic opportunities for surrounding municipalities throughout the great lakes region see steinman et al 2017 millions of visitors use the beaches annually contributing more than 800 million us dollars in revenue per swimming season shaikh 2012 however recreating at these beaches comes with an inherent risk associated with contamination of the beach and water by pathogenic microorganisms e g pathogenic bacteria viruses that cause waterborne illnesses while often not pathogenic itself escherichia coli e coli is used as an indicator of fecal contamination of recreational water high levels of e coli are frequently accompanied by pathogens of human health concern dufour 1984 further beaches located in highly developed and densely populated areas such as jeorse park along southern lake michigan have long been characterized as some of the most highly contaminated recreational areas in the united states with e coli concentrations exceeding water quality standards during more than 25 of each swimming season between 2008 and 2012 dorfman and haren 2014 the potential presence of pathogens highlights the importance of tracking sources of fecal indicator bacteria like e coli in nearshore environments so that coastal managers can minimize or eliminate sources contributing to high e coli levels in situ tracking of bacterial contamination in recreational water commonly takes the form of analyzing water samples for e coli concentrations via culture methods epa methods 1603 1103 1 which causes significant delays 18 24 hours in obtaining results on ambient water quality and can lead to incorrect or untimely decisions regarding the safety of recreational waters see nevers et al 2014 as a result beach science research has begun to prioritize the use of alternate approaches including culture independent gene based or molecular assays and predictive models for assessment of recreational water quality in real time boehm et al 2009 dorner et al 2006 liu et al 2006 kashefipour et al 2006 nevers et al 2014 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 some of these models are mechanistic using hydrometeorological biological and physical data to predict bacterial concentrations contemporaneously thupaki et al 2013 while others are statistical holcomb et al 2018 nevers and whitman 2005 mechanistic models have been developed and used to characterize recreational water quality and to track sources of microbial contamination for decades and their ability to predict bacterial fate and transport has become more reliable over time liu et al 2006 hipsey et al 2008 debrauwere et al 2011 gao et al 2011 thupaki et al 2013 feng et al 2015 safaie et al 2016 weiskerger and phanikumar 2020 the source loading and decay terms used in these models do not capture all impacts on the fate and transport of e coli therefore accounting for additional sources and processes that impact indicator bacteria concentrations may enhance the predictability of mechanistic fate and transport models bacteria in water are substantially impacted by the effects of sediment resuspension and transport due to their propensity to attach to a variety of environmental substrates including sediment particles and aquatic vegetation schillinger et al 1985 pachepsky et al 2008 fries et al 2006 whitman et al 2003 in low velocity waters indicator bacteria e g e coli enterococci often attach to suspended sediment and settle out creating a bacterial sink for the water column these settled bacteria and sediments can then be resuspended during high current and wave events causing the sediment to switch from being an e coli sink to an e coli source for the water column pandey et al 2012 ishii et al 2007 because of these complexities in sediment transport dynamics numerical models commonly forgo incorporating them into their predictions of e coli fate and transport when models included sediment bacteria dynamics model performance metrics such as r2 were found to improve pandey et al 2012 cho et al 2010 thupaki et al 2016 wave current interactions have considerable effect on bottom shear stress sediment transport and bacterial concentrations in some systems the contribution of waves to the bottom shear stress is so significant lou et al 2000 chao et al 2008 that the contribution of currents can be ignored e g roberts et al 2019 at these beaches high energy wave action can impact e coli concentrations in the water column by depositing sediment and bacteria into the foreshore sand and subsequently resuspending it back into the water column whitman et al 2003 vogel et al 2016 alm et al 2003 ishii et al 2007 yamahara et al 2007 weiskerger et al 2019 hydrodynamic models accounting for the effects of deposition on the beach and foreshore sand as a bacterial source explained 41 44 of variability in empirical e coli data at a chicago beach ge et al 2010 these results suggest that foreshore sand and coastal loading can influence nearshore bacterial concentrations avian usage of recreational beaches can provide a substantial source of fecal bacteria to nearshore waters gould and fletcher 1978 fogarty et al 2003 meerburg et al 2011 converse et al 2012 byappanahalli et al 2015 staley and edge 2016 alm et al 2017 so that gull ring billed larus delawarensis and herring gull larus argentatus removal has been correlated with lower e coli concentrations in the nearshore region nevers et al 2018 despite the well documented impacts of gulls on nearshore water quality it is rare for either statistical or numerical models to account for gull influences on e coli at beaches debrauwere et al 2014 sanders et al 2005 ge et al 2010 russell et al 2013 while existing models without avian impacts have reasonable predictive capacity it is expected that including terms for these impacts will increase the skill of such models the objective of this research was to systematically quantify the relative contributions of birds shoreline sand riverine inputs and sediment resuspension to the observed levels of e coli in water at jeorse park the beach areas at jeorse park have diverse and variable potential sources of contamination including outflow from the nearby grand calumet gc river gull feces and resuspension of microbes entrained in sand and sediments due to wave action these potentially synergistic sources of e coli to the beach byappanahalli et al 2015 nevers et al 2018 2020 demand a more holistic and integrated investigation into their relative influences on beach water quality to our knowledge this work is a first of its kind approach to modeling such potential sources of contamination by systematically developing mechanistic models to evaluate the relative impacts of birds sand water sediment interactions and river inputs as sources of e coli in the nearshore at jeorse park beach 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the jeorse park beaches fig 1 in southwestern lake michigan along the northwestern indiana coast 41 39 0 44 n 87 25 59 76 w have been identified as some of the nation s most polluted beaches dorfman and haren 2014 potentially contributing to the e coli exceedances are the outflow of the grand calumet river gc river sediment dynamics and gull activities previous studies have identified microbial markers of gulls at jeorse park beaches and have attempted to link the shoreline and gc river using 16s rrna gene sequencing approach byappanahalli et al 2015 nevers et al 2020 nakatsu et al 2018 these findings have identified the presence of indicator bacteria associated with gull populations and also an abundance of microbes bacteria in shoreline sand sediment and water matrices implying that a consortium of bacterial communities rather than one or two traditional water quality indicators is more useful in understanding contaminant sources and potential interactions among these matrices 2 2 observational data 2 2 1 hydrodynamic temperature and sediment model calibration data a bottom mounted upward looking acoustic doppler current profiler adcp was deployed in

verified using a sample of particles with a known size distribution 2 2 2 water and sand sampling e coli model calibration data lake michigan water from three sites at jeorse park jp1 jp2 jpw was routinely sampled and analyzed for e coli concentrations grab samples were taken monday through friday between august 12 and september 7 2016 at 7 00 8 00 am and 12 00 1 00 pm following the standard methods from the world health organization s annapolis protocol who 1999 water samples 250 ml were taken at 45 cm depth and were immediately transferred to coolers and transported to the u s geological survey lake michigan ecological research station in chesterton indiana for analysis in addition to lake michigan samples water from the gc river was sampled roughly three river miles from its outlet to lake michigan samples of sand in the swash zone 0 5 meters onshore from the extent of the contemporaneous wave runup and lakebed sediment at water sampling locations were obtained using sterilized gardening trowels and 1 inch diameter plastic tube cores sand and sediment samples were taken within three 0 25 square meter frames to ensure relative homogeneity of the samples sand samples were obtained by digging surface sterilized hand trowels roughly 5 cm below the surface of the sand in the swash zone likewise submerged lakebed sediment samples were taken by digging sterilized tube cores roughly 5 cm beneath the lakebed surface within three 0 25 square meter frames and carefully removing from the water column to avoid loss each sample was at least 100 grams and was placed into sterile polyethylene whirl pak bags nasco sampling fort atkinson wi the bags were placed into coolers for transport to usgs lake michigan ecological research station for analysis within four to 24 hours of collection for water and sand sediment samples respectively all samples were analyzed using the colilert 18 chromogenic test for e coli presence and concentration idexx

quantitative and qualitative data were collected via sanitary surveys numbers of birds air and water temperatures wind speed and direction and weather conditions were all noted for each sampling trip full sanitary surveys were completed for jeorse park while only air and water temperature and qualitative observations of water and bird conditions e g juvenile or adult bird were noted for the gc river site upon return to usgs turbidity measurements were taken for each water sample using a hach 2100n benchtop turbidimeter hach loveland co 2 3 hydrodynamic and wave models the unsteady three dimensional unstructured grid numerical model fvcom finite volume coastal ocean model chen et al 2003 was used in this study to resolve both large scale that is lake wide and nearshore hydrodynamic features fvcom has been successfully used to describe transport of tracers and indicator bacteria in the great lakes and their tributaries in the past safaie et al 2016 2017 2020 nguyen et al 2014 2017 anderson and phanikumar 2011 we coupled the fvcom hydrodynamic model with fvcom surface wave model fvcom swave to simulate wave current interactions and calibrated the wave model for the jeorse park area fvcom swave uses an unstructured grid finite volume version of swan simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 to simulate wave current interactions qi et al 2009 details of these models and the coupling procedure used in fvcom swave are in the supplementary material section s2 after calibration the fvcom swave was coupled with the e coli and sediment transport models to understand the effects of including wave current interactions on water quality simulation results the unstructured grids for jeorse park with 14346 nodes and 26439 elements were created using the surface water modeling system sms www aquaveo com the horizontal resolution of grid cells ranged from 10 m near the shoreline to 1 5 km in the center of the lake the model used a terrain following coordinate system with 30 vertical geometric sigma layers additional details of the hydrodynamic model and sources of meteorological data used in the modeling are in the supplementary material section s2 the model simulations were started on may 2 2016 with a uniform vertical temperature profile determined from observations at two buoys maintained by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s national data buoy center ndbc 45002 45007 2 4 suspended sediment transport model to develop a model for predicting e coli concentrations with sediment and e coli interactions a coupled wave current sediment transport model was used to calculate sediment transport on jeorse park beaches for sediment transport fvcom uses an unstructured grid version of the usgs community sediment transport model originally developed by warner et al 2008 within the framework we modeled two size classes based on sediment distribution data measured by the lisst 100x based on these data the two size classes were a fine sediment class with which e coli are known to interact jeng et al 2005 and a coarse sediment class representing sand size classification of sediment were obtained based on particle size distributions recorded by the lisst 100x sequoia scientific bellevue wa because beach infill to change the shoreline angle was considered as a restoration strategy to mitigate bacterial contamination as communicated by project managers michael spinar indiana department of environmental management personal communication sand dynamics at the beach for current natural conditions without infill was included in our modeling for the relatively short period of simulation reported in the present work summer 2016 changes in beach morphology were negligible but the model considered these effects allowing for a more realistic simulation of changes in bottom shear stress and sediment processes the three dimensional sediment model included suspended sediment and bedload transport the suspended load model used the following advection dispersion equation to simulate suspended sediment concentration of each sediment class in the water column thupaki et al 2013 gao et al 2011 1 s i t u s i x v s i x w w s i s i x x k h s i x y k h s i y z k v s i z where s i and w s i are concentrations of sediment and settling velocity for each sediment class i respectively u v w are velocity components m d in x y and z directions and k h and k v denote the horizontal x y and vertical z mixing coefficients m2 d respectively a no flux boundary condition is specified at the surface warner et al 2008 2 k v s i z 0 z ζ where ζ denotes the water surface elevation deposition f s s and erosion f r s at the bottom boundary were modeled as shown below warner et al 2008 3 k v s i z f r s i f s s i z h the erosion term is given by 4 f r s i δ t q i 1 ϕ f b i τ b τ c e i 1 where q i is the erosive flux and ϕ is the bottom porosity f b i represents the fraction of sediment size class i on the bottom of the lake τ b is the net bottom shear stress which was calculated based on wave current interactions τ c e i is the critical shear stress for erosion of sediment size class i four sediment bed layers 6 25 cm thick each were initialized in the sediment transport model each bed layer had initial bed porosity of 0 45 resistance of the topmost layer to erosion is usually very low therefore its critical shear stress was set to 0 1 n m2 other underlying layers were assumed to have critical shear stresses of 0 15 0 2 and 0 25 n m2 respectively from top to bottom the net bottom shear stress τ b with wave current interactions is given by 5 τ b τ c τ w where τ c denotes the current shear stress τ w is the wave generated bed shear stress which is commonly defined as cho et al 2008 6 τ w 1 2 ρ f w u b o t 2 in which ρ is the water density f w is the wave friction factor and u b o t is the near bottom wave orbital velocity the wave friction factor is approximated based on the ratio of the bottom orbital excursion amplitude to the bottom roughness length a b k b by the following expressions madsen 1994 7 f w 0 3 a b k b 0 2 exp 7 02 a b k b 0 078 8 82 0 2 a b k b 100 exp 5 61 a b k b 0 109 7 30 a b k b 100 the orbital velocity was obtained from swan which was coupled with the hydrodynamic model to test the performance of fvcom swave in predicting wave generated bed shear stress bottom orbital velocity was estimated from near bottom velocity measurements made roughly an inch from the bottom figure s2 in supplementary material and compared with simulation results the bottom orbital velocity was calculated based on near bottom velocity spectra following the method of wiberg and sherwood 2008 the coupled wave current sediment transport model used in this study was equipped with the wave current sediment bbl module that accounts for combined effects of currents and waves warner et al 2008 the treatment of bbl is important for simulation of the lake circulation determination of the sediment transport rate for the bedload as well as sediment resuspension rate bed load transport was calculated following the meyer peter and müller 1948 formula bed dynamics were simulated based on the active layer concept an active layer thickness z a was determined at each time step using harris and wiberg 1997 8 z a max k 1 τ s f τ c e ρ 0 0 k 2 d 50 τ c e is the averaged critical stress of sediment classes for erosion d 50 is the median grain size of surface sediment k 1 and k 2 are empirical constants equal to 0 007 and 6 0 respectively the sediment model was calibrated specifically for the jeorse park beaches configuration with breakwalls on either side of the beach and a peninsula bordering the northwest side of the beach 2 5 bacterial fate and transport models the e coli models were run for four cases progressively incorporating more influences and interactions in the first case the outflow of gc river was considered as the only source of e coli called model 1 here then for the second case in addition to the contributions from the outflow of gc river considered in model 1 avian contributions were included as a nonpoint source but without bacteria sand sediment interactions this model is called model 2 here the third case includes additional suspended sediment and bedload transport processes on top of processes already included in model 2 in this case we used a bacteria fate and transport model with wave current interactions model 3 for the last case the exchange of e coli between surf zone and shoreline sand on the beach were considered using a model model 4 with bacteria sand sediment interactions these details are summarized in table s2 in supplementary material the governing equations for models 1 4 as well as parameter values of the models are also summarized in the supplementary material a group of gulls at jeorse park beach september 16 2016 is shown in fig 2 gull activities and roosting have been reported to be in highest numbers near coastal areas schwemmer garthe 2005 sanders et al 2005 to simulate avian contributions we assumed that gulls were mostly confined to shallow water 0 5 m and adjacent interstitial areas fig 2 a matlab function randi was used to assign gull droppings to random fvcom nodes located in the shallow water of the beach in this process each bird was treated as an individual the focus of this research was on contributions of gulls primarily ring billed gull larus delawarensis hereafter referred to with any other transients collectively as gulls to water quality at the beach during bird counts at the beach from august 10 to september 7 2016 other species of birds were observed such as spotted sandpiper actitis macularius canada goose branta canadensis killdeer charadrius vociferous barn swallow hirundo rustica american crow corvus brachyrhynchos american avocet recurvirostra americana and double crested cormorant phalacrocorax auritus wild goose chase inc 2016 fig s3 presents percentage and number of different species of birds observed at jeorse park beaches during the study this pie chart indicates that ring billed gull canada goose and spotted sandpiper were the most common species visiting the beaches respectively barn swallows and double crested cormorants were just flying overhead and they rarely landed the shoreline was often occupied by primarily ring billed gulls spotted sandpipers were also seen running near the water s edge on the beach since there were limited numbers and they do not primarily occupy the water we did not consider this species in the model moreover trained dogs were used to haze geese and keep them away from the water at the study area wild goose chase inc 2016 therefore gulls were the only bird group considered in simulating the direct effect of birds on beach water quality observational data for the number of the gulls seen in the water were used to simulate the direct effect of gulls on water quality at the beach the number of e coli in gull feces was reported in the range of 105 to 109 cfu g 1 in the great lakes area fogarty et al 2003 fecal coliforms in gull feces consist of 95 99 e coli lévesque 2000 therefore e coli concentrations per gram of gull feces could be approximately similar to fecal coliform concentrations large quantities of fecal coliforms were reported in gull droppings with a geometric mean of 2 1 108 cfu g 1 lévesque 2000 gould and fletcher 1978 reported that the number of droppings of four species of gull in 24 h varied between 39 to 62 and daily average wet weight of feces ranged from 11 2 to 24 9 g day 1 based on this information it was assumed that each gull seen in the water contributed e coli at 2 108 most probably number mpn h 1 g 1 of feces gould and fletcher 1978 whitman and nevers 2003 edge and hill 2007 meerburg et al 2011 3 results and discussion in what follows we first present comparisons between observed data and model results for temperature important for representing e coli loss as well as for stratification and mixing wave characteristics and near bottom orbital velocities important for sediment transport and available suspended sediment data before presenting results from the e coli fate and transport models a comparison between simulated and observed temperatures at the ndbc buoy 45007 in southern lake michigan near milwaukee wisconsin as a function of time day of year doy shows that the model reproduced observed temperatures well for a comparison of temperatures in the nearshore region contour plots of observed and simulated water temperatures c at the thermistor chain location are shown in fig 3 panels b and c for the summer of 2016 the model could not predict very low temperatures e g doys 240 and 251 likely caused by upwelling cold water it was noted that the thermistor chain mooring swayed considerably during the deployment period introducing significant positional uncertainty in addition to measurement uncertainty into the temperature measurements especially in the top layers given the complexity of the nearshore processes and the uncertainties the comparisons with temperature data are considered reasonable comparisons between vertically integrated currents from adcp observations at the location adcp m table s1 supplemental material and simulations based on the fvcom swave model that is with wave current interactions are shown in fig s4 in the supplementary material the root mean squared error rmse values in eastward and northward directions were 0 0201 and 0 0224 m s respectively contour plots of observed and simulated velocities in the nearshore region near jeorse park for summer 2016 are also shown in fig s5 supplementary material in fig 4 the significant wave height swh which represents the mean wave height of the highest third of the waves the dominant wave period dwp the wave period associated with the highest energetic waves and the mean wave direction mwd of the waves were compared with observed data collected at the adcp m location the time series of swh at this location was well captured by the coupled wave current fvcom swave model rmse 0 1 m r2 0 93 rmse and r2 values for dwp were 2 24 s and 0 60 respectively observed swh and dwp had more variation with time than exhibited by the model and this observation was also made by previous researchers who reported similar comparisons qi et al 2009 additional comparisons for the wave model shown in figs s6 and s7 in the supplementary material indicate that the wave model captured the observed wave characteristics well spatial maps of significant wave height in the jeorse park area are shown in fig s8 and a comparison of the relative contributions of waves and currents to the total shear stress is shown in fig s9 because wave generated bed shear stress was the dominant component of the total shear stress due to the combined action of currents and waves roberts et al 2019 the measured and simulated bottom orbital velocities were compared eq 6 to ensure that bottom shear stress values are correctly computed by the model fig 5 shows comparisons between orbital velocities estimated from the down looking adcp and the up looking hr profiler measurements based on data from a 24 hour deployment and simulated results from fvcom swave for the same period the simulated and observed results are in good agreement and as expected the results show a correlation between the orbital velocity and significant wave height to ensure that the model was able to capture the dynamics of turbidity ssc at the beach sites a comparison of normalized turbidity from the obs3a sensor and normalized ssc simulated is shown in fig 6a this comparison indicates that the sediment model captured the observed dynamics especially when the turbidity values became high which often coincide with higher e coli concentrations in water nevers and whitman 2005 limited observed data are available for ssc and comparisons of observed and simulated ssc are shown in fig 6 b c in this simulation sediment particle size classifications based on lisst 100x were a fine sediment class with median sediment grain diameter of 26 μ m with which e coli are associated and a coarse sediment class with median sediment grain diameter of 330 μ m the simulated values of ssc are within the range of measured data at the jpw and jp1 locations fig 6 3 1 model 1 river source first the outflow of gc river was considered as the only source of e coli model 1 simulated results show that the effect of the gc river on jeorse park beaches is almost negligible fig 7 a the solid line in fig 7a represents simulated concentrations in all vertical layers which shows that the variability in the vertical direction is negligible for this simulation which ignores bird and bottom sediment contributions a similar model was used by safaie et al 2016 at beaches impacted by a nearby river in southern lake michigan and the model was able to predict e coli concentrations at the beaches with r2 values in the range of 0 42 0 82 and rmse values of 0 459 0 592 log10 cfu 100ml in this study however model 1 did not capture most of the observed data especially when the gc river experienced backflows from the lake fig s1 skill statistics related to this and other models were computed using different metrics e g fry et al 2013 and two metrics are summarized in table 1 r2 values are negative and rmse values are at or above 1 63 log10 mpn 100ml meaning that the model failed to predict contamination at the beaches using the gc river as the only source which is consistent with previous studies that show that a combination of external gc river and internal or intrinsic bacteria laden algae and sand defecations from shoreline birds and limited water circulation factors are responsible for degraded water quality at jeorse park and nearby beaches byappanahalli et al 2015 nevers et al 2018 the lack of predictability indicates that jeorse park beaches are likely not appreciably impacted by riverine contaminants from the gc river a result also supported by the microbial source tracking mst and the 16s rrna gene sequencing results from previous studies nakatsu et al 2019 nevers et al 2020 3 2 model 2 avian source avian contributions were considered as non point sources in addition to any point source impacts from the gc river which drains into lake michigan via the indiana harbor and ship canal byappanahalli et al 2015 nevers et al 2018 model 1 this model model 2 which focused on avian impacts in the water column in addition to the riverine source already considered in model 1 was able to capture some of the observed variability in e coli data but not all of it fig 7b although the number of birds at the beaches were counted at the time of sampling their exact positions are not known and this introduces some uncertainty into the modeling monte carlo simulations for 20 different random bird positions along the edge of the beach where birds were seen during sampling were used to assess whether the uncertainty in bird positions may have contributed to the less than ideal e coli predictions within the simulation shown in fig 7b model performance statistics based on these simulations show improvement compared with the performance of model 1 table 1 but the model 2 results are still not as good as the results of previous studies e g thupaki et al 2013 safaie et al 2016 and 2020 which was an indication that there was room for improvement by including additional processes such as sediment resuspension for example r2 values ranged from 0 03 to 0 27 and rmse ranged from 1 47 to 1 57 log10 mpn 100ml results show that uncertainty in bird position was not a substantial factor in explaining the observed variability fig 7b avian inputs do seem to influence e coli concentrations at the beaches to a degree however a large proportion of the variability in the data was not captured in model 2 and was either associated with sediment bacteria interactions or other factors that were not considered 3 3 model 3 sediment bacteria and wave current interactions in the next step the model with suspended and bed sediment and bacteria and wave current interactions was used while also retaining all inputs and processes considered in models 1 and 2 interactions with shoreline sand were not included in this model simulated results at jpw for 20 monte carlo simulations of bird positions with the same number of birds as well as the model 3 inputs for sediment bacteria and wave current interactions missing from model 2 are presented in fig 7c when model 3 was compared to the observed data at jeorse park beaches results show that model 3 was able to describe many of the observed peaks in e coli concentration this time the model r2 increased from 0 11 to 0 81 at jp1 from 0 03 to 0 75 at jp2 and from 0 27 to 0 4 at jpw the rmse value at jp1 decreased to 0 80 log10 mpn 100ml but at jp2 and jpw it still did not fall below 1 log10 mpn 100ml it should be noted that jp2 and jpw are nearer the retaining wall which could influence the sediment resuspension component due to circulation patterns see figure 1 these results indicate that sediment resuspension of bacteria to the water column in nearshore areas where much of the recreation is concentrated has an important influence on e coli concentrations after including the effects of sediment bacteria interactions on e coli concentrations at the beaches the uncertainty in the results due to different bird positions is greater than the uncertainty seen in models 1 and 2 moreover model 3 predicted increasing concentrations after doy 245 and the e coli concentration reached more than 3 5 104 mpn 100ml around doy 250 which was contrary to observations at the beaches if these predicted levels were reached the beach would be unsafe for any recreational activities and could expose people to potential pathogens introduced via point and or nonpoint sources comparison of observed and simulated e coli concentrations in the bed sediment for one realization of bird positions indicated that model 3 overestimated the bacteria levels in the bed sediment especially at the jpw location near the breakwater where most birds were present fig 8 a in addition resuspension of all e coli content from sediment bed to the water column caused the e coli concentration in the sediment to drop to zero on doy 243 which was followed by increasing the concentration in the water column 3 4 model 4 all interactions finally the results of the full e coli model with all interactions considered that is shoreline sand water bottom sediment water and wave current interactions model 4 at jpw are presented in fig 7d to reduce the computational cost this simulation was conducted using one set of bird positions only since the uncertainty associated with bird positions was already presented earlier although for a different model model 3 skill statistics of this simulation provided in table 1 indicate that the model performance metrics are comparable with those previous studies that simulated contamination at beaches impacted by nearby rivers e g thupaki et al 2013 safaie et al 2016 and 2020 r2 and rmse values of this simulation at three sampling locations had ranges of 0 79 0 83 and 0 57 0 64 log10 mpn 100ml respectively which show the improvement of the results obtained by considering the foreshore sand as a sink source of e coli in the model the model also does a reasonable job in simulating e coli concentrations in the bed sediment especially at jpw see fig 8b which was an important constraint on the e coli levels in the water column consequently e coli levels in the water column were lower than the results form model 3 especially after doy 243 this resulted in better model performance metrics performance metrics for models 3 and 4 in describing e coli concentrations on the bed sediment are summarized in table 2 detailed comparisons of all model results with observed data from the water column and the sediment for all three sites jp1 jp2 jpw are summarized in figs s10 s15 supplementary material despite showing the highest predictive capacity of the four models considered here model 4 may not capture as much variability as some previously published e coli models for other nearshore areas e g safaie et al 2016 this may be due to the more diffuse and variable nature of non point e coli sources such as birds which are difficult to quantify compared to point sources one possible way to further improve model 4 would be to obtain additional details of bird behavior to refine the modeling including for example the exact positions of birds as a function of time frequency of bird droppings and contributions of birds to the contamination depending on their age juvenile or adult bird and species these results highlight the importance of diffuse and non point sources of e coli contamination in nearshore areas byappanahalli and ishii 2011 particularly those for which point source river inputs only marginally influence contamination in cases where beaches are affected by point source river contamination modeling of those inputs and their effects on water quality can be relatively straightforward nevers et al 2007 for nearshore areas such as the jeorse park beaches without clear point sources of contamination tracking diffuse and variable non point sources may be more difficult due to the inherent variability in the sources and an incomplete understanding of all potential sources in a system the modeling results also underscore the value in modeling multiple contamination sources and their interactions simultaneously beaches and other nearshore areas are dynamic ecosystems with multiple interacting factors operating concurrently and are difficult to characterize with a high degree of precision as more potential sources were added to the models predictive ability increased suggesting that birds sand sediments water and possibly a nearby river all interact to serve as sources of contamination to the beaches at jeorse park 4 conclusions the results from our e coli fate and transport models show that the impact of discharge from the gc river on jeorse park beaches is minimal and that adding avian inputs to the model improves prediction of e coli marginally the number of gulls in water was usually lower than the number of gulls on the beach therefore improvement in model results was observed by considering foreshore sand and sediment as sources of e coli model simulation of e coli at the beach progressively improved with the inclusion of wave current interactions river inputs from the gc river avian inputs bacteria sediment interactions and finally bacteria sediment shoreline sand interactions we therefore conclude that birds contribute e coli to the nearshore region of jeorse park but the e coli settle to the bottom of the lake after attaching to suspended sediment e coli enter the water column again when bottom sediment gets resuspended on days with high wind speeds these results are important for two reasons first they suggest that sediment resuspension in the nearshore region and foreshore beach sand s role as a source sink of contamination are both important for correctly simulating e coli concentrations at the beach secondly they indicate that including bird inputs sand water interactions and sand sediment water interactions in models capture progressively more variability in e coli at non point source dominated beaches like jeorse park maximizing model predictive ability including all of these interactions in models improves predictive ability and helps shoreline managers to decrease contamination

17260,beaches along the great lakes shorelines are important recreational and economic resources however contamination at the beaches can threaten their usage during the swimming season potentially resulting in beach closures and or advisories thus understanding the dynamics that control nearshore water quality is integral to effective beach management there have been significant improvements in this effort including incorporating modeling empirical mechanistic in recent years mechanistic modeling frameworks can contribute to this understanding of dynamics by determining sources and interactions that substantially impact fecal indicator bacteria concentrations an index routinely used in water quality monitoring programs to simulate e coli concentrations at jeorse park beaches in southwest lake michigan a coupled hydrodynamic and wave current interaction model was developed that progressively added contaminant sources from river inputs avian presence bacteria sediment interactions and bacteria sand sediment interactions results indicated that riverine inputs affected e coli concentrations at jeorse park beaches only marginally while avian shoreline sand and sediment sources were much more substantial drivers of e coli contamination at the beach by including avian and riverine inputs as well as bacteria sand sediment interactions at the beach models can reasonably capture the variability in observed e coli concentrations in nearshore water and bed sediments at jeorse park beaches consequently it will be crucial to consider avian contamination sources and water sand sediment interactions in effective management of the beach for public health and as a recreational resource and to extend these findings to similar beaches affected by shoreline embayment graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction great lakes beaches are a substantial source of recreational and economic opportunities for surrounding municipalities throughout the great lakes region see steinman et al 2017 millions of visitors use the beaches annually contributing more than 800 million us dollars in revenue per swimming season shaikh 2012 however recreating at these beaches comes with an inherent risk associated with contamination of the beach and water by pathogenic microorganisms e g pathogenic bacteria viruses that cause waterborne illnesses while often not pathogenic itself escherichia coli e coli is used as an indicator of fecal contamination of recreational water high levels of e coli are frequently accompanied by pathogens of human health concern dufour 1984 further beaches located in highly developed and densely populated areas such as jeorse park along southern lake michigan have long been characterized as some of the most highly contaminated recreational areas in the united states with e coli concentrations exceeding water quality standards during more than 25 of each swimming season between 2008 and 2012 dorfman and haren 2014 the potential presence of pathogens highlights the importance of tracking sources of fecal indicator bacteria like e coli in nearshore environments so that coastal managers can minimize or eliminate sources contributing to high e coli levels in situ tracking of bacterial contamination in recreational water commonly takes the form of analyzing water samples for e coli concentrations via culture methods epa methods 1603 1103 1 which causes significant delays 18 24 hours in obtaining results on ambient water quality and can lead to incorrect or untimely decisions regarding the safety of recreational waters see nevers et al 2014 as a result beach science research has begun to prioritize the use of alternate approaches including culture independent gene based or molecular assays and predictive models for assessment of recreational water quality in real time boehm et al 2009 dorner et al 2006 liu et al 2006 kashefipour et al 2006 nevers et al 2014 liu et al 2015 zhang et al 2018 some of these models are mechanistic using hydrometeorological biological and physical data to predict bacterial concentrations contemporaneously thupaki et al 2013 while others are statistical holcomb et al 2018 nevers and whitman 2005 mechanistic models have been developed and used to characterize recreational water quality and to track sources of microbial contamination for decades and their ability to predict bacterial fate and transport has become more reliable over time liu et al 2006 hipsey et al 2008 debrauwere et al 2011 gao et al 2011 thupaki et al 2013 feng et al 2015 safaie et al 2016 weiskerger and phanikumar 2020 the source loading and decay terms used in these models do not capture all impacts on the fate and transport of e coli therefore accounting for additional sources and processes that impact indicator bacteria concentrations may enhance the predictability of mechanistic fate and transport models bacteria in water are substantially impacted by the effects of sediment resuspension and transport due to their propensity to attach to a variety of environmental substrates including sediment particles and aquatic vegetation schillinger et al 1985 pachepsky et al 2008 fries et al 2006 whitman et al 2003 in low velocity waters indicator bacteria e g e coli enterococci often attach to suspended sediment and settle out creating a bacterial sink for the water column these settled bacteria and sediments can then be resuspended during high current and wave events causing the sediment to switch from being an e coli sink to an e coli source for the water column pandey et al 2012 ishii et al 2007 because of these complexities in sediment transport dynamics numerical models commonly forgo incorporating them into their predictions of e coli fate and transport when models included sediment bacteria dynamics model performance metrics such as r2 were found to improve pandey et al 2012 cho et al 2010 thupaki et al 2016 wave current interactions have considerable effect on bottom shear stress sediment transport and bacterial concentrations in some systems the contribution of waves to the bottom shear stress is so significant lou et al 2000 chao et al 2008 that the contribution of currents can be ignored e g roberts et al 2019 at these beaches high energy wave action can impact e coli concentrations in the water column by depositing sediment and bacteria into the foreshore sand and subsequently resuspending it back into the water column whitman et al 2003 vogel et al 2016 alm et al 2003 ishii et al 2007 yamahara et al 2007 weiskerger et al 2019 hydrodynamic models accounting for the effects of deposition on the beach and foreshore sand as a bacterial source explained 41 44 of variability in empirical e coli data at a chicago beach ge et al 2010 these results suggest that foreshore sand and coastal loading can influence nearshore bacterial concentrations avian usage of recreational beaches can provide a substantial source of fecal bacteria to nearshore waters gould and fletcher 1978 fogarty et al 2003 meerburg et al 2011 converse et al 2012 byappanahalli et al 2015 staley and edge 2016 alm et al 2017 so that gull ring billed larus delawarensis and herring gull larus argentatus removal has been correlated with lower e coli concentrations in the nearshore region nevers et al 2018 despite the well documented impacts of gulls on nearshore water quality it is rare for either statistical or numerical models to account for gull influences on e coli at beaches debrauwere et al 2014 sanders et al 2005 ge et al 2010 russell et al 2013 while existing models without avian impacts have reasonable predictive capacity it is expected that including terms for these impacts will increase the skill of such models the objective of this research was to systematically quantify the relative contributions of birds shoreline sand riverine inputs and sediment resuspension to the observed levels of e coli in water at jeorse park the beach areas at jeorse park have diverse and variable potential sources of contamination including outflow from the nearby grand calumet gc river gull feces and resuspension of microbes entrained in sand and sediments due to wave action these potentially synergistic sources of e coli to the beach byappanahalli et al 2015 nevers et al 2018 2020 demand a more holistic and integrated investigation into their relative influences on beach water quality to our knowledge this work is a first of its kind approach to modeling such potential sources of contamination by systematically developing mechanistic models to evaluate the relative impacts of birds sand water sediment interactions and river inputs as sources of e coli in the nearshore at jeorse park beach 2 materials and methods 2 1

beaches dorfman and haren 2014 potentially contributing to the e coli exceedances are the outflow of the grand calumet river gc river sediment dynamics and gull activities previous studies have identified microbial markers of gulls at jeorse park beaches and have attempted to link the shoreline and gc river using 16s rrna gene sequencing approach byappanahalli et al 2015 nevers et al 2020 nakatsu et al 2018 these findings have identified the presence of indicator bacteria associated with gull populations and also an abundance of microbes bacteria in shoreline sand sediment and water matrices implying that a consortium of bacterial communities rather than one or two traditional water quality indicators is more useful in understanding contaminant sources and potential interactions among these matrices 2 2 observational data 2 2 1 hydrodynamic temperature and sediment model calibration data a bottom mounted upward looking acoustic doppler current profiler adcp was deployed in

routinely sampled and analyzed for e coli concentrations grab samples were taken monday through friday between august 12 and september 7 2016 at 7 00 8 00 am and 12 00 1 00 pm following the standard methods from the world health organization s annapolis protocol who 1999 water samples 250 ml were taken at 45 cm depth and were immediately transferred to coolers and transported to the u s geological survey lake michigan ecological research station in chesterton indiana for analysis in addition to lake michigan samples water from the gc river was sampled roughly three river miles from its outlet to lake michigan samples of sand in the swash zone 0 5 meters onshore from the extent of the contemporaneous wave runup and lakebed sediment at water sampling locations were obtained using sterilized gardening trowels and 1 inch diameter plastic tube cores sand and sediment samples were taken within three 0 25 square meter frames to ensure relative homogeneity of the samples sand samples were obtained by digging surface sterilized hand trowels roughly 5 cm below the surface of the sand in the swash zone likewise submerged lakebed sediment samples were taken by digging sterilized tube cores roughly 5 cm beneath the lakebed surface within three 0 25 square meter frames and carefully removing from the water column to avoid loss each sample was at least 100 grams and

dimensional unstructured grid numerical model fvcom finite volume coastal ocean model chen et al 2003 was used in this study to resolve both large scale that is lake wide and nearshore hydrodynamic features fvcom has been successfully used to describe transport of tracers and indicator bacteria in the great lakes and their tributaries in the past safaie et al 2016 2017 2020 nguyen et al 2014 2017 anderson and phanikumar 2011 we coupled the fvcom hydrodynamic model with fvcom surface wave model fvcom swave to simulate wave current interactions and calibrated the wave model for the jeorse park area fvcom swave uses an unstructured grid finite volume version of swan simulating waves nearshore booij et al 1999 to simulate wave current interactions qi et al 2009 details of these models and the coupling procedure used in fvcom swave are in the supplementary material section s2 after calibration the fvcom swave was coupled with the e coli and sediment transport models to understand the effects of including wave current interactions on water quality simulation results the unstructured grids for jeorse park with 14346 nodes and 26439 elements were created using the surface water modeling system sms www aquaveo com the horizontal resolution of grid cells ranged from 10 m near the shoreline to 1 5 km in the center of the lake the model used a terrain following coordinate system with 30 vertical geometric sigma layers additional details of the hydrodynamic model and sources of meteorological data used in the modeling are in the supplementary material section s2 the model simulations were started on may 2 2016 with a uniform vertical temperature profile determined from observations at two buoys maintained by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s national data buoy center ndbc 45002 45007 2 4 suspended sediment transport model to develop a model for predicting e coli concentrations with sediment and e coli interactions a coupled wave current sediment transport model was used to calculate sediment transport on jeorse park beaches for sediment transport fvcom uses an unstructured grid version of the usgs community sediment transport model originally developed by warner et al 2008 within the framework we modeled two size classes based on sediment distribution data measured by the lisst 100x based on these data the two size classes were a fine sediment class with which e coli are known to interact jeng et al 2005 and a coarse sediment class representing sand size classification of sediment were obtained based on particle size distributions recorded by the lisst 100x sequoia scientific bellevue wa because beach infill to change the shoreline angle was considered as a restoration strategy to mitigate bacterial contamination as communicated by project managers michael spinar indiana department of environmental management personal communication sand dynamics at the beach for current natural conditions without infill was included in our modeling for the relatively short period of simulation reported in the present work summer 2016 changes in beach morphology were negligible but the model considered these effects allowing for a more realistic simulation of changes in bottom shear stress and sediment processes the three dimensional sediment model included suspended sediment and bedload transport the suspended load model used the following advection dispersion equation to simulate suspended sediment concentration of each sediment class in the water column thupaki et al 2013 gao et al 2011 1 s i t u s i x v s i x w w s i s i x x k h s i x y k h s i y z k v s i z where s i and w s i are concentrations of sediment and settling velocity for each sediment class i respectively u v w are velocity components m d in x y and z directions and k h and k v denote the horizontal x y and vertical z mixing coefficients m2 d respectively a no flux boundary condition is specified at the surface warner et al 2008 2 k v s i z 0 z ζ where ζ denotes the water surface elevation deposition f s s and erosion f r s at the bottom boundary were modeled as shown below warner et al 2008 3 k v s i z f r s i f s s i z h the erosion term is given by 4 f r s i δ t q i 1 ϕ f b i τ b τ c e i 1 where q i is the erosive flux and ϕ is the bottom porosity f b i represents the fraction of sediment size class i on the bottom of the lake τ b is the net bottom shear stress which was calculated based on wave current interactions τ c e i is the critical shear stress for erosion of sediment size class i four sediment bed layers 6 25 cm thick each were initialized in the sediment transport model each bed layer had initial bed porosity of 0 45 resistance of the topmost layer to erosion is usually very low therefore its critical shear stress was set to 0 1 n m2 other underlying layers were assumed to have critical shear stresses of 0 15 0 2 and 0 25 n m2 respectively from top to bottom the net bottom shear stress τ b with wave current interactions is given by 5 τ b τ c τ w where τ c denotes the current shear stress τ w is the wave generated bed shear stress which is commonly defined as cho et al 2008 6 τ w 1 2 ρ f w u b o t 2 in which ρ is the water density f w is the wave friction factor and u b o t is the near bottom wave orbital velocity the wave friction factor is approximated based on the ratio of the bottom orbital excursion amplitude to the bottom roughness length a b k b by the following expressions madsen 1994 7 f w 0 3 a b k b 0 2 exp 7 02 a b k b 0 078 8 82 0 2 a b k b 100 exp 5 61 a b k b 0 109 7 30 a b k b 100 the orbital velocity was obtained from swan which was coupled with the hydrodynamic model to test the performance of fvcom swave in predicting wave generated bed shear stress bottom orbital velocity was estimated from near bottom velocity measurements made roughly an inch from the bottom figure s2 in supplementary material and compared with simulation results the bottom orbital velocity was calculated based on near bottom velocity spectra following the method of wiberg and sherwood 2008 the coupled wave current sediment transport model used in this study was equipped with the wave current sediment bbl module that accounts for combined effects of currents and waves warner et al 2008 the treatment of bbl is important for simulation of the lake circulation determination of the sediment transport rate for the bedload as well as sediment resuspension rate bed load transport was calculated following the meyer peter and müller 1948 formula bed dynamics were simulated based on the active layer concept an active layer thickness z a was determined at each time step using harris and wiberg 1997 8 z a max k 1 τ s f τ c e ρ 0 0 k 2 d 50 τ c e is the averaged critical stress of sediment classes for erosion d 50 is the median grain size of surface sediment k 1 and k 2 are empirical constants equal to 0 007 and 6 0 respectively the sediment model was calibrated specifically for the jeorse park beaches configuration with breakwalls on either side of the beach and a peninsula bordering the northwest side of the beach 2 5 bacterial fate and transport models the e coli models were run for four cases progressively incorporating more influences and interactions in the first case the outflow of gc river was considered as the only source of e coli called model 1 here then for the second case in addition to the contributions from the outflow of gc river considered in model 1 avian contributions were included as a nonpoint source but without bacteria sand sediment interactions this model is called model 2 here the third case includes additional suspended sediment and bedload transport processes on top of processes already included in model 2 in this case we used a bacteria fate and transport model with wave current interactions model 3 for the last case the exchange of e coli between surf zone and shoreline sand on the beach were considered using a model model 4 with bacteria sand sediment interactions these details are summarized in table s2 in supplementary material the governing equations for models 1 4 as well as parameter values of the models are also summarized in the supplementary material a group of gulls at jeorse park beach september 16 2016 is shown in fig 2 gull activities and roosting have been reported to be in highest numbers near coastal areas schwemmer garthe 2005 sanders et al 2005 to simulate avian contributions we assumed that gulls were mostly confined to shallow water 0 5 m and adjacent interstitial areas fig 2 a matlab function randi was used to assign gull droppings to random fvcom nodes located in the shallow water of the beach in this process each bird was treated as an individual the focus of this research was on contributions of gulls primarily ring billed gull larus delawarensis hereafter referred to with any other transients collectively as gulls to water quality at the beach during bird counts at the beach from august 10 to september 7 2016 other species of birds were observed such as spotted sandpiper actitis macularius canada goose branta canadensis killdeer charadrius vociferous barn swallow hirundo rustica american crow corvus brachyrhynchos american avocet recurvirostra americana and double crested cormorant phalacrocorax auritus wild goose chase inc 2016 fig s3 presents percentage and number of different species of birds observed at jeorse park beaches during the study this pie chart indicates that ring billed gull canada goose and spotted sandpiper were the most common species visiting the beaches respectively barn swallows and double crested cormorants were just flying overhead and they rarely landed the shoreline was often occupied by primarily ring billed gulls spotted sandpipers were also seen running near the water s edge on the beach since there were limited numbers and they do not primarily occupy the water we did not consider this species in the model moreover trained dogs were used to haze geese and keep them away from the water at the study area wild goose chase inc 2016 therefore gulls were the only bird group considered in simulating the direct effect of birds on beach water quality observational data for the number of the gulls seen in the water were used to simulate the direct effect of gulls on water quality at the beach the number of e coli in gull feces was reported in the range of 105 to 109 cfu g 1 in the great lakes area fogarty et al 2003 fecal coliforms in gull feces consist of 95 99 e coli lévesque 2000 therefore e coli concentrations per gram of gull feces could be approximately similar to fecal coliform concentrations large quantities of fecal coliforms were reported in gull droppings with a geometric mean of 2 1 108 cfu g 1 lévesque 2000 gould and fletcher 1978 reported that the number of droppings of four species of gull in 24 h varied between 39 to 62 and daily average wet weight of feces ranged from 11 2 to 24 9 g day 1 based on this information it was assumed that each gull seen in the water contributed e coli at 2 108 most probably number mpn h 1 g 1 of feces gould and fletcher 1978 whitman and nevers 2003 edge and hill 2007 meerburg et al 2011 3 results and discussion in what follows we first present comparisons between observed data and model results for temperature important for representing e coli loss as well as for stratification and mixing wave characteristics and near bottom orbital velocities important for sediment transport and available suspended sediment data before presenting results from the e coli fate and transport models a comparison between simulated and observed temperatures at the ndbc buoy 45007 in southern lake michigan near milwaukee wisconsin as a function of time day of year doy shows that the model reproduced observed temperatures well for a comparison of temperatures in the nearshore region contour plots of observed and simulated water temperatures c at the thermistor chain location are shown in fig 3 panels b and c for the summer of 2016 the model could not predict very low temperatures e g doys 240 and 251 likely caused by upwelling cold water it was noted that the thermistor chain mooring swayed considerably during the deployment period introducing significant positional uncertainty in addition to measurement uncertainty into the temperature measurements especially in the top layers given the complexity of the nearshore processes and the uncertainties the comparisons with temperature data are considered reasonable comparisons between vertically integrated currents from adcp observations at the location adcp m table s1 supplemental material and simulations based on the fvcom swave model that is with wave current interactions are shown in fig s4 in the supplementary material the root mean squared error rmse values in eastward and northward directions were 0 0201 and 0 0224 m s respectively contour plots of observed and simulated velocities in the nearshore region near jeorse park for summer 2016 are also shown in fig s5 supplementary material in fig 4 the significant wave height swh which represents the mean wave height of the highest third of the waves the dominant wave period dwp the wave period associated with the highest energetic waves and the mean wave direction mwd of the waves were compared with observed data collected at the adcp m location the time series of swh at this location was well captured by the coupled wave current fvcom swave model rmse 0 1 m r2 0 93 rmse and r2 values for dwp were 2 24 s and 0 60 respectively observed swh and dwp had more variation with time than exhibited by the model and this observation was also made by previous researchers who reported similar comparisons qi et al 2009 additional comparisons for the wave model shown in figs s6 and s7 in the supplementary material indicate that the wave model captured the observed wave characteristics well spatial maps of significant wave height in the jeorse park area are shown in fig s8 and a comparison of the relative contributions of waves and currents to the total shear stress is shown in fig s9 because wave generated bed shear stress was the dominant component of the total shear stress due to the combined action of currents and waves roberts et al 2019 the measured and simulated bottom orbital velocities were compared eq 6 to ensure that bottom shear stress values are correctly computed by the model fig 5 shows comparisons between orbital velocities estimated from the down looking adcp and the up looking hr profiler measurements based on data from a 24 hour deployment and simulated results from fvcom swave for the same period the simulated and observed results are in good agreement and as expected the results show a correlation between the orbital velocity and significant wave height to ensure that the model was able to capture the dynamics of turbidity ssc at the beach sites a comparison of normalized turbidity from the obs3a sensor and normalized ssc simulated is shown in fig 6a this comparison indicates that the sediment model captured the observed dynamics especially when the turbidity values became high which often coincide with higher e coli concentrations in water nevers and whitman 2005 limited observed data are available for ssc and comparisons of observed and simulated ssc are shown in fig 6 b c in this simulation sediment particle size classifications based on lisst 100x were a fine sediment class with median sediment grain diameter of 26 μ m with which e coli are associated and a coarse sediment class with median sediment grain diameter of 330 μ m the simulated values of ssc are within the range of measured data at the jpw and jp1 locations fig 6 3 1 model 1 river source first the outflow of gc river was considered as the only source of e coli model 1 simulated results show that the effect of the gc river on jeorse park beaches is almost negligible fig 7 a the solid line in fig 7a represents simulated concentrations in all vertical layers which shows that the variability in the vertical direction is negligible for this simulation which ignores bird and bottom sediment contributions a similar model was used by safaie et al 2016 at beaches impacted by a nearby river in southern lake michigan and the model was able to predict e coli concentrations at the beaches with r2 values in the range of 0 42 0 82 and rmse values of 0 459 0 592 log10 cfu 100ml in this study however model 1 did not capture most of the observed data especially when the gc river experienced backflows from the lake fig s1 skill statistics related to this and other models were computed using different metrics e g fry et al 2013 and two metrics are summarized in table 1 r2 values are negative and rmse values are at or above 1 63 log10 mpn 100ml meaning that the model failed to predict contamination at the beaches using the gc river as the only source which is consistent with previous studies that show that a combination of external gc river and internal or intrinsic bacteria laden algae and sand defecations from shoreline birds and limited water circulation factors are responsible for degraded water quality at jeorse park and nearby beaches byappanahalli et al 2015 nevers et al 2018 the lack of predictability indicates that jeorse park beaches are likely not appreciably impacted by riverine contaminants from the gc river a result also supported by the microbial source tracking mst and the 16s rrna gene sequencing results from previous studies nakatsu et al 2019 nevers et al 2020 3 2 model 2 avian source avian contributions were considered as non point sources in addition to any point source impacts from the gc river which drains into lake michigan via the indiana harbor and ship canal byappanahalli et al 2015 nevers et al 2018 model 1 this model model 2 which focused on avian impacts in the water column in addition to the riverine source already considered in model 1 was able to capture some of the observed variability in e coli data but not all of it fig 7b although the number of birds at the beaches were counted at the time of sampling their exact positions are not known and this introduces some uncertainty into the modeling monte carlo simulations for 20 different random bird positions along the edge of the beach where birds were seen during sampling were used to assess whether the uncertainty in bird positions may have contributed to the less than ideal e coli predictions within the simulation shown in fig 7b model performance statistics based on these simulations show improvement compared with the performance of model 1 table 1 but the model 2 results are still not as good as the results of previous studies e g thupaki et al 2013 safaie et al 2016 and 2020 which was an indication that there was room for improvement by including additional processes such as sediment resuspension for example r2 values ranged from 0 03 to 0 27 and rmse ranged from 1 47 to 1 57 log10 mpn 100ml results show that uncertainty in bird position was not a substantial factor in explaining the observed variability fig 7b avian inputs do seem to influence e coli concentrations at the beaches to a degree however a large proportion of the variability in the data was not captured in model 2 and was either associated with sediment bacteria interactions or other factors that were not considered 3 3 model 3 sediment bacteria and wave current interactions in the next step the model with suspended and bed sediment and bacteria and wave current interactions was used while also retaining all inputs and processes considered in models 1 and 2 interactions with shoreline sand were not included in this model simulated results at jpw for 20 monte carlo simulations of bird positions with the same number of birds as well as the model 3 inputs for sediment bacteria and wave current interactions missing from model 2 are presented in fig 7c when model 3 was compared to the observed data at jeorse park beaches results show that model 3 was able to describe many of the observed peaks in e coli concentration this time the model r2 increased from 0 11 to 0 81 at jp1 from 0 03 to 0 75 at jp2 and from 0 27 to 0 4 at jpw the rmse value at jp1 decreased to 0 80 log10 mpn 100ml but at jp2 and jpw it still did not fall below 1 log10 mpn 100ml it should be noted that jp2 and jpw are nearer the retaining wall which could influence the sediment resuspension component due to circulation patterns see figure 1 these results indicate that sediment resuspension of bacteria to the water column in nearshore areas where much of the recreation is concentrated has an important influence on e coli concentrations after including the effects of sediment bacteria interactions on e coli concentrations at the beaches the uncertainty in the results due to different bird positions is greater than the uncertainty seen in models 1 and 2 moreover model 3 predicted increasing concentrations after doy 245 and the e coli concentration reached more than 3 5 104 mpn 100ml around doy 250 which was contrary to observations at the beaches if these predicted levels were reached the beach would be unsafe for any recreational activities and could expose people to potential pathogens introduced via point and or nonpoint sources comparison of observed and simulated e coli concentrations in the bed sediment for one realization of bird positions indicated that model 3 overestimated the bacteria levels in the bed sediment especially at the jpw location near the breakwater where most birds were present fig 8 a in addition resuspension of all e coli content from sediment bed to the water column caused the e coli concentration in the sediment to drop to zero on doy 243 which was followed by increasing the concentration in the water column 3 4 model 4 all interactions finally the results of the full e coli model with all interactions considered that is shoreline sand water bottom sediment water and wave current interactions model 4 at jpw are presented in fig 7d to reduce the computational cost this simulation was conducted using one set of bird positions only since the uncertainty associated with bird positions was already presented earlier although for a different model model 3 skill statistics of this simulation provided in table 1 indicate that the model performance metrics are comparable with those previous studies that simulated contamination at beaches impacted by nearby rivers e g thupaki et al 2013 safaie et al 2016 and 2020 r2 and rmse values of this simulation at three sampling locations had ranges of 0 79 0 83 and 0 57 0 64 log10 mpn 100ml respectively which show the improvement of the results obtained by considering the foreshore sand as a sink source of e coli in the model the model also does a reasonable job in simulating e coli concentrations in the bed sediment especially at jpw see fig 8b which was an important constraint on the e coli levels in the water column consequently e coli levels in the water column were lower than the results form model 3 especially after doy 243 this resulted in better model performance metrics performance metrics for models 3 and 4 in describing e coli concentrations on the bed sediment are summarized in table 2 detailed comparisons of all model results with observed data from the water column and the sediment for all three sites jp1 jp2 jpw are summarized in figs s10 s15 supplementary material despite showing the highest predictive capacity of the four models considered here model 4 may not capture as much variability as some previously published e coli models for other nearshore areas e g safaie et al 2016 this may be due to the more diffuse and variable nature of non point e coli sources such as birds which are difficult to quantify compared to point sources one possible way to further improve model 4 would be to obtain additional details of bird behavior to refine the modeling including for example the exact positions of birds as a function of time frequency of bird droppings and contributions of birds to the contamination depending on their age juvenile or adult bird and species these results highlight the importance of diffuse and non point sources of e coli contamination in nearshore areas byappanahalli and ishii 2011 particularly those for which point source river inputs only marginally influence contamination in cases where beaches are affected by point source river contamination modeling of those inputs and their effects on water quality can be relatively straightforward nevers et al 2007 for nearshore areas such as the jeorse park beaches without clear point sources of contamination tracking diffuse and variable non point sources may be more difficult due to the inherent variability in the sources and an incomplete understanding of all potential sources in a system the modeling results also underscore the value in modeling multiple contamination sources and their interactions simultaneously beaches and other nearshore areas are dynamic ecosystems with multiple interacting factors operating concurrently and are difficult to characterize with a high degree of precision as more potential sources were added to the models predictive ability increased suggesting that birds sand sediments water and possibly a nearby river all interact to serve as sources of contamination to the beaches at jeorse park 4 conclusions the results from our e coli fate and transport models show that the impact of discharge from the gc river on jeorse park beaches is minimal and that adding avian inputs to the model improves prediction of e coli marginally the number of gulls in water was usually lower than the number of gulls on the beach therefore improvement in model results was observed by considering foreshore sand and sediment as sources of e coli model simulation of e coli at the beach progressively improved with the inclusion of wave current interactions river inputs from the gc river avian inputs bacteria sediment interactions and finally bacteria sediment shoreline sand interactions we therefore conclude that birds contribute e coli to the nearshore region of jeorse park but the e coli settle to the bottom of the lake after attaching to suspended sediment e coli enter the water column again when bottom sediment gets resuspended on days with high wind speeds these results are important for two reasons first they suggest that sediment resuspension in the nearshore region and foreshore beach sand s role as a source sink of contamination are both important for correctly simulating e coli concentrations at the beach secondly they indicate that including bird inputs sand water interactions and sand sediment water interactions in models capture progressively more variability in e coli at non point source dominated beaches like jeorse park maximizing model predictive ability including all of these interactions in models improves predictive ability and helps shoreline managers to decrease contamination

17261,chlorination can lead to the formation of hazardous chlorinated disinfection byproducts cl dbps we identified tyrosine tyr and tryptophan trp as precursors of toxic cl dbps and developed a halogen extraction code to complement ultra performance liquid chromatography in tandem with high resolution mass spectrometry uplc hrms in detecting and identifying cl dbps we detected 20 and 11 cl dbps formed from chlorination of tyr and trp respectively and identified the structures of 15 cl dbps fourteen structures were previously unreported we also proposed the tentative formation pathways of these newly identified cl dbps their incidence in real water sources demonstrated that these cl dbps are likely to form during chlorination of reclaimed water we computationally predicted the toxicity of these cl dbps which was relatively high indicating that these cl dbps could be hazardous and were of valid concern combining analytical data with the halogen extraction code can identify cl dbps accurately from complex compounds this analytical method can be used to identify cl dbps of water treatment procedures in further studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

and von gunten 2011 takeuchi and tanaka 2020 yang et al 2014 yang et al 2019b chlorination is widely used to kill waterborne pathogens and prevent disease but may result in the formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts dbps du et al 2017 huang et al 2018 krasner et al 2009 yang et al 2019a to date over 700 dbps have been identified but only a small fraction such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids chlorite and bromate are regulated huang et al 2019b richardson et al 2007 toxicological studies have shown that the majority of dbps are cytotoxic genotoxic and mutagenic li and mitch 2018 richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 epidemiological studies have reported that exposure to dbps can exert adverse health effects such as bladder cancer costet et al 2011 rahman et al 2010 villanueva et al 2004 since regulated dbps cannot account for the increased health risks observed by epidemiological studies current efforts have focused on identifying and characterizing unregulated dbps of toxicological relevance richardson et al 2007 jiang et al 2017 dissolved organic nitrogen don a surrogate of organic nitrogen containing compounds in dissolved organic matter has gained much attention in recent years because of its potential to form hazardous dbps lee et al 2007 mitch and sedlak 2004 reckhow 2003 wang and hu 2018 wu et al 2020c levels of don in reclaimed water sources are typically higher than in drinking water sources and range from 0 29 to 4 30 mg n l bull 2001 hu et al 2016 westerhoff and mash 2002 total amino acids including proteins peptides and free amino acids are ubiquitous constituents of aquatic environments accounting for approximately 30 of don in reclaimed water hu et al 2016 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 the majority of amino acids in reclaimed water are thought to be free amino acids prior to disinfection so it is important to understand the characteristics of free amino acids as dbps precursors huang et al 2018 hu et al 2016 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 pérez and susa 2017 studies have shown that chlorination of free amino acids can form a wide range of dbps including trihalomethanes haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides chu et al 2012 trehy et al 1986 reckhow 2003 owing to the large number of dbps and the limitations of existing analytical methods the majority of dbps formed by chlorination of free amino acids have not been identified huang et al 2019a aromatic dbps especially halogenated aromatic dbps have been reported to induce higher toxicity than regulated dbps and commonly known aliphatic dbps liu et al 2020 for example 3 4 dichlorophenylacetonitrile was found to be 100 times more cytotoxic than trichloromethane and the developmental toxicity of tetrabromopyrrole was shown to be over 8 000 higher than that of bromoacetic acid drawing attention to halogenated aromatic dbps formed by chlorination of free amino acids yang and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the three aromatic free amino acids are tyrosine tyr tryptophan trp and phenylalanine phe and all have the potential to form aromatic dbps during chlorination pérez and susa 2017 however previous studies mainly focused on regular dbps and commonly known aliphatic dbps neglecting aromatic dbps for example a previous study has shown that trihalomethanes are more likely to be formed during chlorination of aromatic amino acids than during chlorination of non aromatic amino acids hong et al 2009 and chlorination of tyr can produce dichloroacetonitrile and trichloroacetamide chu et al 2012 wu et al 2020a aromatic amino acid contains two reactive sites the aromatic ring and the amino group huang et al 2018 the amino group with which electrophiles have an affinity can react with hypochlorous acid hocl through electrophilic substitution trehy et al 1986 how et al 2017 the aromatic ring which can be attacked by electrophiles can also react with hocl to form chlorinated dbps cl dbps jiang et al 2017 although few studies have assessed the role of aromatic amino acids in the formation of aromatic cl dbps the reaction characteristics indicate that aromatic cl dbps are very likely to form during chlorination the objective of this study was to identify cl dbps generated from the chlorination of aromatic amino acids first we developed a halogen extraction code to complement data from ultra performance liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry uplc hrms we measured cl dbps in chlorinated aromatic amino acids and identified previously unreported cl dbps we then tentatively proposed the formation pathways of these cl dbps and assessed their incidence in real water samples finally we estimated and compared the toxicity of these cl dbps 2 materials and methods

0 45 µm microfilters and stored at 4 c before use table s1 lists the quality parameters of the reclaimed water a blank sample consisting of ultrapure water was also prepared and pretreated for background subtraction 2 3 chlorination chlorination experiment was conducted in an amber glass sealed bottle containing 1000 ml of the sample each sample was first adjusted to ph 7 00 0 05 by h2so4 2

dbps was estimated comparatively using a prediction model cytotoxicity was evaluated using chinese hamster ovary cho cells detailed information on cell culturing and the cytotoxicity assay was reported previously du et al 2017 2018 wu et al 2019 2020b we used quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models to predict toxicity the prediction model acute toxicity 96 h half maximal lethal concentration lc50 to the fathead minnow was used to assess the comparative toxicity of cl dbps detailed information regarding toxicity predictions has also been reported previously eldred et al 1999 kaiser and niculescu 1999 karabunarliev et al 1996 konemann 1981 martin and young 2001 nendza and russom 1991 newsome et al 1991 russom et al 1997 zhu et al 2009 2 6 uplc hrms method the dried

orbitrap mass spectrometer q exactive thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa equipped with a uplc system ultimate 3000 thermo fisher scientific the mass spectrum of each sample was acquired using a heated electrospray ionization hesi source under negative ion mode with a mass to charge ratio m z scanning range of 50 500 the uplc conditions and mass spectrometric ms parameters were referred to previous studies li et al 2019 lu et al 2021 with more specific information provided in text s2 2 7 uplc hrms data analysis raw mass spectra of the samples were first analyzed using compound discoverer 3 1 software thermo fisher scientific usa detailed information on background subtraction elemental composition analysis and component extraction was referred to previous studies lu et al 2021 ng et al 2020 and is provided in text s3 cl dbps were detected from their mass spectrometry peaks and their molecular formulas and retention times were recorded raw mass spectra of the samples were also analyzed using a halogen extraction code combined with the r package mfassignr first mass spectrometry data of each spectrum were exported to excel microsoft redmond wa usa and processed with the r package mfassignr schum et al 2019 2020 in r v 4 0 2 using the rstudio environment v 1 3 959 r tools technology inc richmond hill on canada data matrices consisting of the m z values molecular formulas and peak intensities were obtained using this package next the isotopic patterns of cl dbps calculated by mfassignr were checked using our analytical code halogen extraction code written in matlab r2019b v 9 7 0 mathworks natick ma usa this code was written from the 35cl 37cl mass defect and halogen isotopic ratio detailed information on the code and the elemental composition analysis by mfassignr is given in text s4 we also interpreted the tandem mass spectrometry ms ms spectra of the cl dbps manually and proposed compound identities fig 1 presents the overall workflow to identify cl dbps 3 results and discussion 3 1 cytotoxicity of chlorinated aromatic amino acids we assessed the cytotoxicity of organic extracts in chlorinated tyr trp and phe using cho cells fig 2 prior to chlorination even 400 concentrations of these aromatic amino acids did not affect cell viability after chlorination a 27 concentration of tyr and 23 concentration of trp decreased cell viability to 50 however chlorination of phe did not result in cytotoxicity even at a 400 concentration fig 2d shows the cytotoxicity equivalents of these aromatic amino acids chlorination increased the cytotoxicity to 19 8 mg phenol l for tyr and to 24 0 mg phenol l for trp perhaps because the reactivity and substitution effects formed more toxic products liu et al 2014 as chlorination did not render phe cytotoxic we surmise that the transformation rates of the precursor were low or that only non toxic products were formed the findings of the toxicity assay suggest that tyr and trp are important precursors of toxic cl dbps and should be studied in depth 3 2 identification of cl dbps formed by chlorination of tyr and trp nontargeted screening by uplc hrms was used to detect dbps in chlorinated tyr and trp fig s1 shows the mass spectra obtained each spectrum contained thousands of peaks implying the presence of thousands of products and requiring a highly sensitive and effective method for identification fig 1 shows the workflow for analyzing uplc hrms data using compound discoverer 54 and 41 molecular formulas of cl dbps were detected in samples of chlorinated tyr and trp respectively tables s2 and s3 provide detailed information on the specific molecular formulas and retention times obtained by compound discoverer previous studies have noted that the accuracy of compound discoverer data should be further verified using other means lu et al 2021 ng et al 2020 as chlorine has two natural isotopes 35cl and 37cl with a mass defect of 1 9970 da and occurrence probabilities of 75 8 and 24 2 respectively these distinct isotope patterns are helpful in checking the accuracy of the analysis yang et al 2019b however because of the complexity of the spectra and large number of cl dbps it is almost impossible to check all the isotope patterns manually thus isotope patterns of cl dbps must be validated automatically we developed an analytical code from halogen isotope patterns to check the accuracy of the compound discoverer analysis we also used the r package mfassignr to determine the elemental compositions of the mass spectrometry peaks schum et al 2019 2020 using this code we detected 20 and 11 cl dbps formed by chlorination of tyr and trp respectively table 1 with compound a 1 as an example the peak of m z 194 9177 corresponds to the deprotonated molecular ion m h of c6h3ocl3 with a mass accuracy of 0 3 ppm in general routine mass measurement error for the orbitrap mass is 10 ppm and a mass accuracy 5 ppm will confirm the identification callahan et al 2011 peterson et al 2012 moreover the pair of peaks at m z 194 9177 and 196 9138 shows the 100 94 ratio of peak intensity which corroborates with the isotopic patterns of 35cl 37cl containing three chlorine atoms the halogen extraction code is therefore effective in checking 35cl 37cl mass defects and isotopic ratios guaranteeing the unambiguous identification of cl dbps notably the cl dbps detected using the code were all included in the cl dbps obtained using compound discoverer showing that this code can effectively exclude the false positives returned by compound discoverer however the code cannot calculate the retention times thus an effective method to identify cl dbps and acquire necessary information accurately and conveniently is to combine the use of the halogen extraction code to obtain the accurate m z and formulas and compound discoverer to obtain the retention times to identify the structures of the cl dbps we obtained the ms ms spectra of cl dbp fragment ions fig 3 taking compound a 3 c8h7nocl2 as an example the parent ion of m z 201 9831 produces characteristic fragment ions of m z 168 0222 m z 134 0611 and m z 77 097 which were identified as c8h7nocl c8h7no and c6h5 respectively chlorination principles would suggest that c8h7nocl2 is 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenylethylimine a 3a and the ms ms fragment ions confirmed the proposed structure fig 3a notably the measured m z 201 9831 of a 3 corresponds to two separate retention times tables s2 indicating that this compound contains two isomers lu et al 2021 studies have shown that chlorine substitution of amino acids may occur at the amino group or the aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution during chlorination huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 in light of this c8h7nocl2 was also proposed to be n cl 3 chloro 4 hydroxyphenylethylimine a 3b taking a 7 c8h7no2cl2 as another example the ms ms spectrum of m z 217 9782 contains m z 184 0170 m z 126 9956 and m z 59 0317 and the characteristic fragment ions were identified as c8h7nocl c8h7no and c6h5 respectively through formation pathway proposal and structure identification a 7 was proposed to be 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenylacetamide fig 3b similarly fig 3c and fig 3d show the fragment ions of b 2 with m z 240 9942 and b 11 with m z 240 9942 in the chlorinated trp sample respectively along with their proposed structures in total 15 structures of detected cl dbps were identified table 2 and their ms ms spectra are presented in figs s2a s15a most do not have commercially available reference standards or cannot be easily synthesized in the laboratory eleven of the 15 cl dbps a 1 a 3a a 3b a 7 a 14 a 20 b 2 b 3 b 5 b 8 and b 11 are aromatic cl dbps with the exception of a 1 all these cl dbps are reported here for the first time the listed structures were proposed from possible formation pathways discussed in the next section and confirmed by the ms ms fragment ions 3 3 formation pathways during chlorination of tyr and trp fig s16 shows generalized and simplified transformation pathways during chlorination of amino acids chu et al 2012 conyers and scully 1993 how et al 2017 kimura et al 2015 trehy et al 1986 yu and reckhow 2015 zhao et al 2012 studies have shown that three reactions of hocl with organic compounds are possible oxidation addition of hocl to unsaturated bonds and electrophilic substitution criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 johnson and jensen 1986 phungsai et al 2016 rozhko et al 2013 sawaki 1983 sorba et al 1982 figs 4 and 5 illustrate tentative formation pathways of cl dbps formed during chlorination of tyr and trp respectively figs s2b s15b outline the reaction steps to form each cl dbp fig 4 shows the transformation products of chlorinated tyr whose identities were proposed by the generalized pathways fig s16 and possible reactions of hocl with organic compounds the potential formation pathways of a 1 have been reported previously fig s2b chu et al 2012 the 3 and 5 positions in the aromatic ring of transformation products a ⅱ and a ⅹ were activated by hydroxyl groups thus certain hydrogen atoms were displaced by chlorine atoms forming a 3a a 3b and a 7 figs s3b and s5b oxidation and electrophilic substitution induced modification of transformation products a ⅲ a ⅶ a ⅵ and a ⅰ to form a 6 a 13 a 14 and a 20 respectively figs s4b s6b s7b and s10b a 16 and a 17 are the further oxidation products of a 13 and a 14 respectively figs s8b and s9b fig 5 shows the transformation products of chlorinated trp proposed using the generalized pathways in fig s16 transformation product b ⅵ was proposed as an oxidation product of transformation product b ⅴ from the literature salminen and heinonen 2008 simat and steinhart 1998 through electrophilic substitution of hocl to the aromatic ring transformation product b ⅳ was converted into b 2 figs s11b while transformation product b ⅵ was converted into b 3 and b 11 figs s12b and s15b it should be noted that chlorine substitution of the indole ring will first occur on the pyrrole ring and then on the benzene ring thus the specific positions of substituted chlorine were determined james and snyder 2003 cleavage of the pyrrole ring in trp may also occur salminen and heinonen 2008 leading to the formation of transformation products b ⅶ and b ⅷ the latter may undergo subsequent reactions such as decarboxylation and electrophilic substitution to produce b 5 and b 8 figs s13b and s14b to validate the proposed formation pathways we searched for the 18 transformation products a ⅰ to a ⅹ and b ⅰ to b ⅷ using uplc hrms nine transformation products were detected a ⅲ a ⅸ a ⅹ and b ⅲ to b ⅷ table s4 not all transformation products can be detected as the unstable compounds may have been transformed to other products rapidly or were not detectable by the method zhai and zhang 2011 yang et al 2019a 3 4 incidence of the newly identified cl dbps in reclaimed water we analyzed samples of reclaimed water by uplc hrms to assess the incidence of cl dbps formed by chlorination of tyr and trp because standard compounds are not commercially available and cannot be easily synthesized data on the incidence of aromatic cl dbps are not comprehensive and many aromatic cl dbps reported in the literature such as halotyrosylalanines halophenylalanylglycines and halopeptides cannot be analyzed quantitatively huang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 thus we evaluated the incidence of cl dbps formed by the chlorination of tyr and trp by comparing the characteristic ions and retention times table 3 shows that seven of the cl dbps a 1 a 3a a 3b a 7 a 16 a 17 and a 20 were detected in the chlorinated reclaimed water from the rw a sample and nine cl dbps a 3a a 3b a 13 a 16 a 17 a 20 b 2 b 5 and b 11 were detected in the chlorinated reclaimed water from the rw b sample five of the cl dbps a 3a a 3b a 16 a 17 and a 20 were detected in samples from both sources none of these cl dbps were detected in unchlorinated reclaimed water samples from these sources most of the cl dbps we identified were detected in the samples showing that they are likely to be formed during chlorination of reclaimed water 3 5 comparative toxicity of cl dbps formed by chlorination of tyr and trp without reference standard for these compounds we assessed their comparative toxicity using prediction models multiple qsar models have been developed to predict toxicity endpoints klopman et al 2004 richard and benigni 2002 yang et al 2006 in general qsar models are more applicable to comparing chemical structures with existing experimental data martin and young 2001 zhu et al 2009 selecting a suitable qsar model involves considerations of practical constraints and prediction accuracy after evaluating several qsar models we selected the acute toxicity 96 h lc50 to the fathead minnow to predict the comparative toxicity of cl dbps table s5 and table 2 list the calculations and predicted lc50 values all the aromatic cl dbps detected in this study were predicted to exert higher lethality than trichloromethane

17261,chlorination can lead to the formation of hazardous chlorinated disinfection byproducts cl dbps we identified tyrosine tyr and tryptophan trp as precursors of toxic cl dbps and developed a halogen extraction code to complement ultra performance liquid chromatography in tandem with high resolution mass spectrometry uplc hrms in detecting and identifying cl dbps we detected 20 and 11 cl dbps formed from chlorination of tyr and trp respectively and identified the structures of 15 cl dbps fourteen structures were previously unreported we also proposed the tentative formation pathways of these newly identified cl dbps their incidence in real water sources demonstrated that these cl dbps are likely to form during chlorination of reclaimed water we computationally predicted the toxicity of these cl dbps which was relatively high indicating that these cl dbps could be hazardous and were of valid concern combining analytical data with the halogen extraction code can identify cl dbps accurately from complex compounds this analytical method can be used to identify cl dbps of water treatment procedures in further studies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

and von gunten 2011 takeuchi and tanaka 2020 yang et al 2014 yang et al 2019b chlorination is widely used to kill waterborne pathogens and prevent disease but may result in the formation of hazardous disinfection byproducts dbps du et al 2017 huang et al 2018 krasner et al 2009 yang et al 2019a to date over 700 dbps have been identified but only a small fraction such as trihalomethanes haloacetic acids chlorite and bromate are regulated huang et al 2019b richardson et al 2007 toxicological studies have shown that the majority of dbps are cytotoxic genotoxic and mutagenic li and mitch 2018 richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 epidemiological studies have reported that exposure to dbps can exert adverse health effects such as bladder cancer costet et al 2011 rahman et al 2010 villanueva et al 2004 since regulated dbps cannot account for the increased health risks observed by epidemiological studies current efforts have focused on identifying and characterizing unregulated dbps of toxicological relevance richardson et al 2007 jiang et al 2017 dissolved organic nitrogen don a surrogate of organic nitrogen containing compounds in dissolved organic matter has gained much attention in recent years because of its potential to form hazardous dbps lee et al 2007 mitch and sedlak 2004 reckhow 2003 wang and hu 2018 wu et al 2020c levels of don in reclaimed water sources are typically higher than in drinking water sources and range from 0 29 to 4 30 mg n l bull 2001 hu et al 2016 westerhoff and mash 2002 total amino acids including proteins peptides and free amino acids are ubiquitous constituents of aquatic environments accounting for approximately 30 of don in reclaimed water hu et al 2016 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 the majority of amino acids in reclaimed water are thought to be free amino acids prior to disinfection so it is important to understand the characteristics of free amino acids as dbps precursors huang et al 2018 hu et al 2016 pehlivanoglu mantas and sedlak 2008 pérez and susa 2017 studies have shown that chlorination of free amino acids can form a wide range of dbps including trihalomethanes haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides chu et al 2012 trehy et al 1986 reckhow 2003 owing to the large number of dbps and the limitations of existing analytical methods the majority of dbps formed by chlorination of free amino acids have not been identified huang et al 2019a aromatic dbps especially halogenated aromatic dbps have been reported to induce higher toxicity than regulated dbps and commonly known aliphatic dbps liu et al 2020 for example 3 4 dichlorophenylacetonitrile was found to be 100 times more cytotoxic than trichloromethane and the developmental toxicity of tetrabromopyrrole was shown to be over 8 000 higher than that of bromoacetic acid drawing attention to halogenated aromatic dbps formed by chlorination of free amino acids yang and zhang 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the three aromatic free amino acids are tyrosine tyr tryptophan trp and phenylalanine phe and all have the potential to form aromatic dbps during chlorination pérez and susa 2017 however previous studies mainly focused on regular dbps and commonly known aliphatic dbps neglecting aromatic dbps for example a previous study has shown that trihalomethanes are more likely to be formed during chlorination of aromatic amino acids than during chlorination of non aromatic amino acids hong et al 2009 and chlorination of tyr can produce dichloroacetonitrile and trichloroacetamide chu et al 2012 wu et al 2020a aromatic amino acid contains two reactive sites the aromatic ring and the amino group huang et al 2018 the amino group with which electrophiles have an affinity can react with hypochlorous acid hocl through electrophilic substitution trehy et al 1986 how et al 2017 the aromatic ring which can be attacked by electrophiles can also react with hocl to form chlorinated dbps cl dbps jiang et al 2017 although few studies have assessed the role of aromatic amino acids in the formation of aromatic cl dbps the reaction characteristics indicate that aromatic cl dbps are very likely to form during chlorination the objective of this study was to identify cl dbps generated from the chlorination of aromatic amino acids first we developed a halogen extraction code to complement data from ultra performance liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry uplc hrms we measured cl dbps in chlorinated aromatic amino acids and identified previously unreported cl dbps we then tentatively proposed the formation pathways of these cl dbps and assessed their incidence in real water samples finally we estimated and compared the toxicity of these cl dbps 2 materials and methods

0 45 µm microfilters and stored at 4 c before use table s1 lists the quality parameters of the reclaimed water a blank sample consisting of ultrapure water was also prepared and pretreated for background subtraction 2 3 chlorination chlorination experiment was conducted in an amber glass sealed bottle containing 1000 ml of the sample each sample was first adjusted to ph 7 00 0 05 by h2so4 2

dbps was estimated comparatively using a prediction model cytotoxicity was evaluated using chinese hamster ovary cho cells detailed information on cell culturing and the cytotoxicity assay was reported previously du et al 2017 2018 wu et al 2019 2020b we used quantitative structure activity relationship qsar models to predict toxicity the prediction model acute toxicity 96 h half maximal lethal concentration lc50 to the fathead minnow was used to assess the comparative toxicity of cl dbps detailed information regarding toxicity predictions has also been reported previously eldred et al 1999 kaiser and niculescu 1999 karabunarliev et al 1996 konemann 1981 martin and young 2001 nendza and russom 1991 newsome et al 1991 russom et al 1997 zhu et al 2009 2 6 uplc hrms method the dried

discoverer 3 1 software thermo fisher scientific usa detailed information on background subtraction elemental composition analysis and component extraction was referred to previous studies lu et al 2021 ng et al 2020 and is provided in text s3 cl dbps were detected from their mass spectrometry peaks and their molecular formulas and retention times were recorded raw mass spectra of the samples were also analyzed using a halogen extraction code combined with the r package mfassignr first mass spectrometry data of each spectrum were exported to excel microsoft redmond wa usa and processed with the r package mfassignr schum et al 2019 2020 in r v 4 0 2 using the rstudio environment v 1 3 959 r tools technology inc richmond hill on canada data matrices consisting of the m z values molecular formulas and peak intensities were obtained using this package next the isotopic patterns of cl dbps calculated by mfassignr were checked using our analytical code halogen extraction code written in matlab r2019b v 9 7 0 mathworks natick ma usa this code was written from the 35cl 37cl mass defect and halogen isotopic ratio detailed information on the code and the elemental composition analysis by mfassignr is given in text s4 we also interpreted the tandem mass spectrometry ms ms spectra of the cl dbps manually and proposed compound identities fig 1 presents the overall workflow to identify cl dbps 3 results and discussion 3 1 cytotoxicity of chlorinated aromatic amino acids we assessed the cytotoxicity of organic extracts in chlorinated tyr trp and phe using cho cells fig 2 prior to chlorination even 400 concentrations of these aromatic amino acids did not affect cell viability after chlorination a 27 concentration of tyr and 23 concentration of trp decreased cell viability to 50 however chlorination of phe did not result in cytotoxicity even at a 400 concentration fig 2d shows the cytotoxicity equivalents of these aromatic amino acids chlorination increased the cytotoxicity to 19 8 mg phenol l for tyr and to 24 0 mg phenol l for trp perhaps because the reactivity and substitution effects formed more toxic products liu et al 2014 as chlorination did not render phe cytotoxic we surmise that the transformation rates of the precursor were low or that only non toxic products were formed the findings of the toxicity assay suggest that tyr and trp are important precursors of toxic cl dbps and should be studied in depth 3 2 identification of cl dbps formed by chlorination of tyr and trp nontargeted screening by uplc hrms was used to detect dbps in chlorinated tyr and trp fig s1 shows the mass spectra obtained each spectrum contained thousands of peaks implying the presence of thousands of products and requiring a highly sensitive and effective method for identification fig 1 shows the workflow for analyzing uplc hrms data using compound discoverer 54 and 41 molecular formulas of cl dbps were detected in samples of chlorinated tyr and trp respectively tables s2 and s3 provide detailed information on the specific molecular formulas and retention times obtained by compound discoverer previous studies have noted that the accuracy of compound discoverer data should be further verified using other means lu et al 2021 ng et al 2020 as chlorine has two natural isotopes 35cl and 37cl with a mass defect of 1 9970 da and occurrence probabilities of 75 8 and 24 2 respectively these distinct isotope patterns are helpful in checking the accuracy of the analysis yang et al 2019b however because of the complexity of the spectra and large number of cl dbps it is almost impossible to check all the isotope patterns manually thus isotope patterns of cl dbps must be validated automatically we developed an analytical code from halogen isotope patterns to check the accuracy of the compound discoverer analysis we also used the r package mfassignr to determine the elemental compositions of the mass spectrometry peaks schum et al 2019 2020 using this code we detected 20 and 11 cl dbps formed by chlorination of tyr and trp respectively table 1 with compound a 1 as an example the peak of m z 194 9177 corresponds to the deprotonated molecular ion m h of c6h3ocl3 with a mass accuracy of 0 3 ppm in general routine mass measurement error for the orbitrap mass is 10 ppm and a mass accuracy 5 ppm will confirm the identification callahan et al 2011 peterson et al 2012 moreover the pair of peaks at m z 194 9177 and 196 9138 shows the 100 94 ratio of peak intensity which corroborates with the isotopic patterns of 35cl 37cl containing three chlorine atoms the halogen extraction code is therefore effective in checking 35cl 37cl mass defects and isotopic ratios guaranteeing the unambiguous identification of cl dbps notably the cl dbps detected using the code were all included in the cl dbps obtained using compound discoverer showing that this code can effectively exclude the false positives returned by compound discoverer however the code cannot calculate the retention times thus an effective method to identify cl dbps and acquire necessary information accurately and conveniently is to combine the use of the halogen extraction code to obtain the accurate m z and formulas and compound discoverer to obtain the retention times to identify the structures of the cl dbps we obtained the ms ms spectra of cl dbp fragment ions fig 3 taking compound a 3 c8h7nocl2 as an example the parent ion of m z 201 9831 produces characteristic fragment ions of m z 168 0222 m z 134 0611 and m z 77 097 which were identified as c8h7nocl c8h7no and c6h5 respectively chlorination principles would suggest that c8h7nocl2 is 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenylethylimine a 3a and the ms ms fragment ions confirmed the proposed structure fig 3a notably the measured m z 201 9831 of a 3 corresponds to two separate retention times tables s2 indicating that this compound contains two isomers lu et al 2021 studies have shown that chlorine substitution of amino acids may occur at the amino group or the aromatic ring through electrophilic substitution during chlorination huang et al 2017 jiang et al 2017 in light of this c8h7nocl2 was also proposed to be n cl 3 chloro 4 hydroxyphenylethylimine a 3b taking a 7 c8h7no2cl2 as another example the ms ms spectrum of m z 217 9782 contains m z 184 0170 m z 126 9956 and m z 59 0317 and the characteristic fragment ions were identified as c8h7nocl c8h7no and c6h5 respectively through formation pathway proposal and structure identification a 7 was proposed to be 3 5 dichloro 4 hydroxyphenylacetamide fig 3b similarly fig 3c and fig 3d show the fragment ions of b 2 with m z 240 9942 and b 11 with m z 240 9942 in the chlorinated trp sample respectively along with their proposed structures in total 15 structures of detected cl dbps were identified table 2 and their ms ms spectra are presented in figs s2a s15a most do not have commercially available reference standards or cannot be easily synthesized in the laboratory eleven of the 15 cl dbps a 1 a 3a a 3b a 7 a 14 a 20 b 2 b 3 b 5 b 8 and b 11 are aromatic cl dbps with the exception of a 1 all these cl dbps are reported here for the first time the listed structures were proposed from possible formation pathways discussed in the next section and confirmed by the ms ms fragment ions 3 3 formation pathways during chlorination of tyr and trp fig s16 shows generalized and simplified transformation pathways during chlorination of amino acids chu et al 2012 conyers and scully 1993 how et al 2017 kimura et al 2015 trehy et al 1986 yu and reckhow 2015 zhao et al 2012 studies have shown that three reactions of hocl with organic compounds are possible oxidation addition of hocl to unsaturated bonds and electrophilic substitution criquet et al 2015 deborde and von gunten 2008 johnson and jensen 1986 phungsai et al 2016 rozhko et al 2013 sawaki 1983 sorba et al 1982 figs 4 and 5 illustrate tentative formation pathways of cl dbps formed during chlorination of tyr and trp respectively figs s2b s15b outline the reaction steps to form each cl dbp fig 4 shows the transformation products of chlorinated tyr whose identities were proposed by the generalized pathways fig s16 and possible reactions of hocl with organic compounds the potential formation pathways of a 1 have been reported previously fig s2b chu et al 2012 the 3 and 5 positions in the aromatic ring of transformation products a ⅱ and a ⅹ were activated by hydroxyl groups thus certain hydrogen atoms were displaced by chlorine atoms forming a 3a a 3b and a 7 figs s3b and s5b oxidation and electrophilic substitution induced modification of transformation products a ⅲ a ⅶ a ⅵ and a ⅰ to form a 6 a 13 a 14 and a 20 respectively figs s4b s6b s7b and s10b a 16 and a 17 are the further oxidation products of a 13 and a 14 respectively figs s8b and s9b fig 5 shows the transformation products of chlorinated trp proposed using the generalized pathways in fig s16 transformation product b ⅵ was proposed as an oxidation product of transformation product b ⅴ from the literature salminen and heinonen 2008 simat and steinhart 1998 through electrophilic substitution of hocl to the aromatic ring transformation product b ⅳ was converted into b 2 figs s11b while transformation product b ⅵ was converted into b 3 and b 11 figs s12b and s15b it should be noted that chlorine substitution of the indole ring will first occur on the pyrrole ring and then on the benzene ring thus the specific positions of substituted chlorine were determined james and snyder 2003 cleavage of the pyrrole ring in trp may also occur salminen and heinonen 2008 leading to the formation of transformation products b ⅶ and b ⅷ the latter may undergo subsequent reactions such as decarboxylation and electrophilic substitution to produce b 5 and b 8 figs s13b and s14b to validate the proposed formation pathways we searched for the 18 transformation products a ⅰ to a ⅹ and b ⅰ to b ⅷ using uplc hrms nine transformation products were detected a ⅲ a ⅸ a ⅹ and b ⅲ to b ⅷ table s4 not all transformation products can be detected as the unstable compounds may have been transformed to other products rapidly or were not detectable by the method zhai and zhang 2011 yang et al 2019a 3 4 incidence of the newly identified cl dbps in reclaimed water we analyzed samples of reclaimed water by uplc hrms to assess the incidence of cl dbps formed by chlorination of tyr and trp because standard compounds are not commercially available and cannot be easily synthesized data on the incidence of aromatic cl dbps are not comprehensive and many aromatic cl dbps reported in the literature such as halotyrosylalanines halophenylalanylglycines and halopeptides cannot be analyzed quantitatively huang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 jiang et al 2019 thus we evaluated the incidence of cl dbps formed by the chlorination of tyr and trp by comparing the characteristic ions and retention times table 3 shows that seven of the cl dbps a 1 a 3a a 3b a 7 a 16 a 17 and a 20 were detected in the chlorinated reclaimed water from the rw a sample and nine cl dbps a 3a a 3b a 13 a 16 a 17 a 20 b 2 b 5 and b 11 were detected in the chlorinated reclaimed water from the rw b sample five of the cl dbps a 3a a 3b a 16 a 17 and a 20 were detected in samples from both sources none of these cl dbps were detected in unchlorinated reclaimed water samples from these sources most of the cl dbps we identified were detected in the samples showing that they are likely to be formed during chlorination of reclaimed water 3 5 comparative toxicity of cl dbps formed by chlorination of tyr and trp without reference standard for these compounds we assessed their comparative toxicity using prediction models multiple qsar models have been developed to predict toxicity endpoints klopman et al 2004 richard and benigni 2002 yang et al 2006 in general qsar models are more applicable to comparing chemical structures with existing experimental data martin and young 2001 zhu et al 2009 selecting a suitable qsar model involves considerations of practical constraints and prediction accuracy after evaluating several qsar models we selected the acute toxicity 96 h lc50 to the fathead minnow to predict the comparative toxicity of cl dbps table s5 and table 2 list the calculations and predicted lc50 values all the aromatic cl dbps detected in this study were predicted to exert higher lethality than trichloromethane especially tyr derived a 3b 50 the toxicity and trp derived b 11 300 toxicity indicating that the occurrence of these new cl dbps should be paid to valid concern 4 conclusions in this study we found that tyr and trp are precursors of toxic cl dbps present in chlorine treated reclaimed water and concluded the following 1 our self developed halogen extraction code for analyzing 35cl 37cl mass defects and halogen isotopic ratios complements uplc hrms data to identify cl dbps from thousands of ms peaks 2 we identified 14 previously unreported cl dbps formed by chlorination of tyr and trp and

17262,because arsenic as is highly toxic and carcinogenic its efficient removal from drinking water is essential considering some adsorption media may adsorb as fast but are too expensive to be applied in a household while others could be abundantly available at low cost but with slow uptake kinetics we explored a novel mass re equilibrium mre process between two media with different adsorption characteristics to enhance the overall as removal we employed an adsorbent with fast adsorption kinetics to grab as from water and then allow it to transfer to a second adsorbent with large capacity for as retention in the system containing two adsorbents separated by a dialysis membrane the results showed that as associated with a fast adsorbing iron based ordered mesoporous carbon could diffuse to a slow adsorbing but high capacity iron based activated carbon column tests were further conducted showing that the mixed medium composed of the two adsorbents could be used to adsorb as at a very short empty bed contact time 1 min and the removal was improved by the mre that potentially redistributed solid phase as during pump off periods this study points to a new direction that by the mre process novel binary adsorbent approaches may be developed for contaminant removal if suitable media and process configuration could be identified graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords arsenic removal adsorption kinetics mass transfer mass re equilibrium process configuration 1 introduction since the severe arsenic as contamination in bangladesh was uncovered more than two decades ago sengupta et al 2017 tremendous efforts have been devoted to mitigating this problem in the world cui et al 2013 möller et al 2009 neumann et al 2013 peter et al 2017 xie et al

of the most effective approaches for as removal due to its operational simplicity and small footprint the removal of as by various media has been extensively studied including iron fe impregnated carbons wang et al 2019b as adsorption is a ligand exchange process with complexes formed on the surface with reactive fe moieties fendorf et al 1997 sherman and randall 2003 a simulation demonstrated that such a reaction proceeds with three energetically favorable steps that progress from physical adsorption to monodentate complexation and finally to bidentate complexation farrell and chaudhary 2013 facing the long existing as problem revisiting treatment processes with adsorption is a must decentralized water treatment systems such as point of use pou units have been widely used to produce safe drinking water pérez vidal et al 2016 peter et al 2017 sankar et al 2013 in pou systems the required hydraulic contact time is e g 32 seconds in one study möller et al 2009 an order of magnitude shorter than the necessary contact time of conventional adsorption towers in community water treatment plants chen et al 2007 tresintsi et al 2013 though adsorbents with rapid as adsorption kinetics

frameworks wang et al 2019a and nanomaterials mertens et al 2016 yang et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 the cost of these adsorbents is prohibitively high and very few of them can reach the market on the other hand many other low cost adsorbents have been examined such as modified geomedia ray et al 2019 tailored biochars bakshi et al 2018 hu et al 2015 and fe impregnated granular activated carbon kalaruban et al 2019 however because of the slow uptake rates their application in pou systems is rather limited the focus of this study is therefore to explore if we could integrate these two types of adsorbents with an innovative process configuration for the enhanced as removal this exploration was partially inspired by the work from morel and hering morel and hering 1993 who established a pseudo equilibrium model describing a competitive relationship between two ligands with a metal ion the pseudo equilibrium could be reached quickly with the ligand possessing a rapid complexation kinetics but the system eventually proceeded to a true equilibrium with the one that had a slower kinetics but a higher affinity by replacing the initially complexed ligand see details in section 3 3 by analogy we hypothesized that it was possible to use two media one with fast adsorption kinetics but low affinity and the other slow kinetics but high affinity to remove a contaminant more efficiently the re equilibrium would involve in the contaminant transfer from the fast adsorbing medium to the one with a slower adsorption kinetics specifically for arsenate as v adsorption the concept of this mass re equilibrium mre can be illustrated by the following two reactions 1 m as m as 2 m as m as where as v in pseudo equilibrium with the faster adsorption surface m could be transferred to the slower but stronger adsorbing surface m the use of the mixed medium may therefore result in an overall fast kinetics high capacity and affordable application cost this mre concept is analogous to the information storage system in a computer where a cache buffer is used to quickly store and transfer information while a disk platter to store copious quantities of data fig 1 the goal of this study was to test our hypothesis that the mre process between two adsorbents could be used for the enhanced as v removal specific objectives were to 1 investigate as v adsorption kinetics and capacities on various fe based carbons to select suitable media for the mre process evaluation 2 monitor as v transport between different media in a batch scale reactor refer to fig 1 3 understand

solutions 2 2 preparation of fe based carbonaceous adsorbents three types of carbons were selected for the study based on their differences in particle size and porous structure table s1 of supplementary materials ordered mesoporous carbon omc granular activated carbon gac and powdered activated carbon pac by oxidizing all carbons for both 12 h and 24 h respectively six carbon samples were acquired see text s1 and figs s1 s2 for details the oxidation was to aid fe impregnation that followed a reported protocol chen et al 2007 briefly 2 0 g of oxidized carbons were mixed with 200 ml of 0 10 m fe no3 3 solution at ph 2 0 for 1 5 h suspensions were heated at 96 1 c until dry and then the dry solids were washed thoroughly the prepared adsorbents were named with subscripts indicating the average fe contents i e fe3omc fe6gac and fe23pac denoted the contents of 3 05 6 51 and 23 2 respectively 2 3 batch experiments as v adsorption the prepared adsorbents were firstly assessed in batch tests for their as v adsorption characteristics batch tests were conducted with 20 ml capped glass vials at room temperature 22 1 c and all working solutions contained 50 0 mm nano3 as background electrolyte final ph was controlled at 6 6 0 1 by 2 0 mm mops buffer which did not interfere with as v adsorption on fe minerals couture et al 2013 wolthers et al 2005 preliminary tests were carried out to identify adsorbents with different adsorption kinetics the empirical pseudo first order rate constants were firstly compared between two candidates from the same parent carbon and the faster one was selected for all remaining experiments table s2 kinetic experiments were performed by adding 10 0 mg adsorbent into 10 0 ml of 49 9 51 0 μg as l solutions the suspensions were stirred at 500 rpm on a magnetic stirrer and the supernatants were sampled to monitor the change of as concentration as a function of time for feomcs and fepacs the adsorption equilibrium was reached in 20 and 30 min respectively while for fegacs it took 12 h data not shown additional kinetic tests lasting for 24 hour were conducted for fe3omc and fe6gac in which 5 0 mg of each medium was dosed to 10 0 ml of 2 17 mg as l solutions in separate 20 ml glass vials and then were mixed on an end over end shaker glas col terre haute at 50 rpm samples were taken at 0 1 0 3 0 7 1 3 6 9 12 15 18 and 24 h for as analysis following filtration by 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes membranes adsorption isotherms were measured with the bottle point method schideman et al 2006 all suspensions with pre determined as to solid ratios were mixed on the shaker at 50 rpm for 24 h prior to as analysis controlled experiments with virgin carbons were also conducted in duplicate 2 4 dialysis experiments mre assessment experimental set up to evaluate mre is shown in fig 1 duplicate experiments were carried out at room temperature with the same ph and background electrolyte as the batch tests data were reported as means unless otherwise specified the first step was to couple as loaded adsorbent with virgin ones explicitly 30 0 mg of fe3omc was mixed with 30 0 ml of 48 5 50 6 mg as l working solutions in centrifuge tubes at 50 rpm on the shaker for 24 h and then were centrifuged at 10 000 rcf at 22 c for 20 min afterwards 29 5 ml of supernatants were drawn with pipette leaving 0 5 ml in the centrifuge tubes a sample named as solution i was taken by filtering the supernatant through a 0 22 μm pes membrane the amount of as v loaded to fe3omc reported as the amount at day 0 was calculated by the as concentration difference between the initial working solution and solution i another replicate was sacrificed to obtain a freeze dried solid sample for characterizations a glass dish fig s3 was filled with 50 0 ml solution with 50 0 mm nano3 and 2 0 mm mops named as solution ii 60 0 mg of virgin adsorbent fe6gac or fe23pac was placed into a cellulose dialysis tube 7 8 cm length and 3 4 cm flat width with a molecular weight cut off of 50 kda spectra por 6 spectrum after the tubing with the virgin adsorbent was moved into the dish the as loaded fe3omc was transferred to the reactor along with 0 5 ml supernatant solution ii was again used to transfer the trace amount of leftover in the centrifuge tube only an extra 8 0 ml of solution ii was allowed indicating the total volume of 58 5 ml at the beginning the reactor was covered by a parafilm and then a foil magnetically stirred at 600 rpm for 1 3 and 5 day control experiments fe3omc solution ii dialysis tubing were performed for 1 and 5 day to account for desorption of as v from fe3omc without the other adsorbent in the reactor when the reaction was completed supernatant was carefully withdrawn and filtered through a 0 22 μm pes membrane to collect solution iii total as of solution iii was analyzed for the liquid phase as amount after mre reaction with all analytical details for solutions i ii and iii described in table 1 after taking the dialysis tubing out of the reactor particles were transferred with the supernatant if needed and vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose membrane the particles along with the membrane were placed into 20 0 ml of 0 5 m naoh solution in a centrifuge tube mixed on the shaker at 50 rpm for 24 h to recover as v the naoh concentration of 0 5 m was employed following the literature cumbal and sengupta 2005 sarkar et al 2008 after extraction samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm pes membrane for as analysis to calculate the recovery amount for fe3omc fe23pac experiment one more replicate was sacrificed after 5 days reaction for solid characterizations for fe3omc solution ii control experiment at 5 day fe3omc dialysis tubing and 0 45 μm cellulose membranes were respectively treated by the same protocol for as v recovery 2 5 column experiments demonstration of mre process the application feasibility of mre was tested in column runs using columns packed with fe3omc fe6gac and the mixed medium of fe3omc and fe6gac specifically 300 mg solids 0 4 ml bed volume were packed into 2 5 ml columns 0 9 cm of diameter 3 9 cm of length boca scientific for the mixed medium column a total of 100 mg fe3omc and 200 mg fe6gac were packed into the column via 4 portions for each and were added alternatively to help mixing glass wool glass beads and membrane filters 10 μm boca scientific were placed into the top and the bottom of each column to support the solid an upflow fashion was applied and an as v spiked solution was supplied by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s cole parmer the influent solution was buffered with mops 2 0 mm at ph 6 6 spiked with nano3 50 0 mm and stored in a nalgene bottle two modes were used namely the 10 h on 14 h off and non stop modes for the former the empty bed contact times ebcts of columns packed with the mixed medium fe3omc and fe6gac were set to 1 00 0 95 and 0 93 min respectively for the latter ebcts were 0 95 0 91 and 0 91 min respectively according to the standard method of american society for testing and materials astm 2014 columns were fed with deionized water for 1 h and then the feedwater was switched to the as v test water 2 6 chemical analyses total as was analyzed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with graphite furnace 210 vgp buck scientific or by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icap 6500 thermo fisher check standards were analyzed regularly which showed 3 relative standard deviation typically fe content was determined by a modified 1 10 phenanthroline photometric method as reported previously gu et al 2005 2 7 characterizations morphology and structure of solids were examined by a transmission electron microscope tem jeol 1400 the

digital micrograph software version 3 20 were analyzed as referencing fe valance to the intensity ratio of fe l 3 to l 2 electron core shell transitions cosandey et al 2012 klie and browning 2002 mineralogy of samples was studied by x ray diffraction xrd ultima iv rigaku with cu k a radiation at 40 kv 44 ma and λ 1 54 å the oxygen containing functional groups on carbon surface were

2020plus hd88 micromeritics brunauer emmett teller and barrett joyner halenda theories were applied to determine specific surface area and pore size distribution respectively as v transport for the

measurements were performed with 26 0 ev pass energy at a 200 μm x ray spot size the binding energy was calibrated by referencing the c 1s line at 284 8 ev scott et al 2005 and the spectra were processed with xpspeak41 software see text s1 for details 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of fe based carbons to select suitable media in dialysis and column experiments the solids were first characterized for their porous structures and then appraised in batch adsorption tests for their ability to adsorb as v fig s4 showed that the omc had a highly ordered porous structure in contrast to both pac and gac the uniform porous structure of omc was evidenced by the small angle xrd pattern of omc with 100 and 110 reflections fig s5 and the sharp pore size distribution fig s6 in consistency with literature meng et al 2006 wu et al 2010 the average particle sizes ranges for omc pac gac were 0 539 30 42 and 800 1100 μm respectively fig s7 and table s1 after oxidation the omc surface gained more functional groups as shown by the ftir spectra fig s2a in which the bands at 1629 1639 cm 1 may be ascribed to the vibration of c o bond quinone groups pakuła et al 1998 ramesh and sampath 2001 and 3448 3458 cm 1 to o h bond phenolic hydroxyl groups pradhan and sandle 1999 ramírez et al 2008 virgin pac and gac had some functional groups after oxidation figs s2b c the bands at 1723 1725 cm 1 the vibration of c o stretching together with the bands at 3437 3453 cm 1 hydroxyl groups could be assigned to carboxyl groups moreno castilla et al 1995 the amount of fe adsorbed on carbon surface correlated with the total amount of hydroxyl like and carboxyl groups pakuła et al 1998 which explained that the least amount of fe was coated on the carboxyl free omc we also analyzed how fe particles aggregated in the carbon substrate some fe of fe3omc formed separated islands fig s8 unlike fe6gac and fe23pac with fe basically covering both outer and inner surfaces figs s9 and s10 the covering explained a sharp decrease of the specific surface areas in comparison with their parent carbons they were reduced from 877 to 372 and from 650 to 183 m2 g respectively for fe6gac and fe23pac the accompanied loss in pore volumes was from 0 530 to 0 230 and 1 02 to 0 186 cm3 g respectively for fe3omc however the specific surface area was increased from 554 to 637 m2 g possibly because the island like structure had created more space as the pore volume increased from 0 344 to 0 414 cm3 g it is reported that specific surface area is positively related to pore volume gniot et al 2009 li et al 2013 among three parent carbons the highest pore volume of pac 1 02 cm3 g had allowed the most fe to aggregate in the porous structure potentially leading to the largest as v adsorption capacity figs s5a s6b and s8a showed the ordered mesoporous channels were maintained after oxidation and fe coating according to raw eels spectra fig s11 both fe l and o k edges were detected and the fe l 3 l 2 intensity ratios for all three adsorbents were larger than 5 25 suggesting the fe valence as 3 0 according to literature cosandey et al 2012 salafranca et al 2012 based on the fft analysis figs s11 and s12 the fe phase on both fe6gac and fe23pac may be hematite as the lattice interplanar distances see fft results in text s2 correspond to planes of hematite based on joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds card no 33 0664 compared to maghemite likely on fe3omc based on jcpds card no 39 1346 text s2 two distinct phases were observed with the same fe coating protocol together with the eftem images exhibiting c o and fe distributions fig s13 suggesting that the crystallographic forms of iron oxides may be affected by the surrounding carbon matrices the formation mechanisms of iron oxides on carbonaceous materials need to be further studied nevertheless we characterized fe3omc with fib assisted hrtem to show the embedment of fe in the carbon matrix fig s14 3 2 batch experiments various carbonaceous adsorbents might have very different as v uptake rates under otherwise comparable conditions mainly because of their differences in particle size and porous structure both fe23pac and fe3omc removed as v from 50 0 to below 10 0 μg as l the maximum contamination level zhang et al 2017 within less than 300 s while the as concentration in the system with fe6gac at 300 s remained above the level fig 2 a given the as v uptake rate is inversely proportional to the square of particle radius badruzzaman et al 2004 the slowest uptake rate of fe6gac may be partially due to the largest grain size of the gac that is 800 1100 μm the well documented highway mass transfer effects korenblit et al 2010 as represented by rapid uptake of ordered mesoporous materials were observed for the faster adsorption on fe3omc than on fe23pac when time 100 s with a much higher fe content for the latter however the adsorbed amount caught up with the former at 120 s the similar trend was observed previously gu et al 2007 according to the pore size distribution figs s6c d the existence of larger pores 5 nm for fe23pac and the highest fraction of small pores 2 5 nm for fe6gac corresponded to the fastest and the slowest adsorption rate which was consistent with other studies for a positive correlation between fast mass transfer and large porosity badruzzaman et al 2004 hristovski et al 2008 fitting kinetic data of fe23pac fe3omc and fe6gac with the intraparticle diffusion model kim et al 2004 yu et al 2009 gave the rate constants of 2 24 2 12 and 0 633 μg g 1 s 0 5 respectively see details in table s2 suggesting that the rate limiting step was intraparticle diffusion the control experiments showed that parent carbons cannot adsorb much as v that is 0 091 0 174 and 0 347 mg as g for omc pac and gac respectively the adsorption capacities measured for fe3omc fe6gac and fe23pac fig 2b were 6 44 10 4 and 15 7 mg as g respectively in accordance with the increasing order of fe contents despite unsatisfactory regression coefficients of the freundlich fits r2 0 880 0 931 table s3 the model described the results better than the langmuir model data not shown knowing fe6gac adsorbed more as v at equilibrium of 24 h but with a slower uptake rate than fe3omc we designed the 24 hour kinetic tests fig 2c shows the adsorption plateau reached in 1 h for fe3omc and 18 h for fe6gac and a crossover was observed at 12 h afterwards we evaluated the mre process in dialysis experiments and assessed the application feasibility with the mixed medium in column tests 3 3 as v transport in mre process the pseudo equilibrium model aforementioned could be represented by eqs 3 and 4 morel and hering 1993 3 m p k 1 k 1 mp k m p 4 m q k 2 k 2 mq k m q where k 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 are the rate constants s 1 k mp and k mq are the complexation constants m represents a metal and p and q are two competing ligands assumptions were made morel and hering 1993 i ideally reactions 3 and 4 obeyed pseudo first order kinetics with the rate constants k 1 k 2 k 1 k 1 p k 2 k 2 q ii the weaker ligand p k m p k m q was more abundant at the initial condition i e p 0 q 0 and iii q 0 m 0 the model revealed the pseudo equilibrium was reached quickly between species m and mp with mp mq during this time interval but the final equilibrium was re established later resulting in mq mp due to the competition for the surface sites insights from the pseudo equilibrium model allowed us to evaluate the mre process in which as v initially in a pseudo equilibrium with the fast adsorbing fe3omc is supposed to redistribute with time and eventually reach the true equilibrium with both media the observation of the as v transport from fe3omc to fe6gac or fe23pac clearly established the mre process moving towards the true equilibrium fig 3 setting up dialysis tubing allowed as v rather than adsorbents confined in to diffuse through at the beginning the as amounts loaded to fe3omc were 95 5 95 6 and 95 0 μg for fe3omc solution ii the control fe3omc fe6gac and fe3omc fe23pac experiments respectively for fe3omc solution ii the solid phase as amounts at mre 1 and 5 d recovered from fe3omc by alkaline extraction were 72 8 and 69 8 μg respectively in comparison adding fe6gac to the system induced more as release from fe3omc as evidenced by smaller recovery amounts of 51 8 and 43 5 μg from fe3omc at 1 and 5 d respectively and by as accumulation on fe6gac from 12 4 μg at 1 d to 38 1 μg at 5 d fig 3a when fe23pac with the highest adsorption capacity was introduced the extractable amount from fe3omc was the smallest 37 3 μg at 5 d with the highest amount of 51 0 μg concurrently accumulating on fe23pac at 5 d fig 3b given the accumulating amounts at 5 d for fe6gac and fe23pac were clearly higher than the liquid phase amounts at 0 d 23 1 and 22 6 μg respectively there must be as v transporting away from the as loaded fe3omcs confirming the mre process the high as amounts recoverable from both fe6gac and fe23pac were also due to the decreased liquid phase amounts from 1 to 5 d fig s15 overall mass balance calculations table 1 quantified the mass transfer of as v in the mre process the mass recoveries were 78 0 for most systems the 100 recoveries could be attributed to the loss of particles during operation and the incomplete recovery of as from spent fe based carbons as reported 0 5 m naoh cannot attain 100 as recovery cumbal and sengupta 2005 sarkar et al 2008 in addition the amounts of as adsorbed onto the dialysis tubings and cellulose membranes were measured to be 2 45 and 1 67 μg at mre 5 d respectively indicating that while both adsorbed trace amounts of as the percentage was only 2 05 and 1 40 of the inputs to examine as v transport in the mre process we conducted extensive analyses on the freeze dried solids from fe3omc fe23pac experiments with xps and hrtem fft in terms of as 3d spectra figs s16a c e the peaks centered at 45 2 45 7 ev were associated with the adsorbed as v nesbitt and reinke 1999 prucek et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 together with the contributions from fe iii for fe 2p spectra i e fe 2p 3 2 peaks located at 711 4 ev bonnissel gissinger et al 1998 mcintyre and zetaruk 1977 figs s16b d f we found no redox reactions between as v and the coated iron oxides in carbon matrices hrtem fft microanalysis suggested that iron oxide crystallinity may not change after reactions fig s17 as the fe phases of fe3omc and fe23pac were still maghemite and hematite respectively both inner and outer surfaces of reacted grains from fe3omc fe23pac experiments were observed with fib technique on the mappings of the cross section it clearly showed fe being embedded in the carbon substrate fig 4 for a comprehensive visualization of as v sequestration 31 regions from areas a to ae fig 4 and figs s18 s20 see summary in table s4 were selected for elemental analysis based on eds spectra fe and as distributions were correlated well with the reacted fe3omc grains figs 4a 2 and 4b 2 while a much weaker as mapping was observed for the reacted fe23pac grain fig 4c 2 the relative as weight percentage on the inner surface of fe3omc at 0 d areas a b in fig 4a 2 and f g in fig s18a and 5 d areas c d in fig 4b 2 and h i in fig s18b was 3 72 0 49 and 2 92 0 83 wt standard deviation respectively which suggested that not much as v transported away from the interior hence the smaller as recovery amounts from fe3omc could be ascribed to more as v release from the exterior surface corresponding as weight percentage at 0 d areas j k l m n in figs s19a b and 5 d areas o p q r in figs s19c d was 8 90 2 44 and 4 32 0 89 wt respectively for fe23pac though as was occasionally not detected on two areas the broad weight percentage distributions from 0 43 to 5 75 wt based on another eleven areas illustrated the sequestration areas s to ae in fig s20 the 0 77 wt of as on the inner surface fig 4c 3 implied very little as v can diffuse to the internal regions of reacted fe23pac grains as v adsorption rate is normally much faster than desorption rate grossl et al 1997 yang et al 2012 and only a small fraction of adsorbed as v releases at near neutral ph possibly due to the high activation barriers for as v desorption farrell and chaudhary 2013 and or slow mass transfer effects out of micropores of iron oxides cornell and schwertmann 2003 meanwhile as v desorption generally underwent dual stages outer sphere complexation observed on hematite as v may account for the faster release at the first stage catalano et al 2008 because these complexes were formed by a combination of electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding and configurationally interfacial water stabilization catalano et al 2008 we assumed that some outer sphere as v surface complexes were formed on the coated maghemite of fe3omc then the release of as v in the outer sphere complexes could be partially responsible for the sharp drop of solid phase amounts from mre 0 to 1 d in fe3omc solution ii control experiments fig 3 it was followed by the apparent level off from 1 to 5 d at the second stage in general the coordination bond cleavage of inner sphere complexes would hinder further release of as v at near neutral ph farrell and chaudhary 2013 even in the presence of 6 mm phosphate solution at ph 6 the desorbed fraction of as v from goethite in 100 h was almost the same as the fraction in 700 h and the bonding mechanism of inner sphere complexes did not change after one week o reilly et al 2001 however after adding the competing adsorbent to the system much more was desorbed from fe3omc than the control fig 3 since the as v release from the inside of as loaded fe3omc contributed to the mre in a minor way fig 4 we assumed the inner sphere complexes on the outer surface of fe3omc could be more likely involved in the mre based as v desorption meanwhile we observed that the larger the adsorption capacity of the competing adsorbent the more as v release from fe3omc this can be explained by eqs 1 and 2 as a stronger adsorbent of fe23pac or m in eq 2 could better compete for as v with fe3omc or m in eq 1 thus favoring the forward reaction in eq 2 in summary we demonstrated the feasibility of using the mre process for as v transport from the spent adsorbent to a virgin one at this stage 3 4 column studies we performed column tests with the mixed medium containing both fe3omc and fe6gac at a mass ratio of 1 2 and with the single medium of fe3omc or fe6gac we ran column tests on a 10 h on and 14 h off mode to potentially match diurnal variability in a household fig 5 a in comparison with a continuous mode fig 5b such on off mode of operation could enhance as v uptake when the flow was restarted westerhoff et al 2005 we employed a high as influent concentration 4 64 mg as l to assess the potential of engineering mre process the results indicated that 1 generally the effluent as concentrations increased with time for all three columns 2 the fe3omc column removed as v most effectively in the first 800 bed volumes bvs after each 14 h off period there was an improved as v removal for all as indicated by sharp drops in as concentration for example the concentration dropped by almost half in the fe3omc column fig 5a this drop in the fe3omc column was however very brief which could be rationalized by the lack of sufficient adsorption sites on fe3omc under the high influent concentration in the fe6gac column with a large capacity but slow kinetics for as v the performance for as v removal was the worst in the first 1000 bvs but outperformed the fe3omc column afterwards fig 5a because of the near exhaustion of fe3omc in contrast when the mixed medium was used while the efficiency for as v removal was not as good as that of the pure fe3omc column in the first 800 bvs the mixed medium column outperformed the fe3omc one afterwards as indicated by the crossover of as v breakthrough curves at around 800 bvs fig 5a that is in the mixed medium column fe3omc can adsorb as v faster than fe6gac on a per gram medium basis see fig 2c for reference and then the mre can kick in that could moderately regenerate fe3omc in situ in the off pump cycles eventually leading to a lower effluent as v level this suggested that some as v loaded on fe3omc could diffuse to fe6gac during the idle period when compared with the pure fe6gac column the mixed medium column had a better performance before 800 bvs possibly due to faster kinetics of fe3omc the column interruption tests and corresponding solid phase concentration gradients dq dr have been applied to understand contaminant adsorption as illustrated by fig 6 when intraparticle diffusion is a rate limiting step like this study the solid phase concentration gradient of a single particle that governs the overall uptake rate tends to level out during the interruption li and sengupta 2000 sengupta 2017 right after a larger driving force represented by a greater dq dr due to the interruption can improve the uptake and drop the effluent solute level li and sengupta 2000 sengupta 2017 the solid phase as v concentration profiles for fe3omc and fe6gac could be similarly conceptualized with dq dr changing over an on off pump cycle fig 6 in terms of the mixed medium column the green shaded area adsorbed as v can diffuse and redistribute between fe3omc and fe6gac by the mre during interruption thus further leveling off the dq dr of fe3omc the situation is equivalent to in situ regeneration of fe3omc via intraparticle diffusion of the desorbed as v from fe3omc into fe6gac upon restarting the flow the regenerated fe3omc with a much enhanced dq dr could adsorb as more quickly so resulting in a rapid decrease of effluent concentration for practical application this on and off mode of operation would be consistent with the demand of most households in the continuous mode of operation fig 5b where there was not enough time for mre the as v removal effectiveness in the columns followed the order of fe3omc the mixed medium fe6gac as expected when gac is doped with maghemite nanoparticles magnetically separating the spent gac and then replenishing a new portion would be another possibility taken together the column results showed the possibility of engineering an mre process for the enhanced as v removal upon the on off pump cycling operation 4 conclusions the batch tests and elemental mappings of this study showed that the desorption of as v from an adsorbent can be enhanced by another in close proximity when as v release is well controlled a binary adsorbent system could be engineered by mixing one fast uptake adsorbent with the other with a higher adsorption capacity in column runs the crossover of as v breakthrough curves fig 5a suggested that the solid phase concentrations were altered due to potential redistribution of as v during pump off periods for any adsorption columns operated for households rapid as v uptake is essential to cope with a short ebct e g 32 seconds möller et al 2009 the shorter the ebct the sooner the breakthrough as in general the progression of the mass transfer zone is irreversible with water flow while for those time periods when the household scale filtration column is on standby the as v re equilibrium might re shape the mass transfer zone as the adsorbent with a higher capacity but slower kinetics could regenerate the fast adsorbing one in situ the mre phenomenon examined here may also be applicable to the removal of other contaminants such as phosphate due to similar interactions for adsorbing it on iron based materials last but not least since cost benefit is not studied the efficacy of mre process in practice needs to be further analyzed especially when effluent concentrations are lower than those of this study life cycle assessment of the pros and cons of mre based in situ adsorbent regeneration will be important in comparing the binary adsorbent system with the conventional process configuration declaration of competing interest the authors

17262,because arsenic as is highly toxic and carcinogenic its efficient removal from drinking water is essential considering some adsorption media may adsorb as fast but are too expensive to be applied in a household while others could be abundantly available at low cost but with slow uptake kinetics we explored a novel mass re equilibrium mre process between two media with different adsorption characteristics to enhance the overall as removal we employed an adsorbent with fast adsorption kinetics to grab as from water and then allow it to transfer to a second adsorbent with large capacity for as retention in the system containing two adsorbents separated by a dialysis membrane the results showed that as associated with a fast adsorbing iron based ordered mesoporous carbon could diffuse to a slow adsorbing but high capacity iron based activated carbon column tests were further conducted showing that the mixed medium composed of the two adsorbents could be used to adsorb as at a very short empty bed contact time 1 min and the removal was improved by the mre that potentially redistributed solid phase as during pump off periods this study points to a new direction that by the mre process novel binary adsorbent approaches may be developed for contaminant removal if suitable media and process configuration could be identified graphical abstract image graphical

carbons wang et al 2019b as adsorption is a ligand exchange process with complexes formed on the surface with reactive fe moieties fendorf et al 1997 sherman and randall 2003 a simulation demonstrated that such a reaction proceeds with three energetically favorable steps that progress from physical adsorption to monodentate complexation and finally to bidentate complexation farrell and chaudhary 2013 facing the long existing as problem revisiting treatment processes with adsorption is a must decentralized water treatment systems such as point of use pou units have been widely used to produce safe drinking water pérez vidal et al 2016 peter et al 2017 sankar et al 2013 in pou systems the required hydraulic contact time is e g 32 seconds in one study möller et al 2009 an order of magnitude shorter than the necessary contact time of conventional adsorption towers in community water treatment plants chen et al 2007 tresintsi et al 2013 though adsorbents with rapid as adsorption kinetics have been developed including fe impregnated ordered mesoporous carbon wang et al 2019b nanoscale fe mesoporous carbon composite baikousi et al 2015 hybrid microspheres moraga et al 2019 metal organic frameworks wang et al 2019a and nanomaterials mertens et al 2016 yang et al 2010 zhao et al 2016 the cost of these adsorbents is prohibitively high and very few of them can reach the market on the other hand many other low cost adsorbents have been examined such as modified geomedia ray et al 2019 tailored biochars bakshi et al 2018 hu et al 2015 and fe impregnated granular activated carbon kalaruban et al 2019 however because of the slow uptake rates their application in pou systems is rather limited the focus of this study is therefore to explore if we could integrate these two types of adsorbents with an innovative process configuration for the enhanced as removal this exploration was partially inspired by the work from morel and hering morel and hering 1993 who established a pseudo equilibrium model describing a competitive relationship between two ligands with a metal ion the pseudo equilibrium could be reached quickly with the ligand possessing a rapid complexation kinetics but the system eventually proceeded to a true equilibrium with the one that had a slower kinetics but a higher affinity by replacing the initially complexed ligand see details in section 3 3 by analogy we hypothesized that it was possible to use two media one with fast adsorption kinetics but low affinity and the other slow kinetics but high affinity to remove a contaminant more efficiently the re equilibrium would involve in the contaminant transfer from the fast adsorbing medium to the one with a slower adsorption kinetics specifically for arsenate as v adsorption the concept of this mass re equilibrium mre can be illustrated by the following two reactions 1 m as m as 2 m as m as where as v in pseudo equilibrium with the faster adsorption surface m could be transferred to the slower but stronger adsorbing surface m the use of the mixed medium may therefore result in an overall fast kinetics high capacity and affordable application cost this mre concept is analogous to the information storage system in a computer where a cache buffer is used to quickly store and transfer information while a disk platter to store copious quantities of data fig 1 the goal of this study was to test our hypothesis that the mre process between two adsorbents could be used for the enhanced as v removal specific objectives were to 1 investigate as v adsorption kinetics and capacities on various fe based carbons to select suitable media for the mre process evaluation 2 monitor as v transport between different media in a batch scale reactor refer to fig 1 3 understand the mre process using batch experimental data and solid sample characterizations and 4 evaluate the feasibility of engineering mre process in well packed column experiments 2 experimental 2 1

solutions 2 2 preparation of fe based carbonaceous adsorbents three types of carbons were selected for the study based on their differences in particle size and porous structure table s1 of supplementary materials ordered mesoporous carbon omc granular activated carbon gac and powdered activated carbon pac by oxidizing all carbons for both 12 h and 24 h respectively six carbon samples were acquired see text s1 and figs s1 s2 for details the oxidation was to aid fe impregnation that followed a reported protocol chen et al 2007 briefly 2 0 g of oxidized carbons were mixed with 200 ml of 0 10 m fe no3 3 solution at ph 2 0 for 1 5 h suspensions were heated at 96 1 c until dry and then the dry solids were washed thoroughly the prepared adsorbents were named with subscripts indicating the average fe contents i e fe3omc fe6gac and fe23pac denoted the contents of 3 05 6 51 and 23 2 respectively 2 3 batch experiments as v adsorption the prepared adsorbents were firstly assessed in batch tests for their as v adsorption characteristics batch tests were conducted with 20 ml capped glass vials at room temperature 22 1 c and all working solutions contained 50 0 mm nano3 as background electrolyte final ph was controlled at 6 6 0 1 by 2 0 mm mops buffer which did not interfere with as v adsorption on fe minerals couture et al 2013 wolthers et al 2005 preliminary tests were carried out to identify adsorbents with different adsorption kinetics the empirical pseudo first order rate constants were firstly compared between two candidates from the same parent carbon and the faster one was selected for all remaining experiments table s2 kinetic experiments were performed by adding 10 0 mg adsorbent into 10 0 ml of 49 9 51 0 μg as l solutions the suspensions were stirred at 500 rpm on a magnetic stirrer and the supernatants were sampled to monitor the change of as concentration as a function of time for feomcs and fepacs the adsorption equilibrium was reached in 20 and 30 min respectively while for fegacs it took 12 h data not shown additional kinetic tests lasting for 24 hour were conducted for fe3omc and fe6gac in which 5 0 mg of each medium was dosed to 10 0 ml of 2 17 mg as l solutions in separate 20 ml glass vials and then were mixed on an end over end shaker glas col terre haute at 50 rpm samples were taken at 0 1 0 3 0 7 1 3 6 9 12 15 18 and 24 h for as analysis following filtration by 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes membranes adsorption isotherms were measured with the bottle point method schideman et al 2006 all suspensions with pre determined as to solid ratios were mixed on the shaker at 50 rpm for 24 h prior to as analysis controlled experiments with virgin carbons were also conducted in duplicate 2 4 dialysis experiments mre assessment experimental set up to evaluate mre is shown in fig 1 duplicate experiments were carried out at room temperature with the same ph and background electrolyte as the batch tests data were reported as means unless otherwise specified the first step was to couple as loaded adsorbent with virgin ones explicitly 30 0 mg of fe3omc was mixed with 30 0 ml of 48 5 50 6 mg as l working solutions in centrifuge tubes at 50 rpm on the shaker for 24 h and then were centrifuged at 10 000 rcf at 22 c for 20 min afterwards 29 5 ml of supernatants were drawn with pipette leaving 0 5 ml in the centrifuge tubes a sample named as solution i was taken by filtering the supernatant through a 0 22 μm pes membrane the amount of as v loaded to fe3omc reported as the amount at day 0 was calculated by the as concentration difference between the initial working solution and solution i another replicate was sacrificed to obtain a freeze dried solid sample for characterizations a glass dish fig s3 was filled with 50 0 ml solution with 50 0 mm nano3 and 2 0 mm mops named as solution ii 60 0 mg of virgin adsorbent fe6gac or fe23pac was placed into a cellulose dialysis tube 7 8 cm length and 3 4 cm flat width with a molecular weight cut off of 50 kda spectra por 6 spectrum after the tubing with the virgin adsorbent was moved into the dish the as loaded fe3omc was transferred to the reactor along with 0 5 ml supernatant solution ii was again used to transfer the trace amount of leftover in the centrifuge tube only an extra 8 0 ml of solution ii was allowed indicating the total volume of 58 5 ml at the beginning the reactor was covered by a parafilm and then a foil magnetically stirred at 600 rpm for 1 3 and 5 day control experiments fe3omc solution ii dialysis tubing were performed for 1 and 5 day to account for desorption of as v from fe3omc without the other adsorbent in the reactor when the reaction was completed supernatant was carefully withdrawn and filtered through a 0 22 μm pes membrane to collect solution iii total as of solution iii was analyzed for the liquid phase as amount after mre reaction with all analytical details for solutions i ii and iii described in table 1 after taking the dialysis tubing out of the reactor particles were transferred with the supernatant if needed and vacuum filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose membrane the particles along with the membrane were placed into 20 0 ml of 0 5 m naoh solution in a centrifuge tube mixed on the shaker at 50 rpm for 24 h to recover as v the naoh concentration of 0 5 m was employed following the literature cumbal and sengupta 2005 sarkar et al 2008 after extraction samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm pes membrane for as analysis to calculate the recovery amount for fe3omc fe23pac experiment one more replicate was sacrificed after 5 days reaction for solid characterizations for fe3omc solution ii control experiment at 5 day fe3omc dialysis tubing and 0 45 μm cellulose membranes were respectively treated by the same protocol for as v recovery 2 5 column experiments demonstration of mre process the application feasibility of mre was tested in column runs using columns packed with fe3omc fe6gac and the mixed medium of fe3omc and fe6gac specifically 300 mg solids 0 4 ml bed volume were packed into 2 5 ml columns 0 9 cm of diameter 3 9 cm of length boca scientific for the mixed medium column a total of 100 mg fe3omc and 200 mg fe6gac were packed into the column via 4 portions for each and were added alternatively to help mixing glass wool glass beads and membrane filters 10 μm boca scientific were placed into the top and the bottom of each column to support the solid an upflow fashion was applied and an as v spiked solution was supplied by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s cole parmer the influent solution was buffered with mops 2 0 mm at ph 6 6 spiked with nano3 50 0 mm and stored in a nalgene bottle two modes were used namely the 10 h on 14 h off and non stop modes for the former the empty bed contact times ebcts of columns packed with the mixed medium fe3omc and fe6gac were set to 1 00 0 95 and 0 93 min respectively for the latter ebcts were 0 95 0 91 and 0 91 min respectively according to the standard method of american society for testing and materials astm 2014 columns were fed with deionized water for 1 h and then the feedwater was switched to the as v test water 2 6 chemical analyses total as was analyzed by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer with graphite furnace 210 vgp buck scientific or by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icap 6500 thermo fisher check standards were analyzed regularly which showed 3 relative standard deviation typically fe content was determined by a modified 1 10

2020plus hd88 micromeritics brunauer emmett teller and barrett joyner halenda theories were applied to determine specific surface area and pore size distribution respectively as v transport for the

processed with xpspeak41 software see text s1 for details 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of fe based carbons to select suitable media in dialysis and column experiments the solids were first characterized for their porous structures and then appraised in batch adsorption tests for their ability to adsorb as v fig s4 showed that the omc had a highly ordered porous structure in contrast to both pac and gac the uniform porous structure of omc was evidenced by the small angle xrd pattern of omc with 100 and 110 reflections fig s5 and the sharp pore size distribution fig s6 in consistency with literature meng et al 2006 wu et al 2010 the average particle sizes ranges for omc pac gac were 0 539 30 42 and 800 1100 μm respectively fig s7 and table s1 after oxidation the omc surface gained more functional groups as shown by the ftir spectra fig s2a in which the bands at 1629 1639 cm 1 may be ascribed to the vibration of c o bond quinone groups pakuła et al 1998 ramesh and sampath 2001 and 3448 3458 cm 1 to o h bond phenolic hydroxyl groups pradhan and sandle 1999 ramírez et al 2008 virgin pac and gac had some functional groups after oxidation figs s2b c the bands at 1723 1725 cm 1 the vibration of c o stretching together with the bands at 3437 3453 cm 1 hydroxyl groups could be assigned to carboxyl groups moreno castilla et al 1995 the amount of fe adsorbed on carbon surface correlated with the total amount of hydroxyl like and carboxyl groups pakuła et al 1998 which explained that the least amount of fe was coated on the carboxyl free omc we also analyzed how fe particles aggregated in the carbon substrate some fe of fe3omc formed separated islands fig s8 unlike fe6gac and fe23pac with fe basically covering both outer and inner surfaces figs s9 and s10 the covering explained a sharp decrease of the specific surface areas in comparison with their parent carbons they were reduced from 877 to 372 and from 650 to 183 m2 g respectively for fe6gac and fe23pac the accompanied loss in pore volumes was from 0 530 to 0 230 and 1 02 to 0 186 cm3 g respectively for fe3omc however the specific surface area was increased from 554 to 637 m2 g possibly because the island like structure had created more space as the pore volume increased from 0 344 to 0 414 cm3 g it is reported that specific surface area is positively related to pore volume gniot et al 2009 li et al 2013 among three parent carbons the highest pore volume of pac 1 02 cm3 g had allowed the most fe to aggregate in the porous structure potentially leading to the largest as v adsorption capacity figs s5a s6b and s8a showed the ordered mesoporous channels were maintained after oxidation and fe coating according to raw eels spectra fig s11 both fe l and o k edges were detected and the fe l 3 l 2 intensity ratios for all three adsorbents were larger than 5 25 suggesting the fe valence as 3 0 according to literature cosandey et al 2012 salafranca et al 2012 based on the fft analysis figs s11 and s12 the fe phase on both fe6gac and fe23pac may be hematite as the lattice interplanar distances see fft results in text s2 correspond to planes of hematite based on joint committee on powder diffraction standards jcpds card no 33 0664 compared to maghemite likely on fe3omc based on jcpds card no 39 1346 text s2 two distinct phases were observed with the same fe coating protocol together with the eftem images exhibiting c o and fe distributions fig s13 suggesting that the crystallographic forms of iron oxides may be affected by the surrounding carbon matrices the formation mechanisms of iron oxides on carbonaceous materials need to be further studied nevertheless we characterized fe3omc with fib assisted hrtem to show the embedment of fe in the carbon matrix fig s14 3 2 batch experiments various carbonaceous adsorbents might have very different as v uptake rates under otherwise comparable conditions mainly because of their differences in particle size and porous structure both fe23pac and fe3omc removed as v from 50 0 to below 10 0 μg as l the maximum contamination level zhang et al 2017 within less than 300 s while the as concentration in the system with fe6gac at 300 s remained above the level fig 2 a given the as v uptake rate is inversely proportional to the square of particle radius badruzzaman et al 2004 the slowest uptake rate of fe6gac may be partially due to the largest grain size of the gac that is 800 1100 μm the well documented highway mass transfer effects korenblit et al 2010 as represented by rapid uptake of ordered mesoporous materials were observed for the faster adsorption on fe3omc than on fe23pac when time 100 s with a much higher fe content for the latter however the adsorbed amount caught up with the former at 120 s the similar trend was observed previously gu et al 2007 according to the pore size distribution figs s6c d the existence of larger pores 5 nm for fe23pac and the highest fraction of small pores 2 5 nm for fe6gac corresponded to the fastest and the slowest adsorption rate which was consistent with other studies for a positive correlation between fast mass transfer and large porosity badruzzaman et al 2004 hristovski et al 2008 fitting kinetic data of fe23pac fe3omc and fe6gac with the intraparticle diffusion model kim et al 2004 yu et al 2009 gave the rate constants of 2 24 2 12 and 0 633 μg g 1 s 0 5 respectively see details in table s2 suggesting that the rate limiting step was intraparticle diffusion the control experiments showed that parent carbons cannot adsorb much as v that is 0 091 0 174 and 0 347 mg as g for omc pac and gac respectively the adsorption capacities measured for fe3omc fe6gac and fe23pac fig 2b were 6 44 10 4 and 15 7 mg as g respectively in accordance with the increasing order of fe contents despite unsatisfactory regression coefficients of the freundlich fits r2 0 880 0 931 table s3 the model described the results better than the langmuir model data not shown knowing fe6gac adsorbed more as v at equilibrium of 24 h but with a slower uptake rate than fe3omc we designed the 24 hour kinetic tests fig 2c shows the adsorption plateau reached in 1 h for fe3omc and 18 h for fe6gac and a crossover was observed at 12 h afterwards we evaluated the mre process in dialysis experiments and assessed the application feasibility with the mixed medium in column tests 3 3 as v transport in mre process the pseudo equilibrium model aforementioned could be represented by eqs 3 and 4 morel and hering 1993 3 m p k 1 k 1 mp k m p 4 m q k 2 k 2 mq k m q where k 1 k 1 k 2 k 2 are the rate constants s 1 k mp and k mq are the complexation constants m represents a metal and p and q are two competing ligands assumptions were made morel and hering 1993 i ideally reactions 3 and 4 obeyed pseudo first order kinetics with the rate constants k 1 k 2 k 1 k 1 p k 2 k 2 q ii the weaker ligand p k m p k m q was more abundant at the initial condition i e p 0 q 0 and iii q 0 m 0 the model revealed the pseudo equilibrium was reached quickly between species m and mp with mp mq during this time interval but the final equilibrium was re established later resulting in mq mp due to the competition for the surface sites insights from the pseudo equilibrium model allowed us to evaluate the mre process in which as v initially in a pseudo equilibrium with the fast adsorbing fe3omc is supposed to redistribute with time and eventually reach the true equilibrium with both media the observation of the as v transport from fe3omc to fe6gac or fe23pac clearly established the mre process moving towards the true equilibrium fig 3 setting up dialysis tubing allowed as v rather than adsorbents confined in to diffuse through at the beginning the as amounts loaded to fe3omc were 95 5 95 6 and 95 0 μg for fe3omc solution ii the control fe3omc fe6gac and fe3omc fe23pac experiments respectively for fe3omc solution ii the solid phase as amounts at mre 1 and 5 d recovered from fe3omc by alkaline extraction were 72 8 and 69 8 μg respectively in comparison adding fe6gac to the system induced more as release from fe3omc as evidenced by smaller recovery amounts of 51 8 and 43 5 μg from fe3omc at 1 and 5 d respectively and by as accumulation on fe6gac from 12 4 μg at 1 d to 38 1 μg at 5 d fig 3a when fe23pac with the highest adsorption capacity was introduced the extractable amount from fe3omc was the smallest 37 3 μg at 5 d with the highest amount of 51 0 μg concurrently accumulating on fe23pac at 5 d fig 3b given the accumulating amounts at 5 d for fe6gac and fe23pac were clearly higher than the liquid phase amounts at 0 d 23 1 and 22 6 μg respectively there must be as v transporting away from the as loaded fe3omcs confirming the mre process the high as amounts recoverable from both fe6gac and fe23pac were also due to the decreased liquid phase amounts from 1 to 5 d fig s15 overall mass balance calculations table 1 quantified the mass transfer of as v in the mre process the mass recoveries were 78 0 for most systems the 100 recoveries could be attributed to the loss of particles during operation and the incomplete recovery of as from spent fe based carbons as reported 0 5 m naoh cannot attain 100 as recovery cumbal and sengupta 2005 sarkar et al 2008 in addition the amounts of as adsorbed onto the dialysis tubings and cellulose membranes were measured to be 2 45 and 1 67 μg at mre 5 d respectively indicating that while both adsorbed trace amounts of as the percentage was only 2 05 and 1 40 of the inputs to examine as v transport in the mre process we conducted extensive analyses on the freeze dried solids from fe3omc fe23pac experiments with xps and hrtem fft in terms of as 3d spectra figs s16a c e the peaks centered at 45 2 45 7 ev were associated with the adsorbed as v nesbitt and reinke 1999 prucek et al 2013 zhang et al 2017 together with the contributions from fe iii for fe 2p spectra i e fe 2p 3 2 peaks located at 711 4 ev bonnissel gissinger et al 1998 mcintyre and zetaruk 1977 figs s16b d f we found no redox reactions between as v and the coated iron oxides in carbon matrices hrtem fft microanalysis suggested that iron oxide crystallinity may not change after reactions fig s17 as the fe phases of fe3omc and fe23pac were still maghemite and hematite respectively both inner and outer surfaces of reacted grains from fe3omc fe23pac experiments were observed with fib technique on the mappings of the cross section it clearly showed fe being embedded in the carbon substrate fig 4 for a comprehensive visualization of as v sequestration 31 regions from areas a to ae fig 4 and figs s18 s20 see summary in table s4 were selected for elemental analysis based on eds spectra fe and as distributions were correlated well with the reacted fe3omc grains figs 4a 2 and 4b 2 while a much weaker as mapping was observed for the reacted fe23pac grain fig 4c 2 the relative as weight percentage on the inner surface of fe3omc at 0 d areas a b in fig 4a 2 and f g in fig s18a and 5 d areas c d in fig 4b 2 and h i in fig s18b was 3 72 0 49 and 2 92 0 83 wt standard deviation respectively which suggested that not much as v transported away from the interior hence the smaller as recovery amounts from fe3omc could be ascribed to more as v release from the exterior surface corresponding as weight percentage at 0 d areas j k l m n in figs s19a b and 5 d areas o p q r in figs s19c d was 8 90 2 44 and 4 32 0 89 wt respectively for fe23pac though as was occasionally not detected on two areas the broad weight percentage distributions from 0 43 to 5 75 wt based on another eleven areas illustrated the sequestration areas s to ae in fig s20 the 0 77 wt of as on the inner surface fig 4c 3 implied very little as v can diffuse to the internal regions of reacted fe23pac grains as v adsorption rate is normally much faster than desorption rate grossl et al 1997 yang et al 2012 and only a small fraction of adsorbed as v releases at near neutral ph possibly due to the high activation barriers for as v desorption farrell and chaudhary 2013 and or slow mass transfer effects out of micropores of iron oxides cornell and schwertmann 2003 meanwhile as v desorption generally underwent dual stages outer sphere complexation observed on hematite as v may account for the faster release at the first stage catalano et al 2008 because these complexes were formed by a combination of electrostatic attraction hydrogen bonding and configurationally interfacial water stabilization catalano et al 2008 we assumed that some outer sphere as v surface complexes were formed on the coated maghemite of fe3omc then the release of as v in the outer sphere complexes could be partially responsible for the sharp drop of solid phase amounts from mre 0 to 1 d in fe3omc solution ii control experiments fig 3 it was followed by the apparent level off from 1 to 5 d at the second stage in general the coordination bond cleavage of inner sphere complexes would hinder further release of as v at near neutral ph farrell and chaudhary 2013 even in the presence of 6 mm phosphate solution at ph 6 the desorbed fraction of as v from goethite in 100 h was almost the same as the fraction in 700 h and the bonding mechanism of inner sphere complexes did not change after one week o reilly et al 2001 however after adding the competing adsorbent to the system much more was desorbed from fe3omc than the control fig 3 since the as v release from the inside of as loaded fe3omc contributed to the mre in a minor way fig 4 we assumed the inner sphere complexes on the outer surface of fe3omc could be more likely involved in the mre based as v desorption meanwhile we observed that the larger the adsorption capacity of the competing adsorbent the more as v release from fe3omc this can be explained by eqs 1 and 2 as a stronger adsorbent of fe23pac or m in eq 2 could better compete for as v with fe3omc or m in eq 1 thus favoring the forward reaction in eq 2 in summary we demonstrated the feasibility of using the mre process for as v transport from the spent adsorbent to a virgin one at this stage 3 4 column studies we performed column tests with the mixed medium containing both fe3omc and fe6gac at a mass ratio of 1 2 and with the single medium of fe3omc or fe6gac we ran column tests on a 10 h on and 14 h off mode to potentially match diurnal variability in a household fig 5 a in comparison with a continuous mode fig 5b such on off mode of operation could enhance as v uptake when the flow was restarted westerhoff et al 2005 we employed a high as influent concentration 4 64 mg as l to assess the potential of engineering mre process the results indicated that 1 generally the effluent as concentrations increased with time for all three columns 2 the fe3omc column removed as v most effectively in the first 800 bed volumes bvs after each 14 h off period there was an improved as v removal for all as indicated by sharp drops in as concentration for example the concentration dropped by almost half in the fe3omc column fig 5a this drop in the fe3omc column was however very brief which could be rationalized by the lack of sufficient adsorption sites on fe3omc under the high influent concentration in the fe6gac column with a large capacity but slow kinetics for as v the performance for as v removal was the worst in the first 1000 bvs but outperformed the fe3omc column afterwards fig 5a because of the near exhaustion of fe3omc in contrast when the mixed medium was used while the efficiency for as v removal was not as good as that of the pure fe3omc column in the first 800 bvs the mixed medium column outperformed the fe3omc one afterwards as indicated by the crossover of as v breakthrough curves at around 800 bvs fig 5a that is in the mixed medium column fe3omc can adsorb as v faster than fe6gac on a per gram medium basis see fig 2c for reference and then the mre can kick in that could moderately regenerate fe3omc in situ in the off pump cycles eventually leading to a lower effluent as v level this suggested that some as v loaded on fe3omc could diffuse to fe6gac during the idle period when compared with the pure fe6gac column the mixed medium column had a better performance before 800 bvs possibly due to faster kinetics of fe3omc the column interruption tests and corresponding solid phase concentration gradients dq dr have been applied to understand contaminant adsorption as illustrated by fig 6 when intraparticle diffusion is a rate limiting step like this study the solid phase concentration gradient of a single particle that governs the overall uptake rate tends to level out during the interruption li and sengupta 2000 sengupta 2017 right after a larger driving force represented by a greater dq dr due to the interruption can improve the uptake and drop the effluent solute level li and sengupta 2000 sengupta 2017 the solid phase as v concentration profiles for fe3omc and fe6gac could be similarly conceptualized with dq dr changing over an on off pump cycle fig 6 in terms of the mixed medium column the green shaded area adsorbed as v can diffuse and redistribute between fe3omc and fe6gac by the mre during interruption thus further leveling off the dq dr of fe3omc the situation is equivalent to in situ regeneration of fe3omc via intraparticle diffusion of the desorbed as v from fe3omc into fe6gac upon restarting the flow the regenerated fe3omc with a much enhanced dq dr could adsorb as more quickly so resulting in a rapid decrease of effluent concentration for practical application this on and off mode of operation would be consistent with the demand of most households in the continuous mode of operation fig 5b where there was not enough time for mre the as v removal effectiveness in the columns followed the order of fe3omc the mixed medium fe6gac as expected when gac is doped with maghemite nanoparticles magnetically separating the spent gac and then replenishing a new portion would be another possibility taken together the column results showed the possibility of engineering an mre process for the enhanced as v removal upon the on off pump cycling operation 4 conclusions the batch tests and elemental mappings of this study showed that the desorption of as v from an adsorbent can be enhanced by another in close proximity when as v release is well controlled a binary adsorbent system could be engineered by mixing one fast uptake adsorbent with the other with a higher adsorption capacity in column runs the crossover of as v breakthrough curves fig 5a suggested that the solid phase concentrations were altered due to potential redistribution of as v during pump off periods for any adsorption columns operated for households rapid as v uptake is essential to cope with a short ebct e g 32 seconds möller et al 2009 the shorter the ebct the sooner the breakthrough as in general the progression of the mass transfer zone is irreversible with water flow while for those time periods when the household scale filtration column is on standby the as v re equilibrium might re shape the mass transfer zone as the adsorbent with a higher capacity but slower kinetics could regenerate the fast adsorbing one in situ the mre phenomenon examined here may also be applicable to the removal of other contaminants such as phosphate due to similar interactions for adsorbing it on iron based materials last but not least since cost benefit is not studied the efficacy of mre process in practice needs to be further analyzed especially when effluent concentrations are lower than those of this study life cycle assessment of the pros and cons of mre based in situ adsorbent regeneration will be important in comparing the binary adsorbent system with the conventional process configuration declaration of competing interest the authors

17263,eutrophication and metal pollution are global environmental problems the risk of metal pollution is high in the eutrophic lakes because of high mobility of metal in sediments however the mechanism of cadmium cd mobility in sediments is still unclear here we study the mobilization of cd in sediments from the eutrophic lake taihu via monthly field monitoring of mobile cd using diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and high resolution dialysis hr peeper techniques we found a high mobility of cd in sediments in february and march resulting from reductive dissolution of mn oxide mediation by high microbial activities as shown by the similarities in distribution patterns of dgt labile cd and mn a two orders of magnitude increase in dissolved cd concentrations about 28 μg l 1 was observed in may and june with dissolved cd concentrations in overlying water about 110 times higher than the criteria continuous concentration set by environmental protection agency hourly changes were found to coincide and correlate between dissolved cd and dissolved organic matter dom under simulated anaerobic conditions strongly suggesting that the sudden outbreak of cd pollution observed in the field resulted from the complexation of dom with cd in sediments this was further supported by the nica donnan model that more than 71 of dissolved cd in the pore water in may and june was present as cd dom complexes three components of dom including humic tryptophan and tyrosine like components in the sediments in june was identified using the fluorescence excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis we found that cd was stable complexed with tyrosine like component the fourier transform infrared and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy further revealed that cd was bound to phenolic oh alkene cc alcoholic co aromatic ch and alkene ch groups our study effectively promotes the understanding of cd mobilization in sediments and highlights the risk of sudden cd pollution events in the eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication dissolved organic matter cadmium pollution high resolution sampling spatio temporal analysis 1 introduction cadmium cd is an environmental pollutant ranked eighth in the top 20 hazardous substances priority list atsdr 1999 due to its high toxicity and slow rate of metabolism zhang et al 2020 lakes are an important global source of freshwater and cd pollution of waterbodies is an increasing problem due to the development of industry agriculture and other human activities gao et al 2016 harikumar et al 2009 cadmium pollution in lakes represents a serious threat to water quality drinking water supplies food chain and freshwater ecosystems sediments have been reported to serve as both a sink and source for cd in waterbodies some environmental factors such as the redox state ph and concentration of acid volatile sulfide avs fe mn and dissolved organic matter dom can influence the mobility of cd in sediments banks et al 2012a du et al 2009 a decrease in ph can lead to the dissolution of cd from solid phase and resultantly increase the concentration of dissolved cd in sediments ghavidel et al 2018 furthermore avs can be oxidized under aerobic conditions resulting in a 5 fold increase in labile cd in surface sediments de et al 2012a b in contrast a decrease in sediment redox state can cause the reduction of dissolved cd due to the sulfide precipitation banks et al 2012b simpson et al 2000 some contrasting phenomena in sediments under redox state transition had been previously reported for example the concentration of cd decreased under the aerobic conditions because of the adsorption or co precipitation by fe mn oxides he et al 2017 while those under the anaerobic conditions exhibited two times higher in the surface sediment layer due to the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides banks et al 2012a dom plays a critical role in the biogeochemical cycling of cd aiken et al 2011 complexation with dom could increase the solubility and mobility of cd in sediments li et al 2013 wong et al 2007 to date it remains unclear which of these mechanisms are responsible for controlling the mobility of cd in sediments when subjected to temporally and spatially variable conditions lake eutrophication and the associated algal blooms significantly affects the biogeochemical environment of sediments chen et al 2018 ding et al 2018 changes in these factors may significantly affect the mobility of cd in sediments and therefore its concentration in the water column the previous microcosm studies reported that algal growth resulted in a decrease of acid dissolved cd from 25 25 to 18 95 of total cd and reducible cd from 22 41 to 16 52 of total cd in sediments ni et al 2016 however other study found that the formation outbreak and extinction of algal bloom had only a minor effect on the fractionation of cd in sediments with the reducible and acid dissolved cd displaying similar changes in the presence or absence of algal blooms wang et al 2015 these non consistent findings highlighted the current limitations of holistic understanding of cd mobility in sediments of eutrophic lakes in order to understand the mechanisms for cd mobilization in sediments of eutrophic lakes a yearlong assessment of the variation of mobile cd in eutrophic lake taihu was performed in this study based on high resolution spatiotemporal sampling incubation experiment simulating field condition was performed to investigate the effects of redox state on the mobility of cd in sediments the fluorescence quenching titration experiment was performed to explore the interaction of cd with dom regarding binding components binding sites and binding sequencing finally the underlying mechanisms controlling cd mobility in sediments of eutrophic lakes are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake description and sampling site lake taihu located in the

2 field investigation the high resolution dialysis hr peeper and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were used for measurement of dissolved cd dgt labile cd zro chelex dgt and dgt labile s ii agi dgt in sediment respectively they were provided by easysensor ltd www easysensor net principles of the hr peeper and dgt probes are provided in supporting information three sediments cores 9 cm in diameter 30 cm in length were collected each month from the sampling site from february 2016 to january 2017 the depths of sediments in each core were adjusted on site to about 20 cm and post collection the cores were transported to the laboratory within 3 h three cores were put into a tank and incubated for 2 3 days for deployment of the hr peeper and dgt probes firstly the hr peeper probe was inserted into one of the cores and deployed for 24 h then following this the dgt probe was inserted into the same core and they were both incubated for a further 24 h the temperature in the tank was maintained at the same level as measured in the field using a circulating water bath 2 3 aerobic anaerobic incubation experiments for aerobic anaerobic incubation experiments three sediments

were incubated under anaerobic conditions with n2 addition at a flow rate of 0 4 l min 1 for 376 h 2 4 titration experiments the dom fraction in mlw sediment sampled on june 2016 was extracted using deionized water solid vs water ratio of 1 10 w v by shaking the samples for 24 hrs on a horizontal shaker at 25 c the samples were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min with the supernatant filteration using 0 45 µm ptfe membranes xingya purification materials co shanghai china prior to titration experiments the dom solution was diluted to a low doc concentration of about 10 mg l to minimize the inner filtering effects wu et al 2012 the titration experiments were implemented by adding 0 1 mol l cd ii solution to a series of 100 ml amber vials that contained 50 ml of the dom solution the concentrations of cd in the vials ranged from 0 to 240 μmol l by the addition of 0 120 μl cd ii solution the solution samples after cd addition were shaken for 24 h at 25 c to ensure complexation equilibrium about 10 ml of each titrated solution was collected for fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy analysis with the rest frozed dried for the fourier transform

collected from each chamber of probe devices using a pipette samples were diluted using 3 hno3 to a volume of 3 ml for determination of dissolved cd for analysis of dgt samples zro chelex binding gels were vertically sliced into 4 mm sections using a cutter made by stacking ceramic blades each slice was transferred into a centrifuge tube and combined with 400 μl of 1 0 m hno3 solution for elution of cd within the binding gel the concentration of cd was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 300 perkin elmer agi binding gels were scanned using a flat bed scanner canon 5600f with images analyzed for grayscale intensity using imagej 1 41 software the accumulation masses of s ii were calculated according to previous study ding et al 2012 the doc concentration of the overlying water was analyzed on a shimadzu toc 5050 analyzer for aerobic anaerobic experiments about 1 ml of samples of pore water was obtained from sediments at the depth of 10 mm using rhizon samplers which were pre loaded into sediments cores in the control aerobic and anaerobic treatments for a 4 h period two dimensional oxygen distributions and dynamics in simulated aerobic anaerobic sediments were monitored using the oxygen planar optodes po preparation according to a previous study zhu 2019 the concentration of dissolved fe was analyzed immediately post sampling using the phenanthroline colorimetric method while dissolved mn and cd were analyzed by icp ms the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 were analyzed using the epoch microplate spectrophotometer to

of 600 4000 cm 1 2 6 data treatment and statistical analysis the flux of dgt labile s ii and the concentrations of dgt labile cd in the sediment water profile were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2

represents the thickness of the diffusive layer and d represents the diffusion coefficient of cd in the agarose diffusive layer the concentration of oxygen measurement by po technology was calculated according to eq 3 larsen et al 2011 3 c r 0 r ksv r r 0 α where c is the concentration of oxygen r and r 0 are the fluorescence intensity ratios with and without oxygen respectively ksv is the stern volmer quenching constant and α is the non quenchable fraction of the fluorescence signal parallel factor parafac analysis was used to identify the fluorescent components of dom samples bro 1997 he and hur 2015 murphy et al 2010 stedmon and bro 2008 zepp et al 2004 the chemical speciation of cd in pore water was calculated using the minteq 3 1 software published by jon petter gustafsson the nica donnan model in the software was selected to analyze the complexation with dom the two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis was performed using 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan to reveal the binding extents and sequences of cd and dom groups through the application of synchronous and asynchronous maps statistical analysis was performed using spss v20 0 software the correlations between each pair of two variables were analyzed using the pearson correlation coefficient 3 results 3 1 monthly changes in mobile cd and other factors in the field monthly distributions of dissolved cd and dgt labile cd concentrations in sediments water profiles from february 2016 to january 2017 are shown in fig 1 it is of note that a sharp increase in the dissolved cd concentration was observed in may and june 2016 with 6 82 and 6 85 fold increases in mean concentrations respectively in the 0 to 100 mm layer as compared to the mean values for the other ten months the highest mean concentration of dgt labile cd was observed in february with 2 56 fold greater concentrations than the mean established for the other ten months followed by march with 1 90 fold greater concentrations in the 0 to 100 mm layer respectively similar distribution patterns were observed for dgt labile cd and mn in the sediment layers especially below depths of 28 mm fig s2 this phenomenon was more visible in fig s3 in the presence of selected dgt labile cd fe mn profiles in each month in which concentration peaks or valleys of dgt labile cd and mn appeared at the same depths in sediments in a total of 8 months statistical analysis showed a significantly positive correlation r 0 471 p 0 05 between dgt labile cd and mn concentrations at depths from 28 to 100 mm for all sampling times a significant positive correlation r 0 501 p 0 05 was also observed between dgt labile cd and fe concentrations at sediment depths of 28 to 100 mm from april to august 2016 and in january 2017 different from dissolved fe and mn no significant fluctuation was observed in the distribution of dissolved cd concentrations at sediment depths from 8 to 100 mm fig s4 correlation analysis indicated that dissolved cd exhibited only a positive correlation with dissolved mn or fe in june and september at depths from 28 to 100 mm table s1 two dimensional distribution of dgt labile s ii concentrations in sediments reflected by dgt flux are shown in fig 2 in march and november 2016 and january 2017 throughout the whole sediment core profile the mean values of dgt labile s ii were lower at 10 pg cm 2 s 1 9 pg cm 1 s 1 and 6 pg cm 1 s 1 respectively however the mean fluxes of dgt labile s ii in the whole sediment core profile significantly increased in july and september to 30 pg cm 1 s 1 and 35 pg cm 1 s 1 respectively 3 2 hourly changes in dissolved cd and other factors in simulated aerobic anaerobic experiments the saturation of oxygen significantly increased to 100 from 5 mm sediments to the overlying water under aerobic condition fig 3 a during the anaerobic incubation periods the saturation of oxygen significantly decreased to 0 in both the overlying water and sediments hourly changes of the concentrations of dissolved cd mn fe and uv254 in the pore water under aerobic anaerobic incubation are shown in fig 3b the concentration of dissolved cd remained constant with a mean value of 0 07 μg l 1 in the control treatment and exhibited a slight increase to about 0 13 μg l 1 during the aerobic incubation period in the anaerobic treatment however it increased to 0 60 μg l 1 during the initial 420 h but then substantially increased to 53 24 μg l 1 at 423 h a cd concentration reduction was observed at 440 5 h then pore water concentrations remained steady until 489 h which was followed by a sharp decrease to a value of 5 80 μg l 1 at 496 h then remaining steady until 576 h compared with the control treatment the concentrations of dissolved cd increased by 79 in the aerobic treatment but 17 807 in the anaerobic treatment table s2 as compared to the aerobic treatment the uv254 values under the anaerobic conditions decreased in the initial 420 h but increased sharply between 420 and 489 h followed by a gradual decrease until 576 h uv254 values showed similar trends in comparison with dissolved cd in the anaerobic treatment fig 3b as reflected by the significant positive correlation between the two factors table s3 however the similar pattern in variation and significant positive correlation were not observed between dissolved cd and mn or fe in the anaerobic conditions fig 3b 3 3 the complexation properties of cd with dom three components of dom were identified in mlw sediment sampled on june 2016 based on the eem parafac analysis fig s5 the fluorescence intensities of humic like component 1 and tryptophan like component 2 fluctuated with increasing cd ii concentrations fig 4 a while those of tyrosine like component 3 significantly decreased this indicated that a stable complex of tyrosine like component may be formed with cd ii to quantitatively confirm the interpretation of the fluorescence quenching results the binding parameters of cd ii with three different components were calculated using the modified stern volmer equation the conditional stability constants log k m values in the humic like and tryptophan like components responding to cd ii addition can t be calculated because of the low correlation coefficient in the fitting curve r 0 009 p 0 05 however the correlation coefficient in the fitting curve r 0 874 p 0 001 was relatively high in the tyrosine like component responding to cd ii addition and the calculating log k m value was 4 883 fig 4b these results supported our previous interpretation with fluorescence quenching results the changes in ftir spectra with the addition of cd ii are shown in fig 4c all of the dom backbone vibrations occurred in the range of 650 cm 1 2000 cm 1 the changes in the dom spectral trends were amplified in the differential ftir absorbance spectra in which each of the spectra was subtracted from the spectrum with no cd ii addition fig 4d it can be seen that the vibrations of the ftir bands occurred mainly at 1110 cm 1 1350 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 with increasing cd ii concentrations the one dimensional ftir spectra failed to give the accurate binding characteristics of dom to cd ii in detail because of the strong overlapping absorbance features of the diverse groups in dom therefore 2d cos has been used to facilitate the deconvolution of overlapping peaks through enhancing the spectral resolution by spreading the spectrum to a second dimension the synchronous map for 2d cos shows five predominant auto peaks which center at 666 987 1110 1350 and 1620 cm 1 respectively fig 4e the asynchronous map and signs of the cross peaks are shown in fig 4f and table s4 according to noda s rule noda 2012 supporting information it can be concluded that the structural change sequence of the dom backbones with cd ii binding was in the order 1350 1620 1110 666 987 cm 1 4 discussion 4 1 overall assessment of cd mobility in sediment on fine scale previous studies have revealed that the ecological risk of metal metalloid pollution mainly by cd cr as ni pb and cu is high in surface sediments in taihu lake ma et al 2013 tao et al 2012 with this risk being greatest in the northern and western regions including meiliang bay jiang et al 2012 rajeshkumar et al 2018 observed that metal metalloid concentrations in meiliang bay sediments were higher in winter and summer seasons than that in spring and autumn seasons these assessments have been mostly based on total metal concentrations in sediments with little information available on cd mobility in sediments especially in monthly change the present study uses high resolution passive sampling techniques to monitor the monthly changes in mobile cd in sediments in the field a sharp increase in dissolved cd concentrations were observed in pore water and overlying water in may and june to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of this abnormal phenomenon serious cd pollution levels in overlying water occurred in may and june with concentrations greater than the different national and international guidelines table 1 the dissolved cd concentrations in overlying water in may and june were 109 92 fold and 113 12 fold the criteria continuous concentration ccc and 13 74 and 14 14 fold the criteria maximum concentration cmc for cd in freshwater set by environmental protection agency epa in addition levels were 9 16 and 9 43 fold higher than the drinking water quality standards for cd set by the world health organization who this sudden pollution of cd in bottom water is consistent with previous reports about the 1 26 to 1 85 fold increase of cd concentration in the water column of meiliang bay in summer months in comparison with other seasons rajeshkumar et al 2018 zeng et al 2012 this finding demonstrates that the release of cd from sediments should be a key factor affecting the level of cd pollution in the water column according to previous studies it was found that more than 90 of cd was bound to suspended particles and sediments in aquatic systems calmano et al 1993 zhang et al 2008 and cd in sediments can be mobilized by biochemical progresses causing water pollution violintzis et al 2009 olivares rieumont et al 2005 further support this conclusion 4 2 the mechanisms of cd mobilization immobilization in sediments monthly changes in dissolved and dgt labile cd concentrations could be divided into three periods a holistic and schematic interpretation for the cd mobilization immobilization in the eutrophic lake is shown in fig 5 late winter and early spring similarities vertical fluctuation figs s2 and s3 and significant correlation table s1 were observed between dgt labile cd and mn during this period the similarities in fluctuation reflect a concomitant release of cd and mn due to the reductive dissolution of mn oxide in sediments according to the principle of dgt measurement ding et al 2016 verifying that the mobility of cd was controlled by the mn redox cycle previous studies have recognized that cd could be adsorbed by fe and mn oxides then released in the reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides banks et al 2012a du et al 2009 he et al 2017 but it was hard to confirm whether the individual oxide or the two oxides together absorbing or releasing cd privous study observed the selective enrichment of cd in mn oxide in sediments containing distinct fe and mn oxides layers muller et al 2002 this study providing further evidence of the widespread control of cd mobility by mn redox cycling in natural sediments without distinct fe and mn oxides layers in comparison with fe oxide mn oxide has a larger specific surface area and higher affinity for cd which allows the formation of strong surface complexes between cd and mn oxides fan and anderson 2005 muller et al 2002 furthermore the high phosphorus concentration in mlw the strong association of phosphorus with fe might decrease the adsorption properties of fe for cd ding et al 2016 in march the highest bacterial abundance 1 14e 12 copies g 1 was observed in sediments fig s1 the microbial activities could mediate the reduction process of fe and mn oxides ding et al 2018 gadd 2010 therefore enhanced microbial reduction for mn oxide resulted in the release of cd which increased the dissolved and dgt labile cd in sediments in february and march in april the microbial reduction of mn oxide is significantly reduced due to the sharp decrease in bacterial abundance 2 49e 11 copies g 1 fig s1 ding et al 2018 a fraction of dissolved mn is likely to be reoxidized to absorb cd which resulted in the decrease in dissolved and dgt labile cd late spring and early summer increases in dissolved cd concentrations by two and three orders of magnitude were observed in the field sediments figs 1 and s4 and under anaerobic incubation fig 3b respectively it is of note that in both cases the increases were greater than those reported in previous studies about 2 fold due to reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides banks et al 2012a in the present study the opd sharply decreased in may and june compared to february and april 2016 fig s1 under anaerobic conditions the dom which was mainly bound with fe iii minerals lalonde et al 2012 should be released with the reduction of fe iii chin et al 1998 this was supported by the significant increase in dissolved fe and dom concentrations in may and june figs s1 and s4 the increase of dom created favorable conditions for the formation of cd dom complexes the positive correlation observed between dissolved cd concentration and uv254 along with their simultaneous rapid increase from 423 to 489 h fig 3b under anaerobic incubation fig 3a strongly suggests that the increase in dissolved cd may result from dom complexation this was further supported by the nica donnan model that more than 71 of dissolved cd in the pore water in may and june was present as cd dom complexes table 2 similarly previous studies found that the cd dom complex would be the dominant cd species in sediments representing 57 93 of the total aqueous cd concentration gardner et al 2007 krishnamurti and naidu 2003 dom was comprised of low molecular weight organic acids carbohydrates proteins humic acids fulvic acids and other compounds mainly originated from soils through rain run off and the degradation of algae in eutrophic lakes pivokonsky et al 2014 xu et al 2018 three components of dom including humic tryptophan and tyrosine like components were identified from mlw sediments sampling in june using the eem parafac analysis fig s5 similar components were identified in the previous study in sediments of lake taihu hu et al 2019 the quenching in fluorescent intensities of tyrosine like component was observed with increasing cd ii concentrations fig 4a this indicated that cd was stable complexed with tyrosine like component xu et al 2013 this was supported by the relatively high log k m value for tyrosine like component responding to cd ii addition fig 4b in addition previous studies had found that cd could be bound in phenol carboxyl thiol and amine groups in doms guo et al 2012 weng et al 2002 this study found that five groups in the tyrosine like component namely aromatic ch 666 cm 1 alkene ch 987 cm 1 alcoholic co 1110 cm 1 phenolic oh 1350 cm 1 and alkene cc 1620 cm 1 responded to the binding of cd according to the results of the ftir and the 2d cos mapping fig 4c e the binding sequence was phenolic oh groups alkene cc groups alcoholic co groups aromatic ch groups alkene ch groups fig 4f and table s4 previous studies cognized that dom played a key role in the mobilization and speciation of cd in the freshwater ecosystem aiken et al 2011 gardner et al 2007 however the extent of dom effects on cd mobilization in sediments in the field conditions is still unclear this study provides strong evidence of a sudden outbreak of cd pollution from sediments in a eutrophic lake through tyrosine like component complexation late summer to early winter a sharp fall in dissolved cd concentrations were observed in sediments in july fig 1 and s4 with the onset of cyanobacteria dominant algal blooms formation fig s1 cd could be strongly absorbed by microcystis 0 46 2 19 mg kg 1 algal dry weight a dominant species of cyanobacteria in lake taihu jia et al 2018 the cyanobacterial cell walls bear functional groups such as polysaccharide carboxyl groups which provided biosorptive sites for the complexation ionic exchange and precipitation of metals kumar and gaur 2011 consequently the sharp reduction in dissolved cd concentrations observed in july may be primarily attributed to algal bioaccumulation at depths from 28 to 100 mm a significant positive correlation table s1 and similar pattern of vertical distribution was observed between dgt labile cd and mn in sediment profiles from august 2016 to january 2017 figs s2 and s3 reinforcing that the mobility of cd was controlled by mn redox however at depths from 0 to 28 mm no positive correlation was found between dgt labile cd and mn table s1 the concentration of dgt labile s ii in sediments was higher in september than that in november and march fig 2 according to previous studies high concentration of s ii in sediments can result in the precipitation of cd as cds frohne et al 2011 in comparison with other metals such as fe and mn s ii could preferentially precipitate cd due to the low solubility of cds 8 0 10 27 this finding infers that the significant decrease observed in dissolved and dgt labile cd concentrations in sediments at depths from 0 to 28 mm in august and september resulted from cd precipitation with s ii from october 2016 to january 2017 the concentration of dissolved and dgt labile cd increased in sediments at depths of 0 mm to 28 mm fig 1 s2 s4 during this time sediments were under aerobic conditions with high do in overlying water high eh and opd values fig s1 ding et al 2018 oxidation of s ii should occur under these conditions in surface sediments resulting in the release of cd due to the dissolution of cds precipitates kelderman and osman 2007 according to previous studies the concentration of dissolved cd can be enhanced up to 5 fold following a 54 day oxidation phase in sulfide rich sediments de et al 2012a b implications eutrophication conditions significantly increased the mobilization of cd from sediments as supported by the sharp increase in dissolved cd in may and june as algae dominated eutrophic lakes have typical features of anaerobic conditions and high dom concentrations in sediments the observed sudden release of cd from sediments may occur widely in eutrophic lakes and other aquatic systems with similar bottom environment the release of cd from sediments will further deteriorate water quality and induce toxicity in benthic organisms and human health through biomagnification this scenario may be more serious in shallow water regions due to the limited dilution effect field monitoring and short term emergency treatments are required to control sudden cd pollution events however wider control of water eutrophication through altering redox conditions and decreasing dom production may result in the long term stability of cd in sediments it is urgent for relative government sectors to develop an overall strategy in this aspect 5 conclusions a yearlong monitoring in meiliang bay showed that the mobility of cd in sediments varied greatly and significantly affected the pollution level of cd in the overlying water the high mobility of cd in sediments observed in february and march resulted from reductive dissolution of mn oxide which was verified by the similarities in distribution patterns of dgt labile cd and mn a two orders of magnitude increase in dissolved cd concentrations observed in may and june have caused serious pollution

17263,eutrophication and metal pollution are global environmental problems the risk of metal pollution is high in the eutrophic lakes because of high mobility of metal in sediments however the mechanism of cadmium cd mobility in sediments is still unclear here we study the mobilization of cd in sediments from the eutrophic lake taihu via monthly field monitoring of mobile cd using diffusive gradient in thin films dgt and high resolution dialysis hr peeper techniques we found a high mobility of cd in sediments in february and march resulting from reductive dissolution of mn oxide mediation by high microbial activities as shown by the similarities in distribution patterns of dgt labile cd and mn a two orders of magnitude increase in dissolved cd concentrations about 28 μg l 1 was observed in may and june with dissolved cd concentrations in overlying water about 110 times higher than the criteria continuous concentration set by environmental protection agency hourly changes were found to coincide and correlate between dissolved cd and dissolved organic matter dom under simulated anaerobic conditions strongly suggesting that the sudden outbreak of cd pollution observed in the field resulted from the complexation of dom with cd in sediments this was further supported by the nica donnan model that more than 71 of dissolved cd in the pore water in may and june was present as cd dom complexes three components of dom including humic tryptophan and tyrosine like components in the sediments in june was identified using the fluorescence excitation emission matrix parallel factor analysis we found that cd was stable complexed with tyrosine like component the fourier transform infrared and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy further revealed that cd was bound to phenolic oh alkene cc alcoholic co aromatic ch and alkene ch groups our study effectively promotes the understanding of cd mobilization in sediments and highlights the risk of sudden cd pollution events in the eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication dissolved organic matter cadmium pollution high resolution sampling spatio temporal analysis 1 introduction cadmium cd is an environmental pollutant ranked eighth in the top 20 hazardous substances priority list atsdr 1999 due to its high toxicity and slow rate of metabolism zhang et al 2020 lakes are an important global source of freshwater and cd pollution of waterbodies is an increasing problem due to the development of industry agriculture and other human activities gao et al 2016 harikumar et al 2009 cadmium pollution in lakes represents a serious threat to water quality drinking water supplies food chain and freshwater ecosystems sediments have been reported to serve as both a sink and source for cd in waterbodies some environmental factors such as the redox state ph and concentration of acid volatile sulfide avs fe mn and dissolved organic matter dom can influence the mobility of cd in sediments banks et al 2012a du et al 2009 a decrease in ph can lead to the dissolution of cd from solid phase and resultantly increase the concentration of dissolved cd in sediments ghavidel et al 2018 furthermore avs can be oxidized under aerobic conditions resulting in a 5 fold increase in labile cd in surface sediments de et al 2012a b in contrast a decrease in sediment redox state can cause the reduction of dissolved cd due to the sulfide precipitation banks et al 2012b simpson et al 2000 some contrasting phenomena in sediments under redox state transition had been previously reported for example the concentration of cd decreased under the aerobic conditions because of the adsorption or co precipitation by fe mn oxides he et al 2017 while those under the anaerobic conditions exhibited two times higher in the surface sediment layer due to the reductive dissolution of fe mn oxides banks et al 2012a dom plays a critical role in the biogeochemical cycling of cd aiken et al 2011 complexation with dom could increase the solubility and mobility of cd in sediments li et al 2013 wong et al 2007 to date it remains unclear which of these mechanisms are responsible for controlling the mobility of cd in sediments when subjected to temporally and spatially variable conditions lake eutrophication and the associated algal blooms significantly affects the biogeochemical environment of sediments chen et al 2018 ding et al 2018 changes in these factors may significantly affect the mobility of cd in sediments and therefore its concentration in the water column the previous microcosm studies reported that algal growth resulted in a decrease of acid dissolved cd from 25 25 to 18 95 of total cd and reducible cd from 22 41 to 16 52 of total cd in sediments ni et al 2016 however other study found that the formation outbreak and extinction of algal bloom had only a minor effect on the fractionation of cd in sediments with the reducible and acid dissolved cd displaying similar changes in the presence or absence of algal blooms wang et al 2015 these non consistent findings highlighted the current limitations of holistic understanding of cd mobility in sediments of eutrophic lakes in order to understand the mechanisms for cd mobilization in sediments of eutrophic lakes a yearlong assessment of the variation of mobile cd in eutrophic lake taihu was performed in this study based on high resolution spatiotemporal sampling incubation experiment simulating field condition was performed to investigate the effects of redox state on the mobility of cd in sediments the fluorescence quenching titration experiment was performed to explore the interaction of cd with dom regarding binding components binding sites and binding sequencing finally the underlying mechanisms controlling cd mobility in sediments of eutrophic lakes are discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake description and sampling site lake taihu located in the

2 field investigation the high resolution dialysis hr peeper and diffusive gradients in thin films dgt were used for measurement of dissolved cd dgt labile cd zro chelex dgt and dgt labile s ii agi dgt in sediment respectively they were provided by easysensor ltd www easysensor net principles of the hr peeper and dgt probes are provided in supporting information three sediments cores 9 cm in diameter 30 cm in length were collected each month from the sampling site from february 2016 to january 2017 the depths of sediments in each core were adjusted on site to about 20 cm and post collection the cores were transported to the laboratory within 3 h three cores were put into a tank and incubated for 2 3 days for deployment of the hr peeper and dgt probes firstly the hr peeper probe was inserted into one of the cores and deployed for 24 h then following this the dgt probe was inserted into the same core and they were both incubated for a further 24 h the temperature in the

were incubated under anaerobic conditions with n2 addition at a flow rate of 0 4 l min 1 for 376 h 2 4 titration experiments the dom fraction in mlw sediment sampled on june 2016 was extracted using deionized water solid vs water ratio of 1 10 w v by shaking the samples for 24 hrs on a horizontal shaker at 25 c the samples were then centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min with the supernatant filteration using 0 45 µm ptfe membranes xingya purification materials co shanghai china prior to titration experiments the dom solution was diluted to a low doc concentration of about 10 mg l to minimize the inner filtering effects wu et al 2012 the titration experiments were implemented by adding 0 1 mol l cd ii solution to a series of 100 ml amber vials that contained 50 ml of the dom solution the concentrations of cd in the vials ranged from 0 to 240 μmol l by the addition of 0 120 μl cd ii solution the solution samples after cd addition were shaken for 24 h at 25 c to ensure complexation equilibrium about 10 ml of each titrated solution was collected for fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectroscopy analysis with the rest frozed dried for the fourier transform

were vertically sliced into 4 mm sections using a cutter made by stacking ceramic blades each slice was transferred into a centrifuge tube and combined with 400 μl of 1 0 m hno3 solution for elution of cd within the binding gel the concentration of cd was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 300 perkin elmer agi binding gels were scanned using a flat bed scanner canon 5600f with images analyzed for grayscale intensity using imagej 1 41 software the accumulation masses of s ii were calculated according to previous study ding et al 2012 the doc concentration of the overlying water was analyzed on a shimadzu toc 5050 analyzer for aerobic anaerobic experiments about 1 ml of samples of pore water was obtained from sediments at the depth of 10 mm using rhizon samplers which were pre loaded into sediments cores in the control aerobic and anaerobic treatments for a 4 h period two dimensional oxygen distributions and dynamics in simulated aerobic anaerobic sediments were monitored using the oxygen planar optodes po preparation according to a previous study zhu 2019 the concentration of dissolved fe was analyzed immediately post sampling using the phenanthroline colorimetric method while dissolved mn and cd were analyzed by icp ms the specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm uv254 were analyzed using the epoch microplate spectrophotometer to

and hur 2015 murphy et al 2010 stedmon and bro 2008 zepp et al 2004 the chemical speciation of cd in pore water was calculated using the minteq 3 1 software published by jon petter gustafsson the nica donnan model in the software was selected to analyze the complexation with dom the two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analysis was performed using 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan to reveal the binding extents and sequences of cd and dom groups through the application of synchronous and asynchronous maps statistical analysis was performed using spss v20 0 software the correlations between each pair of two variables were analyzed using the pearson correlation coefficient 3 results 3 1 monthly changes in mobile cd and other factors in the field monthly distributions of dissolved cd and dgt labile cd concentrations in sediments water profiles from february 2016 to january 2017 are shown in fig 1 it is of note that a sharp increase in the dissolved cd concentration was observed in may and june 2016 with 6 82 and 6 85 fold increases in mean concentrations respectively in the 0 to 100 mm layer as compared to the mean values for the other ten months the highest mean concentration of dgt labile cd was observed in february with 2 56 fold greater concentrations than the mean established for the other ten months followed by march with 1 90 fold greater concentrations in the 0 to 100 mm layer respectively similar distribution patterns were observed for dgt labile cd and mn in the sediment layers especially below depths of 28 mm fig s2 this phenomenon was more visible in fig s3 in the presence of selected dgt labile cd fe mn profiles in each month in which concentration peaks or valleys of dgt labile cd and mn appeared at the same depths in sediments in a total of 8 months statistical analysis showed a significantly positive correlation r 0 471 p 0 05 between dgt labile cd and mn concentrations at depths from 28 to 100 mm for all sampling times a significant positive correlation r 0 501 p 0 05 was also observed between dgt labile cd and fe concentrations at sediment depths of 28 to 100 mm from april to august 2016 and in january 2017 different from dissolved fe and mn no significant fluctuation was observed in the distribution of dissolved cd concentrations at sediment depths from 8 to 100 mm fig s4 correlation analysis indicated that dissolved cd exhibited only a positive correlation with dissolved mn or fe in june and september at depths from 28 to 100 mm table s1 two dimensional distribution of dgt labile s ii concentrations in sediments reflected by dgt flux are shown in fig 2 in march and november 2016 and january 2017 throughout the whole sediment core profile the mean values of dgt labile s ii were lower at 10 pg cm 2 s 1 9 pg cm 1 s 1 and 6 pg cm 1 s 1 respectively however the mean fluxes of dgt labile s ii in the whole sediment core profile significantly increased in july and september to 30 pg cm 1 s 1 and 35 pg cm 1 s 1 respectively 3 2 hourly changes in dissolved cd and other factors in simulated aerobic anaerobic experiments the saturation of oxygen significantly increased to 100 from 5 mm sediments to the overlying water under aerobic condition fig 3 a during the anaerobic incubation periods the saturation of oxygen significantly decreased to 0 in both the overlying water and sediments hourly changes of the concentrations of dissolved cd mn fe and uv254 in the pore water under aerobic anaerobic incubation are shown in fig 3b the concentration of dissolved cd remained constant with a mean value of 0 07 μg l 1 in the control treatment and exhibited a slight increase to about 0 13 μg l 1 during the aerobic incubation period in the anaerobic treatment however it increased to 0 60 μg l 1 during the initial 420 h but then substantially increased to 53 24 μg l 1 at 423 h a cd concentration reduction was observed at 440 5 h then pore water concentrations remained steady until 489 h which was followed by a sharp decrease to a value of 5 80 μg l 1 at 496 h then remaining steady until 576 h compared with the control treatment the concentrations of dissolved cd increased by 79 in the aerobic treatment but 17 807 in the anaerobic treatment table s2 as compared to the aerobic treatment the uv254 values under the anaerobic conditions decreased in the initial 420 h but increased sharply between 420 and 489 h followed by a gradual decrease until 576 h uv254 values showed similar trends in comparison with dissolved cd in the anaerobic treatment fig 3b as reflected by the significant positive correlation between the two factors table s3 however the similar pattern in variation and significant positive correlation were not observed between dissolved cd and mn or fe in the anaerobic conditions fig 3b 3 3 the complexation properties of cd with dom three components of dom were identified in mlw sediment sampled on june 2016 based on the eem parafac analysis fig s5 the fluorescence intensities of humic like component 1 and tryptophan like component 2 fluctuated with increasing cd ii concentrations fig 4 a while those of tyrosine like component 3 significantly decreased this indicated that a stable complex of tyrosine like component may be formed with cd ii to quantitatively confirm the interpretation of the fluorescence quenching results the binding parameters of cd ii with three different components were calculated using the modified stern volmer equation the conditional stability constants log k m values in the humic like and tryptophan like components responding to cd ii addition can t be calculated because of the low correlation coefficient in the fitting curve r 0 009 p 0 05 however the correlation coefficient in the fitting curve r 0 874 p 0 001 was relatively high in the tyrosine like component responding to cd ii addition and the calculating log k m value was 4 883 fig 4b these results supported our previous interpretation with fluorescence quenching results the changes in ftir spectra with the addition of cd ii are shown in fig 4c all of the dom backbone vibrations occurred in the range of 650 cm 1 2000 cm 1 the changes in the dom spectral trends were amplified in the differential ftir absorbance spectra in which each of the spectra was subtracted from the spectrum with no cd ii addition fig 4d it can be seen that the vibrations of the ftir bands occurred mainly at 1110 cm 1 1350 cm 1 and 1620 cm 1 with increasing cd ii concentrations the one dimensional ftir spectra failed to give the accurate binding characteristics of dom to cd ii in detail because of the strong overlapping absorbance features of the diverse groups in dom therefore 2d cos has been used to facilitate the deconvolution of overlapping peaks through enhancing the spectral resolution by spreading the spectrum to a second dimension the synchronous map for 2d cos shows five predominant auto peaks which center at 666 987 1110 1350 and 1620 cm 1 respectively fig 4e the asynchronous map and signs of the cross peaks are shown in fig 4f and table s4 according to noda s rule noda 2012 supporting information it can be concluded that the structural change sequence of the dom backbones with cd ii binding was in the order 1350 1620 1110 666 987 cm 1 4 discussion 4 1 overall assessment of cd mobility in sediment on fine scale previous studies have revealed that the ecological risk of metal metalloid pollution mainly by cd cr as ni pb and cu is high in surface sediments in taihu lake ma et al 2013 tao et al 2012 with this risk being greatest in the northern and western regions including meiliang bay jiang et al 2012 rajeshkumar et al 2018 observed that metal metalloid concentrations in meiliang bay sediments were higher in winter and summer seasons than that in spring and autumn seasons these assessments have been mostly based on total metal concentrations in sediments with little information available on cd mobility in sediments especially in monthly change the present study uses high resolution passive sampling techniques to monitor the monthly changes in mobile cd in sediments in the field a sharp increase in dissolved cd concentrations were observed in pore water and overlying water in may and june to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of this abnormal phenomenon serious cd pollution levels in overlying water occurred in may and june with concentrations greater than the different national and international guidelines table 1 the dissolved cd concentrations in overlying water in may and june were 109 92 fold and 113 12 fold the criteria continuous concentration ccc and 13 74 and 14 14 fold the criteria maximum concentration cmc for cd in freshwater set by environmental protection agency epa in addition levels were 9 16 and 9 43 fold higher than the drinking water quality standards for cd set by the world health organization who this sudden pollution of cd in bottom water is consistent with previous reports about the 1 26 to 1 85 fold increase of cd concentration in the water column of meiliang bay in summer months in comparison with other seasons rajeshkumar et al 2018 zeng et al 2012 this finding demonstrates that the release of cd from sediments should be a key factor affecting the level of cd pollution in the water column according to previous studies it was found that more than 90 of cd was bound to suspended particles and sediments in aquatic systems calmano et al 1993 zhang et al 2008 and cd in sediments can be mobilized by biochemical progresses causing water pollution violintzis et al 2009 olivares rieumont et al 2005 further support this conclusion 4 2 the mechanisms of cd mobilization immobilization in sediments monthly changes in dissolved and dgt labile cd concentrations could be divided into three periods a holistic and schematic interpretation for the cd mobilization immobilization in the eutrophic lake is shown in fig 5 late winter and early spring similarities vertical fluctuation figs s2 and s3 and significant correlation table s1 were observed between dgt labile cd and mn during this period the similarities in fluctuation reflect a concomitant release of cd and mn due to the reductive dissolution of mn oxide in sediments according to the principle of dgt measurement ding et al 2016 verifying that the mobility of cd was controlled by the mn redox cycle previous studies have recognized that cd could be adsorbed by fe and mn oxides then released in the reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides banks et al 2012a du et al 2009 he et al 2017 but it was hard to confirm whether the individual oxide or the two oxides together absorbing or releasing cd privous study observed the selective enrichment of cd in mn oxide in sediments containing distinct fe and mn oxides layers muller et al 2002 this study providing further evidence of the widespread control of cd mobility by mn redox cycling in natural sediments without distinct fe and mn oxides layers in comparison with fe oxide mn oxide has a larger specific surface area and higher affinity for cd which allows the formation of strong surface complexes between cd and mn oxides fan and anderson 2005 muller et al 2002 furthermore the high phosphorus concentration in mlw the strong association of phosphorus with fe might decrease the adsorption properties of fe for cd ding et al 2016 in march the highest bacterial abundance 1 14e 12 copies g 1 was observed in sediments fig s1 the microbial activities could mediate the reduction process of fe and mn oxides ding et al 2018 gadd 2010 therefore enhanced microbial reduction for mn oxide resulted in the release of cd which increased the dissolved and dgt labile cd in sediments in february and march in april the microbial reduction of mn oxide is significantly reduced due to the sharp decrease in bacterial abundance 2 49e 11 copies g 1 fig s1 ding et al 2018 a fraction of dissolved mn is likely to be reoxidized to absorb cd which resulted in the decrease in dissolved and dgt labile cd late spring and early summer increases in dissolved cd concentrations by two and three orders of magnitude were observed in the field sediments figs 1 and s4 and under anaerobic incubation fig 3b respectively it is of note that in both cases the increases were greater than those reported in previous studies about 2 fold due to reductive dissolution of fe and mn oxides banks et al 2012a in the present study the opd sharply decreased in may and june compared to february and april 2016 fig s1 under anaerobic conditions the dom which was mainly bound with fe iii minerals lalonde et al 2012 should be released with the reduction of fe iii chin et al 1998 this was supported by the significant increase in dissolved fe and dom concentrations in may and june figs s1 and s4 the increase of dom created favorable conditions for the formation of cd dom complexes the positive correlation observed between dissolved cd concentration and uv254 along with their simultaneous rapid increase from 423 to 489 h fig 3b under anaerobic incubation fig 3a strongly suggests that the increase in dissolved cd may result from dom complexation this was further supported by the nica donnan model that more than 71 of dissolved cd in the pore water in may and june was present as cd dom complexes table 2 similarly previous studies found that the cd dom complex would be the dominant cd species in sediments representing 57 93 of the total aqueous cd concentration gardner et al 2007 krishnamurti and naidu 2003 dom was comprised of low molecular weight organic acids carbohydrates proteins humic acids fulvic acids and other compounds mainly originated from soils through rain run off and the degradation of algae in eutrophic lakes pivokonsky et al 2014 xu et al 2018 three components of dom including humic tryptophan and tyrosine like components were identified from mlw sediments sampling in june using the eem parafac analysis fig s5 similar components were identified in the previous study in sediments of lake taihu hu et al 2019 the quenching in fluorescent intensities of tyrosine like component was observed with increasing cd ii concentrations fig 4a this indicated that cd was stable complexed with tyrosine like component xu et al 2013 this was supported by the relatively high log k m value for tyrosine like component responding to cd ii addition fig 4b in addition previous studies had found that cd could be bound in phenol carboxyl thiol and amine groups in doms guo et al 2012 weng et al 2002 this study found that five groups in the tyrosine like component namely aromatic ch 666 cm 1 alkene ch 987 cm 1 alcoholic co 1110 cm 1 phenolic oh 1350 cm 1 and alkene cc 1620 cm 1 responded to the binding of cd according to the results of the ftir and the 2d cos mapping fig 4c e the binding sequence was phenolic oh groups alkene cc groups alcoholic co groups aromatic ch groups alkene ch groups fig 4f and table s4 previous studies cognized that dom played a key role in the mobilization and speciation of cd in the freshwater ecosystem aiken et al 2011 gardner et al 2007 however the extent of dom effects on cd mobilization in sediments in the field conditions is still unclear this study provides strong evidence of a sudden outbreak of cd pollution from sediments in a eutrophic lake through tyrosine like component complexation late summer to early winter a sharp fall in dissolved cd concentrations were observed in sediments in july fig 1 and s4 with the onset of cyanobacteria dominant algal blooms formation fig s1 cd could be strongly absorbed by microcystis 0 46 2 19 mg kg 1 algal dry weight a dominant species of cyanobacteria in lake taihu jia et al 2018 the cyanobacterial cell walls bear functional groups such as polysaccharide carboxyl groups which provided biosorptive sites for the complexation ionic exchange and precipitation of metals kumar and gaur 2011 consequently the sharp reduction in dissolved cd concentrations observed in july may be primarily attributed to algal bioaccumulation at depths from 28 to 100 mm a significant positive correlation table s1 and similar pattern of vertical distribution was observed between dgt labile cd and mn in sediment profiles from august 2016 to january 2017 figs s2 and s3 reinforcing that the mobility of cd was controlled by mn redox however at depths from 0 to 28 mm no positive correlation was found between dgt labile cd and mn table s1 the concentration of dgt labile s ii in sediments was higher in september than that in november and march fig 2 according to previous studies high concentration of s ii in sediments can result in the precipitation of cd as cds frohne et al 2011 in comparison with other metals such as fe and mn s ii could preferentially precipitate cd due to the low solubility of cds 8 0 10 27 this finding infers that the significant decrease observed in dissolved and dgt labile cd concentrations in sediments at depths from 0 to 28 mm in august and september resulted from cd precipitation with s ii from october 2016 to january 2017 the concentration of dissolved and dgt labile cd increased in sediments at depths of 0 mm to 28 mm fig 1 s2 s4 during this time sediments were under aerobic conditions with high do in overlying water high eh and opd values fig s1 ding et al 2018 oxidation of s ii should occur under these conditions in surface sediments resulting in the release of cd due to the dissolution of cds precipitates kelderman and osman 2007 according to previous studies the concentration of dissolved cd can be enhanced up to 5 fold following a 54 day oxidation phase in sulfide rich sediments de et al 2012a b implications eutrophication conditions significantly increased the mobilization of cd from sediments as supported by the sharp increase in dissolved cd in may and june as algae dominated eutrophic lakes have typical features of anaerobic conditions and high dom concentrations in sediments the observed sudden release of cd from sediments may occur widely in eutrophic lakes and other aquatic systems with similar bottom environment the release of cd from sediments will further deteriorate water quality and induce toxicity in benthic organisms and human health through biomagnification this scenario may be more serious in shallow water regions due to the limited dilution effect field monitoring and short term emergency treatments are required to control sudden cd pollution events however wider control of water eutrophication through altering redox conditions and decreasing dom production may result in the long term stability of cd in sediments it is urgent for relative government sectors to develop an overall strategy in this aspect 5 conclusions a yearlong monitoring in meiliang bay showed that the mobility of cd in sediments varied greatly and significantly affected the pollution level of cd in the overlying water the high mobility of cd in sediments observed in february and march resulted from reductive dissolution of mn oxide which was verified by the similarities in distribution patterns of dgt labile cd and mn a two orders of magnitude increase in dissolved cd concentrations observed in may and june have caused serious pollution of cd in the overlying water more than 71 of dissolved cd in the pore water in may and june was present as cd dom complexes calculating by the nica donnan model hourly changes were found to coincide and correlate between dissolved cd and dom under simulated anaerobic conditions these demonstrated that the sudden outbreak of cd pollution resulted from dom complexation with cd in sediments fluorescence eem quenching titration and parafac analysis found that cd was stable complexed with tyrosine like component ftir and 2d cos further revealed that cd was bound to phenolic oh alkene cc alcoholic co aromatic ch and alkene ch groups in addition the low cd mobility observed from july 2016 to january 2017 was caused by a combination of algal uptake sulfide precipitation and mn oxide

17264,production of methane ch4 an essential anthropogenic greenhouse gas from municipal sewer sediment is a problem deserving intensive attention based on long term laboratory batch tests in conjunction with 16 s rrna gene sequencing and metagenomics this study provides the first detailed assessment of the variable sediment ch4 production in response to different pollution source associated sewer sediment types and hydrological patterns while addressing the role of the sediment microbiome the high ch4 production capability of sanitary sewer sediment is shaped by enriched biologically active substrate and dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis genus methanosaeta moreover it involves syntrophic interactions among fermentation bacteria hydrogen producing acetogens and methanogens distinct source associated microbial species denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria occur in storm sewer and illicit discharge associated ida storm sewer sediments this reveals their insufficient microbial function capabilities to support efficient methanogenesis hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis genus methanobacterium prevails in both these sediments in this context storm sewer sediment has an extremely low ch4 production capability while ida storm sewer sediment still shows significant carbon emission through a possibly unique mechanism hydrological connections promote the sewer sediment biodegradability and ch4 production capability in contrast hydrological disconnection facilitates the prevalence of acetoclastic methanogenesis sulfate reducing enzymes denitrification enzymes and the sulfur utilizing chemolithoautotrophic denitrifier which drastically decreases ch4 production turbulent suspension of sediments results in relative stagnation of methanogenesis this work bridges the knowledge gap and will help to stimulate and guide the resolution of bottom up system scale carbon budgets and ghg sources as well as the target ch4 abatement interventions graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane production sewer sediment type hydrological pattern microbiome enzyme 1 introduction with a global warming potential 34 times that of carbon dioxide co2 over 100 years methane ch4 has been recognized as a highly potent greenhouse gas ghg that significantly contributes to climate change regarding anthropogenic ch4 sources concerns about municipal sewer systems have intensively grown in recent decades due to mounting evidence of ubiquitously high ch4 yields from the sewers of many cities worldwide chaosakul et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2014 these emissions can contribute a ghg budget of roughly 48 60 above that from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp guisasola et al 2008 the global sewer ch4 emissions are conservatively projected to reach 1 10 mt co2 e according to an estimation carried out in australia during 2011 2012 short et al 2017 furthermore methanogenesis depletes carbon sources in sewage which is detrimental to the downstream nutrient removal process of wwtps gaseous ch4 concentration of up to 50 000 ppmv has a low explosive limit of approximately 5 vol and can cause an explosion when in contact with air in a confined sewer space spencer et al 2006 current research aims to improve knowledge on the estimation of sewer ch4 emissions impacted by sewage quality hydrodynamics and sewer attributes liu et al 2015c short et al 2017 willis et al 2018 notably ch4 produced by sewer wall biofilm has been an intense area of focus guisasola et al 2009 sun et al 2018 methanogenesis is a surface area dependent process liu et al 2016 accumulated sediment in extensive sewer networks which is deposited at a reported rate of 30 500 g m of sewer length per day ashley et al 2003 represents a problem deserving greater attention due to its extremely large combined surface area as well as the substantial total network scale ch4 generation liu et al 2015b and methanogenic efficiency vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 moreover sewer sediment is substrate rich and biologically active contributing more than 50 60 chemical oxygen demand cod and 80 suspended solids ss and biological oxygen demand bod5 on average to storm sewage overflows chebbo et al 2001 gasperi et al 2010 which constitutes a robust endogenous potential for sediment methanogenesis in recent decades a widespread view focused on sewage transport force based municipal sewer classification has guided the studies on sewer ch4 considering the essential but still unclear biochemical influence of the diverse influent pollution sources from the sediment deposition process it is vitally important to further profile the sewer sediment ch4 production via pollution source classification in this regard sanitary sewers storm sewers and illicit discharge associated ida storm sewers collect heterogeneous influent substrates from different pollution sources generally sanitary sewers receive domestic sewage containing highly bioavailable organics that can be preferentially utilized by microorganisms multi site surveys have confirmed recalcitrant humic substances petroleum derivatives and solid particles flushed via stormwater as the dominant influent substrates in storm sewers chen et al 2017 durand et al 2004 ida storm sewers a type of defective sewer that broadly exists worldwide pitt 2004 comprise of both substrate input types mentioned above long term input of these heterogeneous substrates could greatly shape the sediment substrate composition and microbiome differentiation to reflect influent source characteristics as well as promote the adaptive tendency of the microbial functional capabilities in mediating anaerobic bioreactions including fermentation hydrolytic acidification methanogenesis sulfate reduction and denitrification hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 jin et al 2018 this link could ultimately dominate the carbon stream for microbial growth or stoichiometric biogas productions and alter the efficacy of methanogenesis throughout the whole process guillemette et al 2016 in conjunction with the influence of the source associated sewer sediment type the hydrological pattern of the total sewer system e g hydrological connection disconnection influent cut off caused by inadequate slope mini flow or intermittent influent chaosakul et al 2014 and turbulence causing sediment suspension in durable hydraulic further promotes a shift in the exogenous substrate input mode and eventually contributes to variability in the sediment methanogenesis efficacy particularly hydrological disconnection has been reported to amplify the heterogeneity of substrate pools and the biochemical kinetics in fluvial systems casas ruiz et al 2015 whereas in sewer turbulence has been suggested to induce first flush peaks in wastewater ch4 emission due to mobilization of methanogenic sewer sediment short et al 2017 the current related studies about sewer ch4 have only assessed the effects of gradient changes in hydraulic shear force or hydraulic retention time hrt during stable sewage flow liu et al 2016 collectively we still do not know the mechanism or the extent to which the source associated sewer sediment type and hydrological pattern affect sewer sediment ch4 production as these issues have long been overlooked bridging the knowledge gap to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings involving the differentiation of microbiome and gene functional capability in sewer sediment as well as their key roles in mediating methanogenesis related metabolisms is essential for establishing links between sediment ch4 production and sewer sediment type and hydrological patterns this study aimed to provide a detailed assessment of the variability of sediment ch4 production in response to the different source associated sewer sediment types sanitary storm and ida storm sewers and hydrological patterns hydrological connection disconnection and turbulence based on long term laboratory batch tests and addressed the role of the sediment microbiome the endogenous ch4 production capability of the initial sewer sediment was determined by large scale sampling and five day anaerobic digestion tests sediment microbiome was profiled using 16 s rrna gene sequencing the enzymes involved in methanogenesis sulfur reduction and oxidation and denitrification in sediments cultivated under hydrological connection and disconnection conditions were analyzed by metagenomic sequencing and subsequent kegg annotation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling campaigns sediment samples were collected from seven separate sewer systems located in shanghai china the catchments of these systems were mainly associated with residential land use sampling sites were selected based on the sewer location configuration age and characteristics of the influent wastewater tables s1 and s2 the in field criterion included crabtree 1989 1 adequate sediment quantity in the sewer channel 2 sediment depth of 100 300 mm 3 no flow locking effects of tide and high river levels 4 baseflow 0 75 m s over sediment and 5 no large solid waste in the sediment in total 65 sewers classified as sanitary storm and ida storm sewers were studied for sewer attributes see table s1 sewage flow to the sanitary sewers was of domestic origin the storm sewers were all relatively young and received storm runoff only during wet weather the ida storm sewers 1 point per segment which receive continuous or intermittent domestic sewage or septage flow in dry weather and storm runoff in wet weather were previously identified based on historical onsite monitoring data and closed circuit television inspection sampling was carried out in the dry season at an ambient temperature of 25 3 c from july 2018 to april 2019 the antecedent dry weather period before each sampling was at least two weeks sediment was collected in triplicate using a shovel with due care taken to keep the sediment as intact as possible the collected sediments were carefully placed into acid washed hdpe containers to avoid disturbance overlying wastewater associated with these sediments was also collected all samples were stored overnight at 4 c before cultivation 2 2 batch tests 2 2 1 endogenous ch4 produced by sewer sediment anaerobic digestion tests were performed using 1000 ml φ 122 7 cm2 glass flasks with two holes for gas inlet n2 and outlet to estimate the endogenous ch4 flux produced by each sediment sample a total of 30 sanitary sewer sediment samples types c d and e crabtree 1989 22 storm sewer sediment samples types a b and c and 13 ida storm sewer sediment samples types c d and e were tested for the initial properties of these sediment samples and their associated overlying wastewater see table s2 each flask was layer inoculated with sediment 100 ml and stagnant ultrapure water 400 ml that was degassed and spiked with nutrients table s3 the hermetically sealed flasks were then purged with n2 gas to keep the headspace anaerobic and then completely covered with aluminum foil to prevent light exposure the incubation period lasted five days at 35 c for influence of temperature on sewer sediment ch4 production see fig s1 the ch4 produced from each flask was diurnally collected for quantification using a gas sampling bag the consumed sediment biochemical oxygen

stress fig s2 the laboratory reactor system used for batch tests was designed to mimic the dark anaerobic in sewer environment fig s3 the reactor had working volumes of 0 62 l 2 31 l and 0 77 l for the sediment liquid and gas phases respectively assembled reactors were sealed and then flushed with n2 gas to remove oxygen and keep the headspace anaerobic finally the reactors were completely covered with aluminum foil and maintained at 35 1 c steady state profiles in groups i and iii were obtained by incubating the sediments for at least four h in the presence of overlying sewage prior to cultivation a hydraulic shear force of 0 0748 n m2 90 rpm was applied to achieve homogeneous contact of overlying sewage substances while maintaining the stability of the stratified sediment layer throughout the groups i 60 days and iii first 20 days reactors for influence of hydraulic shear force on sewer sediment ch4 production see fig s4 the hydraulic shear force in group iii was increased to 0 322 n m2 for the next 40 days to achieve complete sediment suspension the overlying sewage was refreshed in groups i each 10 days and iii day 10 and 20 using peristaltic pumps at a low flow velocity sewage used in the batch tests was collected every 10 days from a rising pump station sewage trunk line and stored at 4 c before being pumped into the reactor the raw sewage was filtered through 0 22 μm pvdf filters to remove the vast majority of microorganisms and then warmed to 35 c stable sewage quality was ensured for each feeding table s4 sediments used in this experiment were collected from selected typical sewers which were thoroughly investigated in a large scale reconnaissance and sampling campaign for sediment properties see table s5 2 3 chemical analysis and high throughput sequencing gaseous ch4 and co2 concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography agilent 7890b usa the gas flux mg m2 d was calculated using the diurnal total ch4 or co2 concentration

sewer sediment consistent with the initial properties of the sediments and their associated overlying wastewater table s2 significant discrepancies anova p 0 05 were also observed in their endogenous ch4 production capabilities during the five day degradation tests fig 1 a storm sewer sediments sediment cod 124 83 mg l vs ts 0 068 0 020 overlying reserved storm runoff cod 43 11 mg l showed the minimum endogenous ch4 flux mean 4 48 103 mg m2 whereas the endogenous ch4 yield of sediments from sanitary sewers sediment cod 460 78 mg l vs ts 0 275 0 022 overlying sewage cod 157 23 mg l and ida storm sewers sediment cod 504 52 mg l vs ts 0 244 0 043 overlying wastewater cod 138 42 mg l were substantial and similar 1 50 104 mg m2 a significant exponential relationship p 0 02 between the consumed sediment bod5 and the endogenous ch4 flux reveals that increased sediment bod5 consumption can strongly promote ch4 production fig 1b in terms of diurnal and total fluxes the long term ch4 production capability of sediments from both the sanitary sewer sediment cod 522 mg l vs ts 0 289 and ida storm sewer sediment cod 473 mg l vs ts 0 251 was also substantial and similar especially those of groups i total 7 8 104 and 6 2 104 mg m2 mean diurnal 1 3 103 and 1 0 103 mg m2 d spearman correlation p 0 01 and iii total 5 2 104 and 4 5 104 mg m2 mean diurnal 0 9 103 and 0 7 103 mg m2 d p 0 01 fig 1c and 1d the latter sediment reached the highest ch4 peak within the first 10 days in both these two groups fig s5 however the ch4 production capability of the storm sewer sediment sediment cod 225 mg l vs ts 0 074 was approximately 2 9 fold lower for each group the hydrological patterns further caused alterations in ch4 production in each sewer sediment the ch4 dynamics of group i periodically changed with a sharp increase observed on day 2 of each 10 day cycle when overlying sewage was refreshed followed by a rapid decrease after a short term increase of ch4 flux in the initial phase ch4 production in the sanitary sewer sediment was strongly inhibited in group ii compared to group i t test p 0 01 with the total and diurnal fluxes decreasing to mean 2 37 103 mg m2 and 39 42 mg m2 d respectively however it presented a limited inhibitory effect on ch4 production in the ida storm sewer sediment ch4 production in all the sediments was significantly reduced following the suspension in group iii despite short term and weak ch4 peaks that occurred on day 2 sanitary sewer sediment still maintained a certain amount of ch4 flux in the 40 days following after suspension 3 2 sewer sediment dom degradation in batch tests the significant carbon content and dom biodegradability in sanitary sewer and ida storm sewer sediments and their associated overlying wastewater also caused their higher initial dp values 2 4 and 2 3 compared to that in storm sewer sediment 1 8 table s2 and fig 2 sediments in group i showed a rising trend of endogenous dom dp from 1 8 2 4 to 3 5 4 7 linear regression p 0 05 as the major dom component in the overlying sewage of group i tryptophan like components were consumed significantly over the following five days after sewage refresh for each 10 day cycle fig s6 in contrast the humic like components increased over the next five days sediment dom dp in group ii was low 1 8 2 7 and changed little sanitary sewer sediment presented a decreasing curve exponential regression p 0 04 sediments in group iii showed a marked dom dp peak on day 20 and exponentially decreased thereafter from 2 9 3 8 to 1 5 2 0 p 0 05 3 3 variations in sewer sediment microbiome and metagenome 3 3 1 microbiome profiles in sewer sediment a total of 668 430 valid bacterial and archaeal sequences were obtained from 16s rrna gene sequencing the rarefaction curves approached a saturation plateau indicating that the results represent an adequate description of the entire microbiome fig s7 otus assigned using a 97 similarity cutoff of these sewer sediments and the associated α diversity indices varied for the batch tests table s7 α diversity of the sanitary sewer sediment microbiome was significantly the lowest shannon ace and chao t test p 0 05 storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments showed a similar α diversity while the ace and chao indices which estimate total abundance were higher in the storm sewer sediments the sediment microbiome was dominated by the phyla proteobacteria 18 8 32 9 chloroflexi 15 0 23 9 euryarchaeota 11 0 16 1 bacteroidetes 12 7 13 8 firmicutes 6 4 10 2 and actinobacteria 4 5 7 3 fig 3 and s8 among these proteobacteria and actinobacteria were prevalent in both storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments anova p 0 01 chloroflexi increased to some extent in the sanitary sewer and ida storm sewer sediments following cultivation p 0 05 norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 10 2 11 1 unclassified f anaerolineaceae 6 0 14 1 methanosaeta 3 7 9 9 methanobacterium 3 7 6 3 longilinea 3 3 4 7 and smithella 2 1 3 6 were the six most abundant genera for the taxonomy of each identified genus see table s8 unclassified f anaerolineaceae and methanosaeta were significantly abundant in sanitary sewer sediments p 0 01 while smithella was enriched in both the cultivated storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments p 0 05 additionally syntrophomonas was the significantly discriminant genus in the sanitary sewer sediments p 0 001 while phylum acidobacteria and genus unclassified f rhodocyclaceae were significantly discriminant in the storm sewer sediments greatly increased in cultivation p 0 001 fig 3 and s9 acidobacteria was also the significantly discriminant taxa in the ida storm sediments although the α diversity showed a convergent tendency during anaerobic cultivation with a shared otu increase from 29 26 to 43 84 fig s10 typing analysis revealed that these sewer sediments still formed two distinct microbiome phenotypes p 0 05 fig 3 phenotype 1 which only consisted of sanitary sewer sediments was dominated by unclassified f anaerolineaceae 14 5 norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 11 3 and methanosaeta 10 0 phenotype 2 which comprised storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments was dominated by norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 10 6 the hydrological patterns showed a limited impact on the β diversity of the sediment microbiome fig s11 however some functional genera showed an extremely significant increase including smithella in group i p 0 05 thiobacillus p 0 05 unclassified f rhodocyclaceae p 0 01 and desulfobulbus in ida storm sewer sediment 1 5 7 0 in group ii and unclassified f rhodocyclaceae in group iii in storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments especially the former 0 1 28 3 3 2 general connection pattern of the sediment microbiome and chemical variables the general connection pattern between the sediment microbiome and chemical variables that varied during anaerobic cultivation were explored fig 4 both ch4 and toc represented the key hub nodes in the network that showed complex and dense connections with microorganisms with the highest topological indices table s9 nodes tn nh3 n and sulfate presented high closeness centrality and dense negative edges connecting to ch4 revealing that the associated metabolisms were crucial and have interfered negatively with the methanation system in depth the vs node also belonged to the center of the network considering the degree centrality and it was positively correlated with ch4 through genera like syntrophomonas the genera unclassified f rhodocyclaceae thiobacillus sulfurisoma and sva0081 sediment group showed significant negative correlations among nh3 n tn sulfate and ch4 a significant positive correlation was identified between smithella and dp unexpectedly the most abundant genera i e norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 unclassified f anaerolineaceae methanosaeta and methanobacterium did not show significant or pairwise correlations with the chemical variables in the network however rda still indicates a strong positive correlation among methanosaeta unclassified f anaerolineaceae ch4 organic indicators and sanitary sewer sediments fig 4 additionally norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 was negatively correlated with organic indicators ch4 and co2 while positively correlated with storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments finally methanobacterium was significantly correlated to ida storm sewer sediments 3 3 3 functional gene enzymes in metabolic pathways metagenomic sequencing generated an average of 3 54 gb of sequence for each sample for a total of 31 88 gb of sequencing data the significantly low abundance of enzyme acetyl coa carboxylase acds fig 5 suggests that the acetyl coa decarboxylation reaction to form 5 methyl thmpt should be the rate limiting step in acetoclastic methanogenesis this enzyme predominantly occurred in the initial sanitary sewer sediment and exhibited a remarkable enrichment 376 in the ida storm sewer sediment of group ii the acetyl coa synthetase acss enzyme had a high initial abundance in all sediments which implies that the acetic acid acetyl coa pathway should have a stronger functional capability than the acetic acid acetyl phosphate acetyl coa pathway during acetoclastic methanogenesis acetyl coa 5 methyl thmpt and methyl com are generally the main intermediate metabolites during anaerobic conversion of acetate to ch4 ferry 2010 however it appeared that acss in ida storm sewer sediment decreased in both groups i and ii 33 and 16 respectively the enzymes fmda ftr mch mtd and mer of the hydrogenotrophic formate co2 methanogenesis pathway decreased following cultivation therein the reduction of fmda in storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments that were cultivated in group ii was the most significant 58 and 35 this suggests that the function capability of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway was weakened in sewer sediments after cultivation when compared to the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway this trend was consistent with the dramatic decrease in the functional contribution of hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium to both carbon and ch4 metabolism fig s12 especially in group ii on the other hand the enzyme fdh which converts formate into co2 exhibited a high and relatively stable abundance in all the sediments during cultivation unexpectedly in group ii however it was drastically enriched in the ida storm sewer sediment 155 finally the hydrological disconnection simulated in group ii significantly promoted the abundance of enzymes for assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate metabolism especially the papss sat 339 cysji 647 aprab 8078 and dsrab 1824 in the ida storm sewer sediment similarly denitrification enzymes also showed a dramatic enrichment in group ii especially in the ida storm sewer sediment narb 412 narg 394 nirk s 2093 and nosz 16 033 these enhanced metabolic enzymes supported the significant decrease in content of sulfate and nitrate in group ii especially the decrease that occurred in the storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments fig s13 4 discussion 4 1 microbiome differentiation causes variations in the ch4 production capability of sewer sediment 4 1 1 sanitary sewer sediment microbiome phenotype 1 the feeding of sufficient highly biodegradable organic substrate conveyed by domestic sewage in sanitary sewers promotes the sinking and formation of sediment that is biologically active as well as acetate precursor rich e g proteins carbohydrates long chain aliphatic hydrocarbon and short chain fatty acids scfas in this context this kind of sediment presents a high capability for ch4 production methanosaeta which is significantly prevalent in sanitary sewer sediments microbiome phenotype 1 is the most predominant methanogen accounting for more than 90 of the total methanogens in sewer conditions that generate ch4 through an obligate acetoclastic pathway sun et al 2014 based on cod the acetate pathway contributes more than 70 of ch4 load gujer and zehnder 1983 thus the great abundance of methanosaeta and its strong positive correlation with sanitary sewer sediments reveal that acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated there this can be also corroborated by enrichment of acds an enzyme that mediates the key reaction of acetyl coa decarboxylation to form 5 methyl thmpt during acetoclastic methanogenesis liu et al 2015a enrichment of fermentative bacteria fb hydrogen producing acetogens hpas and methanogens in the sanitary sewer sediments demonstrates marked syntrophic interactions that strengthen substrate utilization and more efficiently promote the thermodynamics of methanogenesis unclassified f anaerolineaceae hpa family anaerolineaceae was the main genus enriched in microbiome phenotype 1 members of this family can ferment carbohydrates and produce h2 and acetate yamada et al 2006 and this taxa have been frequently observed to co occur with methanogens in methanogenic modules of co occurrence networks ji et al 2018 rda further demonstrates the significant positive correlations of unclassified f anaerolineaceae with ch4 flux organic indicators and methanosaeta moreover there remained some significantly discriminant taxa in the sanitary sewer sediments throughout anaerobic cultivation most of which were fb and hpa particularly syntrophomonas this species can form a robust syntrophic interaction with methanogens and thereby overcoming the thermodynamic energy barrier associated with anaerobic decomposition of the organic substrate and promoting interspecies h2 formate transfer and syntrophic oxidation of scfas and alcohols to produce ch4 mcinerney et al 1981 the statistically significant connection pattern of the sediment microbiome reconstructed here indicates that syntrophomonas is the crucial genus connecting the vs and ch4 nodes given the high vs ts this may suggest that the sediment particulate organic matter in the sanitary sewer plays another essential role during anaerobic bioreactions as a microbial carbon source in this regard because the particulate substrates must undergo hydrolysis before utilization hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 syntrophomonas is likely to mediate such processes phylum chloroflexi to which unclassified f anaerolineaceae belongs is another significantly increased taxon in the sanitary sewer sediments that is capable of metabolizing diverse substrates thereby playing an important role in the degradation of complex polysaccharides durán et al 2018 4 1 2 storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments microbiome phenotype 2 sediment microbiome phenotype 2 which comprised the storm sewer and ida storm sewer was markedly different from that of phenotype 1 this phenotype was predominantly shaped by the long term input of distinct exogenous substrates from storm runoff and illicitly discharged domestic sewage the enriched microbial species such as the taxa norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 class bacteroidetes vadinha17 smithella methanobacterium and acidobacteria highlight the prominent peculiarity of the potential metabolic processes occurring in these sediments and indicates that there is insufficient bioavailable substrate and microbial function for supporting efficient methanogenesis especially in the storm sewer norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 has been detected in environments undergoing complex carbon degradation especially those with high amounts of recalcitrant organics baldwin et al 2015 the negative correlations of this taxon with ch4 co2 and organic indicators as well as the positive correlations with storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments were consistent with findings from other storm sewers chen et al 2017 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 storm runoff from permeable or impervious underlying surfaces is a major pollution source of storm sewers including ida storm sewers and these wastewaters are rich in cellulose hemicellulose humic acid and other refractory organics that are not easily utilized for ch4 production or energy metabolism hosen et al 2014 this suggests that the abundant norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 does not contribute to ch4 metabolism the significantly discriminant phylum acidobacteria that emerged in these sewer sediments also confirms the pollution source characteristic of their microbiome acidobacteria is a ubiquitous and abundant species of soil habitats jones et al 2009 it can degrade cellulose to produce hydrogen under anaerobic conditions thereby providing substrates for methanogenesis pankratov et al 2012 the alkane degrading bacteria smithella which significantly increased in these sediments and presented a strong correlation with dp reportedly proliferates in environments impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons gray et al 2011 and can promote the conversion of long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons to acetic acid thus forming a syntrophic relationship with methanogens embree et al 2014 indeed storm runoff contains high levels of petroleum derived hydrophobic substrates due to traffic activities durand et al 2004 however although acidobacteria and smithella can promote ch4 production in the sewer a higher efficiency based on refractory substrates would be minimal of critical importance the abundant methanobacterium in these sewer sediments especially their extremely significant link with ida storm sewer sediments implies that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could be more prevalent than in the sanitary sewer denitrifying bacteria dnb sulfate reducing bacteria srb and their associated metabolic reactions that are enriched in storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments pose significant substrate competition and even toxic inhibition further reducing ch4 production especially in the storm sewer the dnb unclassified f rhodocyclaceae family rhodocyclaceae li et al 2019 was highly enriched in storm sewer sediments and its significant negative correlations with nh3 n tn and ch4 indicate great inhibition of ch4 production products obtained from denitrification e g nitric oxide and nitrous oxide can also inhibit methanogenesis at varying concentrations short et al 2017 high initial sulfate concentrations significant sulfate decrease and abundant srb such as the genera caldisericum mori et al 2009 desulfobulbus sun et al 2014 and sva0081 sediment group family desulfobacteraceae were also found in these sediments methanogenesis can be inhibited via srb mediated sulfur metabolism in a number of ways including 1 competition for substrates due to sulfate reduction 2 sulfate acting as a strong reducing agent to promote orp and 3 production of the toxic product h2s hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 phylum actinobacteria which was observed as significantly discriminant in these sediments was dominant in other sewer systems with high h2s concentrations dong et al 2017 which further confirms the occurrence of sulfate reducing reactions to a certain extent it should be pointed out that however in the limited substrate environment of storm sewer sediments the competition between methanogens dnb and srb is likely to be enhanced although the ida storm sewer sediment microbiome was not conducive to methanogenesis the substrate mass and ch4 flux scale were still close to or even larger than that of the sanitary sewer sediment due to the intermittent or continuous influent of domestic sewage during the formation process additionally a similar level of thiobacillus emerged in both the sanitary sewer and ida storm sewer sediments this species has been shown as primarily responsible for corroding a concrete sewer environment jiang et al 2016 this is very consistent with the general status of the sanitary sewer and ida storm sewer as concrete corrosion often occurs in this environment notably in the absence of exogenous substrate group ii ida storm sewer sediment still produced robust ch4 and co2 fluxes fig s5 and exhibited a drastic enrichment of the fdh enzyme this further suggests its significant carbon emission capability through a possibly unique and unknown mechanism however the specific details and efficiency discrepancies of such a mechanism that could involve metabolic synergy and competition are still unclear 4 2 hydrological patterns affect the links among microbiome structure metabolic function expression and ch4 production capability of sewer sediment exogenous substrate input via influent in hydrological connections especially the bioavailable dom in domestic sewage are the crucial factors resulting in high sediment dom biodegradability and condensation significantly increased sediment dp and promoting the ch4 production capability importantly refreshing the overlying sewage in 10 day cycles revealed that exogenous substrate can rapidly promote ch4 flux from anaerobic systems to reach their peak in a short 24 h period fig s5 this result is consistent with a laboratory flume study showing that sediment beds can quickly become substantially methanogenic within 24 48 h vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 assuming that the hrt is shortened to a certain extent under hydrological connection for example 24 h in the scale of the present study favorable conditions for ch4 generation will ultimately be provided although the practical hrt in sewer systems is generally short its promotion or inhibition of sediment ch4 production capability may vary due to sewer attributes interestingly long term sewage feeding did not cause a differentiation of the sediment microbiome with only smithella increasing significantly hydrological disconnection entails the absence of exogenous substrate and a great depletion of endogenous bioavailable substrate overall low dp facilitating differentiation of the sediment microbial functional capability and a dramatic decrease in ch4 production concurrently the weakened expression of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in sewer sediments as evidenced by the presence of methanobacterium and the related enzymes indicates prevailing acetoclastic methanogenesis following hydrological disconnection given that the bioavailable substrates are broadly exhausted during hydrological disconnection dominance of the acetoclastic pathway might further decrease ch4 production additionally that hydrological pattern promoted the enrichment of enzymes associated with sulfur and nitrogen metabolism as well as the functional microorganisms that are able to rapidly out compete methanogens such as the dnb unclassified f rhodocyclaceae srb desulfobulbus and sulfur utilizing chemolithoautotrophic denitrifier thiobacillus cardoso et al 2006 these enhanced metabolisms facilitated the prominent decrease in content of sulfate and nitrate under hydrological disconnection conditions accordingly ch4 production was mitigated due to kinetic and thermodynamic disadvantages hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 khanal 2008 conversely variation of the enzymes fmda and fdh of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway reduced formic acid utilization for converting to ch4 during hydrological disconnection particularly in the ida storm sewer sediment thus more formic acid could be metabolized into co2 which could cause the immediate and robust co2 flux emitted under this hydrological pattern fig s5 this phenomenon has also been documented during field monitoring of the local storm sewer system chen et al 2020 however in a practical case of in sewer hydrological disconnection oxygen may be more likely to approach the sediment surface causing anoxic or aerobic respiration and accelerating sediment dehydration which might promote carbon efficiency in aerobic respiration and increase co2 production while inhibiting ch4 production mackelprang et al 2011 turbulent suspension of sediment primarily occurs in wet weather or during dry weather with high flow influent even such a hydrological pattern can promote mass transfer and intensify the consumption of bioavailable substrates marked dp decrease however this did not heighten ch4 production on the contrary essentially stagnated methanogenesis was apparent due to failed adhesion and formation of a stable biofilm layer that would have supported the growth and biochemical activities of the microorganisms hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 liu et al 2015b especially in storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments to some extent this finding is similar to that of a study involving individual anaerobic sewage incubations which showed that sewage could produce little ch4 by only relying on its carbon and microbiome chen et al 2020 the drastically enriched dnb unclassified f rhodocyclaceae could also be responsible for inhibition of methanogenesis under suspension conditions moreover the transient ch4 peak that occurred only one day after sediment suspension indicates a short run release of ch4 bubbles or dissolved gasses caused by mobilization of methanogenic sewer sediment under extreme turbulence this has also been observed during the first flush of particular storm events in which the scale of these physical ch4 emissions is of significant magnitude in the short term 10 fold above baseline daelman et al 2012 of note in field hydraulic turbulence may otherwise result in sewage reoxygenation and a higher orp thereby inhibiting methanogenesis in addition a certain amount of ch4 produced from sanitary sewer sediment in suspension may be related to elevated mas transfer high vs ts and abundant hydrolytic acidogenic bacteria yu et al 2017 5 conclusions this study provides new insights into the crucial links among sewer sediment ch4 production and the impacts of source associated sewer sediment type and hydrological pattern taking into account the increasing uncertainty of urban hydrology caused by climatic change and intense construction of sewer networks fueled by global urbanization and improved sanitation this work will help to stimulate and guide the resolution of bottom up system scale carbon budgets and ghg sources as well as the target ch4 abatement interventions findings here also contribute to a better understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings involving the adaptive differentiation of microbiomes and gene function capability in sewer sediment and their key roles in mediating anaerobic metabolism the results show 1 sanitary sewer sediment has a high ch4 production capability due to enriched biologically active substrate dominant acetoclastic methanogenesis and the syntrophic interactions among functional microorganisms 2 storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments present insufficient microbial function supporting efficient methanogenesis with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis prevailing in both these sediments 3 storm sewer sediment has an extremely low ch4 production capability while ida storm sewer sediment shows substantial ch4 production 4 hydrological connection promotes the sewer sediment biodegradability and ch4 production capability 5 hydrological disconnection facilitates acetoclastic methanogenesis sulfate reduction and denitrification while decreasing ch4 production and 6 turbulent suspension of sediment results in the stagnation of methanogenesis given the significant discrepancy between sanitary sewers and storm sewers as well as those altered under different hydrological patterns this work further highlights the

17264,production of methane ch4 an essential anthropogenic greenhouse gas from municipal sewer sediment is a problem deserving intensive attention based on long term laboratory batch tests in conjunction with 16 s rrna gene sequencing and metagenomics this study provides the first detailed assessment of the variable sediment ch4 production in response to different pollution source associated sewer sediment types and hydrological patterns while addressing the role of the sediment microbiome the high ch4 production capability of sanitary sewer sediment is shaped by enriched biologically active substrate and dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis genus methanosaeta moreover it involves syntrophic interactions among fermentation bacteria hydrogen producing acetogens and methanogens distinct source associated microbial species denitrifying bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria occur in storm sewer and illicit discharge associated ida storm sewer sediments this reveals their insufficient microbial function capabilities to support efficient methanogenesis hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis genus methanobacterium prevails in both these sediments in this context storm sewer sediment has an extremely low ch4 production capability while ida storm sewer sediment still shows significant carbon emission through a possibly unique mechanism hydrological connections promote the sewer sediment biodegradability and ch4 production capability in contrast hydrological disconnection facilitates the prevalence of acetoclastic methanogenesis sulfate reducing enzymes denitrification enzymes and the sulfur utilizing chemolithoautotrophic denitrifier which drastically decreases ch4 production turbulent suspension of sediments results in relative stagnation of methanogenesis this work bridges the knowledge gap and will help to stimulate and guide the resolution of bottom up system scale carbon budgets and ghg sources as well as the target ch4 abatement interventions graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords methane production sewer sediment type hydrological pattern microbiome enzyme 1 introduction with a global warming potential 34 times that of carbon dioxide co2 over 100 years methane ch4 has been recognized as a highly potent greenhouse gas ghg that significantly contributes to climate change regarding anthropogenic ch4 sources concerns about municipal sewer systems have intensively grown in recent decades due to mounting evidence of ubiquitously high ch4 yields from the sewers of many cities worldwide chaosakul et al 2014 chen et al 2020 liu et al 2014 these emissions can contribute a ghg budget of roughly 48 60 above that from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp guisasola et al 2008 the global sewer ch4 emissions are conservatively projected to reach 1 10 mt co2 e according to an estimation carried out in australia during 2011 2012 short et al 2017 furthermore methanogenesis depletes carbon sources in sewage which is detrimental to the downstream nutrient removal process of wwtps gaseous ch4 concentration of up to 50 000 ppmv has a low explosive limit of approximately 5 vol and can cause an explosion when in contact with air in a confined sewer space spencer et al 2006 current research aims to improve knowledge on the estimation of sewer ch4 emissions impacted by sewage quality hydrodynamics and sewer attributes liu et al 2015c short et al 2017 willis et al 2018 notably ch4 produced by sewer wall biofilm has been an intense area of focus guisasola et al 2009 sun et al 2018 methanogenesis is a surface area dependent process liu et al 2016 accumulated sediment in extensive sewer networks which is deposited at a reported rate of 30 500 g m of sewer length per day ashley et al 2003 represents a problem deserving greater attention due to its extremely large combined surface area as well as the substantial total network scale ch4 generation liu et al 2015b and methanogenic efficiency vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 moreover sewer sediment is substrate rich and biologically active contributing more than 50 60 chemical oxygen demand cod and 80 suspended solids ss and biological oxygen demand bod5 on average to storm sewage overflows chebbo et al 2001 gasperi et al 2010 which constitutes a robust endogenous potential for sediment methanogenesis in recent decades a widespread view focused on sewage transport force based municipal sewer classification has guided the studies on sewer ch4 considering the essential but still unclear biochemical influence of the diverse influent pollution sources from the sediment deposition process it is vitally important to further profile the sewer sediment ch4 production via pollution source classification in this regard sanitary sewers storm sewers and illicit discharge associated ida storm sewers collect heterogeneous influent substrates from different pollution sources generally sanitary sewers receive domestic sewage containing highly bioavailable organics that can be preferentially utilized by microorganisms multi site surveys have confirmed recalcitrant humic substances petroleum derivatives and solid particles flushed via stormwater as the dominant influent substrates in storm sewers chen et al 2017 durand et al 2004 ida storm sewers a type of defective sewer that broadly exists worldwide pitt 2004 comprise of both substrate input types mentioned above long term input of these heterogeneous substrates could greatly shape the sediment substrate composition and microbiome differentiation to reflect influent source characteristics as well as promote the adaptive tendency of the microbial functional capabilities in mediating anaerobic bioreactions including fermentation hydrolytic acidification methanogenesis sulfate reduction and denitrification hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 jin et al 2018 this link could ultimately dominate the carbon stream for microbial growth or stoichiometric biogas productions and alter the efficacy of methanogenesis throughout the whole process guillemette et al 2016 in conjunction with the influence of the source associated sewer sediment type the hydrological pattern of the total sewer system e g hydrological connection disconnection influent cut off caused by inadequate slope mini flow or intermittent influent chaosakul et al 2014 and turbulence causing sediment suspension in durable hydraulic further promotes a shift in the exogenous substrate input mode and eventually contributes to variability in the sediment methanogenesis efficacy particularly hydrological disconnection has been reported to amplify the heterogeneity of substrate pools and the biochemical kinetics in fluvial systems casas ruiz et al 2015 whereas in sewer turbulence has been suggested to induce first flush peaks in wastewater ch4 emission due to mobilization of methanogenic sewer sediment short et al 2017 the current related studies about sewer ch4 have only assessed the effects of gradient changes in hydraulic shear force or hydraulic retention time hrt during stable sewage flow liu et al 2016 collectively we still do not know the mechanism or the extent to which the source associated sewer sediment type and hydrological pattern affect sewer sediment ch4 production as these issues have long been overlooked bridging the knowledge gap to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings involving the differentiation of microbiome and gene functional capability in sewer sediment as well as their key roles in mediating methanogenesis related metabolisms is essential for establishing links between sediment ch4 production and sewer sediment type and hydrological patterns this study aimed to provide a detailed assessment of the variability of sediment ch4 production in response to the different source associated sewer sediment types sanitary storm and ida storm sewers and hydrological patterns hydrological connection disconnection and turbulence based on long term laboratory batch tests and addressed the role of the sediment microbiome the endogenous ch4 production capability of the initial sewer sediment was determined by large scale sampling and five day anaerobic digestion tests sediment microbiome was profiled using 16 s rrna gene sequencing the enzymes involved in methanogenesis sulfur reduction and oxidation and denitrification in sediments cultivated under hydrological connection and disconnection conditions were analyzed by metagenomic sequencing and subsequent kegg annotation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling campaigns sediment samples were collected from seven separate sewer systems located in shanghai china the catchments of these systems were mainly associated with residential land use sampling sites were selected based on the sewer location configuration age and characteristics of the influent wastewater tables s1 and s2 the in field criterion included crabtree 1989 1 adequate sediment quantity in the sewer channel 2 sediment depth of 100 300 mm 3 no flow locking effects of tide and high river levels 4 baseflow 0 75 m s over sediment and 5 no large solid waste in the sediment in total 65 sewers classified as sanitary storm and ida storm sewers were studied for sewer attributes see table s1 sewage flow to the sanitary sewers was of domestic origin the storm sewers were all relatively young and received storm runoff only during wet weather the ida storm sewers 1 point per segment which receive continuous or intermittent domestic sewage or septage flow in dry weather and storm runoff in wet weather were previously identified based on historical onsite monitoring data and closed circuit television inspection sampling was carried out in the dry season at an ambient temperature of 25 3 c from july 2018 to april 2019 the antecedent dry weather period before each sampling was at least two weeks sediment was collected in triplicate using a shovel with due care taken to keep the sediment as intact as possible the collected sediments were carefully placed into acid washed hdpe containers to avoid disturbance overlying wastewater associated with these sediments was also collected all samples were stored overnight at 4 c before cultivation 2 2 batch tests 2 2 1 endogenous ch4 produced by sewer sediment anaerobic digestion tests were performed using 1000 ml φ 122 7 cm2 glass flasks with two holes for gas inlet n2 and outlet to estimate the endogenous ch4 flux produced by each sediment sample a total of 30 sanitary sewer sediment samples types c d and e crabtree 1989 22 storm sewer sediment samples types a b and c and 13 ida storm sewer sediment samples types c d and e were tested for the initial properties of these sediment samples and their associated overlying wastewater see table s2 each flask was layer inoculated with sediment 100 ml and stagnant ultrapure water 400 ml that was degassed and spiked with nutrients table s3 the hermetically sealed flasks were then purged with n2 gas to keep the headspace anaerobic and then completely covered with aluminum foil to prevent light exposure the incubation period lasted five days at 35 c for influence of temperature on sewer sediment ch4 production see fig s1 the ch4 produced from each flask was diurnally collected for quantification using a gas sampling bag the consumed sediment biochemical oxygen

the sediment liquid and gas phases respectively assembled reactors were sealed and then flushed with n2 gas to remove oxygen and keep the headspace anaerobic finally the reactors were completely covered with aluminum foil and maintained at 35 1 c steady state profiles in groups i and iii were obtained by incubating the sediments for at least four h in the presence of overlying sewage prior to cultivation a hydraulic shear force of 0 0748 n m2 90 rpm was applied to achieve homogeneous contact of overlying sewage substances while maintaining the stability of the stratified sediment layer throughout the groups i 60 days and iii first 20 days reactors for influence of hydraulic shear force on sewer sediment ch4 production see fig s4 the hydraulic shear force in group iii was increased to 0 322 n m2 for the next 40 days to achieve complete sediment suspension the overlying sewage was refreshed in groups i each 10 days and iii day 10 and 20 using peristaltic pumps at a low flow velocity sewage used in the batch tests was collected every 10 days from a rising pump station sewage trunk line and stored at 4 c before being pumped into the reactor the raw sewage was filtered through 0 22 μm pvdf filters to remove the vast majority of microorganisms and then warmed to 35 c stable sewage quality was ensured for each feeding table s4 sediments used in this experiment were collected from selected typical sewers which were thoroughly investigated in a large scale reconnaissance and sampling campaign for sediment properties see table s5 2 3 chemical analysis and high throughput sequencing gaseous ch4 and co2 concentrations were quantified by gas chromatography agilent 7890b usa the gas flux mg m2 d was calculated using the diurnal total ch4 or co2 concentration

sewer sediment consistent with the initial properties of the sediments and their associated overlying wastewater table s2 significant discrepancies anova p 0 05 were also observed in their endogenous ch4 production capabilities during the five day degradation tests fig 1 a storm sewer sediments sediment cod 124 83 mg l vs ts 0 068 0 020 overlying reserved storm runoff cod 43 11 mg l showed the minimum endogenous ch4 flux mean 4 48 103 mg m2 whereas the endogenous ch4 yield of sediments from sanitary sewers sediment cod 460 78 mg l vs ts 0 275 0 022 overlying sewage cod 157 23 mg l and ida storm sewers sediment cod 504 52 mg l vs ts 0 244 0 043 overlying wastewater cod 138 42 mg l were substantial and similar 1 50 104 mg m2 a significant exponential relationship p 0 02 between the consumed sediment bod5 and the endogenous ch4 flux reveals that increased sediment bod5 consumption can strongly promote ch4 production fig 1b in terms of diurnal and total fluxes the long term ch4 production capability of sediments from both the sanitary sewer sediment cod 522 mg l vs ts 0 289 and ida storm sewer sediment cod 473 mg l vs ts 0 251 was also substantial and similar especially those of groups i total 7 8 104 and 6 2 104 mg m2 mean diurnal 1 3 103 and 1 0 103 mg m2 d spearman correlation p 0 01 and iii total 5 2 104 and 4 5 104 mg m2 mean diurnal 0 9 103 and 0 7 103 mg m2 d p 0 01 fig 1c and 1d the latter sediment reached the highest ch4 peak within the first 10 days in both these two groups fig s5 however the ch4 production capability of the storm sewer sediment sediment cod 225 mg l vs ts 0 074 was approximately 2 9 fold lower for each group the hydrological patterns further caused alterations in ch4 production in each sewer sediment the ch4 dynamics of group i periodically changed with a sharp increase observed on day 2 of each 10 day cycle when overlying sewage was refreshed followed by a rapid decrease after a short term increase of ch4 flux in the initial phase ch4 production in the sanitary sewer sediment was strongly inhibited in group ii compared to group i t test p 0 01 with the total and diurnal fluxes decreasing to mean 2 37 103 mg m2 and 39 42 mg m2 d respectively however it presented a limited inhibitory effect on ch4 production in the ida storm sewer sediment ch4 production in all the sediments was significantly reduced following the suspension in group iii despite short term and weak ch4 peaks that occurred on day 2 sanitary sewer sediment still maintained a certain amount of ch4 flux in the 40 days following after suspension 3 2 sewer sediment dom degradation in batch tests the significant carbon content and dom biodegradability in sanitary sewer and ida storm sewer sediments and their associated overlying wastewater also caused their higher initial dp values 2 4 and 2 3 compared to that in storm sewer sediment 1 8 table s2 and fig 2 sediments in group i showed a rising trend of endogenous dom dp from 1 8 2 4 to 3 5 4 7 linear regression p 0 05 as the major dom component in the overlying sewage of group i tryptophan like components were consumed significantly over the following five days after sewage refresh for each 10 day cycle fig s6 in contrast the humic like components increased over the next five days sediment dom dp in group ii was low 1 8 2 7 and changed little sanitary sewer sediment presented a decreasing curve exponential regression p 0 04 sediments in group iii showed a marked dom dp peak on day 20 and exponentially decreased thereafter from 2 9 3 8 to 1 5 2 0 p 0 05 3 3 variations in sewer sediment microbiome and metagenome 3 3 1 microbiome profiles in sewer sediment a total of 668 430 valid bacterial and archaeal sequences were obtained from 16s rrna gene sequencing the rarefaction curves approached a saturation plateau indicating that the results represent an adequate description of the entire microbiome fig s7 otus assigned using a 97 similarity cutoff of these sewer sediments and the associated α diversity indices varied for the batch tests table s7 α diversity of the sanitary sewer sediment microbiome was significantly the lowest shannon ace and chao t test p 0 05 storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments showed a similar α diversity while the ace and chao indices which estimate total abundance were higher in the storm sewer sediments the sediment microbiome was dominated by the phyla proteobacteria 18 8 32 9 chloroflexi 15 0 23 9 euryarchaeota 11 0 16 1 bacteroidetes 12 7 13 8 firmicutes 6 4 10 2 and actinobacteria 4 5 7 3 fig 3 and s8 among these proteobacteria and actinobacteria were prevalent in both storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments anova p 0 01 chloroflexi increased to some extent in the sanitary sewer and ida storm sewer sediments following cultivation p 0 05 norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 10 2 11 1 unclassified f anaerolineaceae 6 0 14 1 methanosaeta 3 7 9 9 methanobacterium 3 7 6 3 longilinea 3 3 4 7 and smithella 2 1 3 6 were the six most abundant genera for the taxonomy of each identified genus see table s8 unclassified f anaerolineaceae and methanosaeta were significantly abundant in sanitary sewer sediments p 0 01 while smithella was enriched in both the cultivated storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments p 0 05 additionally syntrophomonas was the significantly discriminant genus in the sanitary sewer sediments p 0 001 while phylum acidobacteria and genus unclassified f rhodocyclaceae were significantly discriminant in the storm sewer sediments greatly increased in cultivation p 0 001 fig 3 and s9 acidobacteria was also the significantly discriminant taxa in the ida storm sediments although the α diversity showed a convergent tendency during anaerobic cultivation with a shared otu increase from 29 26 to 43 84 fig s10 typing analysis revealed that these sewer sediments still formed two distinct microbiome phenotypes p 0 05 fig 3 phenotype 1 which only consisted of sanitary sewer sediments was dominated by unclassified f anaerolineaceae 14 5 norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 11 3 and methanosaeta 10 0 phenotype 2 which comprised storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments was dominated by norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 10 6 the hydrological patterns showed a limited impact on the β diversity of the sediment microbiome fig s11 however some functional genera showed an extremely significant increase including smithella in group i p 0 05 thiobacillus p 0 05 unclassified f rhodocyclaceae p 0 01 and desulfobulbus in ida storm sewer sediment 1 5 7 0 in group ii and unclassified f rhodocyclaceae in group iii in storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments especially the former 0 1 28 3 3 2 general connection pattern of the sediment microbiome and chemical variables the general connection pattern between the sediment microbiome and chemical variables that varied during anaerobic cultivation were explored fig 4 both ch4 and toc represented the key hub nodes in the network that showed complex and dense connections with microorganisms with the highest topological indices table s9 nodes tn nh3 n and sulfate presented high closeness centrality and dense negative edges connecting to ch4 revealing that the associated metabolisms were crucial and have interfered negatively with the methanation system in depth the vs node also belonged to the center of the network considering the degree centrality and it was positively correlated with ch4 through genera like syntrophomonas the genera unclassified f rhodocyclaceae thiobacillus sulfurisoma and sva0081 sediment group showed significant negative correlations among nh3 n tn sulfate and ch4 a significant positive correlation was identified between smithella and dp unexpectedly the most abundant genera i e norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 unclassified f anaerolineaceae methanosaeta and methanobacterium did not show significant or pairwise correlations with the chemical variables in the network however rda still indicates a strong positive correlation among methanosaeta unclassified f anaerolineaceae ch4 organic indicators and sanitary sewer sediments fig 4 additionally norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 was negatively correlated with organic indicators ch4 and co2 while positively correlated with storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments finally methanobacterium was significantly correlated to ida storm sewer sediments 3 3 3 functional gene enzymes in metabolic pathways metagenomic sequencing generated an average of 3 54 gb of sequence for each sample for a total of 31 88 gb of sequencing data the significantly low abundance of enzyme acetyl coa carboxylase acds fig 5 suggests that the acetyl coa decarboxylation reaction to form 5 methyl thmpt should be the rate limiting step in acetoclastic methanogenesis this enzyme predominantly occurred in the initial sanitary sewer sediment and exhibited a remarkable enrichment 376 in the ida storm sewer sediment of group ii the acetyl coa synthetase acss enzyme had a high initial abundance in all sediments which implies that the acetic acid acetyl coa pathway should have a stronger functional capability than the acetic acid acetyl phosphate acetyl coa pathway during acetoclastic methanogenesis acetyl coa 5 methyl thmpt and methyl com are generally the main intermediate metabolites during anaerobic conversion of acetate to ch4 ferry 2010 however it appeared that acss in ida storm sewer sediment decreased in both groups i and ii 33 and 16 respectively the enzymes fmda ftr mch mtd and mer of the hydrogenotrophic formate co2 methanogenesis pathway decreased following cultivation therein the reduction of fmda in storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments that were cultivated in group ii was the most significant 58 and 35 this suggests that the function capability of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway was weakened in sewer sediments after cultivation when compared to the acetoclastic methanogenesis pathway this trend was consistent with the dramatic decrease in the functional contribution of hydrogenotrophic methanobacterium to both carbon and ch4 metabolism fig s12 especially in group ii on the other hand the enzyme fdh which converts formate into co2 exhibited a high and relatively stable abundance in all the sediments during cultivation unexpectedly in group ii however it was drastically enriched in the ida storm sewer sediment 155 finally the hydrological disconnection simulated in group ii significantly promoted the abundance of enzymes for assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate metabolism especially the papss sat 339 cysji 647 aprab 8078 and dsrab 1824 in the ida storm sewer sediment similarly denitrification enzymes also showed a dramatic enrichment in group ii especially in the ida storm sewer sediment narb 412 narg 394 nirk s 2093 and nosz 16 033 these enhanced metabolic enzymes supported the significant decrease in content of sulfate and nitrate in group ii especially the decrease that occurred in the storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments fig s13 4 discussion 4 1 microbiome differentiation causes variations in the ch4 production capability of sewer sediment 4 1 1 sanitary sewer sediment microbiome phenotype 1 the feeding of sufficient highly biodegradable organic substrate conveyed by domestic sewage in sanitary sewers promotes the sinking and formation of sediment that is biologically active as well as acetate precursor rich e g proteins carbohydrates long chain aliphatic hydrocarbon and short chain fatty acids scfas in this context this kind of sediment presents a high capability for ch4 production methanosaeta which is significantly prevalent in sanitary sewer sediments microbiome phenotype 1 is the most predominant methanogen accounting for more than 90 of the total methanogens in sewer conditions that generate ch4 through an obligate acetoclastic pathway sun et al 2014 based on cod the acetate pathway contributes more than 70 of ch4 load gujer and zehnder 1983 thus the great abundance of methanosaeta and its strong positive correlation with sanitary sewer sediments reveal that acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated there this can be also corroborated by enrichment of acds an enzyme that mediates the key reaction of acetyl coa decarboxylation to form 5 methyl thmpt during acetoclastic methanogenesis liu et al 2015a enrichment of fermentative bacteria fb hydrogen producing acetogens hpas and methanogens in the sanitary sewer sediments demonstrates marked syntrophic interactions that strengthen substrate utilization and more efficiently promote the thermodynamics of methanogenesis unclassified f anaerolineaceae hpa family anaerolineaceae was the main genus enriched in microbiome phenotype 1 members of this family can ferment carbohydrates and produce h2 and acetate yamada et al 2006 and this taxa have been frequently observed to co occur with methanogens in methanogenic modules of co occurrence networks ji et al 2018 rda further demonstrates the significant positive correlations of unclassified f anaerolineaceae with ch4 flux organic indicators and methanosaeta moreover there remained some significantly discriminant taxa in the sanitary sewer sediments throughout anaerobic cultivation most of which were fb and hpa particularly syntrophomonas this species can form a robust syntrophic interaction with methanogens and thereby overcoming the thermodynamic energy barrier associated with anaerobic decomposition of the organic substrate and promoting interspecies h2 formate transfer and syntrophic oxidation of scfas and alcohols to produce ch4 mcinerney et al 1981 the statistically significant connection pattern of the sediment microbiome reconstructed here indicates that syntrophomonas is the crucial genus connecting the vs and ch4 nodes given the high vs ts this may suggest that the sediment particulate organic matter in the sanitary sewer plays another essential role during anaerobic bioreactions as a microbial carbon source in this regard because the particulate substrates must undergo hydrolysis before utilization hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 syntrophomonas is likely to mediate such processes phylum chloroflexi to which unclassified f anaerolineaceae belongs is another significantly increased taxon in the sanitary sewer sediments that is capable of metabolizing diverse substrates thereby playing an important role in the degradation of complex polysaccharides durán et al 2018 4 1 2 storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments microbiome phenotype 2 sediment microbiome phenotype 2 which comprised the storm sewer and ida storm sewer was markedly different from that of phenotype 1 this phenotype was predominantly shaped by the long term input of distinct exogenous substrates from storm runoff and illicitly discharged domestic sewage the enriched microbial species such as the taxa norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 class bacteroidetes vadinha17 smithella methanobacterium and acidobacteria highlight the prominent peculiarity of the potential metabolic processes occurring in these sediments and indicates that there is insufficient bioavailable substrate and microbial function for supporting efficient methanogenesis especially in the storm sewer norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 has been detected in environments undergoing complex carbon degradation especially those with high amounts of recalcitrant organics baldwin et al 2015 the negative correlations of this taxon with ch4 co2 and organic indicators as well as the positive correlations with storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments were consistent with findings from other storm sewers chen et al 2017 hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 storm runoff from permeable or impervious underlying surfaces is a major pollution source of storm sewers including ida storm sewers and these wastewaters are rich in cellulose hemicellulose humic acid and other refractory organics that are not easily utilized for ch4 production or energy metabolism hosen et al 2014 this suggests that the abundant norank c bacteroidetes vadinha17 does not contribute to ch4 metabolism the significantly discriminant phylum acidobacteria that emerged in these sewer sediments also confirms the pollution source characteristic of their microbiome acidobacteria is a ubiquitous and abundant species of soil habitats jones et al 2009 it can degrade cellulose to produce hydrogen under anaerobic conditions thereby providing substrates for methanogenesis pankratov et al 2012 the alkane degrading bacteria smithella which significantly increased in these sediments and presented a strong correlation with dp reportedly proliferates in environments impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons gray et al 2011 and can promote the conversion of long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons to acetic acid thus forming a syntrophic relationship with methanogens embree et al 2014 indeed storm runoff contains high levels of petroleum derived hydrophobic substrates due to traffic activities durand et al 2004 however although acidobacteria and smithella can promote ch4 production in the sewer a higher efficiency based on refractory substrates would be minimal of critical importance the abundant methanobacterium in these sewer sediments especially their extremely significant link with ida storm sewer sediments implies that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis could be more prevalent than in the sanitary sewer denitrifying bacteria dnb sulfate reducing bacteria srb and their associated metabolic reactions that are enriched in storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments pose significant substrate competition and even toxic inhibition further reducing ch4 production especially in the storm sewer the dnb unclassified f rhodocyclaceae family rhodocyclaceae li et al 2019 was highly enriched in storm sewer sediments and its significant negative correlations with nh3 n tn and ch4 indicate great inhibition of ch4 production products obtained from denitrification e g nitric oxide and nitrous oxide can also inhibit methanogenesis at varying concentrations short et al 2017 high initial sulfate concentrations significant sulfate decrease and abundant srb such as the genera caldisericum mori et al 2009 desulfobulbus sun et al 2014 and sva0081 sediment group family desulfobacteraceae were also found in these sediments methanogenesis can be inhibited via srb mediated sulfur metabolism in a number of ways including 1 competition for substrates due to sulfate reduction 2 sulfate acting as a strong reducing agent to promote orp and 3 production of the toxic product h2s hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 phylum actinobacteria which was observed as significantly discriminant in these sediments was dominant in other sewer systems with high h2s concentrations dong et al 2017 which further confirms the occurrence of sulfate reducing reactions to a certain extent it should be pointed out that however in the limited substrate environment of storm sewer sediments the competition between methanogens dnb and srb is likely to be enhanced although the ida storm sewer sediment microbiome was not conducive to methanogenesis the substrate mass and ch4 flux scale were still close to or even larger than that of the sanitary sewer sediment due to the intermittent or continuous influent of domestic sewage during the formation process additionally a similar level of thiobacillus emerged in both the sanitary sewer and ida storm sewer sediments this species has been shown as primarily responsible for corroding a concrete sewer environment jiang et al 2016 this is very consistent with the general status of the sanitary sewer and ida storm sewer as concrete corrosion often occurs in this environment notably in the absence of exogenous substrate group ii ida storm sewer sediment still produced robust ch4 and co2 fluxes fig s5 and exhibited a drastic enrichment of the fdh enzyme this further suggests its significant carbon emission capability through a possibly unique and unknown mechanism however the specific details and efficiency discrepancies of such a mechanism that could involve metabolic synergy and competition are still unclear 4 2 hydrological patterns affect the links among microbiome structure metabolic function expression and ch4 production capability of sewer sediment exogenous substrate input via influent in hydrological connections especially the bioavailable dom in domestic sewage are the crucial factors resulting in high sediment dom biodegradability and condensation significantly increased sediment dp and promoting the ch4 production capability importantly refreshing the overlying sewage in 10 day cycles revealed that exogenous substrate can rapidly promote ch4 flux from anaerobic systems to reach their peak in a short 24 h period fig s5 this result is consistent with a laboratory flume study showing that sediment beds can quickly become substantially methanogenic within 24 48 h vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 2000 assuming that the hrt is shortened to a certain extent under hydrological connection for example 24 h in the scale of the present study favorable conditions for ch4 generation will ultimately be provided although the practical hrt in sewer systems is generally short its promotion or inhibition of sediment ch4 production capability may vary due to sewer attributes interestingly long term sewage feeding did not cause a differentiation of the sediment microbiome with only smithella increasing significantly hydrological disconnection entails the absence of exogenous substrate and a great depletion of endogenous bioavailable substrate overall low dp facilitating differentiation of the sediment microbial functional capability and a dramatic decrease in ch4 production concurrently the weakened expression of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in sewer sediments as evidenced by the presence of methanobacterium and the related enzymes indicates prevailing acetoclastic methanogenesis following hydrological disconnection given that the bioavailable substrates are broadly exhausted during hydrological disconnection dominance of the acetoclastic pathway might further decrease ch4 production additionally that hydrological pattern promoted the enrichment of enzymes associated with sulfur and nitrogen metabolism as well as the functional microorganisms that are able to rapidly out compete methanogens such as the dnb unclassified f rhodocyclaceae srb desulfobulbus and sulfur utilizing chemolithoautotrophic denitrifier thiobacillus cardoso et al 2006 these enhanced metabolisms facilitated the prominent decrease in content of sulfate and nitrate under hydrological disconnection conditions accordingly ch4 production was mitigated due to kinetic and thermodynamic disadvantages hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 khanal 2008 conversely variation of the enzymes fmda and fdh of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis pathway reduced formic acid utilization for converting to ch4 during hydrological disconnection particularly in the ida storm sewer sediment thus more formic acid could be metabolized into co2 which could cause the immediate and robust co2 flux emitted under this hydrological pattern fig s5 this phenomenon has also been documented during field monitoring of the local storm sewer system chen et al 2020 however in a practical case of in sewer hydrological disconnection oxygen may be more likely to approach the sediment surface causing anoxic or aerobic respiration and accelerating sediment dehydration which might promote carbon efficiency in aerobic respiration and increase co2 production while inhibiting ch4 production mackelprang et al 2011 turbulent suspension of sediment primarily occurs in wet weather or during dry weather with high flow influent even such a hydrological pattern can promote mass transfer and intensify the consumption of bioavailable substrates marked dp decrease however this did not heighten ch4 production on the contrary essentially stagnated methanogenesis was apparent due to failed adhesion and formation of a stable biofilm layer that would have supported the growth and biochemical activities of the microorganisms hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 liu et al 2015b especially in storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments to some extent this finding is similar to that of a study involving individual anaerobic sewage incubations which showed that sewage could produce little ch4 by only relying on its carbon and microbiome chen et al 2020 the drastically enriched dnb unclassified f rhodocyclaceae could also be responsible for inhibition of methanogenesis under suspension conditions moreover the transient ch4 peak that occurred only one day after sediment suspension indicates a short run release of ch4 bubbles or dissolved gasses caused by mobilization of methanogenic sewer sediment under extreme turbulence this has also been observed during the first flush of particular storm events in which the scale of these physical ch4 emissions is of significant magnitude in the short term 10 fold above baseline daelman et al 2012 of note in field hydraulic turbulence may otherwise result in sewage reoxygenation and a higher orp thereby inhibiting methanogenesis in addition a certain amount of ch4 produced from sanitary sewer sediment in suspension may be related to elevated mas transfer high vs ts and abundant hydrolytic acidogenic bacteria yu et al 2017 5 conclusions this study provides new insights into the crucial links among sewer sediment ch4 production and the impacts of source associated sewer sediment type and hydrological pattern taking into account the increasing uncertainty of urban hydrology caused by climatic change and intense construction of sewer networks fueled by global urbanization and improved sanitation this work will help to stimulate and guide the resolution of bottom up system scale carbon budgets and ghg sources as well as the target ch4 abatement interventions findings here also contribute to a better understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings involving the adaptive differentiation of microbiomes and gene function capability in sewer sediment and their key roles in mediating anaerobic metabolism the results show 1 sanitary sewer sediment has a high ch4 production capability due to enriched biologically active substrate dominant acetoclastic methanogenesis and the syntrophic interactions among functional microorganisms 2 storm sewer and ida storm sewer sediments present insufficient microbial function supporting efficient methanogenesis with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis prevailing in both these sediments 3 storm sewer sediment has an extremely low ch4 production capability while ida storm sewer sediment shows substantial ch4 production 4 hydrological connection promotes the sewer sediment biodegradability and ch4 production capability 5 hydrological disconnection facilitates acetoclastic methanogenesis sulfate reduction and denitrification while decreasing ch4 production and 6 turbulent suspension of sediment results in the stagnation of methanogenesis given the significant discrepancy between sanitary sewers and storm sewers as well as those altered under different hydrological patterns this work further highlights the
