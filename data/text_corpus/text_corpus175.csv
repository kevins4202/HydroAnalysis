875,interfaces between sediments and water bodies often represent biochemical hotspots for nutrient reactions and are characterized by steep concentration gradients of different reactive solutes vertical profiles of these concentrations are routinely collected to obtain information on nutrient dynamics and simple codes have been developed to analyze these profiles and determine the magnitude and distribution of reaction rates within sediments however existing publicly available codes do not consider the potential contribution of water flow in the sediments to nutrient transport and their applications to field sites with significant water borne nutrient fluxes may lead to large errors in the estimated reaction rates to fill this gap the present work presents gradient a novel algorithm to evaluate distributions of reaction rates from observed concentration profiles gradient is a matlab code that extends a previously published framework to include the role of nutrient advection and provides robust estimates of reaction rates in sediments with significant water flow this work discusses the theoretical basis of the method and shows its performance by comparing the results to a series of synthetic data and to laboratory experiments the results clearly show that in systems with losing or gaining fluxes the inclusion of such fluxes is critical for estimating local and overall reaction rates in sediments 1 introduction chemical gradients in aquatic systems occur ubiquitously across boundaries such as the water sediment interface in streams lakes and oceans gundersen and jorgensen 1990 krause et al 2009 stierli et al 1998 these gradients usually span from millimeter to meter scales depending on the local hydrochemical conditions and reaction rates the concentration gradients and the resulting solute fluxes are often characterized by different redox conditions and are therefore associated with a high diversity of biogeochemical reactions this is why water sediment interfaces are associated with enhanced microbial activity and are often referred to as hot spots for reactions and biological activity palmer felgate et al 2010 lautz and fanelli 2008 fischer et al 2005 harvey et al 2013 knapp et al 2017 interpretation of chemical gradients is important for understanding local and even global biogeochemical cycles revsbech et al 2005 jørgensen and revsbech 1985 grimm et al 2008 initial works were focused on the oceanic benthic environments and were based on the assumption that solute transport across the water sediment interface is driven by diffusion e g rysgaard and berg 1996 and that transport within the sediments is mainly affected by diffusion dispersion and reactions a major leap forward was done by the pioneering work of berg et al 1998 that expanded the framework of reactive transport across interfaces and developed an efficient algorithm to determine a vertical profile of reaction rate the work by berg et al 1998 resulted in a computer code called profile that enabled the interpretation of measured concentration profiles in sediment pore water the numerical procedure begins by finding a series of least square fits to the measured concentration profile followed by comparisons of these fits through statistical f testing berg et al 1998 the final output is a vertical distribution of reaction rates in the sediments since 1998 the profile code or similar models based on diffusive like fluxes were extensively used to analyze reactions in ocean sediments e g glud et al 2009 hyporheic flow in streams e g zak et al 2006 o connor and harvey 2008 lakes e g rahalkar et al 2009 wetlands larsen et al 2015 and wastewater treatment reactors e g satoh et al 2004 profile also allowed including bioturbation a diffusion like transport caused by random movements of meiofauna and irrigation pumping activity of tube dwelling animals transport mechanisms earlier work shows that the oxygen gradients and consumption are also influenced by hydrodynamic effects guss 1998 and by the structure roughness of the surface jørgensen and des marais 1990 glud 2008 jørgensen and des marais 1990 for example acknowledged that the topography has a significant effect on diffusive boundary layer dbl and oxygen fluxes and proposed a correction for the flux calculation but did not discuss in details the reason for the differences the aforementioned correction may be applicable for slow flowing systems in laminar flow such as lakes and oceans but is probably not valid for streams where flow is usually turbulent the interaction between the stream water velocity and sediment structures e g bed forms produces significant pressure differences across the streambed that drive advective flow into the sediments boano et al 2014 effects of hyporheic flow on oxygen uptake in streams was first modeled by rutherford et al 1995 and was later modeled using the profile model by o connor and harvey 2008 in addition to the advective fluxes driven by the physical structure of the streambed termed from now on hyporheic flux the interaction between stream and groundwater may produce additional exchange flow boano et al 2014 below the streambed an upward vertical flux into the stream will occur when the groundwater level is higher than the water in the stream gaining condition while a downward vertical flux into the aquifer will occur when the hydraulic head of the groundwater is lower than the water in the stream losing condition it was also recently reported in experimental and modeling studies that increasing losing or gaining fluxes lead to decreasing hyporheic fluxes fox et al 2014 trauth et al 2013 cardenas and wilson 2007 it also appeared in the aforementioned studies that the reduction in hyporheic flux was similar for the same magnitude of the losing or gaining fluxes regardless of the vertical flow direction the interpretation of reactive transport in streambeds is sometimes done by relatively complex 2d 3d numerical codes that require advanced modeling skills high computational efforts and long run times e g bardini et al 2012 trauth et al 2013 alternatively a number of researchers have developed their own 1d approaches to analyze specific laboratory or field datasets in presence of water flow for instance some authors have proposed to represent solute advection using an effective dispersion coefficient elliott and brooks 1997a b bhaskar et al 2012 thus allowing the application of profile even in presence of water flow e g o connor and harvey 2008 larsen et al 2015 while this dispersive approach allowed to circumvent the lack of explicit modeling of advection by profile it must be stressed that the use of an equivalent dispersion coefficient is valid only for a limited range of times elliott and brooks 1997a marion and zaramella 2005 and for transient conditions i e in response to temporal variations of solute concentrations in surface water the existence of these limitations makes a case for the development of a method that explicitly accounts for solute advection recently the role of advection was indeed included in a study by knapp et al 2017 who analyzed the dynamics in streambed sediments of a conservative solute bromide and two reactive tracers resazurin and resorufin after tracer injection in the stream this study employed an optimization procedure on a set of coupled advection dispersion reaction equations to jointly assess water velocity dispersion coefficient and first order reaction rates for all tracers while definitely more advanced than previous approaches the method focused on first order reactions which were considered appropriate for the specific tracers employed in the study and the modeling code was not provided in the manuscript the previous discussion demonstrates the need for methods for the interpretation of chemical gradients that are collected routinely in many studies these methods should be a easily available to the interested researcher b relatively quick and simple to use and c able to describe water flow without suffering from the limitations of dispersion based approaches to achieve this aim this work presents gradient a mathematical framework for calculating depth distributed reaction rates from 1d vertical solute gradients in stream sediments where vertical fluxes e g losing or gaining fluxes are present gradient whose code is included in this manuscript was developed as a matlab script and is based on an algorithm that extends the profile code by berg et al 1998 to include the presence of solute advection induced by vertical water flow the present study demonstrates that gradient can be applied to interpret 1d profiles of solute concentrations when vertical water flow occurs and discusses the robustness of the estimated reaction rates in the presence of uncertainty arising from experimental factors such as measurements errors and sampling resolution 2 methods this section is divided in two parts first the theoretical background of the gradient algorithm is presented then the theoretical and experimental cases employed in the validation phase are described the complete matlab code of the gradient algorithm is reported in the supplementary material 2 1 gradient algorithm the core of the gradient algorithm is the advection dispersion equation for the mass balance of a generic reactive solute 1 d φ z d z r z where 2 φ z q c φ d d c d z represents the solute flux per unit area at depth z increasing downwards r z is the reaction rate per unit bulk volume q is water flux per unit area i e a darcian velocity c z is the solute concentration φ z is sediment porosity and d is the dispersion coefficient in the sediments it should be noticed that the dispersion coefficient d represents the combined effects of molecular diffusion in which case the value of d is always lower than corresponding value dm in free water because of the effect of sediment tortuosity and mechanical dispersion due to heterogeneity in pore velocities even though previous approaches berg et al 1998 considered the potential contribute of solute fluxes induced by the presence of macroinvertebrates e g baranov et al 2016 these fluxes are not included in gradient because their quantification requires additional parameters whose values are extremely uncertain the first term in eq 2 represents the contribution to solute transport of advection by water flow and constitutes the novelty of the present algorithm compared to previously proposed approaches the domain is discretized into n elementary cells with vertical size zi i 2 n 1 plus two additional cells with vanishing extensions z1 zn 2 0 that are used to impose boundary conditions for the ith cell the discretized form of eqs 1 and 2 is 3 φ i 1 2 φ i 1 2 r i δ z i where the i subscript indicates that the corresponding quantity is evaluated at z zi solute fluxes φ i 1 2 and φ i 1 2 are calculated at the upper and lower cell boundary respectively and are expressed as 4 φ i 1 2 q c i 1 2 k i 1 2 c i 1 c i where the boundary concentrations c i 1 2 are calculated by linear interpolating values at the adjacent cells and k i 1 2 represent a dispersive transfer coefficient at the lower boundary these quantities are given by 5 c i 1 2 δ z i c i 1 δ z i 1 c i δ z i δ z i 1 6 k i 1 2 2 φ i d i φ i 1 d i 1 δ z i φ i 1 d i 1 δ z i 1 φ i d i and analogous expressions hold for the upper boundary following berg et al 1998 the coefficient k i 1 2 for dispersive transfer through a boundary is calculated as a harmonic average of the value at the adjacent cells because this formulation improves numerical stability in case of sharp variations in dispersion properties between cells the coupling among eqs 3 6 for the different cells is represented by a system of n coupled equations which is expressed in matrix form as 7 a i j c i b i where cj is a nx1 vector of concentration values aij is a nxn tridiagonal coefficient matrix and bi is a nx1 coefficient vector 8 a i i 1 q δ z i δ z i 1 δ z i k i 1 a i i q δ z i 1 δ z i 1 δ z i δ z i 1 δ z i δ z i 1 k j 1 k i 1 a i i 1 q δ z i δ z i δ z i 1 k i 1 i 2 n 1 9 b i r i δ z i i 2 n 1 with other terms in aij being equal to zero the expressions 8 and 9 must be coupled with two boundary conditions to complete the system the most straightforward choice is to apply a couple of dirichlet boundary conditions to ensure that the uppermost c1 and lowermost cn 2 concentrations coincide with the measured values cup and cdown at the highest and lowest observation points respectively these conditions are expressed as 10 a 1 1 1 b 1 c u p a n 2 n 2 1 b n 2 c d o w n alternatively if the solute flux at one of the boundaries is known the dirichlet condition at this boundary can be replaced by a neumann boundary condition the corresponding conditions 10 hence become 11 a 1 1 k 2 a 1 2 k 2 b 1 φ u p a n 2 n 1 k n 1 a n 2 n 2 k n 1 b n 2 φ d o w n it should be noted that aij depends on transport coefficients q d that must be specified by the user while bi depends on the unknown reaction rate values ri that are determined by the algorithm values of q can be derived from data collection of hydraulic e g kennedy et al 2009 or thermal e g hatch et al 2006 observations or from inverse modeling of conservative tracer concentrations e g larsen et al 2014 the dispersion coefficient d is given by the contribution of molecular diffusion in the porous medium and of mechanical dispersion the molecular diffusion coefficient of a given solute is typically obtained from tabulated values with a correction due to the porous medium tortuosity the mechanical dispersion coefficient is calculated as the product of water velocity and sediment dispersivity the latter depending on sediment type and on the scale of the domain schulze makuch 2005 for a given set of ri values the solution of the system of equations 7 provides the concentration values ci along the profile these values of ri are identified through a fitting procedure that minimizes the sum of squared errors sse between predicted and observed concentrations namely 12 min r i s s e min r i j 1 p c j i n t c j o b s 2 where p is the number of available observations cj obs and cj int are obtained by interpolating the n concentrations obtained from eq 7 at the p depths where concentrations cj obs were observed a typical issue with optimization problems such as eq 12 is that the number m of calibration parameters must be lower than the number of observations p to avoid overparametrization which would lead to unreliable and potentially unphysical estimates of reaction rates following berg et al 1998 the reaction rate profile r z is described as a stepwise sequence of m reaction rate values with m p specifically a two phase procedure is adopted to find the optimal number m of reaction rates in the first phase eq 12 is repeatedly solved using an increasing number m of reaction rates the value of m is progressively increased from unity up to a user specified value that must be lower than p at each step the depth of the profile is divided into m equally spaced zones with constant reaction rates whose values are calculated applying eq 12 to assess if the use of a higher number of calibration parameters results in a statistically significant improvement of the model fit all the solutions are compared with f tests see appendix a to identify the best value of m gradient leaves the user the choice of whether employing the suggested value of m or specifying a different value in the second phase zones with similar values of reaction rates are progressively merged at each step the algorithm merges the consecutive zones with the most similar reaction rates and an f test is applied to assess if the original reaction profile provides a more significant fit to the observed data than the merged one the same operations are repeated until only a single zone is left in this way a stepwise reaction rate profile with variable spacing is obtained thus avoiding the constraint of a constant size of the reaction zones as before the user can either choose the m value suggested by the statistical test or specify a different value the data and parameters described in the previous paragraph that the user must supply as input information to apply the gradient code are a concentration profile arranged as an ascii text file first column depth mm second column porosity optional third column concentration mg l a value for porosity φ if not provided in the previous file a value for the magnitude of the vertical flux q cm d the user is also asked to specify if the flow direction is upward or downward a value for the dispersion coefficient d cm2 s if this value represents molecular diffusion the variable flag tortuosity in the code can be modified to correct this value for the effect of sediment tortuosity 2 2 validation procedure and applications the algorithm was applied to synthetically generated data to verify the performance of the proposed method under variations in fluxes and concentrations after validation controlled laboratory flume experiments were used to demonstrate how gradient is utilized to analyze observed concentration profiles 2 2 1 synthetic data validation of the gradient code was done through its application to synthetic data that represented two cases of reaction rate profiles in case 1 a homogenous production rate r 0 was applied over a sediment domain with depth l 10 cm while case 2 had a spatially variable consumption rate r 0 over the same depth the values of the reaction rates are reported in table 1 unless specified otherwise all examples were characterized by a sediment porosity φ 0 30 a dispersion coefficient d 9 0 10 11 m2 s and by a downward flux q 5 0 10 9 m s 0 43 mm d these values correspond to a peclet number pe q l d 5 56 o 1 which indicates that both advection and dispersion contribute to solute transport in a comparable way synthetic concentration values were generated as surrogate observations by solving eqs 1 and 2 with the boundary conditions reported in table 1 and with a spatial resolution of 1 mm the values of the damköhler number da ravg l q cmax where ravg is the average reaction rate and cmax is the maximum concentration are 1 3 and 2 0 for case 1 and 2 respectively da values of the order of unity imply that the role of reaction and advective transport were very similar thus indicating that the shape of the concentration profiles was strongly influenced by water flow furthermore a 2d comsol model similar to the one of bardini et al 2012 of a streambed dune was developed to test the influence of non vertical flow on gradient performance the average depth of the streambed was 11 cm and the dune height and length were equal to 2 cm and 15 cm respectively other parameters characterizing surface flow and sediments were chosen as in the laboratory experiments described in section 2 2 2 while a constant consumption rate r 10 4 g m3 s and a losing water flux q 20 cm d at the sediment bottom were imposed this configuration corresponds to pe 4 103 and da 0 8 i e advection dominates solute transport and the role of reaction is comparable to the one of advection the flow field was determined by solving the darcy s equation for incompressible flow with boundary conditions given by i no horizontal flow at the side boundaries ii constant water flux equal to q at the streambed bottom and iii a sinusoidal distribution of hydraulic head at the streambed top calculated as in fox et al 2014 dissolved oxygen concentrations were obtained by solving a 2d version of the mass balance eqs 1 and 2 with water velocities derived from the darcy s equation and boundary conditions given by i no oxygen flux at the side boundaries ii concentration equal to the saturation value 8 3 mg l at the streambed top and iii no oxygen diffusion i e c z 0 at the streambed bottom once the model was solved concentration values along a vertical profile located at the stoss side namely 1 4 of the dune length were extracted and analyzed with gradient 2 2 2 laboratory setup a series of flume experiments was used to demonstrate the importance of losing and gaining flow conditions on reactions rates in streambeds de falco et al 2016 in these experiments oxygen profiles were measured in a flume packed with natural silica sand φ 0 42 and organized into bed forms which were 15 cm long and 1 5 cm high for more details see de falco et al 2016 a peristaltic pump was connected to a drainage system that was positioned at the bottom of the flume and allowed the control on the downwelling or upwelling fluxes fox et al 2014 biofilm growth was achieved by seeding of microorganisms that were scraped from natural sediments and supplying periodically sodium benzoate as a carbon source and nutrients such as n and p after three months of biofilm growth under overlying water velocity of 12 cm s a set of oxygen profiles were measured with a clark type oxygen microelectrode system mounted on a micromanipulator with a computerized depth control and data acquisition unisense aarhus denmark the measurements started two hours after spiking sodium benzoate and while maintaining its concentration at 9 1 mg l the oxygen profiles were measured at the middle of the stoss side of a bed form and under overlying water velocity at 12 cm s and losing or gaining fluxes of 50 cm d under these flow conditions the bed forms were stationary afterwards the bed forms were manually mixed to evenly distribute the biomass in the streambed and the oxygen profiles were measured again under the same flow conditions de falco et al 2016 3 results and discussion in this section gradient is first validated using the synthetic data for the cases summarized in table 1 the effects of water flow errors in concentration data and sampling resolution on the reaction rates are also discussed then a numerical test of the influence of non vertical flow components on gradient performance is described finally an application of gradient to observed profiles of dissolved oxygen concentration from laboratory experiments is presented 3 1 validation the performance of gradient in recovering the concentrations in a profile with a constant reaction rate and in presence of vertical water flow is shown in fig 1 case 1 table 1 the results show that the reaction rate profile was correctly identified the model fit to the input concentration data is also extremely accurate a close inspection of the model reveals that the recovered reaction profile is actually composed of three reaction zones whose values are within 0 1 error between the average recovered rate and the true rate the ability of gradient to identify spatially variable reaction rates is shown in fig 2 the optimal number of zones suggested by the algorithm is five which corresponds to the actual number of zones in the stepwise reaction profile case 2 table 1 calculated consumption rates are almost identical to the true values with an average error that was lower than 0 01 this performance demonstrates the potential of gradient to identify reaction hotspots due for instance to localized accumulation of fine particles with high specific surface area hartwig et al 2015 or to higher amounts of microbial biomass and activity caruso et al 2017 3 2 effect of vertical advective fluxes as previously discussed including the presence of advective fluxes due to water seepage is crucial for a correct evaluation of reaction rates in sediments to exemplify this concept gradient was applied to the synthetic concentration data of both cases 1 and 2 assuming different incorrect values for the water flux q specifically the concentration profiles were analyzed assuming q values equal to zero and to 50 of the correct value each recovered reaction profile was also integrated over depth to determine a value of surficial reaction rate per unit sediment area these calculated surficial reaction rates are compared to the integrated rates of the true values shown in table 2 for the homogeneous reaction profile of case 1 fig 3 shows that if water flux was neglected q 0 top panel the estimated reaction profile was no longer constant interestingly the error was not systematic as reaction rates were underestimated in shallower sediments where almost no reaction is predicted while they were largely overestimated the true value at larger depths the results in fig 3 top panel represent the errors that would result from the application of the profile code which does not include the presence of solute advection to situations where water flow occurs and significantly contributes to solute transport this example demonstrates the need to employ methods such as gradient to analyze concentration datasets if the presence of water seepage cannot be excluded when the value of q was lower than the true value 50 central panel estimated reaction rates increased in the shallower region of sediments and decreased in the deeper region if q is overestimated 50 bottom panel estimated reaction rates in the deepest sediments decrease so much that solute is predicted to be consumed rather than produced these results exemplify how the distribution of reaction rates over depth is sensitive to solute advection by water seepage interestingly when reaction rates were integrated over depth the resulting values of surficial reaction rates in case 1 were found to be only marginally affected by errors in input water flux 2 table 2 the same approach was applied to analyze the influence of water flow on the depth variable reaction rates of case 2 table 1 results are displayed in fig 4 for the assumptions of no input flow top panel and input flow smaller 50 central panel and larger 50 bottom panel as before the algorithm adjusted the estimated reaction rates to compensate for the errors in the value of q the figure shows that the estimated reaction rates were more positive for smaller values of the downwelling water flux when water flow was neglected fig 4 top panel a reaction pattern characterized by an alternation of production and consumption zones was erroneously predicted it is particularly important to notice that for case 2 the input value of q had a stronger influence on the values of surficial reaction rates compared to case 1 table 2 the largest errors were found when water flow was not considered q 0 with an underestimation of the consumption rates of two orders of magnitude these findings demonstrate that the presence of water flow should not be overlooked considered even when average rates of solute turnover are investigated 3 3 effect of experimental errors in real applications observed concentration data are subject to errors e g due to instrumental noise which implies that the input concentration values are not error free as for the previous examples to assess this influence the effect of experimental errors was simulated by adding randomly generated errors to the synthetic concentration values of case 1 errors were generated by randomly sampling a gaussian distribution with zero mean value and a standard deviation of 0 1 mg l i e approximately 0 7 of the maximum concentration in this way 100 concentration profiles were generated and were analyzed with gradient the resulting reaction rates are shown in fig 5 mean values along depth standard deviation the figure shows that the average estimated rate was very close to the true value however at each depth the standard deviation for the reaction rate ranged between 5 and 27 of the true value these results indicate that reaction rates estimated from a single concentration profile are quite sensitive to experimental errors this finding implies that it is recommend to calculate an average reaction profile r z by collecting multiple measurements at each depth and employing all available profiles to estimate reaction rates the 100 reaction rate profiles from fig 5 were also averaged over the depth of the sediments to produce the surficial reaction rates which ranged between 0 97 1 03 10 7 g m2 s these values are hence very similar to the correct value of 1 0 10 7 g m2 s with errors lower than 5 these rather small differences indicate that the errors shown in fig 5 were evenly distributed along the vertical profile and they were cancelled out when averaging over the vertical profile therefore surficial reaction rates calculated by gradient are much less sensitive to experimental errors compared to vertical rate profiles and they thus represent robust estimates of true rates of solute reaction 3 4 effect of sampling resolution the spatial resolution of the available concentration data affects the level of detail of the observed concentration profile to be analyzed therefore the influence of the resolution of input concentration data on reaction rates estimated by gradient was assessed by repeating the analysis of case 2 using only 20 values of synthetic concentration instead of the 100 used in section 3 1 results are presented in fig 6 which displays the gradient fit to the 20 concentration data and the reaction rate profile that was consequently estimated the results show that sampling resolution had a moderate influence on the estimated profile of consumption rate the consumption peaks were correctly recovered because of their strong fingerprint on the concentration profile while the lowest rates exhibited some errors including a slight production at uppermost and lowermost points the average surficial rate was 3 7 10 9 g m2 s which is quite similar to the true value 4 0 10 9 g m2 s these findings suggest that gradient can provide a good estimate of the reaction rates as long as the sampling resolution is detailed enough to capture the major features of the concentration profile 3 5 influence of non vertical flow one of the most limiting assumptions of gradient is that water flow is considered to be purely vertical while any horizontal flow component is neglected the presence of non vertical flow will induce errors in the reaction rates estimated with gradient and it is hence important to assess its sensitivity to this horizontal advection when gradient is applied the estimated reaction rate at a given depth compensates the net horizontal advective flux at the same depth this advective flux is given by the interaction between horizontal gradients of water velocity and concentration because the latter is influenced by nonlocal factors namely the spatial distributions of velocity and reaction rate over the whole domain errors in gradient results are site specific and are not uniquely determined by the local magnitude of horizontal velocity the influence of non vertical advection was tested through the numerical example of dissolved oxygen dynamics in streambed sediments described in section 2 2 1 the simulation results are presented in fig 7 where white lines represent water flowpaths and the black line indicates the location of the concentration profile that was analyzed with gradient water flow along this profile deviates significantly from the vertical direction the average angle with the vertical axis being equal to 18 and reaching a maximum of 53 at the streambed surface the magnitude of vertical velocity also varies over depth and the average value q 21 7 cm d was chosen for the application of gradient the results of the gradient analysis of this synthetic concentration profile are depicted in fig 8 which shows that even though the concentration profile was correctly modeled the consumption rates are slightly misestimated the average error in the estimated reaction rates is 8 and it ranges between 5 and 25 depending on the intensity of the horizontal flux as expected the largest error occurs near the surface where the horizontal velocity component is the highest however the magnitude of these errors is not very high given that the flow field shown in fig 7 significantly deviates from the 1d assumption of gradient 3 6 application to laboratory data the profiles of dissolved oxygen concentration observed at the stoss side of a sandy bed form are shown in figs 9 and 10 for losing and gaining flow conditions respectively at these points vertical water fluxes were calculated as described by fox et al 2014 to account for the influence of the bed form shape which led to values of q equal to 51 and 48 cm d for losing and gaining flow conditions respectively the comparison between the left panels of figs 9 and 10 reveals that the shape of the oxygen profiles was very different for the two flow conditions under losing conditions oxygen concentration progressively decreased with depth as the dissolved organic carbon doc advection from surface water to sediments stimulated heterotrophic respiration under gaining flow conditions upward water flow toward the streambed surface hampered nutrient supply to the shallowest sediment thus limiting heterotrophic respiration to a thin layer where oxygen concentrations dropped this picture is confirmed by the reaction rate profiles estimated by gradient in the right panels of figs 9 and 10 which show a steeper decay of oxygen consumption rates for the case of gaining conditions moreover the surficial reaction rates reported in table 3 indicate that the rate of oxygen consumption was more intense 57 under losing flow conditions compared to gaining flow conditions during the second phase of the experiments sediments were mixed to verify if bed stirring e g due to flood events affects the distribution and activity of microbial biomass in the streambed results indicated that microbial biomass was evenly distributed after the mixing de falco et al 2016 the concentration profiles not shown were analyzed with gradient and the estimated surficial oxygen consumption rates are reported in table 3 the results indicate that bed mixing led to a strong increase in the surficial consumption rate for losing conditions 314 the reaction rate under gaining conditions was also enhanced as compared to the non mixed sediments however the magnitude of the increase under gaining conditions 44 was lower than for losing conditions these increases can be explained by the more even distribution of microbial biomass in the sediments which may have provided more chances for oxygen consumption over the entire profile of the active streambed additionally sediment disturbance could have reduced pore clogging by microbial biofilm thus enhancing nutrient supply and heterotrophic respiration in the streambed caruso et al 2017 4 conclusions this study presented a novel and simple 1d approach for the analysis of chemical gradients in sediments in the presence of vertical flow conditions the synthetic and experimental data that were analyzed demonstrated how estimated reaction rates can be highly sensitive to the direction and magnitude of water fluxes hence pointing out the need for tools that properly consider the role of solute advection for those applications where flow is expected between surface water and sediments the proposed algorithm fulfils this purpose and represents an effective method to calculate reaction rates in cases where water flow significantly contributes to solute transport application of gradient to data from laboratory experiments has demonstrated that the proposed approach can help to interpret reaction processes that control oxygen consumption in sediments but is applicable to all kind of problems that deal with solute fate within sediments the aforementioned examples have shown that the spatial resolution of data sampling has only a minor influence on gradient results on the other hand experimental errors in concentration data strongly affect vertical distribution of reaction rates but have a limited influence on the surficial average rates replicate observations of solute concentration at each sediment depth should hence be collected to better assess the vertical distribution of reaction rates however robust estimates of average rates can be easily obtained even when no replicates are available appendix a f test procedure the gradient algorithm identifies a set of reaction rate profiles that are characterized by different number of zones with homogeneous rates of reaction hereinafter referred to as calibration parameters the comparison of two profiles with m1 and m2 parameters with m1 m2 relies on the calculation of the f statistic a1 f s s e 1 s s e 2 m 2 m 1 s s e 2 p m 2 where sse is defined by eq 12 and p denotes the number of observations the tested hypothesis is that increasing the number of parameters from m1 to m2 does not significantly improve the fit to the observed data this hypothesis is tested by evaluating the probability associated with the calculated f value which is described by an f distribution with m2 m1 p m2 degrees of freedom if this probability falls below a significance level p e g p 01 the test is passed and the hypothesis is rejected the profile with m2 parameters is thus chosen during the first phase section 2 1 profiles with increasing numbers of parameters are compared first m1 and m2 are set equal to 1 and 2 respectively and the following steps are iteratively performed 1 an f test is performed to compare profiles with m1 and m2 parameters 2 if the f test is passed set m1 m2 and m2 m1 1 go to step 4 3 if the f test is not passed set m2 m2 1 go to step 4 4 repeat steps 1 3 until the maximum value of m2 is reached without passing the f test the last value of m2 that passed the f test is selected for the next phase in the second phase of the procedure profiles are progressively merged section 2 1 and the f test is performed between profiles with decreasing values of parameters m2 is initially set to the value determined in the first phase while m1 m2 1 the following steps are then performed 1 an f test is performed to compare profiles with m1 and m2 parameters 2 if the f test is passed m1 is selected as the best option the procedure is completed 3 if the f test is not passed set m1 m1 1 go to step 4 4 repeat steps 1 3 if the test is never passed the original value of m2 is selected as best option in both phases the user is allowed the option to choose a value that is different from the one

875,interfaces between sediments and water bodies often represent biochemical hotspots for nutrient reactions and are characterized by steep concentration gradients of different reactive solutes vertical profiles of these concentrations are routinely collected to obtain information on nutrient dynamics and simple codes have been developed to analyze these profiles and determine the magnitude and distribution of reaction rates within sediments however existing publicly available codes do not consider the potential contribution of water flow in the sediments to nutrient transport and their applications to field sites with significant water borne nutrient fluxes may lead to large errors in the estimated reaction rates to fill this gap the present work presents gradient a novel algorithm to evaluate distributions of reaction rates from observed concentration profiles gradient is a matlab code that extends a previously published framework to include the role of nutrient advection and provides robust estimates of reaction rates in sediments with significant water flow this work discusses the theoretical basis of the method and shows its performance by comparing the results to a series of synthetic data and to laboratory experiments the results clearly show that in systems with losing or gaining fluxes the inclusion of such fluxes is critical for estimating local and overall reaction rates in sediments 1 introduction chemical gradients in aquatic systems occur ubiquitously across boundaries such as the water sediment interface in streams lakes and oceans gundersen and jorgensen 1990 krause et al 2009 stierli et al 1998 these gradients usually span from millimeter to meter scales depending on the local hydrochemical conditions and reaction rates the concentration gradients and the resulting solute fluxes are often characterized by different redox conditions and are therefore associated with a high diversity of biogeochemical reactions this is why water sediment interfaces are associated with enhanced microbial activity and are often referred to as hot spots for reactions and biological activity palmer felgate et al 2010 lautz and fanelli 2008 fischer et al 2005 harvey et al 2013 knapp et al 2017 interpretation of chemical gradients is important for understanding local and even global biogeochemical cycles revsbech et al 2005 jørgensen and revsbech 1985 grimm et al 2008 initial works were focused on the oceanic benthic environments and were based on the assumption that solute transport across the water sediment interface is driven by diffusion e g rysgaard and berg 1996 and that transport within the sediments is mainly affected by diffusion dispersion and reactions a major leap forward was done by the pioneering work of berg et al 1998 that expanded the framework of reactive transport across interfaces and developed an efficient algorithm to determine a vertical profile of reaction rate the work by berg et al 1998 resulted in a computer code called profile that enabled the interpretation of measured concentration profiles in sediment pore water the numerical procedure begins by finding a series of least square fits to the measured concentration profile followed by comparisons of these fits through statistical f testing berg et al 1998 the final output is a vertical distribution of reaction rates in the sediments since 1998 the profile code or similar models based on diffusive like fluxes were extensively used to analyze reactions in ocean sediments e g glud et al 2009 hyporheic flow in streams e g zak et al 2006 o connor and harvey 2008 lakes e g rahalkar et al 2009 wetlands larsen et al 2015 and wastewater treatment reactors e g satoh et al 2004 profile also allowed including bioturbation a diffusion like transport caused by random movements of meiofauna and irrigation pumping activity of tube dwelling animals transport mechanisms earlier work shows that the oxygen gradients and consumption are also influenced by hydrodynamic effects guss 1998 and by the structure roughness of the surface jørgensen and des marais 1990 glud 2008 jørgensen and des marais 1990 for example acknowledged that the topography has a significant effect on diffusive boundary layer dbl and oxygen fluxes and proposed a correction for the flux calculation but did not discuss in details the reason for the differences the aforementioned correction may be applicable for slow flowing systems in laminar flow such as lakes and oceans but is probably not valid for streams where flow is usually turbulent the interaction between the stream water velocity and sediment structures e g bed forms produces significant pressure differences across the streambed that drive advective flow into the sediments boano et al 2014 effects of hyporheic flow on oxygen uptake in streams was first modeled by rutherford et al 1995 and was later modeled using the profile model by o connor and harvey 2008 in addition to the advective fluxes driven by the physical structure of the streambed termed from now on hyporheic flux the interaction between stream and groundwater may produce additional exchange flow boano et al 2014 below the streambed an upward vertical flux into the stream will occur when the groundwater level is higher than the water in the stream gaining condition while a downward vertical flux into the aquifer will occur when the hydraulic head of the groundwater is lower than the water in the stream losing condition it was also recently reported in experimental and modeling studies that increasing losing or gaining fluxes lead to decreasing hyporheic fluxes fox et al 2014 trauth et al 2013 cardenas and wilson 2007 it also appeared in the aforementioned studies that the reduction in hyporheic flux was similar for the same magnitude of the losing or gaining fluxes regardless of the vertical flow direction the interpretation of reactive transport in streambeds is sometimes done by relatively complex 2d 3d numerical codes that require advanced modeling skills high computational efforts and long run times e g bardini et al 2012 trauth et al 2013 alternatively a number of researchers have developed their own 1d approaches to analyze specific laboratory or field datasets in presence of water flow for instance some authors have proposed to represent solute advection using an effective dispersion coefficient elliott and brooks 1997a b bhaskar et al 2012 thus allowing the application of profile even in presence of water flow e g o connor and harvey 2008 larsen et al 2015 while this dispersive approach allowed to circumvent the lack of explicit modeling of advection by profile it must be stressed that the use of an equivalent dispersion coefficient is valid only for a limited range of times elliott and brooks 1997a marion and zaramella 2005 and for transient conditions i e in response to temporal variations of solute concentrations in surface water the existence of these limitations makes a case for the development of a method that explicitly accounts for solute advection recently the role of advection was indeed included in a study by knapp et al 2017 who analyzed the dynamics in streambed sediments of a conservative solute bromide and two reactive tracers resazurin and resorufin after tracer injection in the stream this study employed an optimization procedure on a set of coupled advection dispersion reaction equations to jointly assess water velocity dispersion coefficient and first order reaction rates for all tracers while definitely more advanced than previous approaches the method focused on first order reactions which were considered appropriate for the specific tracers employed in the study and the modeling code was not provided in the manuscript the previous discussion demonstrates the need for methods for the interpretation of chemical gradients that are collected routinely in many studies these methods should be a easily available to the interested researcher b relatively quick and simple to use and c able to describe water flow without suffering from the limitations of dispersion based approaches to achieve this aim this work presents gradient a mathematical framework for calculating depth distributed reaction rates from 1d vertical solute gradients in stream sediments where vertical fluxes e g losing or gaining fluxes are present gradient whose code is included in this manuscript was developed as a matlab script and is based on an algorithm that extends the profile code by berg et al 1998 to include the presence of solute advection induced by vertical water flow the present study demonstrates that gradient can be applied to interpret 1d profiles of solute concentrations when vertical water flow occurs and discusses the robustness of the estimated reaction rates in the presence of uncertainty arising from experimental factors such as measurements errors and sampling resolution 2 methods this section is divided in two parts first the theoretical background of the gradient algorithm is presented then the theoretical and experimental cases employed in the validation phase are described the complete matlab code of the gradient algorithm is reported in the supplementary material 2 1 gradient algorithm the core of the gradient algorithm is the advection dispersion equation for the mass balance of a generic reactive solute 1 d φ z d z r z where 2 φ z q c φ d d c d z represents the solute flux per unit area at depth z increasing downwards r z is the reaction rate per unit bulk volume q is water flux per unit area i e a darcian velocity c z is the solute concentration φ z is sediment porosity and d is the dispersion coefficient in the sediments it should be noticed that the dispersion coefficient d represents the combined effects of molecular diffusion in which case the value of d is always lower than corresponding value dm in free water because of the effect of sediment tortuosity and mechanical dispersion due to heterogeneity in pore velocities even though previous approaches berg et al 1998 considered the potential contribute of solute fluxes induced by the presence of macroinvertebrates e g baranov et al 2016 these fluxes are not included in gradient because their quantification requires additional parameters whose values are extremely uncertain the first term in eq 2 represents the contribution to solute transport of advection by water flow and constitutes the novelty of the present algorithm compared to previously proposed approaches the domain is discretized into n elementary cells with vertical size zi i 2 n 1 plus two additional cells with vanishing extensions z1 zn 2 0 that are used to impose boundary conditions for the ith cell the discretized form of eqs 1 and 2 is 3 φ i 1 2 φ i 1 2 r i δ z i where the i subscript indicates that the corresponding quantity is evaluated at z zi solute fluxes φ i 1 2 and φ i 1 2 are calculated at the upper and lower cell boundary respectively and are expressed as 4 φ i 1 2 q c i 1 2 k i 1 2 c i 1 c i where the boundary concentrations c i 1 2 are calculated by linear interpolating values at the adjacent cells and k i 1 2 represent a dispersive transfer coefficient at the lower boundary these quantities are given by 5 c i 1 2 δ z i c i 1 δ z i 1 c i δ z i δ z i 1 6 k i 1 2 2 φ i d i φ i 1 d i 1 δ z i φ i 1 d i 1 δ z i 1 φ i d i and analogous expressions hold for the upper boundary following berg et al 1998 the coefficient k i 1 2 for dispersive transfer through a boundary is calculated as a harmonic average of the value at the adjacent cells because this formulation improves numerical stability in case of sharp variations in dispersion properties between cells the coupling among eqs 3 6 for the different cells is represented by a system of n coupled equations which is expressed in matrix form as 7 a i j c i b i where cj is a nx1 vector of concentration values aij is a nxn tridiagonal coefficient matrix and bi is a nx1 coefficient vector 8 a i i 1 q δ z i δ z i 1 δ z i k i 1 a i i q δ z i 1 δ z i 1 δ z i δ z i 1 δ z i δ z i 1 k j 1 k i 1 a i i 1 q δ z i δ z i δ z i 1 k i 1 i 2 n 1 9 b i r i δ z i i 2 n 1 with other terms in aij being equal to zero the expressions 8 and 9 must be coupled with two boundary conditions to complete the system the most straightforward choice is to apply a couple of dirichlet boundary conditions to ensure that the uppermost c1 and lowermost cn 2 concentrations coincide with the measured values cup and cdown at the highest and lowest observation points respectively these conditions are expressed as 10 a 1 1 1 b 1 c u p a n 2 n 2 1 b n 2 c d o w n alternatively if the solute flux at one of the boundaries is known the dirichlet condition at this boundary can be replaced by a neumann boundary condition the corresponding conditions 10 hence become 11 a 1 1 k 2 a 1 2 k 2 b 1 φ u p a n 2 n 1 k n 1 a n 2 n 2 k n 1 b n 2 φ d o w n it should be noted that aij depends on transport coefficients q d that must be specified by the user while bi depends on the unknown reaction rate values ri that are determined by the algorithm values of q can be derived from data collection of hydraulic e g kennedy et al 2009 or thermal e g hatch et al 2006 observations or from inverse modeling of conservative tracer concentrations e g larsen et al 2014 the dispersion coefficient d is given by the contribution of molecular diffusion in the porous medium and of mechanical dispersion the molecular diffusion coefficient of a given solute is typically obtained from tabulated values with a correction due to the porous medium tortuosity the mechanical dispersion coefficient is calculated as the product of water velocity and sediment dispersivity the latter depending on sediment type and on the scale of the domain schulze makuch 2005 for a given set of ri values the solution of the system of equations 7 provides the concentration values ci along the profile these values of ri are identified through a fitting procedure that minimizes the sum of squared errors sse between predicted and observed concentrations namely 12 min r i s s e min r i j 1 p c j i n t c j o b s 2 where p is the number of available observations cj obs and cj int are obtained by interpolating the n concentrations obtained from eq 7 at the p depths where concentrations cj obs were observed a typical issue with optimization problems such as eq 12 is that the number m of calibration parameters must be lower than the number of observations p to avoid overparametrization which would lead to unreliable and potentially unphysical estimates of reaction rates following berg et al 1998 the reaction rate profile r z is described as a stepwise sequence of m reaction rate values with m p specifically a two phase procedure is adopted to find the optimal number m of reaction rates in the first phase eq 12 is repeatedly solved using an increasing number m of reaction rates the value of m is progressively increased from unity up to a user specified value that must be lower than p at each step the depth of the profile is divided into m equally spaced zones with constant reaction rates whose values are calculated applying eq 12 to assess if the use of a higher number of calibration parameters results in a statistically significant improvement of the model fit all the solutions are compared with f tests see appendix a to identify the best value of m gradient leaves the user the choice of whether employing the suggested value of m or specifying a different value in the second phase zones with similar values of reaction rates are progressively merged at each step the algorithm merges the consecutive zones with the most similar reaction rates and an f test is applied to assess if the original reaction profile provides a more significant fit to the observed data than the merged one the same operations are repeated until only a single zone is left in this way a stepwise reaction rate profile with variable spacing is obtained thus avoiding the constraint of a constant size of the reaction zones as before the user can either choose the m value suggested by the statistical test or specify a different value the data and parameters described in the previous paragraph that the user must supply as input information to apply the gradient code are a concentration profile arranged as an ascii text file first column depth mm second column porosity optional third column concentration mg l a value for porosity φ if not provided in the previous file a value for the magnitude of the vertical flux q cm d the user is also asked to specify if the flow direction is upward or downward a value for the dispersion coefficient d cm2 s if this value represents molecular diffusion the variable flag tortuosity in the code can be modified to correct this value for the effect of sediment tortuosity 2 2 validation procedure and applications the algorithm was applied to synthetically generated data to verify the performance of the proposed method under variations in fluxes and concentrations after validation controlled laboratory flume experiments were used to demonstrate how gradient is utilized to analyze observed concentration profiles 2 2 1 synthetic data validation of the gradient code was done through its application to synthetic data that represented two cases of reaction rate profiles in case 1 a homogenous production rate r 0 was applied over a sediment domain with depth l 10 cm while case 2 had a spatially variable consumption rate r 0 over the same depth the values of the reaction rates are reported in table 1 unless specified otherwise all examples were characterized by a sediment porosity φ 0 30 a dispersion coefficient d 9 0 10 11 m2 s and by a downward flux q 5 0 10 9 m s 0 43 mm d these values correspond to a peclet number pe q l d 5 56 o 1 which indicates that both advection and dispersion contribute to solute transport in a comparable way synthetic concentration values were generated as surrogate observations by solving eqs 1 and 2 with the boundary conditions reported in table 1 and with a spatial resolution of 1 mm the values of the damköhler number da ravg l q cmax where ravg is the average reaction rate and cmax is the maximum concentration are 1 3 and 2 0 for case 1 and 2 respectively da values of the order of unity imply that the role of reaction and advective transport were very similar thus indicating that the shape of the concentration profiles was strongly influenced by water flow furthermore a 2d comsol model similar to the one of bardini et al 2012 of a streambed dune was developed to test the influence of non vertical flow on gradient performance the average depth of the streambed was 11 cm and the dune height and length were equal to 2 cm and 15 cm respectively other parameters characterizing surface flow and sediments were chosen as in the laboratory experiments described in section 2 2 2 while a constant consumption rate r 10 4 g m3 s and a losing water flux q 20 cm d at the sediment bottom were imposed this configuration corresponds to pe 4 103 and da 0 8 i e advection dominates solute transport and the role of reaction is comparable to the one of advection the flow field was determined by solving the darcy s equation for incompressible flow with boundary conditions given by i no horizontal flow at the side boundaries ii constant water flux equal to q at the streambed bottom and iii a sinusoidal distribution of hydraulic head at the streambed top calculated as in fox et al 2014 dissolved oxygen concentrations were obtained by solving a 2d version of the mass balance eqs 1 and 2 with water velocities derived from the darcy s equation and boundary conditions given by i no oxygen flux at the side boundaries ii concentration equal to the saturation value 8 3 mg l at the streambed top and iii no oxygen diffusion i e c z 0 at the streambed bottom once the model was solved concentration values along a vertical profile located at the stoss side namely 1 4 of the dune length were extracted and analyzed with gradient 2 2 2 laboratory setup a series of flume experiments was used to demonstrate the importance of losing and gaining flow conditions on reactions rates in streambeds de falco et al 2016 in these experiments oxygen profiles were measured in a flume packed with natural silica sand φ 0 42 and organized into bed forms which were 15 cm long and 1 5 cm high for more details see de falco et al 2016 a peristaltic pump was connected to a drainage system that was positioned at the bottom of the flume and allowed the control on the downwelling or upwelling fluxes fox et al 2014 biofilm growth was achieved by seeding of microorganisms that were scraped from natural sediments and supplying periodically sodium benzoate as a carbon source and nutrients such as n and p after three months of biofilm growth under overlying water velocity of 12 cm s a set of oxygen profiles were measured with a clark type oxygen microelectrode system mounted on a micromanipulator with a computerized depth control and data acquisition unisense aarhus denmark the measurements started two hours after spiking sodium benzoate and while maintaining its concentration at 9 1 mg l the oxygen profiles were measured at the middle of the stoss side of a bed form and under overlying water velocity at 12 cm s and losing or gaining fluxes of 50 cm d under these flow conditions the bed forms were stationary afterwards the bed forms were manually mixed to evenly distribute the biomass in the streambed and the oxygen profiles were measured again under the same flow conditions de falco et al 2016 3 results and discussion in this section gradient is first validated using the synthetic data for the cases summarized in table 1 the effects of water flow errors in concentration data and sampling resolution on the reaction rates are also discussed then a numerical test of the influence of non vertical flow components on gradient performance is described finally an application of gradient to observed profiles of dissolved oxygen concentration from laboratory experiments is presented 3 1 validation the performance of gradient in recovering the concentrations in a profile with a constant reaction rate and in presence of vertical water flow is shown in fig 1 case 1 table 1 the results show that the reaction rate profile was correctly identified the model fit to the input concentration data is also extremely accurate a close inspection of the model reveals that the recovered reaction profile is actually composed of three reaction zones whose values are within 0 1 error between the average recovered rate and the true rate the ability of gradient to identify spatially variable reaction rates is shown in fig 2 the optimal number of zones suggested by the algorithm is five which corresponds to the actual number of zones in the stepwise reaction profile case 2 table 1 calculated consumption rates are almost identical to the true values with an average error that was lower than 0 01 this performance demonstrates the potential of gradient to identify reaction hotspots due for instance to localized accumulation of fine particles with high specific surface area hartwig et al 2015 or to higher amounts of microbial biomass and activity caruso et al 2017 3 2 effect of vertical advective fluxes as previously discussed including the presence of advective fluxes due to water seepage is crucial for a correct evaluation of reaction rates in sediments to exemplify this concept gradient was applied to the synthetic concentration data of both cases 1 and 2 assuming different incorrect values for the water flux q specifically the concentration profiles were analyzed assuming q values equal to zero and to 50 of the correct value each recovered reaction profile was also integrated over depth to determine a value of surficial reaction rate per unit sediment area these calculated surficial reaction rates are compared to the integrated rates of the true values shown in table 2 for the homogeneous reaction profile of case 1 fig 3 shows that if water flux was neglected q 0 top panel the estimated reaction profile was no longer constant interestingly the error was not systematic as reaction rates were underestimated in shallower sediments where almost no reaction is predicted while they were largely overestimated the true value at larger depths the results in fig 3 top panel represent the errors that would result from the application of the profile code which does not include the presence of solute advection to situations where water flow occurs and significantly contributes to solute transport this example demonstrates the need to employ methods such as gradient to analyze concentration datasets if the presence of water seepage cannot be excluded when the value of q was lower than the true value 50 central panel estimated reaction rates increased in the shallower region of sediments and decreased in the deeper region if q is overestimated 50 bottom panel estimated reaction rates in the deepest sediments decrease so much that solute is predicted to be consumed rather than produced these results exemplify how the distribution of reaction rates over depth is sensitive to solute advection by water seepage interestingly when reaction rates were integrated over depth the resulting values of surficial reaction rates in case 1 were found to be only marginally affected by errors in input water flux 2 table 2 the same approach was applied to analyze the influence of water flow on the depth variable reaction rates of case 2 table 1 results are displayed in fig 4 for the assumptions of no input flow top panel and input flow smaller 50 central panel and larger 50 bottom panel as before the algorithm adjusted the estimated reaction rates to compensate for the errors in the value of q the figure shows that the estimated reaction rates were more positive for smaller values of the downwelling water flux when water flow was neglected fig 4 top panel a reaction pattern characterized by an alternation of production and consumption zones was erroneously predicted it is particularly important to notice that for case 2 the input value of q had a stronger influence on the values of surficial reaction rates compared to case 1 table 2 the largest errors were found when water flow was not considered q 0 with an underestimation of the consumption rates of two orders of magnitude these findings demonstrate that the presence of water flow should not be overlooked considered even when average rates of solute turnover are investigated 3 3 effect of experimental errors in real applications observed concentration data are subject to errors e g due to instrumental noise which implies that the input concentration values are not error free as for the previous examples to assess this influence the effect of experimental errors was simulated by adding randomly generated errors to the synthetic concentration values of case 1 errors were generated by randomly sampling a gaussian distribution with zero mean value and a standard deviation of 0 1 mg l i e approximately 0 7 of the maximum concentration in this way 100 concentration profiles were generated and were analyzed with gradient the resulting reaction rates are shown in fig 5 mean values along depth standard deviation the figure shows that the average estimated rate was very close to the true value however at each depth the standard deviation for the reaction rate ranged between 5 and 27 of the true value these results indicate that reaction rates estimated from a single concentration profile are quite sensitive to experimental errors this finding implies that it is recommend to calculate an average reaction profile r z by collecting multiple measurements at each depth and employing all available profiles to estimate reaction rates the 100 reaction rate profiles from fig 5 were also averaged over the depth of the sediments to produce the surficial reaction rates which ranged between 0 97 1 03 10 7 g m2 s these values are hence very similar to the correct value of 1 0 10 7 g m2 s with errors lower than 5 these rather small differences indicate that the errors shown in fig 5 were evenly distributed along the vertical profile and they were cancelled out when averaging over the vertical profile therefore surficial reaction rates calculated by gradient are much less sensitive to experimental errors compared to vertical rate profiles and they thus represent robust estimates of true rates of solute reaction 3 4 effect of sampling resolution the spatial resolution of the available concentration data affects the level of detail of the observed concentration profile to be analyzed therefore the influence of the resolution of input concentration data on reaction rates estimated by gradient was assessed by repeating the analysis of case 2 using only 20 values of synthetic concentration instead of the 100 used in section 3 1 results are presented in fig 6 which displays the gradient fit to the 20 concentration data and the reaction rate profile that was consequently estimated the results show that sampling resolution had a moderate influence on the estimated profile of consumption rate the consumption peaks were correctly recovered because of their strong fingerprint on the concentration profile while the lowest rates exhibited some errors including a slight production at uppermost and lowermost points the average surficial rate was 3 7 10 9 g m2 s which is quite similar to the true value 4 0 10 9 g m2 s these findings suggest that gradient can provide a good estimate of the reaction rates as long as the sampling resolution is detailed enough to capture the major features of the concentration profile 3 5 influence of non vertical flow one of the most limiting assumptions of gradient is that water flow is considered to be purely vertical while any horizontal flow component is neglected the presence of non vertical flow will induce errors in the reaction rates estimated with gradient and it is hence important to assess its sensitivity to this horizontal advection when gradient is applied the estimated reaction rate at a given depth compensates the net horizontal advective flux at the same depth this advective flux is given by the interaction between horizontal gradients of water velocity and concentration because the latter is influenced by nonlocal factors namely the spatial distributions of velocity and reaction rate over the whole domain errors in gradient results are site specific and are not uniquely determined by the local magnitude of horizontal velocity the influence of non vertical advection was tested through the numerical example of dissolved oxygen dynamics in streambed sediments described in section 2 2 1 the simulation results are presented in fig 7 where white lines represent water flowpaths and the black line indicates the location of the concentration profile that was analyzed with gradient water flow along this profile deviates significantly from the vertical direction the average angle with the vertical axis being equal to 18 and reaching a maximum of 53 at the streambed surface the magnitude of vertical velocity also varies over depth and the average value q 21 7 cm d was chosen for the application of gradient the results of the gradient analysis of this synthetic concentration profile are depicted in fig 8 which shows that even though the concentration profile was correctly modeled the consumption rates are slightly misestimated the average error in the estimated reaction rates is 8 and it ranges between 5 and 25 depending on the intensity of the horizontal flux as expected the largest error occurs near the surface where the horizontal velocity component is the highest however the magnitude of these errors is not very high given that the flow field shown in fig 7 significantly deviates from the 1d assumption of gradient 3 6 application to laboratory data the profiles of dissolved oxygen concentration observed at the stoss side of a sandy bed form are shown in figs 9 and 10 for losing and gaining flow conditions respectively at these points vertical water fluxes were calculated as described by fox et al 2014 to account for the influence of the bed form shape which led to values of q equal to 51 and 48 cm d for losing and gaining flow conditions respectively the comparison between the left panels of figs 9 and 10 reveals that the shape of the oxygen profiles was very different for the two flow conditions under losing conditions oxygen concentration progressively decreased with depth as the dissolved organic carbon doc advection from surface water to sediments stimulated heterotrophic respiration under gaining flow conditions upward water flow toward the streambed surface hampered nutrient supply to the shallowest sediment thus limiting heterotrophic respiration to a thin layer where oxygen concentrations dropped this picture is confirmed by the reaction rate profiles estimated by gradient in the right panels of figs 9 and 10 which show a steeper decay of oxygen consumption rates for the case of gaining conditions moreover the surficial reaction rates reported in table 3 indicate that the rate of oxygen consumption was more intense 57 under losing flow conditions compared to gaining flow conditions during the second phase of the experiments sediments were mixed to verify if bed stirring e g due to flood events affects the distribution and activity of microbial biomass in the streambed results indicated that microbial biomass was evenly distributed after the mixing de falco et al 2016 the concentration profiles not shown were analyzed with gradient and the estimated surficial oxygen consumption rates are reported in table 3 the results indicate that bed mixing led to a strong increase in the surficial consumption rate for losing conditions 314 the reaction rate under gaining conditions was also enhanced as compared to the non mixed sediments however the magnitude of the increase under gaining conditions 44 was lower than for losing conditions these increases can be explained by the more even distribution of microbial biomass in the sediments which may have provided more chances for oxygen consumption over the entire profile of the active streambed additionally sediment disturbance could have reduced pore clogging by microbial biofilm thus enhancing nutrient supply and heterotrophic respiration in the streambed caruso et al 2017 4 conclusions this study presented a novel and simple 1d approach for the analysis of chemical gradients in sediments in the presence of vertical flow conditions the synthetic and experimental data that were analyzed demonstrated how estimated reaction rates can be highly sensitive to the direction and magnitude of water fluxes hence pointing out the need for tools that properly consider the role of solute advection for those applications where flow is expected between surface water and sediments the proposed algorithm fulfils this purpose and represents an effective method to calculate reaction rates in cases where water flow significantly contributes to solute transport application of gradient to data from laboratory experiments has demonstrated that the proposed approach can help to interpret reaction processes that control oxygen consumption in sediments but is applicable to all kind of problems that deal with solute fate within sediments the aforementioned examples have shown that the spatial resolution of data sampling has only a minor influence on gradient results on the other hand experimental errors in concentration data strongly affect vertical distribution of reaction rates but have a limited influence on the surficial average rates replicate observations of solute concentration at each sediment depth should hence be collected to better assess the vertical distribution of reaction rates however robust estimates of average rates can be easily obtained even when no replicates are available appendix a f test procedure the gradient algorithm identifies a set of reaction rate profiles that are characterized by different number of zones with homogeneous rates of reaction hereinafter referred to as calibration parameters the comparison of two profiles with m1 and m2 parameters with m1 m2 relies on the calculation of the f statistic a1 f s s e 1 s s e 2 m 2 m 1 s s e 2 p m 2 where sse is defined by eq 12 and p denotes the number of observations the tested hypothesis is that increasing the number of parameters from m1 to m2 does not significantly improve the fit to the observed data this hypothesis is tested by evaluating the probability associated with the calculated f value which is described by an f distribution with m2 m1 p m2 degrees of freedom if this probability falls below a significance level p e g p 01 the test is passed and the hypothesis is rejected the profile with m2 parameters is thus chosen during the first phase section 2 1 profiles with increasing numbers of parameters are compared first m1 and m2 are set equal to 1 and 2 respectively and the following steps are iteratively performed 1 an f test is performed to compare profiles with m1 and m2 parameters 2 if the f test is passed set m1 m2 and m2 m1 1 go to step 4 3 if the f test is not passed set m2 m2 1 go to step 4 4 repeat steps 1 3 until the maximum value of m2 is reached without passing the f test the last value of m2 that passed the f test is selected for the next phase in the second phase of the procedure profiles are progressively merged section 2 1 and the f test is performed between profiles with decreasing values of parameters m2 is initially set to the value determined in the first phase while m1 m2 1 the following steps are then performed 1 an f test is performed to compare profiles with m1 and m2 parameters 2 if the f test is passed m1 is selected as the best option the procedure is completed 3 if the f test is not passed set m1 m1 1 go to step 4 4 repeat steps 1 3 if the test is never passed the original value of m2 is selected as best option in both phases the user is allowed the option to choose a value that is different from the one

876,in this paper we present a novel inverse modeling method called discrete network deterministic inversion dndi for mapping the geometry and property of the discrete network of conduits and fractures in the karstified aquifers the dndi algorithm is based on a coupled discrete continuum concept to simulate numerically water flows in a model and a deterministic optimization algorithm to invert a set of observed piezometric data recorded during multiple pumping tests in this method the model is partioned in subspaces piloted by a set of parameters matrix transmissivity and geometry and equivalent transmissivity of the conduits that are considered as unknown in this way the deterministic optimization process can iteratively correct the geometry of the network and the values of the properties until it converges to a global network geometry in a solution model able to reproduce the set of data an uncertainty analysis of this result can be performed from the maps of posterior uncertainties on the network geometry or on the property values this method has been successfully tested for three different theoretical and simplified study cases with hydraulic responses data generated from hypothetical karstic models with an increasing complexity of the network geometry and of the matrix heterogeneity keywords distributed modeling coupled discrete continuum model deterministic inversion heterogeneity aquifer characterization 1 introduction in hydrogeological studies the choice of the management and protection strategies of the groundwater resources is mainly based on the characterization of the hydraulic properties of the aquifer such as hydraulic conductivity and specific storage this characterization is most often carried out from pumping slug and tracer tests by intrusively recording the aquifer responses such as hydraulic pressure and tracer concentration at a set of boreholes butler 2005 the reliability of these techniques for capturing the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrodynamic properties is particularly conditioned by the amount and spatial disposition of wells used during the investigation and the procedure applied to analyze the hydraulic data yeh and lee 2007 in karstic and or fractured aquifers the hydrodynamic properties such as the hydraulic conductivity can vary significantly from 10 10 m s to 10 1 m s even at small scales wang et al 2016 this heterogeneity mainly depends on the apertures connectivity and density of the conduits and fractures network in the medium making the groundwater flow path complex eisenlohr et al 1997 kovacs et al 2005 borghi et al 2016 ronayne 2013 in this complex context the hydraulic flow pattern is spatially disconnected and principally focused in the transmissive fissures and fractured zones wherein the geometrical features and hydraulic flow regime turbulent or laminar are usually difficult to identify especially with a limited number of wells or with the use of oversimplified assumptions for interpreting the piezometric data to infer the hydrodynamic parameters in the hydroscience literature several different modeling approaches based on the physical theories have already been tested in order to simulate the dynamics of karstic flows for the prediction of hydraulic properties hartmann et al 2014 among them the equivalent porous media model also called the single continuum model in which the discrete features of fractures and karstic conduits are conceptualized as a porous media with continuous hydraulic properties larocque et al 1999 illman 2014 wang et al 2016 this simplifies the description of heterogeneity of karstic aquifers because it does not require an accurate knowledge on the architecture of fractures and conduits networks for simulating the groundwater flows in such concept it is sufficient to assign high hydraulic conductivity values to fractured zones and very low conductivity for intact rock otherwise the coupled discrete continuum distributed approach is of great interest thanks to its ability to imitate the dual hydrodynamic behaviors in the fractured aquifers by using discrete channel or fracture networks dcn dfn for the conduits and fractures and equivalent porous media for representing the matrix blocks teutsch 1993 liedl et al 2003 de rooij et al 2013 in contrast to the equivalent porous media model the discrete continuum approach requires a good knowledge on the geometry of the karstic and fracture networks the influence of the discrete network geometry on the hydraulic simulations and the benefits of a coupled discrete continuum approach compared to the equivalent porous media have been widely discussed in the literature kovacs 2003 painter and cvetkovic 2005 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 one of these advantages is its efficiency to reproduce numerically the hydraulic fluctuations of karst spring discharge while an equivalent porous media systematically generated lower values than the ones measured kovacs 2003 the hydraulic tomography is a useful tool to predict rigorously the spatial distribution of the hydraulic properties or the structural architecture of the fractures and conduits and their properties it involves the use of inverse algorithms to analyze jointly a set of hydraulic data collected during multiple pumping tests carrera et al 2005 cliffe et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 in this framework various inversion algorithms were successfully applied for characterizing the hydraulic properties of fractured and heterogeneous aquifers using both concepts of parametrization discussed in the previous paragraph the equivalent porous media and coupled discrete continuum approach i inversions in an equivalent porous media were led by using geostatistical approaches in which the statistical characteristics of hydraulic properties are used as a priori information to constraint the inversion among these tools we cite sequential successive linear estimator yeh and liu 2000 ni and yeh 2008 hao et al 2008 illman et al 2009 sharmeen et al 2012 pilot point lavenue and de marsily 2001 transitional probability wang et al 2017 anisotropy directions meier et al 2001 multi scale resolution ackerer and delay 2010 or structural approaches probability perturbation method caers and hoffman 2006 image guided soueid ahmed et al 2015 and cellular automata based fischer et al 2017 ii on the other hand the parameterization of hydraulic tomography using a distributed discrete continuum approach is less flexible than the concept of the equivalent porous medium because the discrete continuum model relies on the establishment of the architecture of the conduits and fractures and their hydraulic properties several works have already brought some solutions to these difficulties one solution would be to generate stochastically patterns of networks with various constraints statistical constraints li et al 2014 le coz et al 2017 mechanical constraints bonneau et al 2013 jaquet et al 2004 geological and speleogeological metrics information collon et al 2017 pardo iguzquiza et al 2012 or flows hierarchical identification le goc et al 2010 more recently borghi et al 2016 have combined the use of a generator of karstic networks based on sets of fractures stochastically generated with a gradient based parameters optimization in order to reconstruct a discrete network able to reproduce a set of tracer test hydraulic data in this present article we propose a novel strategy for dealing with hydraulic tomography of fractured and karstic aquifers which we will shorten as the discrete network deterministic inversion dndi the dndi algorithm permits to map the architecture of fractures and conduits networks their hydraulic properties and the distribution of the transmissivity in the hard rock matrix the dndi approach relies on the use of a coupled discrete continuum concept to simulate water flows through a karstic and fractured aquifer and a deterministic optimization algorithm to invert a set of observed piezometric data recorded during multiple pumping tests the model is partitioned in several subspaces each one being piloted locally by a set of parameters including the orientations of the conduit fracture their equivalent transmissivity values and the transmissivity of the rock matrix this partitioning makes it possible to locally modify the directions of the fracture network and to iteratively update the geometry of the global network in order to minimize the objective function in the inverse process the method is tested on several hypothetical and simplified karstic aquifers with simple to more complex conduit networks and with homogeneous or heterogeneous transmissivity in the matrices 2 algorithm framework 2 1 forward problem and model parameterization we represent a confined karstic and fractured aquifer in a two dimensional model γ with an equivalent porous media γ m for representing the water flows where the rock is intact and a discrete network γ n for simulating the water flows in the fracture conduit networks the numerical simulation of groundwater flows are governed by a steady state continuity equation associated to darcy s law considering a laminar flow in both the matrix domain and the discrete networks 1 where qm and qn are punctual water extraction or injection rates per unit of thickness m3 s m applied on the matrix and network respectively k m denotes the matrix hydraulic conductivities m s k n denotes the fractures or conduits equivalent conductivities m s is the piezometric level m common to both domains γ m and γ n em m is the thickness of the matrix block en m is the aperture of the network and vel is an elementary volume at the pumping location m3 we mention that darcy s law formulation in the matrix domain is described in 2d and in 1d for fractured networks at the internal network boundaries that s why we use the tangential gradient operator t ℓ where ℓ is a local directional unit vector of the network to solve the hydraulic equation at the network in the study cases presented later in this article we have chosen to simulate laminar flows as presented in eq 1 in a network of conduits however the property values k n in the network can be more specifically adapted to the behavior of turbulent conduit flows or fracture flows through other empirical laws eventually related to an aperture variable the forward problem consists in solving numerically eq 1 by using a finite element technique with a triangular meshing it links the hydraulic head data simulated continuously over the coupled model to the spatial distribution in the model of the conduits or fractures with their properties in 1d and the hydraulic transmissivities of the matrix in 2d fig 1 the forward problem can be formulated as 2 d f γ p dir p prop ɛ where d is a vector of simulated hydraulic data n 1 f is a forward operator that calculates the hydraulic data field from a model γ p dir p prop defined by given parameters of network geometry p dir and hydraulic properties p prop ε is a null mean gaussian noise to add the uncertainties associated to the numerical discretization technique and the hydraulic experimental data the model is enclosed in a large buffer zone associated to an equivalent porous media mean transmissivity this zone permits to limit the influence of the boundary conditions the dndi inversion algorithm was coded using matlab and is linked to the comsol multiphysics software which runs the forward problems for the dndi algorithm the model domain γ is partitioned in p x squared subspaces along the x axis and p y along the y axis the total of subspaces of the whole domain is then p px py three parameters are assigned to each subspace fig 3 i the local direction of the conduit fracture network ii the local conduit fracture equivalent transmissivity value iii and the local matrix transmissivity value the geometry of the network follows the local direction in each subspace by a node to node principle the network structure enters a subspace by activating one of its four nodes corners of the square and the subspace direction parameter will define to each other node of the subspace the structure will generate this other node will then be activated itself and permits to the structure to include new subspaces a subspace in which the structure has already been generated becomes inhibited to another generation from the same network the generation process is schematized in fig 2 in order to perform this node to node generation an initially activated node has to be specified in the model starting node in fig 3 the model geometry in comsol is built as a discrete grid including all network possibilities a grid of squares and diagonals as presented in fig 3 this whole geometry is initially disabled in the comsol physical part when different network geometries are tested in the inversion process only the associated parts in the model grid are enabled for the solver computation this avoids the creation of a new model geometry for each modification of the network and permits to reduce the computing time in the inversion the parameterization of the whole model is contained in two vectors piloting the subspaces i the local direction in a subspace is selected among six possibilities see fig 3 as a structural parameter dir 1 2 3 4 5 6 the set of structural parameters for all subspaces in the model is contained in a p 1 vector p dir it is also possible to generate more than one network but this would add more unknown structural parameters for example if one would want to generate 3 independent networks in the model each subspace would need to define 3 local directions instead of one thus the structural vector of direction parameters p dir would become a 3p 1 vector ii the local equivalent transmissivity of the structure in a subspace is defined as a property parameter tn and the matrix transmissivity as a property parameter tm the set of property parameters for all subspaces in the model is contained in a 2p 1 vector p prop with the p parameters tn followed by the p parameters tm the entire model γ is thus piloted only by two parameter vectors p dir and p prop and can be noted γ p dir p prop 2 2 inverse problem the inversion process in the dndi algorithm consists in retrieving a model of network of conduit fracture and of spatial distribution of the transmissivities of the network and matrix which permits to maximize two probability density functions ρ network and ρ properties following the theory described by tarantola and valette 1982 for a least square criterion resolution of the inverse problem we calculate ρ network and ρ properties with the bayes theorem by considering gaussian laws for the probability density functions ρ and ρ d obs as certain 3 ρ network p dir d obs p prop ρ d obs p dir p prop ρ p dir ρ d obs ρ network p dir d obs p prop exp 1 2 d obs

prop represents the a posteriori probability density function of the discrete fracture network model for a given hydraulic observed data d obs and the transmissivity model of the network and matrix p prop ρ properties p prop d obs p dir is the a posteriori probability density function of the spatial distribution of the transmissivity parameters for a given hydraulic observed data d obs and network model p dir ρ d obs p dir p prop and ρ d obs p prop p dir represent the probability density functions of the network structure and property models which permit to evaluate the ability of the network structure and property models to reproduce the observed data via the use of the forward operator ρ p dir and ρ p prop represent prior distributions for the unknown parameters it is well known that on one hand the piezometric data are insufficient to cope with the non uniqueness of the solution of an inverse process and on another hand that a deterministic inversion process leads to a single local solution dependent to the initial model for these reasons and in order to additionally constrain the inversion to a more realistic solution in relation to the field knowledges it can be interesting to incorporate prior distributions for the unknown parameters in ρ p dir and ρ p prop the maximization of the a posteriori probability density functions ρ network and ρ properties is equivalent to a minimization of the arguments of the exponentials in eqs 3 and 4 this is what we aim to minimize during the inversion process in the following objective functions ψ 5 ψ network p dir 1 2 d obs f γ p

c p prop 1 p prop prior p prop where d obs is a vector of observed data n 1 p dir and p prop are the unknown parameters to estimate for imaging the geometry of the network in p dir and the hydraulic properties defined here by the equivalent transmissivity of the conduits fractures and the transmissivity of the matrix in p prop p dir prior p 1 and p prop prior 2p 1 are the prior information on the geometry and on the property parameters employed to constrain the inverse problem for overcoming the unrealistic solutions c d n n is a covariance matrix on the observed data that permits to include the uncertainties of the hydraulic data in the inversion process c p dir p p and c p prop 2p 2p are the covariance matrices on the structural and property parameters respectively this separated formulation of the probability density functions between network and properties permits to sequentially estimate the two dependent unknown models p dir and p prop in a first step we focus on the characterization of the network with the piezometric data by fixing the model of the transmissivity distributions in the conduits fractures and matrices the model of network resulting from the first step will then be used in a second step as known parameter to infer the transmissivity pattern 2 3 optimization and uncertainty analysis the minimization of eqs 5 and 6 can be done by optimizing the network geometry and the property values during two sequential iterative processes these optimizations consist in successively modifying the structural and property parameters p dir and p prop the inversion process is led as a sequential optimization fig 4 of i the structural geometry considering as fixed the initially chosen property values ii and the property values t n t m considering as fixed the previously inverted structural geometry the structural optimization is performed iteratively by modifying the structural parameter p dir through a structural sensitivity analysis and by considering the hydraulic properties p prop as fixed at a given iteration step k the sensitivity analysis of the network geometry toward the observed data is recorded into a 6 p sensitivity matrix j n k for a local direction i 1 6 and for a subspace j 1 p the element of the matrix j n k is calculated as 7 j n k i j 1 2 d obs f γ p dir k p dir j i p prop t c d 1 d obs f γ p dir k p dir j i p prop 1 2 p dir prior j i t c p dir 1 p dir prior j i with p dir k p dir j i the structural geometry parameter at the iteration k considering a modified local direction in the subspace j and p dir prior j i the gap between the prior local direction of subspace j and the modified local direction thus the sensitivity matrix guides the evolution of the objective function in eq 5 by testing successively the modification of the network with all possible local direction in each subspace the minimal value in the matrix j n k i min j min designates the local direction i min in the subspace j min which would produce the best decrease in the objective function then the parameters set p dir k is updated from the previous set p dir k p dir k 1 by taking into account the sensitivity analysis minimum p dir k j min i min in order to minimize the objective function at each step of the optimization once the sensitivity analysis cannot find any more p dir configuration decreasing the objective function the iterative structural optimization is stopped the last structural iteration represents the local solution dependent to the initial model the uncertainty analysis of the inverted network geometry can be inferred from the computation of the posterior covariance matrix as 8 c p dir post j 1 6 i 1 6 j n post i j ψ netw ork post c p dir 1 j j 1 where c p dir p o s t j is the posterior structural uncertainty value for the local direction in the subspace j j n post is the last iteration structural sensitivity matrix and ψ network post is the value of the minimized structural objective function if the structural uncertainty value is low then another direction in the subspace would lead to a deterioration of the reproduction of the data on the other hand if the structural uncertainty value is high then the structure in the subspace could have another local direction without significantly degrading the reproduction of the observed data following the network geometry optimization the property parameters optimization will iteratively modify the transmissivities with the previously inverted geometry in order to minimize the objective function in eq 6 the network equivalent transmissivities and the matrix transmissivities are optimized simultaneously at a given iteration step k the parameters set p prop which contains the transmissivities for both the network and the matrix is updated by linearizing eq 6 which can be formulated as 9 p prop k 1 p prop k j p k t c d 1 j p k c p prop 1 1 j p k t c d 1 d obs f γ p dir p prop k c p prop 1 p prop prior p prop k where j p k is the jacobian matrix n 2p that holds the sensitivity for each modeled data f i at the positions of the observed data toward the property values in the matrix and the network this jacobian matrix can be calculated by using a finite difference approach with a finite difference step δp prop 10 j p k i j f i p prop k p prop k j p prop k j δ p prop finally once the objective function has iteratively converged to a minimum the property optimization is stopped the posterior covariance matrix on the inversion of the property values can be calculated as 11 c p prop p o s t j p p o s t t c d 1 j p p o s t c p prop 1 1 where c p prop post is the posterior covariance matrix and j p post is the jacobian matrix of the last iteration step the diagonal entries of the posterior matrix represent the variances on the property values of each subspace 3 validation of the dndi algorithm on hypothetical study cases the dndi inversion algorithm has been tested on three hypothetical and simplified confined karstic fields with network of conduits i in a first case we treat a simple network case with heterogeneity in the equivalent transmissivity of the conduits and a homogenous transmissivity assigned to the matrix ii a second case is similar to the first one but adding a transmissivity variability also in the matrix iii in a third case we seek to image a complex network geometry with the use of two different initial models to start the inverse problem we considered in the forward problem eq 1 a unit thickness for the matrix 2d modeling and a unit aperture for the network but with a variable equivalent transmissivity the buffer zone boundaries were associated to a bound 0 m dirichlet condition and the hydraulic heads were set to 0 0 m initially over the model these theoretical study cases were used to produce 2401 hydraulic drawdown data from 49 pumping measurement boreholes a pumping test is performed alternatively in each borehole distributed homogeneously over the 100 100 m² models the pumping rates were set to 0 6 l min for a borehole in the matrix and 5 l s for one in the conduit network in these different cases for the inversion of the geometry of the network no a priori information has been added on the other hand we have constrained the inversion of the hydraulic properties with a priori values the a priori models on the properties are used also as initial model to launch the inversion process for the property optimization for the matrix we took the log10 t as transmissivity parameter tm for example a transmissivity parameter equal to 6 represents in the model a 10 6 m² s transmissivity value and for the network we took directly the t value as transmissivity parameter tn the covariance matrices c d and c p prop are built as diagonal matrices with a constant variance value σ 2 in the case of the matrix transmissivity the variance value σ t m 2 applies to the exponent of the transmissivity in the case of the network transmissivity the variance value σ t n 2 applies to the transmissivity the partitioning of the models and the chosen inversion parameters values for each study case are given in table 1 the different study cases inversions were led on a 64go ram pc on 2 processors of 16 cores 3 1 study case 1 in a first study case we have tested the ability of the inversion method to reproduce a network geometry with variable conduit equivalent transmissivities in a homogeneous matrix we generated drawdown data from a theoretical model with a 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity and a principal conduit associated to a 0 1 m² s transmissivity and secondary conduits associated to a 0 01 m² s transmissivity firstly we tested an inversion with a small set of data 100 drawdown data from 10 boreholes see the true model in fig 5 we started the inversion from a simple initial model with a single horizontal 0 06 m² s conduit and a homogeneous 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity the structural optimization converged in 10 iterations and the properties optimization in 1 iteration the inverted model reproduces the data set r² 0 97 and approximately the connectivity between the points in the network however this reconstruction remains distant from the true geometry this is due to a lack of data to correctly identify the shape of the conduit network therefore the efficiency of the inversion for mapping the heterogeneity of the hydraulic parameters and retrieving the principal karstic conduits is highly dependent to the number of wells and their locations in the next test we used a denser distribution of wells 49 wells for providing a better spatial resolution in order to image the heterogeneity of the aquifer presented for the same true model in fig 6 the structural optimization converged in 11 iterations and the properties optimization in 1 iteration the inverted model reproduces now the data set r² 0 95 and also a very good representation of the true geometry fig 6 the property optimization permitted to correct the initial equivalent transmissivity of 0 06 m² s to 0 01 m² s for the conduits connected in the bottom right area of the network it permits to reduce the flow rates coming to this zone and enhance the reproduction of the true cones of depression the flows in this zone are mainly conditioned by the properties of the conduits connected directly to the primary drain this affirmation can be supported by the conduit transmissivity standard deviation map produced from eq 11 fig 6 that shows that the properties of the conduits directly connected to the primary drain have lower uncertainties than the primary drain itself in the center of the inverted model the conduit in the bottom right periphery of the inverted model does not image correctly the true model but as the data reproduction is perfect this periphery zone might not be sufficiently described by the data to permit a very good reproduction the uncertainty map confirms that this part of the network has a more uncertain transmissivity value than the rest of the network we have also tested another configuration with more available boreholes than in the case in fig 5 but in which only two boreholes intersect the true karstic network the true model and the inversion result are presented in fig 7 the inverted model can almost reproduce the true network geometry which shows that boreholes even in the matrix can provide information about the localization of nearby conduits this is especially true for the thin conduits which appear in the inverted model although no boreholes are intersecting them therefore the dndi method can be used with dataset with only a few boreholes intersecting the conduits as long as there are a sufficient number of other boreholes in the matrix in suitable locations for characterizing the nearby conduit network 3 2 study case 2 a second study case was led to test the ability of this inversion method to reproduce the data in a case of a karstic network with various conduit properties developed in a heterogeneous matrix we simulated the piezometric data from a theoretical model with the same karstic network than in study case 1 but in a matrix with a transmissivity varying from 5 10 6 m² s to 5 10 7 m² s fig 8 we started the inversion from a simple initial model with a single horizontal 0 04 m² s conduit and a homogeneous 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity the structural optimization converged in 10 iterations and the properties optimization in 3 iterations fig 8 a the structural optimization permitted to retrieve the true geometry of the conduits network but it also added conduits in the bottom left part of the model to reproduce the drawdown data of the more transmissive area of the matrix then the property optimization could reproduce the true transmissivity values distribution in the matrix in the end the inverted model can reproduce the true drawdowns data but its network geometry incorporates parts inexistent in the true model that has been generated in order to simulate a more transmissive area of the matrix before the matrix transmissivity values could be optimized we started a second inversion using the previously inverted model indicated in fig 4 as the multi scale option the structural optimization converged in 2 iterations and the parameter property optimization in 1 iteration fig 8 b the only changes were made during the structural optimization step with an important improvement in the identification of the shape of the conduits in this case the inverted model reproduces the drawdowns data r² 0 99 but is also a good representation of the true network geometry the posterior standard deviation maps produced from eq 11 fig 9 show for the conduit property values a smaller uncertainty for the secondary conduits and a higher uncertainty for the primary drain especially for the part of the network on the left of the model concerning the matrix transmissivity property values the highest uncertainty are located mostly in the most transmissive areas 3 3 study case 3 finally a third study case was led to test the ability of this inversion method to reproduce the data in a case of a complex karstic network geometry we generated drawdown data from a theoretical model with a karstic network with a constant equivalent transmissivity of 0 1 m² s in a homogeneous matrix with a transmissivity of 10 6 m² s fig 10 we started an inversion from a simple initial model with a single vertical 0 1 m² s conduit and a homogeneous 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity the structural optimization converged in 33 iterations and the parameter optimization in 1 iteration fig 10 a the inverted model permits to fit the data set approximately r² 0 78 and represents the global geometry of the conduits network of the true model regarding the simplicity of the initial model the result model remains satisfying we also started an inversion from a more complex initial model with two vertical 0 1 m² s conduits diverging in the upper part of the model in a homogeneous 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity this initial model geometry representing a simple approximation of the true geometry can be associated to a priori field knowledge information the structural optimization converged in 17 iterations and the parameter optimization in 1 iteration fig 10 b in this case the inverted geometry of the discrete network permits a good reproduction of the data r² 0 97 and is closer to the real network than the case in fig 10 a the structural posterior uncertainty maps produced from eq 8 are presented in fig 11 these maps show that in the case a the highest uncertainties are distributed relatively uniformly among the inverted model while in case b they are mostly located in the periphery of the model here the structural posterior uncertainties are giving important information about the local validity of the different inverted networks 4 discussion we have successfully tested the dndi method on three theoretical and simplified study cases with steady state drawdowns however as we have seen an inversion process is limited by the non uniqueness of its solution therefore using the dndi method requires several prerequisites and the modeler needs to be critical toward the result as we have seen in the first study case the efficiency of the inversion is dependent to the hydraulic data set and in particular the number and the localization of observation wells on the field we note that even wells in the matrix can provide information on nearby conduits for the inversion globally it appears that the most important point about a steady state dataset is to have a homogeneous and sufficiently dense distribution of wells on the site in order to characterize successfully the network concerning the inversion process itself we note in the third study case the ability of the dndi method to image complex networks however as the inversion is deterministic the precision of the result model is dependent to the initial model the inversion process will converge to a local solution dependent to the initial model in fact in fig 10 we show that a simple initial model permitted to reproduce a satisfying global representation of the true model but with local approximations while a more complex initial model permitted a more accurate reproduction of the true model and a faster convergence therefore an inverted model using the dndi method should be analyzed critically like any deterministic inverse methods depending from the initial model the study of the computed structural and property uncertainty values from eqs 8 to 11 can supply this critical analysis on the result model the second study case also illustrates some limits of the sequential optimization of the method especially when starting from a too simple initial model therefore the amount of a priori information introduced in the initial model is important for the accuracy of the result model otherwise as we demonstrate in fig 8 a simple possible operation would be to re run the inversion with a first inversion result to slightly improve the result we would also recommend the coupling of this inversion method to a multiscale method grimstadt et al 2003 which consists in a re run of the inversion starting from a previous result with a refinement of the partitioning it permits to lead several inversions with an initial model each time more precise while saving time as we initially start with a coarsely partitioned model 5 conclusion we present in this paper a novel deterministic inversion method that permits to characterize in a partitioned model the karst conduits and fractures network geometry and their hydraulic properties including the transmissivity distribution of the matrices the dndi method let the modeler choose the partitioning of the model for the inversion this cursor permits to define either an inversion with a coarse partitioning for a quick approximation model or with a fine partitioning and a longer computation time for a better fitting model the use of a discrete network model permits to associate a specific behavior to the flows in the network and thus produces more realistic models than an equivalent porous media model this method can be easily adapted for channels or fractures network models by modifying the properties associated to the discrete network these properties can also be directly linked to an aperture value by choosing an adapted law therefore we believe that the dndi method is an interesting new imagery tool for the distributed modeling associated to a set of data from an investigation in a karstic and or fractured aquifer we have realized different tests in three theoretical and simplified study cases with an increasing complexity and the dndi could always produce satisfying results both on the reproduction of the generated data and on finding the network geometry and property values from the true model as we have seen in the first study case the result of the structural inversion is dependent on the positioning and the amount of observed data this is true for any inversion but is especially important in the case of highly heterogeneous aquifers for delineating the position of the heterogeneities therefore the result of the inversion has to be interpreted critically regarding the set of data used for it a first critical analysis can be performed from the maps of posterior uncertainties on the structure or on the property values that can be produced by using the formulas we propose in this paper the a priori information on the geometry of the network and on the property values is also a way to constrain the inversion in addition to the data this information can be inferred from general field knowledges geological and geophysical information conduits observation in wells through video camera other studies etc because this method is deterministic the choice of the initial model should be based on a relatively coherent possibility and should not be too far from the real solution in order to produce a good result therefore we propose to couple the dndi method to a multi scale method this consists in a first inversion started from an initial model which is followed by a new one that starts from the first inversion solution with a refined partitioning this strategy permits to start from a simple initial model and to progressively make the model more complex and improve the solution an application of this method for mapping the conduits and fractures network with real data from a karstic field is planned for future works these works will be more specifically focused on the sensitivity of the method to the spatial distribution of the measurement boreholes and on delineating the preferential flow paths in the network conflict of interest none acknowledgments we thank the normandy region for providing financial

876,in this paper we present a novel inverse modeling method called discrete network deterministic inversion dndi for mapping the geometry and property of the discrete network of conduits and fractures in the karstified aquifers the dndi algorithm is based on a coupled discrete continuum concept to simulate numerically water flows in a model and a deterministic optimization algorithm to invert a set of observed piezometric data recorded during multiple pumping tests in this method the model is partioned in subspaces piloted by a set of parameters matrix transmissivity and geometry and equivalent transmissivity of the conduits that are considered as unknown in this way the deterministic optimization process can iteratively correct the geometry of the network and the values of the properties until it converges to a global network geometry in a solution model able to reproduce the set of data an uncertainty analysis of this result can be performed from the maps of posterior uncertainties on the network geometry or on the property values this method has been successfully tested for three different theoretical and simplified study cases with hydraulic responses data generated from hypothetical karstic models with an increasing complexity of the network geometry and of the matrix heterogeneity keywords distributed modeling coupled discrete continuum model deterministic inversion heterogeneity aquifer characterization 1 introduction in hydrogeological studies the choice of the management and protection strategies of the groundwater resources is mainly based on the characterization of the hydraulic properties of the aquifer such as hydraulic conductivity and specific storage this characterization is most often carried out from pumping slug and tracer tests by intrusively recording the aquifer responses such as hydraulic pressure and tracer concentration at a set of boreholes butler 2005 the reliability of these techniques for capturing the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrodynamic properties is particularly conditioned by the amount and spatial disposition of wells used during the investigation and the procedure applied to analyze the hydraulic data yeh and lee 2007 in karstic and or fractured aquifers the hydrodynamic properties such as the hydraulic conductivity can vary significantly from 10 10 m s to 10 1 m s even at small scales wang et al 2016 this heterogeneity mainly depends on the apertures connectivity and density of the conduits and fractures network in the medium making the groundwater flow path complex eisenlohr et al 1997 kovacs et al 2005 borghi et al 2016 ronayne 2013 in this complex context the hydraulic flow pattern is spatially disconnected and principally focused in the transmissive fissures and fractured zones wherein the geometrical features and hydraulic flow regime turbulent or laminar are usually difficult to identify especially with a limited number of wells or with the use of oversimplified assumptions for interpreting the piezometric data to infer the hydrodynamic parameters in the hydroscience literature several different modeling approaches based on the physical theories have already been tested in order to simulate the dynamics of karstic flows for the prediction of hydraulic properties hartmann et al 2014 among them the equivalent porous media model also called the single continuum model in which the discrete features of fractures and karstic conduits are conceptualized as a porous media with continuous hydraulic properties larocque et al 1999 illman 2014 wang et al 2016 this simplifies the description of heterogeneity of karstic aquifers because it does not require an accurate knowledge on the architecture of fractures and conduits networks for simulating the groundwater flows in such concept it is sufficient to assign high hydraulic conductivity values to fractured zones and very low conductivity for intact rock otherwise the coupled discrete continuum distributed approach is of great interest thanks to its ability to imitate the dual hydrodynamic behaviors in the fractured aquifers by using discrete channel or fracture networks dcn dfn for the conduits and fractures and equivalent porous media for representing the matrix blocks teutsch 1993 liedl et al 2003 de rooij et al 2013 in contrast to the equivalent porous media model the discrete continuum approach requires a good knowledge on the geometry of the karstic and fracture networks the influence of the discrete network geometry on the hydraulic simulations and the benefits of a coupled discrete continuum approach compared to the equivalent porous media have been widely discussed in the literature kovacs 2003 painter and cvetkovic 2005 ghasemizadeh et al 2012 hartmann et al 2014 one of these advantages is its efficiency to reproduce numerically the hydraulic fluctuations of karst spring discharge while an equivalent porous media systematically generated lower values than the ones measured kovacs 2003 the hydraulic tomography is a useful tool to predict rigorously the spatial distribution of the hydraulic properties or the structural architecture of the fractures and conduits and their properties it involves the use of inverse algorithms to analyze jointly a set of hydraulic data collected during multiple pumping tests carrera et al 2005 cliffe et al 2011 zhou et al 2014 in this framework various inversion algorithms were successfully applied for characterizing the hydraulic properties of fractured and heterogeneous aquifers using both concepts of parametrization discussed in the previous paragraph the equivalent porous media and coupled discrete continuum approach i inversions in an equivalent porous media were led by using geostatistical approaches in which the statistical characteristics of hydraulic properties are used as a priori information to constraint the inversion among these tools we cite sequential successive linear estimator yeh and liu 2000 ni and yeh 2008 hao et al 2008 illman et al 2009 sharmeen et al 2012 pilot point lavenue and de marsily 2001 transitional probability wang et al 2017 anisotropy directions meier et al 2001 multi scale resolution ackerer and delay 2010 or structural approaches probability perturbation method caers and hoffman 2006 image guided soueid ahmed et al 2015 and cellular automata based fischer et al 2017 ii on the other hand the parameterization of hydraulic tomography using a distributed discrete continuum approach is less flexible than the concept of the equivalent porous medium because the discrete continuum model relies on the establishment of the architecture of the conduits and fractures and their hydraulic properties several works have already brought some solutions to these difficulties one solution would be to generate stochastically patterns of networks with various constraints statistical constraints li et al 2014 le coz et al 2017 mechanical constraints bonneau et al 2013 jaquet et al 2004 geological and speleogeological metrics information collon et al 2017 pardo iguzquiza et al 2012 or flows hierarchical identification le goc et al 2010 more recently borghi et al 2016 have combined the use of a generator of karstic networks based on sets of fractures stochastically generated with a gradient based parameters optimization in order to reconstruct a discrete network able to reproduce a set of tracer test hydraulic data in this present article we propose a novel strategy for dealing with hydraulic tomography of fractured and karstic aquifers which we will shorten as the discrete network deterministic inversion dndi the dndi algorithm permits to map the architecture of fractures and conduits networks their hydraulic properties and the distribution of the transmissivity in the hard rock matrix the dndi approach relies on the use of a coupled discrete continuum concept to simulate water flows through a karstic and fractured aquifer and a deterministic optimization algorithm to invert a set of observed piezometric data recorded during multiple pumping tests the model is partitioned in several subspaces each one being piloted locally by a set of parameters including the orientations of the conduit fracture their equivalent transmissivity values and the transmissivity of the rock matrix this partitioning makes it possible to locally modify the directions of the fracture network and to iteratively update the geometry of the global network in order to minimize the objective function in the inverse process the method is tested on several hypothetical and simplified karstic aquifers with simple to more complex conduit networks and with homogeneous or heterogeneous transmissivity in the matrices 2 algorithm framework 2 1 forward problem and model parameterization we represent a confined karstic and fractured aquifer in a two dimensional model γ with an equivalent porous media γ m for representing the water flows where the rock is intact and a discrete network γ n for simulating the water flows in the fracture conduit networks the numerical simulation of groundwater flows are governed by a steady state continuity equation associated to darcy s law considering a laminar flow in both the matrix domain and the discrete networks 1 where qm and qn are punctual water extraction or injection rates per unit of thickness m3 s m applied on the matrix and network respectively k m denotes the matrix hydraulic conductivities m s k n denotes the fractures or conduits equivalent conductivities m s is the piezometric level m common to both domains γ m and γ n em m is the thickness of the matrix block en m is the aperture of the network and vel is an elementary volume at the pumping location m3 we mention that darcy s law formulation in the matrix domain is described in 2d and in 1d for fractured networks at the internal network boundaries that s why we use the tangential gradient operator t ℓ where ℓ is a local directional unit vector of the network to solve the hydraulic equation at the network in the study cases presented later in this article we have chosen to simulate laminar flows as presented in eq 1 in a network of conduits however the property values k n in the network can be more specifically adapted to the behavior of turbulent conduit flows or fracture flows through other empirical laws eventually related to an aperture variable the forward problem consists in solving numerically eq 1 by using a finite element technique with a triangular meshing it links the hydraulic head data simulated continuously over the coupled model to the spatial distribution in the model of the conduits or fractures with their properties in 1d and the hydraulic transmissivities of the matrix in 2d fig 1 the forward problem can be formulated as 2 d f γ p dir p prop ɛ where d is a vector of simulated hydraulic data n 1 f is a forward operator that calculates the hydraulic data field from a model γ p dir p prop defined by given parameters of network geometry p dir and hydraulic properties p prop ε is a null mean gaussian noise to add the uncertainties associated to the numerical discretization technique and the hydraulic experimental data the model is enclosed in a large buffer zone associated to an equivalent porous media mean transmissivity this zone permits to limit the influence of the boundary conditions the dndi inversion algorithm was coded using matlab and is linked to the comsol multiphysics software which runs the forward problems for the dndi algorithm the model domain γ is partitioned in p x squared subspaces along the x axis and p y along the y axis the total of subspaces of the whole domain is then p px py three parameters are assigned to each subspace fig 3 i the local direction of the conduit fracture network ii the local conduit fracture equivalent transmissivity value iii and the local matrix transmissivity value the geometry of the network follows the local direction in each subspace by a node to node principle the network structure enters a subspace by activating one of its four nodes corners of the square and the subspace direction parameter will define to each other node of the subspace the structure will generate this other node will then be activated itself and permits to the structure to include new subspaces a subspace in which the structure has already been generated becomes inhibited to another generation from the same network the generation process is schematized in fig 2 in order to perform this node to node generation an initially activated node has to be specified in the model starting node in fig 3 the model geometry in comsol is built as a discrete grid including all network possibilities a grid of squares and diagonals as presented in fig 3 this whole geometry is initially disabled in the comsol physical part when different network geometries are tested in the inversion process only the associated parts in the model grid are enabled for the solver computation this avoids the creation of a new model geometry for each modification of the network and permits to reduce the computing time in the inversion the parameterization of the whole model is contained in two vectors piloting the subspaces i the local direction in a subspace is selected among six possibilities see fig 3 as a structural parameter dir 1 2 3 4 5 6 the set of structural parameters for all subspaces in the model is contained in a p 1 vector p dir it is also possible to generate more than one network but this would add more unknown structural parameters for example if one would want to generate 3 independent networks in the model each subspace would need to define 3 local directions instead of one thus the structural vector of direction parameters p dir would become a 3p 1 vector ii the local equivalent transmissivity of the structure in a subspace is defined as a property parameter tn and the matrix transmissivity as a property parameter tm the set of property parameters for all subspaces in the model is contained in a 2p 1 vector p prop with the p parameters tn followed by the p parameters tm the entire model γ is thus piloted only by two parameter vectors p dir and p prop and can be noted γ p dir p prop 2 2 inverse problem the inversion process in the dndi algorithm consists in retrieving a model of network of conduit fracture and of spatial distribution of the transmissivities of the network and matrix which permits to maximize two probability density functions ρ network and ρ properties following the theory described by tarantola and valette 1982 for a least square criterion resolution of the inverse problem we calculate ρ network and ρ properties with the bayes theorem by considering gaussian laws for the probability density functions ρ and ρ d obs as certain 3 ρ network p dir d obs p prop ρ d obs p dir p prop ρ p dir ρ d obs ρ network p dir d obs p prop exp 1 2 d obs

prop represents the a posteriori probability density function of the discrete fracture network model for a given hydraulic observed data d obs and the transmissivity model of the network and matrix p prop ρ properties p prop d obs p dir is the a posteriori probability density function of the spatial distribution of the transmissivity parameters for a given hydraulic observed data d obs and network model p dir ρ d obs p dir p prop and ρ d obs p prop p dir represent the probability density functions of the network structure and property models which permit to evaluate the ability of the network structure and property models to reproduce the observed data via the use of the forward operator ρ p dir and ρ p prop represent prior distributions for the unknown parameters it is well known that on one hand the piezometric data are insufficient to cope with the non uniqueness of the solution of an inverse process and on another hand that a deterministic inversion process leads to a single local solution dependent to the initial model for these reasons and in order to additionally constrain the inversion to a more realistic solution in relation to the field knowledges it can be interesting to incorporate prior distributions for the unknown parameters in ρ p dir and ρ p prop the maximization of the a posteriori probability density functions ρ network and ρ properties is equivalent to a minimization of the arguments of the exponentials in eqs 3 and 4 this is what we aim to minimize during the inversion process in the following objective functions ψ 5 ψ network p dir 1 2 d obs f γ p

c p prop 1 p prop prior p prop where d obs is a vector of observed data n 1 p dir and p prop are the unknown parameters to estimate for imaging the geometry of the network in p dir and the hydraulic properties defined here by the equivalent transmissivity of the conduits fractures and the transmissivity of the matrix in p prop p dir prior p 1 and p prop prior 2p 1 are the prior information on the geometry and on the property parameters employed to constrain the inverse problem for overcoming the unrealistic solutions c d n n is a covariance matrix on the observed data that permits to include the uncertainties of the hydraulic data in the inversion process c p dir p p and c p prop 2p 2p are the covariance matrices on the structural and property parameters respectively this separated formulation of the probability density functions between network and properties permits to sequentially estimate the two dependent unknown models p dir and p prop in a first step we focus on the characterization of the network with the piezometric data by fixing the model of the transmissivity distributions in the conduits fractures and matrices the model of network resulting from the first step will then be used in a second step as known parameter to infer the transmissivity pattern 2 3 optimization and uncertainty analysis the minimization of eqs 5 and 6 can be done by optimizing the network geometry and the property values during two sequential iterative processes these optimizations consist in successively modifying the structural and property parameters p dir and p prop the inversion process is led as a sequential optimization fig 4 of i the structural geometry considering as fixed the initially chosen property values ii and the property values t n t m considering as fixed the previously inverted structural geometry the structural optimization is performed iteratively by modifying the structural parameter p dir through a structural sensitivity analysis and by considering the hydraulic properties p prop as fixed at a given iteration step k the sensitivity analysis of the network geometry toward the observed data is recorded into a 6 p sensitivity matrix j n k for a local direction i 1 6 and for a subspace j 1 p the element of the matrix j n k is calculated as 7 j n k i j 1 2 d obs f γ p dir k p dir j i p prop t c d 1 d obs f γ p dir k p dir j i p prop 1 2 p dir prior j i t c p dir 1 p dir prior j i with p dir k p dir j i the structural geometry parameter at the iteration k considering a modified local direction in the subspace j and p dir prior j i the gap between the prior local direction of subspace j and the modified local direction thus the sensitivity matrix guides the evolution of the objective function in eq 5 by testing successively the modification of the network with all possible local direction in each subspace the minimal value in the matrix j n k i min j min designates the local direction i min in the subspace j min which would produce the best decrease in the objective function then the parameters set p dir k is updated from the previous set p dir k p dir k 1 by taking into account the sensitivity analysis minimum p dir k j min i min in order to minimize the objective function at each step of the optimization once the sensitivity analysis cannot find any more p dir configuration decreasing the objective function the iterative structural optimization is stopped the last structural iteration represents the local solution dependent to the initial model the uncertainty analysis of the inverted network geometry can be inferred from the computation of the posterior covariance matrix as 8 c p dir post j 1 6 i 1 6 j n post i j ψ netw ork post c p dir 1 j j 1 where c p dir p o s t j is the posterior structural uncertainty value for the local direction in the subspace j j n post is the last iteration structural sensitivity matrix and ψ network post is the value of the minimized structural objective function if the structural uncertainty value is low then another direction in the subspace would lead to a deterioration of the reproduction of the data on the other hand if the structural uncertainty value is high then the structure in the subspace could have another local direction without significantly degrading the reproduction of the observed data following the network geometry optimization the property parameters optimization will iteratively modify the transmissivities with the previously inverted geometry in order to minimize the objective function in eq 6 the network equivalent transmissivities and the matrix transmissivities are optimized simultaneously at a given iteration step k the parameters set p prop which contains the transmissivities for both the network and the matrix is updated by linearizing eq 6 which can be formulated as 9 p prop k 1 p prop k j p k t c d 1 j p k c p prop 1 1 j p k t c d 1 d obs f γ p dir p prop k c p prop 1 p prop prior p prop k where j p k is the jacobian matrix n 2p that holds the sensitivity for each modeled data f i at the positions of the observed data toward the property values in the matrix and the network this jacobian matrix can be calculated by using a finite difference approach with a finite difference step δp prop 10 j p k i j f i p prop k p prop k j p prop k j δ p prop finally once the objective function has iteratively converged to a minimum the property optimization is stopped the posterior covariance matrix on the inversion of the property values can be calculated as 11 c p prop p o s t j p p o s t t c d 1 j p p o s t c p prop 1 1 where c p prop post is the posterior covariance matrix and j p post is the jacobian matrix of the last iteration step the diagonal entries of the posterior matrix represent the variances on the property values of each subspace 3 validation of the dndi algorithm on hypothetical study cases the dndi inversion algorithm has been tested on three hypothetical and simplified confined karstic fields with network of conduits i in a first case we treat a simple network case with heterogeneity in the equivalent transmissivity of the conduits and a homogenous transmissivity assigned to the matrix ii a second case is similar to the first one but adding a transmissivity variability also in the matrix iii in a third case we seek to image a complex network geometry with the use of two different initial models to start the inverse problem we considered in the forward problem eq 1 a unit thickness for the matrix 2d modeling and a unit aperture for the network but with a variable equivalent transmissivity the buffer zone boundaries were associated to a bound 0 m dirichlet condition and the hydraulic heads were set to 0 0 m initially over the model these theoretical study cases were used to produce 2401 hydraulic drawdown data from 49 pumping measurement boreholes a pumping test is performed alternatively in each borehole distributed homogeneously over the 100 100 m² models the pumping rates were set to 0 6 l min for a borehole in the matrix and 5 l s for one in the conduit network in these different cases for the inversion of the geometry of the network no a priori information has been added on the other hand we have constrained the inversion of the hydraulic properties with a priori values the a priori models on the properties are used also as initial model to launch the inversion process for the property optimization for the matrix we took the log10 t as transmissivity parameter tm for example a transmissivity parameter equal to 6 represents in the model a 10 6 m² s transmissivity value and for the network we took directly the t value as transmissivity parameter tn the covariance matrices c d and c p prop are built as diagonal matrices with a constant variance value σ 2 in the case of the matrix transmissivity the variance value σ t m 2 applies to the exponent of the transmissivity in the case of the network transmissivity the variance value σ t n 2 applies to the transmissivity the partitioning of the models and the chosen inversion parameters values for each study case are given in table 1 the different study cases inversions were led on a 64go ram pc on 2 processors of 16 cores 3 1 study case 1 in a first study case we have tested the ability of the inversion method to reproduce a network geometry with variable conduit equivalent transmissivities in a homogeneous matrix we generated drawdown data from a theoretical model with a 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity and a principal conduit associated to a 0 1 m² s transmissivity and secondary conduits associated to a 0 01 m² s transmissivity firstly we tested an inversion with a small set of data 100 drawdown data from 10 boreholes see the true model in fig 5 we started the inversion from a simple initial model with a single horizontal 0 06 m² s conduit and a homogeneous 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity the structural optimization converged in 10 iterations and the properties optimization in 1 iteration the inverted model reproduces the data set r² 0 97 and approximately the connectivity between the points in the network however this reconstruction remains distant from the true geometry this is due to a lack of data to correctly identify the shape of the conduit network therefore the efficiency of the inversion for mapping the heterogeneity of the hydraulic parameters and retrieving the principal karstic conduits is highly dependent to the number of wells and their locations in the next test we used a denser distribution of wells 49 wells for providing a better spatial resolution in order to image the heterogeneity of the aquifer presented for the same true model in fig 6 the structural optimization converged in 11 iterations and the properties optimization in 1 iteration the inverted model reproduces now the data set r² 0 95 and also a very good representation of the true geometry fig 6 the property optimization permitted to correct the initial equivalent transmissivity of 0 06 m² s to 0 01 m² s for the conduits connected in the bottom right area of the network it permits to reduce the flow rates coming to this zone and enhance the reproduction of the true cones of depression the flows in this zone are mainly conditioned by the properties of the conduits connected directly to the primary drain this affirmation can be supported by the conduit transmissivity standard deviation map produced from eq 11 fig 6 that shows that the properties of the conduits directly connected to the primary drain have lower uncertainties than the primary drain itself in the center of the inverted model the conduit in the bottom right periphery of the inverted model does not image correctly the true model but as the data reproduction is perfect this periphery zone might not be sufficiently described by the data to permit a very good reproduction the uncertainty map confirms that this part of the network has a more uncertain transmissivity value than the rest of the network we have also tested another configuration with more available boreholes than in the case in fig 5 but in which only two boreholes intersect the true karstic network the true model and the inversion result are presented in fig 7 the inverted model can almost reproduce the true network geometry which shows that boreholes even in the matrix can provide information about the localization of nearby conduits this is especially true for the thin conduits which appear in the inverted model although no boreholes are intersecting them therefore the dndi method can be used with dataset with only a few boreholes intersecting the conduits as long as there are a sufficient number of other boreholes in the matrix in suitable locations for characterizing the nearby conduit network 3 2 study case 2 a second study case was led to test the ability of this inversion method to reproduce the data in a case of a karstic network with various conduit properties developed in a heterogeneous matrix we simulated the piezometric data from a theoretical model with the same karstic network than in study case 1 but in a matrix with a transmissivity varying from 5 10 6 m² s to 5 10 7 m² s fig 8 we started the inversion from a simple initial model with a single horizontal 0 04 m² s conduit and a homogeneous 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity the structural optimization converged in 10 iterations and the properties optimization in 3 iterations fig 8 a the structural optimization permitted to retrieve the true geometry of the conduits network but it also added conduits in the bottom left part of the model to reproduce the drawdown data of the more transmissive area of the matrix then the property optimization could reproduce the true transmissivity values distribution in the matrix in the end the inverted model can reproduce the true drawdowns data but its network geometry incorporates parts inexistent in the true model that has been generated in order to simulate a more transmissive area of the matrix before the matrix transmissivity values could be optimized we started a second inversion using the previously inverted model indicated in fig 4 as the multi scale option the structural optimization converged in 2 iterations and the parameter property optimization in 1 iteration fig 8 b the only changes were made during the structural optimization step with an important improvement in the identification of the shape of the conduits in this case the inverted model reproduces the drawdowns data r² 0 99 but is also a good representation of the true network geometry the posterior standard deviation maps produced from eq 11 fig 9 show for the conduit property values a smaller uncertainty for the secondary conduits and a higher uncertainty for the primary drain especially for the part of the network on the left of the model concerning the matrix transmissivity property values the highest uncertainty are located mostly in the most transmissive areas 3 3 study case 3 finally a third study case was led to test the ability of this inversion method to reproduce the data in a case of a complex karstic network geometry we generated drawdown data from a theoretical model with a karstic network with a constant equivalent transmissivity of 0 1 m² s in a homogeneous matrix with a transmissivity of 10 6 m² s fig 10 we started an inversion from a simple initial model with a single vertical 0 1 m² s conduit and a homogeneous 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity the structural optimization converged in 33 iterations and the parameter optimization in 1 iteration fig 10 a the inverted model permits to fit the data set approximately r² 0 78 and represents the global geometry of the conduits network of the true model regarding the simplicity of the initial model the result model remains satisfying we also started an inversion from a more complex initial model with two vertical 0 1 m² s conduits diverging in the upper part of the model in a homogeneous 10 6 m² s matrix transmissivity this initial model geometry representing a simple approximation of the true geometry can be associated to a priori field knowledge information the structural optimization converged in 17 iterations and the parameter optimization in 1 iteration fig 10 b in this case the inverted geometry of the discrete network permits a good reproduction of the data r² 0 97 and is closer to the real network than the case in fig 10 a the structural posterior uncertainty maps produced from eq 8 are presented in fig 11 these maps show that in the case a the highest uncertainties are distributed relatively uniformly among the inverted model while in case b they are mostly located in the periphery of the model here the structural posterior uncertainties are giving important information about the local validity of the different inverted networks 4 discussion we have successfully tested the dndi method on three theoretical and simplified study cases with steady state drawdowns however as we have seen an inversion process is limited by the non uniqueness of its solution therefore using the dndi method requires several prerequisites and the modeler needs to be critical toward the result as we have seen in the first study case the efficiency of the inversion is dependent to the hydraulic data set and in particular the number and the localization of observation wells on the field we note that even wells in the matrix can provide information on nearby conduits for the inversion globally it appears that the most important point about a steady state dataset is to have a homogeneous and sufficiently dense distribution of wells on the site in order to characterize successfully the network concerning the inversion process itself we note in the third study case the ability of the dndi method to image complex networks however as the inversion is deterministic the precision of the result model is dependent to the initial model the inversion process will converge to a local solution dependent to the initial model in fact in fig 10 we show that a simple initial model permitted to reproduce a satisfying global representation of the true model but with local approximations while a more complex initial model permitted a more accurate reproduction of the true model and a faster convergence therefore an inverted model using the dndi method should be analyzed critically like any deterministic inverse methods depending from the initial model the study of the computed structural and property uncertainty values from eqs 8 to 11 can supply this critical analysis on the result model the second study case also illustrates some limits of the sequential optimization of the method especially when starting from a too simple initial model therefore the amount of a priori information introduced in the initial model is important for the accuracy of the result model otherwise as we demonstrate in fig 8 a simple possible operation would be to re run the inversion with a first inversion result to slightly improve the result we would also recommend the coupling of this inversion method to a multiscale method grimstadt et al 2003 which consists in a re run of the inversion starting from a previous result with a refinement of the partitioning it permits to lead several inversions with an initial model each time more precise while saving time as we initially start with a coarsely partitioned model 5 conclusion we present in this paper a novel deterministic inversion method that permits to characterize in a partitioned model the karst conduits and fractures network geometry and their hydraulic properties including the transmissivity distribution of the matrices the dndi method let the modeler choose the partitioning of the model for the inversion this cursor permits to define either an inversion with a coarse partitioning for a quick approximation model or with a fine partitioning and a longer computation time for a better fitting model the use of a discrete network model permits to associate a specific behavior to the flows in the network and thus produces more realistic models than an equivalent porous media model this method can be easily adapted for channels or fractures network models by modifying the properties associated to the discrete network these properties can also be directly linked to an aperture value by choosing an adapted law therefore we believe that the dndi method is an interesting new imagery tool for the distributed modeling associated to a set of data from an investigation in a karstic and or fractured aquifer we have realized different tests in three theoretical and simplified study cases with an increasing complexity and the dndi could always produce satisfying results both on the reproduction of the generated data and on finding the network geometry and property values from the true model as we have seen in the first study case the result of the structural inversion is dependent on the positioning and the amount of observed data this is true for any inversion but is especially important in the case of highly heterogeneous aquifers for delineating the position of the heterogeneities therefore the result of the inversion has to be interpreted critically regarding the set of data used for it a first critical analysis can be performed from the maps of posterior uncertainties on the structure or on the property values that can be produced by using the formulas we propose in this paper the a priori information on the geometry of the network and on the property values is also a way to constrain the inversion in addition to the data this information can be inferred from general field knowledges geological and geophysical information conduits observation in wells through video camera other studies etc because this method is deterministic the choice of the initial model should be based on a relatively coherent possibility and should not be too far from the real solution in order to produce a good result therefore we propose to couple the dndi method to a multi scale method this consists in a first inversion started from an initial model which is followed by a new one that starts from the first inversion solution with a refined partitioning this strategy permits to start from a simple initial model and to progressively make the model more complex and improve the solution an application of this method for mapping the conduits and fractures network with real data from a karstic field is planned for future works these works will be more specifically focused on the sensitivity of the method to the spatial distribution of the measurement boreholes and on delineating the preferential flow paths in the network conflict of interest none acknowledgments we thank the normandy region for providing financial

877,existing analytical or approximate solutions that are appropriate for describing the migration mechanics of co2 and the evolution of fluid pressure in reservoirs do not consider the high compressibility of co2 which reduces their calculation accuracy and application value therefore this work first derives a new governing equation that represents the movement of complex fluids in reservoirs based on the equation of continuity and the generalized darcy s law a more rigorous definition of the coefficient of compressibility of fluid is then presented and a power function model pfm that characterizes the relationship between the physical properties of co2 and the pressure is derived meanwhile to avoid the difficulty of determining the saturation of fluids a method that directly assumes the average relative permeability of each fluid phase in different fluid domains is proposed based on the theory of gradual change an advanced analytical solution is obtained that includes both the partial miscibility and the compressibility of co2 and brine in evaluating the evolution of fluid pressure by integrating within different regions finally two typical sample analyses are used to verify the reliability improved nature and universality of this new analytical solution based on the physical characteristics and the results calculated for the examples this work elaborates the concept and basis of partitioning for use in further work keywords analytical solution compressibility co2 brine flow relative permeability co2 geological storage 1 introduction investigations into the theory of multiphase flow in porous media originated in the exploitation of oil and gas resources it has been shown by many years of engineering practice that the actual flow that is present during the process of exploitation of oil fields under conditions of saturated vapor pressure or with injection of water is two phase flow involving oil gas or oil water kong 2010 therefore the theory of multiphase flow was established gradually beginning in the 1930s in this area the most classic analytical solution is the particular solution for two phase flow in one dimension that was solved by buckley and leverett 1942 according to the method of characteristics assuming incompressible and immiscible flow and no capillary pressure it has been verified by ample practical engineering applications blunt and king 1991 kong 2010 the relevant fluids are mainly incompressible or slightly compressible oil water natural gas etc in the traditional exploitation of oil and gas they are immiscible and the capillary pressure is also small so that the assumptions of the above analytical solution are basically appropriate kong 2010 however in the most recent twenty years oil and gas resources have become increasingly depleted and traditional oil and gas resources and exploitation patterns cannot meet the demand of human development for energy therefore some scholars have proposed a new exploitation method that involves injecting gas nitrogen to enhance the recovery efficiency of oil and gas resources johns et al 2002 taber et al 1997 and new underground resources of shale gas cooper et al 2016 golding et al 2013 condensate gas li et al 2012 etc have been discovered moreover the demand for co2 the main greenhouse gas causing global warming storage is becoming increasingly large because of the increasingly deteriorated environment ipcc 2005 many investigations have suggested that co2 geological storage is the most effective method of sequestration bachu 2000 lal 2008 michael et al 2010 subsequently the concept and method of exploiting underground resources of oil gas geothermal energy etc by injecting co2 and realizing co2 storage at the same time has obtained general support among scholars considering the economic costs alvarado and manrique 2010 damen et al 2005 gozalpour et al 2005 nagy and olajossy 2008 poordad and forutan 2013 pruess 2006 wojnarowski 2012 hence the main fluids are co2 brine or co2 oil in this new kind of engineering however it is not known whether the traditional analytical solutions for multiphase flow are valid because of the particularity of co2 consequently the physical properties of co2 have been studied in many ways fenghour et al 1998 span and wagner 1996 vesovic et al 1990 the results show that the phase diagram of co2 is very special compared with water and other gases with changes in pressure and temperature co2 can reach a supercritical state in addition to the conventional three states of gas liquid and solid when the pressure and temperature approach the critical point 7 38 mpa 31 1 c the physical properties of co2 are very different span and wagner 1996 fig 1 shows the state curves of the physical properties of co2 and brine as a function of pressure a density b viscosity it is clear that co2 has properties including high compressibility low viscosity and low density compared with water therefore the traditional assumption of an incompressible fluid described above is inappropriate in addition co2 is also partially miscible in brine dilmore et al 2006 lu et al 2008 generally to consider the complicated physical properties of co2 scholars prefer to apply numerical methods to explore the migration mechanics of co2 plumes and the evolution of fluid pressure in reservoirs pruess 2005 zyvoloski 2007 however the numerical method is very dependent on the availability of a high performance electronic computer and problems often occur during the solution process these problems include numerical oscillations non convergence and low efficiency therefore sometimes the analytical method reflecting the physical essence of flow may be a better choice mathias et al 2009 mijic et al 2014 wu et al 2016 in terms of analytical methods many scholars have done considerable work in the area of co2 geological storage celia et al 2015 mijic et al 2014 the work of nordbotten and his research group nordbotten and celia 2006a b nordbotten et al 2005a b is most representative they obtained a continuous function that represents the thickness of co2 plume based on the principle of energy minimization and then proposed some semi analytical solutions and approximate solutions subsequently it was further developed by other scholars azizi and cinar 2013 cihan et al 2013 mathias et al 2009 mathias et al 2011a mathias et al 2011b vilarrasa et al 2013 whereas only the partial miscibility of co2 and brine is considered in the above work and it is limited to semi analytical solutions or approximate solutions wu et al 2016 more recently wu et al 2016 developed an explicit integral solution by directly integrating the governing equation of fluid migration in the reservoir the process of solution did not involve any numerical method it is a pure analytical solution that considers the partial miscibility of co2 and brine however as to the compressibility of fluid which has a great of impact on the evolution of fluid pressure in the reservoir for the high compressible fluid media no breakthroughs at all exist in present analytical work it should be noted that minority scholars mijic et al 2014 nordbotten and celia 2006b vilarrasa et al 2010 presented some iterative algorithms for treating compressibility although they are separated from the essence of the analytical method the most pressing problem is that the variation in the density and viscosity of co2 under different pressures and temperatures is very considerable however the appropriate function to characterize this complicated relationship has not yet been derived therefore when considering the compressibility of fluid the only applicable method to update the parameters of the fluid involves establishing a data base pruess 2005 zyvoloski 2007 so that it transforms into a numerical solution method to solve the above problem regarding the compressibility of fluid this work first describes the problem clearly and presents the basic assumptions applied in this article before presenting the following three innovative studies in section 3 we derive a new governing equation that describes the movement of complex fluids in reservoirs by combining the equation of continuity including the compressibility of fluid with the formulation of darcy s law generalized to multiphase flows in section 4 we define a new coefficient of compressibility using the basic concept of compressibility the power function model characterizing the relationship between the physical properties of co2 and pressure is then deduced in section 5 we apply the power function model to the above governing equation and obtain an advanced analytical solution including the compressibility of fluid for the evolution of fluid pressure in the reservoir by integrating within different regions finally we analyze two typical examples to verify the reliability improved nature and universality of this work by comparing the calculated results from this advanced analytical solution with the results of previous analytical solutions and simulated results from tough2 eco2n 2 problem description and basic assumptions to express the problem clearly and conveniently this work subsequently takes a two phase flow involving co2 brine as an example to establish an analytical solution for fluid pressure evolution in the reservoir the corresponding practical projects are mainly co2 geological storage and co2 enhanced geothermal systems in these projects co2 is generally injected into the target reservoirs through injection wells at a constant mass injection rate bai et al 2017 wu et al 2017 as the reservoirs are completely saturated with brine in their natural state the actual migration of the injected co2 is a process by which the co2 continuously displaces the brine however the density of co2 is smaller than that of the brine as shown in fig 1 which induces an apparent phenomenon of buoyancy thus the co2 is concentrated at the tops of reservoirs nordbotten et al 2005a in the flow field of the injected co2 co2 co exists with brine in each pore and they will form separate flow channels by each other because the co2 and brine are only partially miscible kong 2010 the ratios of co2 and brine are expressed by their saturations at one point and the saturation of co2 increases gradually while it decreases for brine during the same process as the displacement develops wu et al 2016 therefore from a macroscopic point of view a schematic profile of co2 and brine flow in the reservoir like that shown in fig 2 is completely different from the piston like displacement kong 2010 in traditional oil and gas fields to describe the actual process of displacement using mathematical models some necessary constraining conditions are needed the main basic assumptions applied in this work are as follows 1 a homogeneous and isotropic reservoir without a hydraulic gradient in its natural state extends infinitely in the horizontal direction and is overlain and underlain by thick impervious rocks 2 the flow is steady and isothermal two phase flow given that the depths of the target reservoirs are greater than 800 m the temperature of any given reservoir is relatively high and steady bachu 2000 2003 thus the actual flow in the reservoir can be regarded as an isothermal process if the injection rate is not particularly large though displacement is essentially an unsteady movement because the saturation density and viscosity of the fluids are all changing it can be considered as a steady flow to permit consideration of the homogeneous and infinite reservoir under a constant injection rate nordbotten et al 2005a 3 the vertical pressure gradient and the capillary pressure in the reservoir are neglected 4 chemical reactions are not considered 5 the reservoir is saturated at all points there is a sharp interface between the co2 and the brine the co2 domain exists on one side of the interface whereas the brine domain exists on the other side nordbotten et al 2005a as injection time increases the interface extends outward gradually and the whole flow field presents three regions with different characteristics the partial miscibility of co2 and brine is considered by the saturation of fluids in region 2 wu et al 2016 the former half of this assumption was proposed by nordbotten et al 2005a subsequently they developed the assumption of two interfaces to consider the residual saturation of brine nordbotten and celia 2006b while the physical concept is very clear it causes great difficulties for the mathematical model and the partial co2 dissolved into brine at the co2 front is still not included mathias et al 2011a wu et al 2016 therefore wu et al 2016 abandoned the multi interface assumption and developed the latter half of this assumption subsequently obtaining a pure analytical solution that not only includes the residual saturation of brine but also considers the partial dissolution of co2 into brine therefore that assumption is also applied in this article so that the final analytical solution can consider both the partial miscibility and the compressibility of co2 and brine noting that the above three regions in fig 2 are not fully agreement with the three domains co2 domain brine domain 1 and brine domain 2 of wu et al 2016 in geometry although the fig 2 here is similar to that of wu et al 2016 specifically co2 domain includes the region 1 and a part of region 2 while the brine domain 1 only is a part of region 2 the physical difference of that is the residual brine distributes in the whole co2 domain in wu et al 2016 while it only distributes in a part of region 2 in this work because the residual brine of region 1 will evaporates and then migrates into the region 2 it will be elaborated further in section 5 3 mathematical model as mentioned previously the pores of the porous medium are all saturated with fluids and each fluid phase has its separate flow channel thus the equation of continuity describing the multiphase flow of complex fluids in the reservoir can be expressed by 1 ρ α ϕ s α t ρ α v α 0 2 s α 1 where ρ is the density of the fluid ml 3 ϕ is the porosity of the reservoir s denotes the saturation of the fluid t is injection time t and v is a tensor of darcy velocity lt 1 the subscript α identifies each fluid with α c for co2 and α w for brine in this article as the upper and lower boundaries are both thick impervious rock layers they can be regarded as zero flow boundaries the second kind of boundary the reservoir extends infinitely in the radial direction so the remote outer boundary is a constant pressure boundary which is consistent with the initial formation pressure and its location is a function of time therefore the outer boundary conditions are 3 p n upper and lower boundaries 0 p r 0 p 0 where p is the vertically averaged fluid pressure in the reservoir ml 1t 2 n is the direction normal to the upper and lower boundaries of the reservoir p r 0 is the vertically averaged fluid pressure at the location of r 0 and p 0 is the initial formation pressure in addition there is an inner boundary in the reservoir i e the injection well it can be considered as a source term or inner boundary when establishing the flow model kong 2010 the latter is adopted here to ease the derivation of the model as shown in eq 4 4 ρ k μ p r r well c c 2 π r well b where k is the absolute permeability of the reservoir l2 μ is the viscosity of the fluid ml 1t 1 r is the radial distance far from the center of the wellbore l and c c is the mass injection rate mt 1 the initial condition is 5 p r t 0 p 0 for steady two phase flow eq 1 can be simplified to 6 ρ c v c ρ w v w 0 furthermore as the homogeneous and isotropic reservoir extends infinitely in the horizontal direction the radial darcy velocity of the fluid is radially symmetric hence in cylindrical coordinates eq 6 can be transformed into 7 1 r r r ρ c v r c r ρ w v r w 0 where vr is the radial darcy velocity of the fluid lt 1 integrating eq 7 we have 8 r ρ c v r c ρ w v r w const taking the relative permeability to represent the athletic ability of each fluid phase in the reservoir the radial darcy velocity of the fluid is 9 v r α k k r α μ α d p d r bringing eq 9 into eq 8 10 r k ρ c k r c μ c ρ w k r w μ w d p d r const where kr is the relative permeability of the fluid importing the inner boundary condition represented by eq 2 we obtained const c c 2πb thus the governing equation that includes the compressibility of the fluid and depicts the movement of complex fluids in a reservoir is 11 ρ c k r c μ c ρ w k r w μ w d p d r c c 2 π r k b since υ μ ρ eq 11 can also be expressed as 12 k r c υ c k r w υ w d p d r c c 2 π r k b where υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid l2t 1 4 coefficient of compressibility as the physical properties of fluids are functions of pressure for isothermal flow kong 2010 to solve the above governing equation by analytical methods the density and viscosity or kinematic viscosity of the fluid must be expressed as explicit functions of pressure as shown in fig 1 the changes in the density and viscosity of brine are very small as pressure increases so these quantities can be considered to be constants for co2 though the differences in density and viscosity under different pressure are very great although rapid changes only occur near the critical point when the pressure approaches a certain value which changes with temperature for example it is approximately 20 mpa for 60 c the relationship between the density and viscosity of co2 and the pressure satisfies some type of function the conclusions of bachu 2003 indicate that the depths of target reservoirs are relatively large so that the temperature of the target reservoir is higher than 40 c and the initial formation pressure is larger than 12 mpa therefore after co2 is injected into the reservoir it is in a supercritical state therefore it is appropriate to use a type of function to characterize the density and viscosity of co2 within a certain pressure interval from the viewpoint of engineering demands in traditional treatments of seepage mechanics in porous media the coefficient of compressibility of a fluid is defined as kong 2010 13 c f 1 v d v d p where c f is the traditional coefficient of compressibility of the fluid ml 1t 2 and v is the volume of the fluid l3 the negative sign means that the volume decreases as pressure increases on the basis of eq 13 an exponential function model efm for density can be deduced 14 ρ ρ 0 e c f ρ p p 0 where ρ0 is the original density of the fluid corresponding to p 0 ml 3 and c fρ is the coefficient of compressibility of the fluid in terms of density ml 1t 2 similarly efms describing the viscosity and kinematic viscosity can be obtained 15 μ μ 0 e c f μ p p 0 16 υ υ 0 e c f υ p p 0 where μ0 ml 1t 1 and υ 0 l2t 1 are the original viscosity and the original kinematic viscosity of the fluid corresponding to p 0 respectively and c fμ ml 1t 2 and c f υ ml 1t 2 are the coefficients of compressibility of the fluid for viscosity and kinematic viscosity respectively moreover the above three coefficients of compressibility satisfy the following relationship so if two of them are known the third can be determined 17 c f υ c f μ c f ρ however it can be found that the density and viscosity of supercritical co2 do not rise in a way that follows the form of an exponential function as pressure increases the actual rate of rise decreases gradually according to fig 1 therefore the traditional definition of the coefficient of compressibility is inappropriate especially for co2 analyzing eq 13 from a mathematical perspective a problem can be found in that the traditional definition adopts the ratio of the volumetric relative change to the absolute change of pressure which is not enough scientific in mathematics a more rigorous definition about the coefficient of compressibility would be 18 c f d v v d p p where c f is the new coefficient of compressibility of a fluid defined by this work hence the power function model pfm describing the density viscosity and kinematic viscosity can be derived 19 ρ ρ 0 p p 0 c f ρ μ μ 0 p p 0 c f μ υ υ 0 p p 0 c f υ where c f ρ c f μ a n d c f υ are the new coefficients describing the compressibility of fluids with respect to density viscosity and kinematic viscosity respectively similarly the three new coefficients of compressibility satisfy eq 20 20 c f υ c f μ c f ρ here taking the data of nist chemistry webbook 2016 as standard we compared it with the results predicted using the efm and the pfm for density viscosity and kinematic viscosity to verify which definition of the coefficient of compressibility is more reliable and appropriate we adopt the three different temperatures shown in fig 1 40 c 60 c and 80 c and the corresponding pressure intervals are 15 35 mpa 20 40 mpa and 25 45 mpa respectively the original pressure under different temperatures is close to the corresponding initial formation pressure so the results can be applied in engineering applications directly table 1 shows the values of coefficients of compressibility in the efm and pfm under different temperatures and the comparison of predicted results are shown in fig 3 and table 2 meanwhile considering eq 12 the kinematic viscosity of brine under different pressures are also shown in fig 3 based on fig 3 it is clear that the results predicted by the pfm are more consistent with the nist data compared with the results predicted by the efm in addition the coefficients associated with the pfm are all larger than those of the efm according to table 2 these results suggest that the new definition of the coefficient of compressibility can better characterize the relationship between the physical properties of fluids and pressure therefore it will be applied in section 5 as the physical properties of brine are taken to be constant in the following text the symbols representing the coefficients of compressibility will be the same as in eq 19 all these symbols denote the coefficients of compressibility of co2 moreover the rate of increase of the pfm is decreasing as well as the increase in pressure according to fig 3 these results are consistent with the actual case therefore the results predicted by the pfm are still relatively ideal even extending the interval of pressure to some extent as fig 3 d shows the kinematic viscosity of brine is more stable than its density and viscosity this result indicates that incorporating the density into the governing equation transforms the viscosity into the kinematic viscosity which improves the accuracy of models though they are all regarded as constants for brine that is models that include the compressibility of fluid are more reliable 5 solution using analytical methods according to assumption 5 and the idea of wu et al 2016 during the process of injecting co2 to displace brine the whole flow field can be divided into three regions as shown in fig 2 region 1 is dry co2 it is continuously provided with gas inducing increases in fluid pressure so it can be named as the gas source region region 2 is wet co2 and brine containing a little co2 here co2 is continuously transferred from the gas source region into region 3 it displaces the original brine at the same time so this region is named the region of displacement the co2 and brine are partially miscible and form a sharp interface in this region therefore we name the two sides of the interface as the co2 domain and the brine domain region 3 contains only brine which continuously drains away and decreases in pressure so this region is named the region of drainage in existing work to solve the governing equation describing the movement of complex fluids in the reservoir by analytical methods or semi analytical methods the usual approach is to assume the saturation of each fluid phase in the flow field select the relative permeability model and finally solve the model there is no problem for the gas source region and the region of drainage however with regard to the region of displacement the approach of assuming an average saturation based on the different fluid domains must be discussed further the most important disadvantage is its indeterminacy it is difficult to find the appropriate average saturation wu et al 2016 presented a method for performing sensitivity analysis using various parameter combinations to determine the saturation of each fluid phase of different fluid domains in the region of displacement however it is random and difficult to apply actually according to the mathematical model in section 3 the parameter necessary for solving the governing equation above is the relative permeability of each fluid phase not their saturation therefore it may be better to directly assume the relative permeability of each fluid phase in the flow field in the gas source region the residual brine will evaporate into the co2 it is then brought into the region of displacement by the co2 and forms the wet co2 in the region of displacement given that only co2 exists in the gas source region the relative permeability of co2 and brine are 1 and 0 respectively in the region of drainage the flow is made up solely of brine and the relative permeability of co2 and the brine are 0 and 1 respectively these values are consistent with the method of assuming saturation for the region of displacement it is necessary to assume the relative permeability of each fluid phase based on the different fluid domains taking the region of displacement as the unit of the control body we have k r w r c 0 and k r c r c 1 at the left side i e only co2 is flowing into the unit similarly on the right side k r w r max 1 and k r c r max 0 i e only brine flows out the unit from left to right the relative permeability of co2 changes gradually from 1 to 0 while the relative permeability of the brine changes from 0 to 1 therefore according to the theory of gradual change the average of the relative permeability of each fluid phase at the two sides of the unit can be considered to be the average relative permeability of the unit 21 k r c 2 k r c r c k r c r max 2 0 5 k r w 2 k r w r c k r w r max 2 0 5 where k r α x is the averaged relative permeability of a fluid at the location region of x the second subscript x 1 2 3 2c 2w r c and r max which denote the gas source region the region of displacement the region of drainage the co2 domain in the region of displacement the brine domain in the region of displacement and the location of r c and r max respectively similarly the parameters k rα x s α x ρα x and so on are all like this as the enriched fluid phase is the main flow in the different fluid domains the contribution of the other fluid to the effective permeability is negligible kong 2010 hence the averaged relative permeability of co2 in the co2 domain is equal to the averaged relative permeability of co2 in the region of displacement i e k r c 2 c k r c 2 similarly k r w 2 w k r w 2 thus the average saturation of each fluid phase in the co2 domain and the brine domain can be obtained on the basis of the relative permeability model if we bring the average saturation into the relative permeability model again the relative permeability of the non enriched fluid phase can be obtained so the reliability of ignoring it can be verified we take the corey model pruess et al 1999 as an example setting the residual saturation of co2 and brine to 0 05 and 0 4 respectively according to k r c 2 c 0 5 and k r w 2 w 0 5 we obtained s w 2 c 0 5465 and s w 2 w 0 8625 and then we have k r w 2 c 0 005 and k r c 2 w 0 007 the relative errors are 1 and 1 4 respectively so ignoring the relative permeability of non enriched fluid phase leads to acceptable reliability based on the above analysis to obtain the solution to the governing equation the method of integrating within different regions is available wu et al 2016 as the given outer boundary condition is located at the right side of the region of drainage so the order of integrating is opposite to the direction of flow i e it progresses in order from the region of drainage to the region of displacement and the gas source region moreover the results from the preceding region are taken as the given outer boundary conditions for the next region it is convenient to define the mass mobility of each fluid phase ωα l 2t as 22 ω α k r α ρ α μ α k r α υ α within the region of drainage r max r r 0 only brine flow occurs so the total mass mobility of region is equal to the mass mobility of brine or 23 ω 3 ω w 3 k r w 3 υ w 3 hence the integral form of the above governing equation in this region is 24 p p 0 d p c c 2 π k b r r 0 1 r ω w 3 d r integrating eq 24 we obtain 25 p p 0 c c 2 π k b ω w 3 ln r 0 r therefore the fluid pressure at r max is 26 p r max p 0 c c 2 π k b ω w 3 ln r 0 r max for the region of displacement r c r r max as shown in fig 2 the co2 domain and the brine domain both exist at any given location so the total mass mobility of the complex fluid is 27 ω 2 b b ω c 2 c ω w 2 c b b b ω c 2 w ω w 2 w as the relative permeability of the non enriched fluid phases is negligible compared with the enriched fluid phase within different fluid domains eq 27 can be simplified to 28 ω 2 b b ω c 2 c b b b ω w 2 w the interface between the co2 domain and the brine domain satisfies the following continuous function which was derived by nordbotten et al 2005a based on the principle of energy minimization and the calculus of variations expressing it in terms of mass mobility leads to 29 b b ω c 2 c ω w 2 w ω c 2 c ω w 2 w m c ϕ π b r 2 ρ c ω w 2 w where 30 m c 0 t c c d

region r well r r c is similar to the region of drainage only co2 flow occurs here and the mass mobility of this region is 37 ω 1 ω c 1 k r c 1 υ c r c p p r c c f υ ω c r c p p r c c f υ incorporating this relation into the governing equation the integral form of the governing equation in this region can be deduced that is 38 p p r c p p r c c f υ d p c c 2 π k b r r c 1 r ω c r c d r integrating eq 38 we have 39 p p r c 1 c c 1 c f υ 2 π k b ω c r c p r c ln r c r 1 1 c f υ therefore the fluid pressure located at the wall of wellbore is 40 p k p r c 1 c c 1 c f υ 2 π k b ω c r c p

r 0 note that eq 41 is similar to eq 20 of wu et al 2016 the essential difference is that only the partial miscibility of co2 and brine is included in the latter however the compressibility of fluid is also considered in the former except that to include the compressibility the new definition for the coefficient of compressibility and the assumption of relative permeability both are very significant and available for multi phase flow in porous media in addition the former belongs to the class of power function models while the latter is an exponential function model as to the three characteristic radiuses in the reservoir they are obtained by the following method letting b b and b 0 r c and r max can be derived directly that is 42 r c ω w r c m c ω c r c ϕ π b ρ c r c r max ω c

storage coefficient of the porous medium t is the transmissivity of the porous medium l2t 1 α p β w are the traditional coefficient of compressibility of the pore and brine water ml 1t 2 respectively and u 0 is the zero of the well function which corresponds to the outer boundary 6 application and verification in this section analyses of two typical examples are implemented to verify the reliability improved nature and universality of the above advanced analytical solution for depicting the evaluation of fluid pressure in the reservoir specifically it includes three aspects 1 comparison of the results calculated using the advanced analytical solution with simulated results from tough2 eco2n pruess 2005 to verify its reliability 2 comparison of the results calculated using the advanced analytical solution with the results of previous analytical solution wu et al 2016 to verify that it represents an improvement 3 application to two examples with differing reservoir characteristics to verify its universality example 1 represents a typical reservoir in the shenhua ccs demonstration project china whose depth and temperature are approximately 2 km and 60 c respectively it represents a reservoir with characteristics widely seen in china including a small thickness and low permeability liu et al 2013 xie et al 2015a xie et al 2015b the basic parameters used in the calculations are shown in table 3 example 2 is a standard example presented in the manual of tough2 eco2n the depth and temperature of the reservoir are approximately 1 2 km and 45 c respectively it is a quite typical reservoir and has characteristics that are seen all over the world including a considerable thickness and high permeability bachu 2003 pruess 2005 the basic parameters used in the calculations are shown in table 4 6 1 example 1 for example 1 in tough2 eco2n the cylindrical grids extend 50 km in the radial direction we selected the corey model to calculate the relative permeability and the residual saturation of brine and co2 are 0 4 and 0 05 respectively the capillary pressure is ignored and 10 000 days of continuous co2 injection are simulated the results calculated with this advanced analytical solution ana sol 2 in figures and the previous analytical solution ana sol 1 in figures and the simulated results from tough2 eco2n tough2 in figures are plotted in one figure figs 4 and 6 show a comparison of predicted fluid pressure profiles at three different locations as a function of injection time as well as a comparison of predicted fluid pressure profiles at three different moments as a function of radial distance respectively in addition the corresponding relative error profiles of the analytical solutions are shown in figs 5 and 7 it is clear from figs 4 and 6 that the fluid pressures predicted using the analytical solutions and the numerical solution have the same trend the curves rise as injection time increases while it decreases as radial distance increases this result verifies the reliability of this advanced analytical solution as shown in figs 5 and 7 the maximal relative error of the previous analytical solution exceeds 6 whereas it is only 4 for the advanced analytical solution and the relative error is mostly less than 3 this result suggests that the analytical solution that includes the compressibility is more accurate and closer to actual conditions so the advancement represented by this work is clear furthermore there are three turning points of pressure drop in the spatial distribution curves of pressure taking the results for 10 days as example the three turning points are located at 11 46 m 65 99 m and 1018 52 m respectively they are consistent with the three characteristic radiuses rc rmax and r 0 in the reservoir at that moment therefore it can be found from fig 6 that the rates of pressure decrease are constants in the gas source region and the region of drainage while the rate of pressure decrease rises gradually in the region of displacement in addition the ordering of the three rates is the region of displacement the region of drainage the gas source region the results also indicate that the resistance to flow in the region of displacement is the largest and it increases along the flow direction moreover the resistance to flow of the single co2 phase is small the main reasons are as follows 1 the surface tension at the interface between the co2 and the brine is sufficiently large 2 the viscosity of co2 is small moreover from the perspective of relative error the relative errors of the analytical solutions are greatest in the region of displacement compared with the other two regions this result indicates that the unsteady flow mainly occurs in the region of displacement whereas steady flow occurs in the gas source region and the region of drainage with increasing injection time the ratio of the region of displacement to the other two regions becomes increasingly small so the actual flow in the reservoir tends to gradually become quasi steady 6 2 example 2 for example 2 in tough2 eco2n the differences in the parameter values used compared with example 1 include two aspects 1 the cylindrical grids extend 100 km in the radial direction and 2 the residual saturation of the brine is 0 3 we use the same way to display the results which are shown in figs 8 11 the conclusions drawn from figs 8 11 are consistent with those obtained from figs 4 7 which demonstrated that the advanced analytical solution is applicable in both of the two kinds of typical reservoirs thus the universality of the advanced analytical solution is verified and it is applicable all over the world 7 conclusions to consider the compressibility of fluids especially for co2 this work derived a new governing equation of describing the movement of complex fluids in reservoirs that is based on the equation of continuity and including the compressibility of fluid and darcy s law generalized to multiphase flows an advanced analytical solution about the evolution of fluid pressure was then obtained by integrating within different regions analyses of two typical examples verified the reliability improved nature and universality of this new analytical solution and it can be used in engineering applications all over the world to solve the problems associated with the traditional coefficient of compressibility which cannot characterize the relationship between the physical properties of co2 and pressure this work provided a more rigorous definition for the coefficient of compressibility of fluid then derived the corresponding power function model pfm comparison with a standard data base shows that the pfm is more accurate and applicable than the traditional exponential function model verifying the reliability of the new definition regarding the problem of difficulties in determining the saturation of fluids a method of directly assuming the averaged relative permeability of each fluid phase in different fluid domains was proposed according to the theory of gradual change this method avoids the difficulties of determining the saturation of fluids and also eliminates the errors associated with the relative permeability models for risk assessment of reservoirs improving the simulation accuracy according to the characteristics of the movement and distribution of complex fluids in reservoirs this work divided the flow field into three regions ordered according to increasing radial distance these regions are the gas source region the region of displacement and the region of drainage moreover unsteady flow is always present in the region of displacement while steady flow occurs in the other two regions with increasing injection time the ratio of the region of displacement to the other two regions becomes increasingly small so that the actual flow in the reservoir tends to gradually become quasi steady the results of the sample calculations show that the surface tension at the interface between the co2 and the brine is sufficiently large that the assumption of neglecting the capillary pressure induces a certain amount of error it is worthwhile to investigate it in the future acknowledgment this work was sponsored by the program of international science and technology cooperation china grant no s2016g9005 
877,existing analytical or approximate solutions that are appropriate for describing the migration mechanics of co2 and the evolution of fluid pressure in reservoirs do not consider the high compressibility of co2 which reduces their calculation accuracy and application value therefore this work first derives a new governing equation that represents the movement of complex fluids in reservoirs based on the equation of continuity and the generalized darcy s law a more rigorous definition of the coefficient of compressibility of fluid is then presented and a power function model pfm that characterizes the relationship between the physical properties of co2 and the pressure is derived meanwhile to avoid the difficulty of determining the saturation of fluids a method that directly assumes the average relative permeability of each fluid phase in different fluid domains is proposed based on the theory of gradual change an advanced analytical solution is obtained that includes both the partial miscibility and the compressibility of co2 and brine in evaluating the evolution of fluid pressure by integrating within different regions finally two typical sample analyses are used to verify the reliability improved nature and universality of this new analytical solution based on the physical characteristics and the results calculated for the examples this work elaborates the concept and basis of partitioning for use in further work keywords analytical solution compressibility co2 brine flow relative permeability co2 geological storage 1 introduction investigations into the theory of multiphase flow in porous media originated in the exploitation of oil and gas resources it has been shown by many years of engineering practice that the actual flow that is present during the process of exploitation of oil fields under conditions of saturated vapor pressure or with injection of water is two phase flow involving oil gas or oil water kong 2010 therefore the theory of multiphase flow was established gradually beginning in the 1930s in this area the most classic analytical solution is the particular solution for two phase flow in one dimension that was solved by buckley and leverett 1942 according to the method of characteristics assuming incompressible and immiscible flow and no capillary pressure it has been verified by ample practical engineering applications blunt and king 1991 kong 2010 the relevant fluids are mainly incompressible or slightly compressible oil water natural gas etc in the traditional exploitation of oil and gas they are immiscible and the capillary pressure is also small so that the assumptions of the above analytical solution are basically appropriate kong 2010 however in the most recent twenty years oil and gas resources have become increasingly depleted and traditional oil and gas resources and exploitation patterns cannot meet the demand of human development for energy therefore some scholars have proposed a new exploitation method that involves injecting gas nitrogen to enhance the recovery efficiency of oil and gas resources johns et al 2002 taber et al 1997 and new underground resources of shale gas cooper et al 2016 golding et al 2013 condensate gas li et al 2012 etc have been discovered moreover the demand for co2 the main greenhouse gas causing global warming storage is becoming increasingly large because of the increasingly deteriorated environment ipcc 2005 many investigations have suggested that co2 geological storage is the most effective method of sequestration bachu 2000 lal 2008 michael et al 2010 subsequently the concept and method of exploiting underground resources of oil gas geothermal energy etc by injecting co2 and realizing co2 storage at the same time has obtained general support among scholars considering the economic costs alvarado and manrique 2010 damen et al 2005 gozalpour et al 2005 nagy and olajossy 2008 poordad and forutan 2013 pruess 2006 wojnarowski 2012 hence the main fluids are co2 brine or co2 oil in this new kind of engineering however it is not known whether the traditional analytical solutions for multiphase flow are valid because of the particularity of co2 consequently the physical properties of co2 have been studied in many ways fenghour et al 1998 span and wagner 1996 vesovic et al 1990 the results show that the phase diagram of co2 is very special compared with water and other gases with changes in pressure and temperature co2 can reach a supercritical state in addition to the conventional three states of gas liquid and solid when the pressure and temperature approach the critical point 7 38 mpa 31 1 c the physical properties of co2 are very different span and wagner 1996 fig 1 shows the state curves of the physical properties of co2 and brine as a function of pressure a density b viscosity it is clear that co2 has properties including high compressibility low viscosity and low density compared with water therefore the traditional assumption of an incompressible fluid described above is inappropriate in addition co2 is also partially miscible in brine dilmore et al 2006 lu et al 2008 generally to consider the complicated physical properties of co2 scholars prefer to apply numerical methods to explore the migration mechanics of co2 plumes and the evolution of fluid pressure in reservoirs pruess 2005 zyvoloski 2007 however the numerical method is very dependent on the availability of a high performance electronic computer and problems often occur during the solution process these problems include numerical oscillations non convergence and low efficiency therefore sometimes the analytical method reflecting the physical essence of flow may be a better choice mathias et al 2009 mijic et al 2014 wu et al 2016 in terms of analytical methods many scholars have done considerable work in the area of co2 geological storage celia et al 2015 mijic et al 2014 the work of nordbotten and his research group nordbotten and celia 2006a b nordbotten et al 2005a b is most representative they obtained a continuous function that represents the thickness of co2 plume based on the principle of energy minimization and then proposed some semi analytical solutions and approximate solutions subsequently it was further developed by other scholars azizi and cinar 2013 cihan et al 2013 mathias et al 2009 mathias et al 2011a mathias et al 2011b vilarrasa et al 2013 whereas only the partial miscibility of co2 and brine is considered in the above work and it is limited to semi analytical solutions or approximate solutions wu et al 2016 more recently wu et al 2016 developed an explicit integral solution by directly integrating the governing equation of fluid migration in the reservoir the process of solution did not involve any numerical method it is a pure analytical solution that considers the partial miscibility of co2 and brine however as to the compressibility of fluid which has a great of impact on the evolution of fluid pressure in the reservoir for the high compressible fluid media no breakthroughs at all exist in present analytical work it should be noted that minority scholars mijic et al 2014 nordbotten and celia 2006b vilarrasa et al 2010 presented some iterative algorithms for treating compressibility although they are separated from the essence of the analytical method the most pressing problem is that the variation in the density and viscosity of co2 under different pressures and temperatures is very considerable however the appropriate function to characterize this complicated relationship has not yet been derived therefore when considering the compressibility of fluid the only applicable method to update the parameters of the fluid involves establishing a data base pruess 2005 zyvoloski 2007 so that it transforms into a numerical solution method to solve the above problem regarding the compressibility of fluid this work first describes the problem clearly and presents the basic assumptions applied in this article before presenting the following three innovative studies in section 3 we derive a new governing equation that describes the movement of complex fluids in reservoirs by combining the equation of continuity including the compressibility of fluid with the formulation of darcy s law generalized to multiphase flows in section 4 we define a new coefficient of compressibility using the basic concept of compressibility the power function model characterizing the relationship between the physical properties of co2 and pressure is then deduced in section 5 we apply the power function model to the above governing equation and obtain an advanced analytical solution including the compressibility of fluid for the evolution of fluid pressure in the reservoir by integrating within different regions finally we analyze two typical examples to verify the reliability improved nature and universality of this work by comparing the calculated results from this advanced analytical solution with the results of previous analytical solutions and simulated results from tough2 eco2n 2 problem description and basic assumptions to express the problem clearly and conveniently this work subsequently takes a two phase flow involving co2 brine as an example to establish an analytical solution for fluid pressure evolution in the reservoir the corresponding practical projects are mainly co2 geological storage and co2 enhanced geothermal systems in these projects co2 is generally injected into the target reservoirs through injection wells at a constant mass injection rate bai et al 2017 wu et al 2017 as the reservoirs are completely saturated with brine in their natural state the actual migration of the injected co2 is a process by which the co2 continuously displaces the brine however the density of co2 is smaller than that of the brine as shown in fig 1 which induces an apparent phenomenon of buoyancy thus the co2 is concentrated at the tops of reservoirs nordbotten et al 2005a in the flow field of the injected co2 co2 co exists with brine in each pore and they will form separate flow channels by each other because the co2 and brine are only partially miscible kong 2010 the ratios of co2 and brine are expressed by their saturations at one point and the saturation of co2 increases gradually while it decreases for brine during the same process as the displacement develops wu et al 2016 therefore from a macroscopic point of view a schematic profile of co2 and brine flow in the reservoir like that shown in fig 2 is completely different from the piston like displacement kong 2010 in traditional oil and gas fields to describe the actual process of displacement using mathematical models some necessary constraining conditions are needed the main basic assumptions applied in this work are as follows 1 a homogeneous and isotropic reservoir without a hydraulic gradient in its natural state extends infinitely in the horizontal direction and is overlain and underlain by thick impervious rocks 2 the flow is steady and isothermal two phase flow given that the depths of the target reservoirs are greater than 800 m the temperature of any given reservoir is relatively high and steady bachu 2000 2003 thus the actual flow in the reservoir can be regarded as an isothermal process if the injection rate is not particularly large though displacement is essentially an unsteady movement because the saturation density and viscosity of the fluids are all changing it can be considered as a steady flow to permit consideration of the homogeneous and infinite reservoir under a constant injection rate nordbotten et al 2005a 3 the vertical pressure gradient and the capillary pressure in the reservoir are neglected 4 chemical reactions are not considered 5 the reservoir is saturated at all points there is a sharp interface between the co2 and the brine the co2 domain exists on one side of the interface whereas the brine domain exists on the other side nordbotten et al 2005a as injection time increases the interface extends outward gradually and the whole flow field presents three regions with different characteristics the partial miscibility of co2 and brine is considered by the saturation of fluids in region 2 wu et al 2016 the former half of this assumption was proposed by nordbotten et al 2005a subsequently they developed the assumption of two interfaces to consider the residual saturation of brine nordbotten and celia 2006b while the physical concept is very clear it causes great difficulties for the mathematical model and the partial co2 dissolved into brine at the co2 front is still not included mathias et al 2011a wu et al 2016 therefore wu et al 2016 abandoned the multi interface assumption and developed the latter half of this assumption subsequently obtaining a pure analytical solution that not only includes the residual saturation of brine but also considers the partial dissolution of co2 into brine therefore that assumption is also applied in this article so that the final analytical solution can consider both the partial miscibility and the compressibility of co2 and brine noting that the above three regions in fig 2 are not fully agreement with the three domains co2 domain brine domain 1 and brine domain 2 of wu et al 2016 in geometry although the fig 2 here is similar to that of wu et al 2016 specifically co2 domain includes the region 1 and a part of region 2 while the brine domain 1 only is a part of region 2 the physical difference of that is the residual brine distributes in the whole co2 domain in wu et al 2016 while it only distributes in a part of region 2 in this work because the residual brine of region 1 will evaporates and then migrates into the region 2 it will be elaborated further in section 5 3 mathematical model as mentioned previously the pores of the porous medium are all saturated with fluids and each fluid phase has its separate flow channel thus the equation of continuity describing the multiphase flow of complex fluids in the reservoir can be expressed by 1 ρ α ϕ s α t ρ α v α 0 2 s α 1 where ρ is the density of the fluid ml 3 ϕ is the porosity of the reservoir s denotes the saturation of the fluid t is injection time t and v is a tensor of darcy velocity lt 1 the subscript α identifies each fluid with α c for co2 and α w for brine in this article as the upper and lower boundaries are both thick impervious rock layers they can be regarded as zero flow boundaries the second kind of boundary the reservoir extends infinitely in the radial direction so the remote outer boundary is a constant pressure boundary which is consistent with the initial formation pressure and its location is a function of time therefore the outer boundary conditions are 3 p n upper and lower boundaries 0 p r 0 p 0 where p is the vertically averaged fluid pressure in the reservoir ml 1t 2 n is the direction normal to the upper and lower boundaries of the reservoir p r 0 is the vertically averaged fluid pressure at the location of r 0 and p 0 is the initial formation pressure in addition there is an inner boundary in the reservoir i e the injection well it can be considered as a source term or inner boundary when establishing the flow model kong 2010 the latter is adopted here to ease the derivation of the model as shown in eq 4 4 ρ k μ p r r well c c 2 π r well b where k is the absolute permeability of the reservoir l2 μ is the viscosity of the fluid ml 1t 1 r is the radial distance far from the center of the wellbore l and c c is the mass injection rate mt 1 the initial condition is 5 p r t 0 p 0 for steady two phase flow eq 1 can be simplified to 6 ρ c v c ρ w v w 0 furthermore as the homogeneous and isotropic reservoir extends infinitely in the horizontal direction the radial darcy velocity of the fluid is radially symmetric hence in cylindrical coordinates eq 6 can be transformed into 7 1 r r r ρ c v r c r ρ w v r w 0 where vr is the radial darcy velocity of the fluid lt 1 integrating eq 7 we have 8 r ρ c v r c ρ w v r w const taking the relative permeability to represent the athletic ability of each fluid phase in the reservoir the radial darcy velocity of the fluid is 9 v r α k k r α μ α d p d r bringing eq 9 into eq 8 10 r k ρ c k r c μ c ρ w k r w μ w d p d r const where kr is the relative permeability of the fluid importing the inner boundary condition represented by eq 2 we obtained const c c 2πb thus the governing equation that includes the compressibility of the fluid and depicts the movement of complex fluids in a reservoir is 11 ρ c k r c μ c ρ w k r w μ w d p d r c c 2 π r k b since υ μ ρ eq 11 can also be expressed as 12 k r c υ c k r w υ w d p d r c c 2 π r k b where υ is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid l2t 1 4 coefficient of compressibility as the physical properties of fluids are functions of pressure for isothermal flow kong 2010 to solve the above governing equation by analytical methods the density and viscosity or kinematic viscosity of the fluid must be expressed as explicit functions of pressure as shown in fig 1 the changes in the density and viscosity of brine are very small as pressure increases so these quantities can be considered to be constants for co2 though the differences in density and viscosity under different pressure are very great although rapid changes only occur near the critical point when the pressure approaches a certain value which changes with temperature for example it is approximately 20 mpa for 60 c the relationship between the density and viscosity of co2 and the pressure satisfies some type of function the conclusions of bachu 2003 indicate that the depths of target reservoirs are relatively large so that the temperature of the target reservoir is higher than 40 c and the initial formation pressure is larger than 12 mpa therefore after co2 is injected into the reservoir it is in a supercritical state therefore it is appropriate to use a type of function to characterize the density and viscosity of co2 within a certain pressure interval from the viewpoint of engineering demands in traditional treatments of seepage mechanics in porous media the coefficient of compressibility of a fluid is defined as kong 2010 13 c f 1 v d v d p where c f is the traditional coefficient of compressibility of the fluid ml 1t 2 and v is the volume of the fluid l3 the negative sign means that the volume decreases as pressure increases on the basis of eq 13 an exponential function model efm for density can be deduced 14 ρ ρ 0 e c f ρ p p 0 where ρ0 is the original density of the fluid corresponding to p 0 ml 3 and c fρ is the coefficient of compressibility of the fluid in terms of density ml 1t 2 similarly efms describing the viscosity and kinematic viscosity can be obtained 15 μ μ 0 e c f μ p p 0 16 υ υ 0 e c f υ p p 0 where μ0 ml 1t 1 and υ 0 l2t 1 are the original viscosity and the original kinematic viscosity of the fluid corresponding to p 0 respectively and c fμ ml 1t 2 and c f υ ml 1t 2 are the coefficients of compressibility of the fluid for viscosity and kinematic viscosity respectively moreover the above three coefficients of compressibility satisfy the following relationship so if two of them are known the third can be determined 17 c f υ c f μ c f ρ however it can be found that the density and viscosity of supercritical co2 do not rise in a way that follows the form of an exponential function as pressure increases the actual rate of rise decreases gradually according to fig 1 therefore the traditional definition of the coefficient of compressibility is inappropriate especially for co2 analyzing eq 13 from a mathematical perspective a problem can be found in that the traditional definition adopts the ratio of the volumetric relative change to the absolute change of pressure which is not enough scientific in mathematics a more rigorous definition about the coefficient of compressibility would be 18 c f d v v d p p where c f is the new coefficient of compressibility of a fluid defined by this work hence the power function model pfm describing the density viscosity and kinematic viscosity can be derived 19 ρ ρ 0 p p 0 c f ρ μ μ 0 p p 0 c f μ υ υ 0 p p 0 c f υ where c f ρ c f μ a n d c f υ are the new coefficients describing the compressibility of fluids with respect to density viscosity and kinematic viscosity respectively similarly the three new coefficients of compressibility satisfy eq 20 20 c f υ c f μ c f ρ here taking the data of nist chemistry webbook 2016 as standard we compared it with the results predicted using the efm and the pfm for density viscosity and kinematic viscosity to verify which definition of the coefficient of compressibility is more reliable and appropriate we adopt the three different temperatures shown in fig 1 40 c 60 c and 80 c and the corresponding pressure intervals are 15 35 mpa 20 40 mpa and 25 45 mpa respectively the original pressure under different temperatures is close to the corresponding initial formation pressure so the results can be applied in engineering applications directly table 1 shows the values of coefficients of compressibility in the efm and pfm under different temperatures and the comparison of predicted results are shown in fig 3 and table 2 meanwhile considering eq 12 the kinematic viscosity of brine under different pressures are also shown in fig 3 based on fig 3 it is clear that the results predicted by the pfm are more consistent with the nist data compared with the results predicted by the efm in addition the coefficients associated with the pfm are all larger than those of the efm according to table 2 these results suggest that the new definition of the coefficient of compressibility can better characterize the relationship between the physical properties of fluids and pressure therefore it will be applied in section 5 as the physical properties of brine are taken to be constant in the following text the symbols representing the coefficients of compressibility will be the same as in eq 19 all these symbols denote the coefficients of compressibility of co2 moreover the rate of increase of the pfm is decreasing as well as the increase in pressure according to fig 3 these results are consistent with the actual case therefore the results predicted by the pfm are still relatively ideal even extending the interval of pressure to some extent as fig 3 d shows the kinematic viscosity of brine is more stable than its density and viscosity this result indicates that incorporating the density into the governing equation transforms the viscosity into the kinematic viscosity which improves the accuracy of models though they are all regarded as constants for brine that is models that include the compressibility of fluid are more reliable 5 solution using analytical methods according to assumption 5 and the idea of wu et al 2016 during the process of injecting co2 to displace brine the whole flow field can be divided into three regions as shown in fig 2 region 1 is dry co2 it is continuously provided with gas inducing increases in fluid pressure so it can be named as the gas source region region 2 is wet co2 and brine containing a little co2 here co2 is continuously transferred from the gas source region into region 3 it displaces the original brine at the same time so this region is named the region of displacement the co2 and brine are partially miscible and form a sharp interface in this region therefore we name the two sides of the interface as the co2 domain and the brine domain region 3 contains only brine which continuously drains away and decreases in pressure so this region is named the region of drainage in existing work to solve the governing equation describing the movement of complex fluids in the reservoir by analytical methods or semi analytical methods the usual approach is to assume the saturation of each fluid phase in the flow field select the relative permeability model and finally solve the model there is no problem for the gas source region and the region of drainage however with regard to the region of displacement the approach of assuming an average saturation based on the different fluid domains must be discussed further the most important disadvantage is its indeterminacy it is difficult to find the appropriate average saturation wu et al 2016 presented a method for performing sensitivity analysis using various parameter combinations to determine the saturation of each fluid phase of different fluid domains in the region of displacement however it is random and difficult to apply actually according to the mathematical model in section 3 the parameter necessary for solving the governing equation above is the relative permeability of each fluid phase not their saturation therefore it may be better to directly assume the relative permeability of each fluid phase in the flow field in the gas source region the residual brine will evaporate into the co2 it is then brought into the region of displacement by the co2 and forms the wet co2 in the region of displacement given that only co2 exists in the gas source region the relative permeability of co2 and brine are 1 and 0 respectively in the region of drainage the flow is made up solely of brine and the relative permeability of co2 and the brine are 0 and 1 respectively these values are consistent with the method of assuming saturation for the region of displacement it is necessary to assume the relative permeability of each fluid phase based on the different fluid domains taking the region of displacement as the unit of the control body we have k r w r c 0 and k r c r c 1 at the left side i e only co2 is flowing into the unit similarly on the right side k r w r max 1 and k r c r max 0 i e only brine flows out the unit from left to right the relative permeability of co2 changes gradually from 1 to 0 while the relative permeability of the brine changes from 0 to 1 therefore according to the theory of gradual change the average of the relative permeability of each fluid phase at the two sides of the unit can be considered to be the average relative permeability of the unit 21 k r c 2 k r c r c k r c r max 2 0 5 k r w 2 k r w r c k r w r max 2 0 5 where k r α x is the averaged relative permeability of a fluid at the location region of x the second subscript x 1 2 3 2c 2w r c and r max which denote the gas source region the region of displacement the region of drainage the co2 domain in the region of displacement the brine domain in the region of displacement and the location of r c and r max respectively similarly the parameters k rα x s α x ρα x and so on are all like this as the enriched fluid phase is the main flow in the different fluid domains the contribution of the other fluid to the effective permeability is negligible kong 2010 hence the averaged relative permeability of co2 in the co2 domain is equal to the averaged relative permeability of co2 in the region of displacement i e k r c 2 c k r c 2 similarly k r w 2 w k r w 2 thus the average saturation of each fluid phase in the co2 domain and the brine domain can be obtained on the basis of the relative permeability model if we bring the average saturation into the relative permeability model again the relative permeability of the non enriched fluid phase can be obtained so the reliability of ignoring it can be verified we take the corey model pruess et al 1999 as an example setting the residual saturation of co2 and brine to 0 05 and 0 4 respectively according to k r c 2 c 0 5 and k r w 2 w 0 5 we obtained s w 2 c 0 5465 and s w 2 w 0 8625 and then we have k r w 2 c 0 005 and k r c 2 w 0 007 the relative errors are 1 and 1 4 respectively so ignoring the relative permeability of non enriched fluid phase leads to acceptable reliability based on the above analysis to obtain the solution to the governing equation the method of integrating within different regions is available wu et al 2016 as the given outer boundary condition is located at the right side of the region of drainage so the order of integrating is opposite to the direction of flow i e it progresses in order from the region of drainage to the region of displacement and the gas source region moreover the results from the preceding region are taken as the given outer boundary conditions for the next region it is convenient to define the mass mobility of each fluid phase ωα l 2t as 22 ω α k r α ρ α μ α k r α υ α within the region of drainage r max r r 0 only brine flow occurs so the total mass mobility of region is equal to the mass mobility of brine or 23 ω 3 ω w 3 k r w 3 υ w 3 hence the integral form of the above governing equation in this region is 24 p p 0 d p c c 2 π k b r r 0 1 r ω w 3 d r integrating eq 24 we obtain 25 p p 0 c c 2 π k b ω w 3 ln r 0 r therefore the fluid pressure at r max is 26 p r max p 0 c c 2 π k b ω w 3 ln r 0 r max for the region of displacement r c r r max as shown in fig 2 the co2 domain and the brine domain both exist at any given location so the total mass mobility of the complex fluid is 27 ω 2 b b ω c 2 c ω w 2 c b b b ω c 2 w ω w 2 w as the relative permeability of the non enriched fluid phases is negligible compared with the enriched fluid phase within different fluid domains eq 27 can be simplified to 28 ω 2 b b ω c 2 c b b b ω w 2 w the interface between the co2 domain and the brine domain satisfies the following continuous function which was derived by nordbotten et al 2005a based on the principle of energy minimization and the calculus of variations expressing it in terms of mass mobility leads to 29 b b ω c 2 c ω w 2 w ω c 2 c ω w 2 w m c ϕ π b r 2 ρ c ω w 2 w where 30 m c 0 t c c d

region r well r r c is similar to the region of drainage only co2 flow occurs here and the mass mobility of this region is 37 ω 1 ω c 1 k r c 1 υ c r c p p r c c f υ ω c r c p p r c c f υ incorporating this relation into the governing equation the integral form of the governing equation in this region can be deduced that is 38 p p r c p p r c c f υ d p c c 2 π k b r r c 1 r ω c r c d r integrating eq 38 we have 39 p p r c 1 c c 1 c f υ 2 π k b ω c r c p r c ln r c r 1 1 c f υ therefore the fluid pressure located at the wall of wellbore is 40 p k p r c 1 c c 1 c f υ 2 π k b ω c r c p

r 0 note that eq 41 is similar to eq 20 of wu et al 2016 the essential difference is that only the partial miscibility of co2 and brine is included in the latter however the compressibility of fluid is also considered in the former except that to include the compressibility the new definition for the coefficient of compressibility and the assumption of relative permeability both are very significant and available for multi phase flow in porous media in addition the former belongs to the class of power function models while the latter is an exponential function model as to the three

storage coefficient of the porous medium t is the transmissivity of the porous medium l2t 1 α p β w are the traditional coefficient of compressibility of the pore and brine water ml 1t 2 respectively and u 0 is the zero of the well function which corresponds to the outer boundary 6 application and verification in this section analyses of two typical examples are implemented to verify the

the advanced analytical solution with the results of previous analytical solution wu et al 2016 to verify that it represents an improvement 3 application to two examples with differing reservoir characteristics to verify its universality example 1 represents a typical reservoir in the shenhua ccs demonstration project china whose depth and temperature are approximately 2 km and 60 c respectively it represents a reservoir with characteristics widely seen in china including a small thickness and low permeability liu et al 2013 xie et al 2015a xie et al 2015b the basic parameters used in the calculations are shown in table 3 example 2 is a standard example presented in the manual of tough2 eco2n the depth and temperature of the reservoir are approximately 1 2 km and 45 c respectively it is a quite typical reservoir and has characteristics that are seen all over the world including a considerable thickness and high permeability bachu 2003 pruess 2005 the basic parameters used in the calculations are shown in table 4 6 1 example 1 for example 1 in tough2 eco2n the cylindrical grids extend 50 km in the radial direction we selected the corey model to calculate the relative permeability and the residual saturation of brine and co2 are 0 4 and 0 05 respectively the capillary pressure is ignored and 10 000 days of continuous co2 injection are simulated the results calculated with this advanced analytical solution ana sol 2 in figures and the previous analytical solution ana sol 1 in figures and the simulated results from tough2 eco2n tough2 in figures are plotted in one figure figs 4 and 6 show a comparison of predicted fluid pressure profiles at three different locations as a function of injection time as well as a comparison of predicted fluid pressure profiles at three different moments as a function of radial distance respectively in addition the corresponding relative error profiles of the analytical solutions are shown in figs 5 and 7 it is clear from figs 4 and 6 that the fluid pressures predicted using the analytical solutions and the numerical solution have the same trend the curves rise as injection time increases while it decreases as radial distance increases this result verifies the reliability of this advanced analytical solution as shown in figs 5 and 7 the maximal relative error of the previous analytical solution exceeds 6 whereas it is only 4 for the advanced analytical solution and the relative error is mostly less than 3 this result suggests that the analytical solution that includes the compressibility is more accurate and closer to actual conditions so the advancement represented by this work is clear furthermore there are three turning points of pressure drop in the spatial distribution curves of pressure taking the results for 10 days as example the three turning points are located at 11 46 m 65 99 m and 1018 52 m respectively they are consistent with the three characteristic radiuses rc rmax and r 0 in the reservoir at that moment therefore it can be found from fig 6 that the rates of pressure decrease are constants in the gas source region and the region of drainage while the rate of pressure decrease rises gradually in the region of displacement in addition the ordering of the three rates is the region of displacement the region of drainage the gas source region the results also indicate that the resistance to flow in the region of displacement is the largest and it increases along the flow direction moreover the resistance to flow of the single co2 phase is small the main reasons are as follows 1 the surface tension at the interface between the co2 and the brine is sufficiently large 2 the viscosity of co2 is small moreover from the perspective of relative error the relative errors of the analytical solutions are greatest in the region of displacement compared with the other two regions this result indicates that the unsteady flow mainly occurs in the region of displacement whereas steady flow occurs in the gas source region and the region of drainage with increasing injection time the ratio of the region of displacement to the other two regions becomes increasingly small so the actual flow in the reservoir tends to gradually become quasi steady 6 2 example 2 for example 2 in tough2 eco2n the differences in the parameter values used compared with example 1 include two aspects 1 the cylindrical grids extend 100 km in the radial direction and 2 the residual saturation of the brine is 0 3 we use the same way to display the results which are shown in figs 8 11 the conclusions drawn from figs 8 11 are consistent with those obtained from figs 4 7 which demonstrated that the advanced analytical solution is applicable in both of the two kinds of typical reservoirs thus the universality of the advanced analytical solution is verified and it is applicable all over the world 7 conclusions to consider the compressibility of fluids especially for co2 this work derived a new governing equation of describing the movement of complex fluids in reservoirs that is based on the equation of continuity and including the compressibility of fluid and darcy s law generalized to multiphase flows an advanced analytical solution about the evolution of fluid pressure was then obtained by integrating within different regions analyses of two typical examples verified the reliability improved nature and universality of this new analytical solution and it can be used in engineering applications all over the world to solve the problems associated with the traditional coefficient of compressibility which cannot characterize the relationship between the physical properties of co2 and pressure this work provided a more rigorous definition for the coefficient of compressibility of fluid then derived the corresponding power function model pfm comparison with a standard data base shows that the pfm is more accurate and applicable than the traditional exponential function model verifying the reliability of the new definition regarding the problem of difficulties in determining the saturation of fluids a method of directly assuming the averaged relative permeability of each fluid phase in different fluid domains was proposed according to the theory of gradual change this method avoids the difficulties of determining the saturation of fluids and also eliminates the errors associated with the relative permeability models for risk assessment of reservoirs improving the simulation accuracy according to the characteristics of the movement and distribution of complex fluids in reservoirs this work divided the flow field into three regions ordered according to increasing radial distance these regions are the gas source region the region of displacement and the region of drainage moreover unsteady flow is always present in the region of displacement while steady flow occurs in the other two regions with increasing injection time the ratio of the region of displacement to the other two regions becomes increasingly small so that the actual flow in the reservoir tends to gradually become quasi steady the results of the sample calculations show that the surface tension at the interface between the co2 and the brine is sufficiently large that the assumption of neglecting the capillary pressure induces a certain amount of error it is worthwhile to investigate it in the future acknowledgment this work was sponsored by the program of international science and technology cooperation china grant no s2016g9005 
878,many forested mountain watersheds worldwide evolved with frequent fire which twentieth century fire suppression activities eliminated resulting in unnaturally dense forests with high water demand restoration of pre suppression forest composition and structure through a variety of management activities could improve forest resilience and water yields this study explores the potential for managed wildfire whereby naturally ignited fires are allowed to burn to alter the water balance interest in this type of managed wildfire is increasing yet its long term effects on water balance are uncertain we use soil moisture as a spatially distributed hydrologic indicator to assess the influence of vegetation fire history and landscape position on water availability in the illilouette creek basin in yosemite national park over 6000 manual surface soil moisture measurements were made over a period of three years and supplemented with continuous soil moisture measurements over the top 1m of soil in three sites random forest and linear mixed effects models showed a dominant effect of vegetation type and history of vegetation change on measured soil moisture contemporary and historical vegetation maps were used to upscale the soil moisture observations to the basin and infer soil moisture under fire suppressed conditions little change in basin averaged soil moisture was inferred due to managed wildfire but the results indicated that large localized increases in soil moisture had occurred which could have important impacts on local ecology or downstream flows keywords wildfire mixed conifer wetland shrub sierra nevada soil moisture 1 introduction the importance of forested montane watersheds for water supply in many regions worldwide has long raised the question of whether forest management could be used to enhance water yields baker 1986 hawthorne et al 2013 hibbert 1965 kattelmann et al 1983 lesch and scott 1997 troendle 1983 more recently the potential for such management actions to improve forest health and productivity in fire suppressed forests has raised the prospect of a win win scenario for ecology and water supply fire suppression has led to unnaturally dense forests in many parts of the world including california s sierra nevada collins et al 2011 mcintyre et al 2015 forest management that reduces tree density could increase growth rates of the remaining trees bréda et al 1995 ruprecht and stoneman 1993 reduce competition between trees for scarce resources grant et al 2013 and reduce the potential for catastrophic wildfire aust and blinn 2004 kauffman 2004 pollet and omi 2002 thus improving forest resilience in turn reduced water demand in thinned forests can result in higher water availability downstream and increasing non forested wetland area can increase a watershed s capacity for water storage dubé et al 1995 fletcher et al 2014 soil moisture is a hydrologic variable that integrates all of these processes as subsurface stores provide a source of water for both vegetation needs and streamflow generation and changing soil moisture reflects changes in local water balance the hydrologic impacts of forest management practices are highly uncertain scientific studies are limited and have mixed results for example observed flow increases following forest thinning range from as little as 1 to 70 kattelmann et al 1983 lesch and scott 1997 differences in outcome appear to depend on many factors including the specifics of the forest treatment local topography vegetation type and weather baker 1986 hawthorne et al 2013 problematically increases in water yield typically persist for only 5 years following forest treatments brown et al 2005 suggesting that frequent re treatment would be needed to sustain water supply benefits such high frequencies may impose important feasibility constraints on the implementation of labor intensive management efforts conventional forest management practices such as thinning clearing or prescribed fire may also be difficult to upscale to the point where they can have meaningful impacts on water resources thus identifying alternative and scalable forest management strategies would be attractive managed wildfire may offer such an approach under this management strategy naturally ignited fires are allowed to burn provided a fire management plan is identified and clear conditions for fire operations are in place e g to prevent air quality impacts or protect sensitive areas the fire return interval in many fire prone mountain watersheds is relatively short e g 7 15 years in the mid pine belt in the sierra nevada collins and stephens 2007 meaning that this approach can alter the understory and ground litter collins et al 2016 stephens et al 2009 reduce forest density and leaf area kane et al 2014 and replace land cover boisramé et al 2017a on timescales commensurate with those of hydrologic recovery from such disturbance managed wildfire policies have been implemented long term in only a few watersheds in these locations they are associated with large scale reductions in forest cover and density over multi decadal timescales boisramé et al 2017b kane et al 2014 these changes may have reduced the extent of severe fires collins and stephens 2007 lowered drought induced forest mortality relative to neighboring basins boisramé et al 2017a and increased the biodiversity of pollinating insects ponisio et al 2016 these positive outcomes support the potential for managed wildfire to mimic some of the landscape scale benefits of thinning or patch felling at large scales and at relatively frequent intervals without requiring mechanized harvest and the associated costs labor and soil disturbance to date however the hydrologic impacts of managed wildfire are poorly understood the basins with long term managed wildfire regimes lack long term stream gauges and baseline i e pre treatment hydrologic measurements the study watershed considered here the illilouette creek basin icb is gauged after its confluence with the larger upper merced river while there may be a small signal of enhanced streamflow production at this gauge following the institution of the managed wildfire regime in the icb in 1972 boisramé et al 2017a analysis of flow trends offers little insight into the effects of the fire regime on basin hydrology both due to uncertainty caused by high interannual variability in flows and the basin aggregated nature of streamflow soil moisture provides a useful metric for observing sub watershed scale hydrology representing the local balance between precipitation deep drainage evapotranspiration and discharge soil moisture dynamics in a burned watershed are altered by a complex suite of hydrologically relevant processes initiated by wildfire brown et al 2005 for instance burning can have counteractive effects on the amount and timing of snowmelt inputs to groundwater stores blackened trees provide a source of long wave radiation and canopy losses reduce shading speeding melting and sublimation rates neary et al 2005 tague and dugger 2010 but canopy losses also reduce interception and can reduce long wave radiation enhancing snowpack accumulation and delaying snowmelt compared to dense forest ellis et al 2013 lundquist et al 2013 similarly although loss of mature trees can reduce transpiration bréda et al 1995 he et al 2013 ma et al 2010 rambo and north 2009 zhang et al 2001 loss of shading can increase soil evaporation biederman et al 2014 while regrowth of understory vegetation or young life stages can increase water demand reducing soil moisture levels lane et al 2010 neary et al 2005 tague and dugger 2010 vertessy et al 1995 2001 most literature regarding fire effects on watershed hydrologic balance focuses on large individual fires helvey 1980 langford 1976 e g or individual clearing thinning treatments brown et al 2005 rather than the long term effects of cumulative vegetation change thus the net hydrologic impact of managed wildfire over many decades and at basin scales remains uncertain the illilouette creek basin is one of two basins in california four in the western united states where a managed wildfire regime has been in place for multiple decades it holds wilderness status meaning that soil and surface hydrology are relatively undisturbed by humans although no direct observations of change in the basin hydrology during the institution of the managed wildfire regime are available there are no data for soil moisture streamflow or weather within the icb dating from its fire suppressed state fire effects on vegetation cover in the icb have been reconstructed from air photo records boisramé et al 2017b these reconstructions show that between 1970 when the basin was still fire suppressed and 2012 the watershed lost 24 of its conifer cover while dense meadow area increased by 155 shrub area by 35 and sparse meadow area by 199 boisramé et al 2017b the type of vegetation growing at a location is frequently correlated with local hydrological conditions e g araya et al 2011 milledge et al 2013 mountford and chapman 1993 for example lodgepole pine pinus contorta pico a common species in icb establishes in intermediately wet areas of meadows helms and ratliff 1987 while whitethorn ceanothus ceanothus cordulatus grows in exposed dry sites fites kaufman et al 2007 within the icb kane et al 2015 found relationships between water balance and forest structure suggesting that vegetation observations can be related to water availability and the history of vegetation change in the basin could therefore provide a proxy history of hydrologic changes in this study we use soil moisture to represent these hydrologic changes since it integrates shallow hydrologic fluxes and therefore is a useful spatially explicit indicator of water budget partitioning reconstructing hydrologic change as represented by changing soil moisture using vegetation is undoubtedly an approximate method but it overcomes major limitations of other approaches such as remote sensing of soil moisture related indices musick and pelletier 1988 which are precluded in areas with dense vegetation cover crist and cicone 1984 and thus cannot be used to examine the effects of transitions from forested to unforested sites this study aims to identify the effect of the changing fire regime on water availability in the icb by measuring surface soil moisture establishing its dependence on vegetation fire history and topography and using these relationships to extrapolate soil moisture observations to the basin scale under contemporary and historic vegetation distributions differences in these basin scale soil moisture surfaces would then provide an estimate of the change in soil moisture following the change in fire management in order to justify this modeling approach we first answer the following questions is surface soil moisture a useful indicator of ecologically relevant water storage as might be influenced by or might influence local vegetation is vegetation a useful indicator of surface soil moisture values under a given vegetation type can topography and fire history explain spatial variations in soil moisture ideally we would estimate total soil water storage using continuous moisture measurements over the depth of the soil profile at many locations this would give the most complete measure of the balance between precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff however wilderness regulations u s congress 1964 limited such observations which require disturbance of the soil profile and installation of temporary instrumentation to three sites in the icb therefore we relied primarily on spatially extensive but shallow top 12 cm soil moisture measurements 6000 in 90 sites made twice annually over three consecutive growing seasons 2014 through 2016 although surface soil moisture cannot be directly extrapolated to subsurface water storage it is often closely related to water table depth sörensen et al 2006 and plant available water gonzalez zamora et al 2016 all observations were made during drought years of varying characteristics and severity from extreme drought in 2014 2015 to near normal winter precipitation in 2015 2016 and therefore do not necessarily apply to wet years the observations were made at least nine years after the most recent large fire in the icb and do not capture short term post fire soil moisture responses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the illilouette creek basin icb is a 150 km2 basin within the upper merced watershed in yosemite national park california usa fig 1 spanning an 1800 m to 3000 m elevation range in the central sierra nevada this area experiences a mediterranean type climate with average january daily minimum temperatures ranging from 5 c to 1 c and average july daily maximum temperatures of 25 c 2000 2015 http www wrcc dri edu stations white wolf crane flat average annual precipitation oct sep ranged from 47 to 60 cm 2000 2015 dominated by winter snow the basin is covered by coniferous forests dominated by jeffrey pine pinus jeffreyi red fir abies magnifica white fir abies concolor and p contorta granite outcrops meadows and shrublands dominated by whitethorn ceanothus c cordulatus collins et al 2007 the area never experienced timber harvesting and likely had minimal impacts from livestock grazing collins and stephens 2007 fire suppression began in the icb in the late 19th century at a time when fire suppression was becoming common practice in many u s forests collins and stephens 2007 and the total area burned between 1880 and 1973 was only 0 08 km2 in 1972 the icb transitioned to a managed wildfire policy van wagtendonk 2007 resulting in a new fire regime with very similar fire frequency and extent to those inferred by tree ring analysis from the pre suppression period contemporary mean fire return intervals are 6 8 years compared to a 6 3 year mean from 1700 to 1900 collins and stephens 2007 during the managed wildfire period 30 fires exceeding 40 ha extent burned in the icb forming a mosaic of vegetation change where high severity burn patches intermix with intact forests collins and stephens 2010 fig 2 and leading to a large range in time since last fire and vegetation condition across the basin seventy five percent of the vegetated area and 52 of the total basin area have burned since 1972 2 2 field measurements surface soil moisture was mapped in the icb in the summers of 2014 2016 a total of 6220 measurements were made in 90 sites covering representative combinations of burn severity time since fire slope aspect elevation and vegetation cover fig 1 table a 1 thirty seven sites were selected to overlap with established research plots collins et al 2016 fifty three new sites were selected to represent combinations of slope aspect burn severity and vegetation cover omitted in the previous plots locations for most of these new sites were selected by identifying desired combinations of traits in arcgis http www arcgis com constraining locations to those accessible by foot and sampling randomly within the identified areas twelve of the new locations were chosen opportunistically once in the field the volumetric water content vwc of soils was measured by inserting a 12 cm time domain reflectomer tdr hydrosense ii probe vertically into the surface soils having first removed leaf litter or duff given the high degree of homogeneity amongst the granitic loamy sands in the icb a mineral soil calibration which typically has a 3 accuracy campbell scientific 2015 was used for all sites in common with other large scale surface soil moisture studies e g famiglietti et al 2008 the tdr measurements for all sites gave reasonable values compared to qualitative estimates of soil moisture based on feel and appearance of the soil some organic wetland soils are present in the basin although the tdr was not recalibrated for these soils maximum errors in vwc associated with tdr measurements in organic soils are reported as 0 05 roth et al 1992 much smaller than typical differences in moisture between wetland and mineral soil sites consistency of measurements between handheld instruments was verified throughout the 3 field seasons handheld instruments were also verified against the continuously measuring tdrs from three vertical arrays see below soil moisture was measured at each site one to six times during early and late summer when possible early summer measurements were made between may 21 and june 17 and late summer measurements between july 17 and august 9 fifty five sites were measured at least twice e g early and late summer measurements in one year 27 sites were measured at least four times and seven sites were measured six times both early and late summer measurements in all three years sites with highly variable soil moisture through time were high priorities for multiple measurements conversely only a subset of sites exhibiting very dry early summer soil moisture e g vwc 0 05 were re measured in late summer under the rationale that moisture conditions would remain similar across the dry summer months we avoided taking measurements during or immediately following heavy rainfall though a small number of measurements did occur within one day of precipitation both our continuously measuring soil moisture sensors see below and a subset of manual measurements taken before and after rainfall verified that individual summer storms affected surface soil moisture by a negligible amount compared to seasonal changes in most sites 30 evenly spaced soil moisture measurements 25 for repeat measures in homogeneous sites were made within a 30m by 30m grid additional measurements were made in heterogeneous sites one meter spaced measurements were made across a 30 m transect in sites with obvious strong gradients in soil moisture e g wetland sites bordered by dry uplands the standard error of the per site mean vwc over 25 30 measurements averaged 0 01 max of 0 07 standard errors were 10 of the mean in 56 of sites and 20 of the mean in 90 of sites at each site dominant vegetation cover to species level when possible slope aspect and the presence of burned snags or fire scarred trees were recorded sites were georeferenced using handheld garmin gpsmap 62st and 64st devices horizontal accuracy 3 10 m latitude and longitude were assigned to each measurement point based on location within the grid or transect locations were verified in arcmap 2 3 relating surface and root zone soil moisture under dry climatic conditions shallow soil moisture can become decoupled from water availability across the soil column grayson et al 1997 he et al 2013 which could confound both associations with vegetation and interpretation of shallow soil moisture patterns in terms of basin hydrology to establish relationships between shallow soil moisture and whole column water availability tdr measurements were compared to two independent metrics of subsurface water content i pre dawn leaf water potentials and ii three continuously reporting vertical soil moisture tdr arrays spanning the top 1m of soil 2 3 1 pre dawn leaf water potential measurements pre dawn measurements of leaf water potential provide a proxy for root zone water availability under the assumption that non transpiring plants reached hydraulic equilibrium with soil water potential overnight bréda et al 1995 dawson et al 2007 leaf water potential was measured with a pms 1505d pressure chamber http www pmsinstrument com following the methods of dawson and ehleringer 1993 pre dawn leaf water potential was measured in whitethorn ceanothus willow multiple unidentified salix species lodgepole pine jeffrey pine and aspen populus tremuloides at five sites co located with tdr measurements at least three individuals were measured per species per site and each site was measured in early and late summer these water potentials were then compared to surface soil moisture measurements 2 3 2 vertical tdr arrays weather stations including tdrs installed horizontally at 12 cm 60 cm and 1m beneath the soil surface 12 cm cs655 campbell scientific soil water content reflectometers tdrs http www campbellsci com were installed in july 2015 in loamy sand soils beneath different canopy types closed canopy post fire shrub and post fire wetland occurring within 200 m of each other see appendix c for details tdrs were installed horizontally into undisturbed soil and the access holes backfilled and compacted exact tdr depths vary slightly at each location due to reaching rock or the water table before 1 m but the soil was 90 cm deep at all three locations the tdrs record soil moisture every 10 minutes and enable continuous comparison of surface soil moisture to depth integrated water storage 2 4 spatial data topography vegetation cover and fire history were mapped for the icb using arcgis http www arcgis com site characteristics were extracted from these maps topographic covariates slope aspect elevation distance to nearest stream and upslope area were derived from a lidar elevation map of the icb coarsened to 10 m2 resolution from the original 1 m2 map kane et al 2015 several specific topographic indices were computed the aspect index was used to control for the influence of slope orientation on incident solar radiation rather than describing orientation according to compass direction the aspect index transforms orientation to a 0 1 scale south facing slopes 1 and north facing 0 as 0 5 1 c o s a s p e c t 30 kane et al 2015 the topographic wetness index twi accounts for how topography may predisopose a site to saturation via shallow subsurface flow twi is computed as l n a t a n s where a is the upslope contributing area and s the local slope the higher the twi the greater the topographic potential for saturation beven 1983 the topographic position index describes whether a site is in a valley tpi 0 a ridge tpi 0 or on a near planar slope tpi 0 it is computed as t p i i n t e l e v f o c a l m e a n e l e v a n n u l u s 150 300 5 where elev is the point s elevation in meters focalmean is a function which takes the mean elevation over a ring surrounding the point with inner diameter of 150m and outer diameter of 300 m and int refers to rounding the results to the nearest integer value weiss 2001 the ranges for all topographic and fire history values are given in table a 1 dominant vegetation cover in 1969 1970 at the end of the fire suppressed period and in 2012 following 40 years of managed wildfire was mapped from aerial imagery boisramé et al 2017b vegetation was classified as sparse meadow dense meadow shrub aspen and conifer dense meadows include wetlands and areas of dense herbaceous cover which cannot be reliably separated using imagery sparse meadows include sparse shrub and or herbaceous cover and are dominated by bare ground exposed bedrock and talus fields were excluded from our analyses these vegetation classifications were used for contemporary analysis upscaling and extrapolation to historical maps separately the observed dominance of lodgepole pine pico at a measurement site was considered an additional classifier for the contemporary analysis while pico could not reliably be identified separately from other conifer forest in aerial images it is often associated with wet conditions relative to other conifers and could thus be a useful indicator of hydrologic condition in the contemporary watershed time since fire and times burned since 1930 were computed from a digital fire atlas containing all recorded fire perimeters within yosemite national park available from irma nps gov portal if no fires occurred time since fire was set to 100 years fire severity was calculated using a relative version of the differenced normalized burn ratio rdnbr derived from landsat thematic mapper images boisramé et al 2017a collins et al 2009 thresholds for rdnbr fire severity classes unchanged low moderate and high were taken from miller and thode 2007 spatial covariates were extracted from the spatial datasets for each subsite using arcmap and compared to field notes to verify accuracy they were used in initial exploratory comparisons of soil moisture variability as well as co variates in the statistical models 2 5 other data weather data are incompletely observed across the icb and throughout the sierra nevada generally thus variability in weather conditions and potentially other unobserved time varying drivers of vwc variability was accounted for by using the year of measurement as a covariate in the statistical models of surface soil moisture described below for example 2015 had three times more summer precipitation than the other two years 120 mm in may september yosemite southern entrance station http www ncdc noaa gov while 2016 had the most winter precipitation 890 mm in the winter of 2015 2016 compared to 400 mm the previous two winters we were unable to improve model results by incorporating observations from nearby weather stations directly prior to analysis all covariates were tested to detect collinearity no correlation between covariates exceeded r 0 7 a common cutoff used to indicate unacceptable levels of collinearity dormann et al 2013 shmueli 2010 test models were run incorporating latitude and longitude as spatial predictors but these covariates showed both high collinearity with other covariates and low significance and were dropped from the final models for more details see appendix d 2 6 analysis of soil moisture variability soil moisture was related to site characteristics with statistical models trained on measured surface soil moisture all models were fit using r software http www r project org prior to model fitting data were manipulated to create a dataset in which predictor and explanatory variables were resolved at similar spatial scales and potential biases due to higher sampling frequency of certain sites were addressed as described below first because the spatial predictor data are available at scales of 10 m 30 m vwc measurements in each site were aggregated to the mean value under each dominant vegetation type within the site this coarsening reduces the influence of fine scale variations in for example microtopography which are not captured by the covariates the vegetation patch averaged data within individual sites are referred to as subsites the subsite data formed the basis for all modeling secondly the prioritization of highly time varying sites when sampling as described in section 2 2 meant that saturated sites in early summer and dry sites in late summer were under represented in the data set we used a gap filling algorithm to correct for this sampling bias towards variable sites gap filling used early late season measurements from a different year at the same site if available and with a scaled early or late season measurement if not scaling factors were based on the observed mean seasonal variations from sites with both early and late summer data 0 35 for early to late season scaling in dry sites or 1 4 for late to early season scaling of wet sites this method allowed us to fill in missing data in 59 of the 90 sites adding 91 data points to the original set of 347 subsite aggregated measurements thirty one gap filled points used data from the same time of year but a different year while 17 were in locations with no early summer measurements and 43 in locations with no late summer measurements we explored the effects of this gap filling on model results and verified that results were minimally sensitive to this approach in terms of both modeled vwc values prediction and the relationships between modeled vwc and covariates explanation although this analysis showed that missing data do not appear to be causing a significant bias in the results the gap filled dataset has been used throughout the modeling process to ensure that the data are balanced and complete 2 7 statistical models used two different statistical models were used to relate vwc to topographic vegetation and fire history predictors i a random forest model and ii a generalized linear mixed effects model both models predict continuously valued vwc using current vegetation type vegetation type in 1970 upslope area slope aspect index elevation topographic position index tpi topographic wetness index twi distance from nearest stream year of measurement 2014 2015 or 2016 day of year the measurement was taken e g 152 for june 1 years since last fire times burned since 1970 and maximum fire severity unchanged low moderate or high as covariates the current and 1970 vegetation types use the following categories sparse meadow dense meadow shrub aspen and conifer using two statistical approaches allowed us to capitalize on the relative advantages of each primarily the ability of a random forest model to address nonlinearity in relationships between covariates and outcomes and the relative ease of interpreting a linear regression model the comparison between the two modeling approaches also provides a check on the consistency of interpretations made from the data 2 7 1 random forest model random forest models predict a continuous variable by creating a large number of regression trees each based on a random subset of all possible covariates the predicted values from all of the trees is then averaged breiman 2001 each regression tree divides the data into smaller and smaller groups or nodes until a stopping criterion is reached the data in each parent node is divided into two child nodes based on one of the predictors and the division that maximizes the separation in values between the two child nodes is selected at each step the value of a new point in covariate space is computed by following the path from the first node to the appropriate terminal node the random forest method can describe non linear responses between variables and predictors and avoids over fitting that can result from using only one regression tree grömping 2009 kane et al 2015 prasad et al 2006 we used the randomforest package in r liaw and wiener 2002 to fit a random forest model and set the minimum node size to 5 and the number of trees to 500 the number that minimized the rmse of the model the impact of different covariates on modeled vwc was quantified using the importance and partial dependence the importance of a covariate in a random forest model is calculated using the change in model error when a covariate is included or excluded as a covariate when training the model liaw and wiener 2002 the partial dependence describes the response of a dependent variable to individual covariates while controlling for the effects of other covariates for example partial dependence could describe the influence of elevation on modelled vwc independently of variation in other covariates to assess the partial dependence vwc would be computed for all possible values of the other covariates vegetation cover slope aspect time since fire etc holding elevation constant the resulting vwc values would be averaged this procedure is repeated for different constant values of elevation to visualize the mean vwc response to changing elevation appendix d 2 7 2 linear mixed effects model the vwc data were also fit with a generalized linear mixed effects model referred to subsequently as linear model clark 2007 this statistical modelling method is widely used and can account for spatial autocorrelation between sub sites spatial autocorrelation is often exhibited by large scale moisture patterns western et al 1998 the linear model was trained on the same data as the random forest model using the lme function in r and assuming a spherical spatial correlation structure pinheiro et al 2015 vegetation cover was treated as a random effect as in chen et al 2012 omuto et al 2010 allowing each vegetation type to have a separate intercept we separated vegetation type by current and 1970 cover all other covariates were treated as fixed effects and were normalized to have values between 0 and 1 so that the magnitudes of model coefficients are comparable for the categorical covariates of measurement year fire severity and times burned we coded dummy variables set to 0 or 1 for each data point by category ucla statistical consulting group 2017 for example two dummy variables were created for year the first was set to 1 if the measurement year was 2014 and 0 otherwise the second variable was set to 1 if the measurement year was 2015 and 0 otherwise year 2016 was left as the intercept the coefficients on these variables represent the relative change in vwc in 2014 or 2015 compared to 2016 the final model takes the form v w c v e g x c 0 v e g i 1 n c i x i where vwc is the predicted water content veg is the vegetation transition from 1970 to 2012 c 0 is an intercept unique to each vegetation category x is a vector of n covariates and ci are model coefficients 2 7 3 model performance model performance was evaluated using a cross validation procedure in which all data measured within a random subset of x of all sites were selected as training data and used to predict vwc in the remaining 100 x of sites x varied from 70 90 of the data and 100 iterations of the cross validation were performed for each value of x this cross validation was designed to avoid spurious outcomes due to potential autocorrelation within sites i e across subsites model performance was evaluated using root mean squared error rmse and correlation coefficients the mean and range of model performance across all 100 iterations provides an indication of the model skill in extrapolating beyond the observation points 2 7 4 simulations of soil moisture response to landscape change once the statistical models were trained to field measurements of vwc the models were used to upscale soil moisture measurements to the whole icb on a 10 m resolution grid based on the maps of topographic covariates fire history and vegetation these watershed scale estimates were made using both contemporary and historical vegetation coverage and fire histories providing insight into potential changes in soil moisture induced by the managed wildfire policy to run the model to represent 1970 conditions the year covariate was set to either 2014 2015 or 2016 effectively modeling vwc subject to the land cover and fire history from 1970 modulated by 2014 2016 climatic conditions 3 results 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 relating surface and root zone soil moisture both pre dawn leaf water potentials and comparisons between near surface and deeper subsurface soil moisture support the existence of a relationship between surface soil moisture and overall water availability at a measured site although this relationship is not perfect predawn leaf water potentials were correlated with shallow soil moisture with a correlation coefficient of 0 69 fig 3 a the greatest sensitivity of leaf water potential to vwc was observed for vwc below 0 08 a logarithmic function provided a good fit r 2 0 61 to the observed relationship between leaf water potential and soil moisture at the weather stations the correlation coefficient between daily vwc at 12 cm and at 60 cm during the summer months of may august was 0 98 for the closed canopy and shrub sites and 0 79 for the wet meadow site and correlation between 12 cm and 90 cm 1 m soil moisture was 0 95 for closed canopy 0 94 for shrub and 0 77 for wet meadow see fig c 1 for plots of soil moisture at all three depths combining data from all 3 stations shallow soil moisture was strongly correlated to 60 cm soil moisture ρ 0 96 in the months of may august and well correlated to deep soil moisture ρ 0 91 fig 3 b and c while surface soil moisture is not a one to one indicator of soil column water availability in the icb spatial variations in surface soil moisture appear to indicate spatial variation in water availability to plants and across the soil profile during the growing season 3 1 2 observed relationships between vwc and vegetation type summer surface soil moisture content varied strongly across vegetation types both in terms of mean or median vwc per vegetation type and in terms of the variability associated with each vegetation class to represent this within class variability data are presented as violin plots fig 4 these plots show the distributions of data in different categories of pre fire and contemporary vegetation persistent wetlands areas that were mapped as dense meadow from the 1969 1970 aerial photographs and continued to be identified as such in all subsequent mappings using more recent aerial photos had the highest moisture content of all sites conifer forests that burned and regenerated as dense meadows by 2012 were the next wettest vegetation category despite the drought conditions during the study saturated soil was present in some of the dense meadows and persistent wetlands through to the late summer in every year soil moisture measurements were bimodal for burned dense meadows all times and persistent wetlands late summer only with most measurements either very wet or very dry potentially due to small variations in elevation above a shallow water table in a mean sense dense meadows were distinct from and much wetter than other vegetation categories with mean vwc of 0 38 in may and 0 28 in august at the beginning of the summer persistent conifer sites had the next highest mean vwc 0 11 across all conifer species but dried rapidly and were comparable with other non wetland vegetation types by august 0 06 vwc there was a large range of variability within the conifer sites relative to other vegetation types conifer sites dominated by pico had significantly higher mean vwc throughout the summer than other non meadow vegetation 2 7 times higher under pico p 0001 according to one sided t test as discussed in section 2 4 pico sites were grouped with other conifers in the statistical model we verified that this grouping did not result in changes in predicted vwc of more than 0 03 compared to statistical models representing pico separately shrublands and sparse meadows had comparable mean soil moisture values at the end of may 0 10 and 0 09 respectively but the sparse meadows dried more rapidly dropping to 0 04 mean vwc by june data not shown compared to 0 07 for shrubs statistically different according to one sided t test p 001 the difference between june vwc values under these vegetation types is slightly lower and less significant when data is mean aggregated by site rather than using each individual measurement mean vwc 0 05 for sparse meadow and 0 07 for shrubs p 07 in june only 20 of vwc measurements in shrub sites fell below 0 03 whereas such low values were more common in sparse meadow or conifer sites 40 for both by august however all vegetation types except for dense meadow and pico had similar distributions of moisture 3 2 modeling results 3 2 1 model performance cross validation results indicated that the random forest model provided an excellent fit to training data mean pearson s correlation coefficient ρ 0 98 and a robust but weaker fit to test data mean ρ 0 81 random forest model fits to all 2014 2016 soil moisture observations are shown in fig 5 the linear mixed effects model did not fit the training data as well ρ 0 87 and achieved comparable performance to the random forest model when predicting test data ρ 0 79 the results shown in table 1 are representative of the full suite of cross validation exercises and show summary results for an 80 20 split between training and test data they suggest that the random forest model may be overfitting the training data shmueli 2010 given the similarity in model performance and to avoid duplication model results presented here primarily use the random forest model output which captures nonlinear relationships and avoids some unrealistic vwc predictions e g vwc 0 6 or vwc 0 made by the linear model we refer to the linear model results to assist in interpretation of soil moisture sensitivity to covariates and for checks on consistency between the models numerous consistency checks verified that details of the training data organization e g splitting versus lumping pico with other coniferous forests including or avoiding gapfilling to avoid early late season bias in dry wet sites did not significantly impact model predictions structure or performance for example there was a correlation of 0 99 between vwc values from a model trained on observed data only and values from a model trained on gap filled data the mean difference in vwc between these two versions of the random forest model was 0 01 with a maximum difference of 0 06 at any subsite primarily bias correction resulted in lower predictions of late summer soil moisture values relative to the raw data which we expect to be reasonable 3 2 2 sensitivity of vwc to landscape parameters and fire history as shown in fig 4 significant differences in soil moisture attributes arose between vegetation classes table 2 shows correlations between vwc and other landscape characteristics and suggests that there were not overriding individual correlations between vwc and topography fire history or time metrics upon controlling for covariates via statistical models however clear distinctions in the relative importance of the covariates influence on vwc emerged the random forest importance metric shows that contemporary vegetation was the most important predictor of soil water content and pre fire vegetation was also in the top three most important fig 6 and table 3 twi was one of the most important predictors of vwc in the random forest model and had moderate predictive power in the linear model slope had a strong influence on soil moisture in both models see table 3 fig 6 table 4 and fig d 2 both models agreed that years since fire and times burned did not have an important impact on vwc compared to other covariates the partial dependence metrics for the random forest model show that soil moisture is more likely to be high at sites with low slopes low topographic position index and near rivers or creeks that is in valley bottoms fig 7 b d and f soil moisture increased slightly with elevation and with aspect index fig 7 a and c topographic wetness index fig 7 e slope fig 7 b and upslope area produced threshold like responses in vwc locations that were unburned or burned at low severity were more likely to have high vwc fig 7 g i although this relationship varied with vegetation type for example soil under conifer stands that regrew following high severity fire had the highest mean vwc of all conifer stands data not shown the sign of the linear model coefficients for each covariate matched the sign of the slope of linear fits to the random forest partial dependencies with the exception of times burned which had low significance in the linear model tables 4 and 3 fig 7 in the linear model day of year had a greater coefficient than year 11 vs 3 confirming that within year variability is more important than interannual variability again in agreement with the random forest results topographic covariates generally had more influence on vwc than fire history according to the linear model in terms of coefficient magnitudes as well as statistical significance 3 3 time dependence of soil moisture the relationships in vwc between sites were consistent over all years but some variation in individual sites did occur from year to year and different years varied slightly in the mean for most sites 2014 which followed one of the lowest winter snowfalls on record across the sierra nevada had the lowest soil moisture this year to year variability had low importance in the random forest model relative to the vegetation and topographic differences fig 6 and table 3 there were notable small differences however mean vwc was 0 01 higher in 2016 the wettest year compared to 2014 the driest summer on average independent of all other covariates fig 8 a this difference in means was statistically significant p 1 e 10 according to a t test performed on 100 cross validation runs 3 3 1 summer moisture loss under different vegetation types in contrast to the small year to year variability within year variation was relatively large fig d 1 the rates of summer dry down could be estimated at 24 sites where soil moisture measurements were available at three dates usually may june and late july or early august by fitting a linear equation to the three data points this linear fit gave a mean net loss of approximately 0 1 0 2 mm day over the summer for all vegetation types except for permanently flooded meadows which did not dry this results in a mean vwc drop of approximately 0 09 0 12 across the summer the data were also normalized by dividing by the mean vwc at each site in order to give the slope of the linear fit the drying rate as a percent per day using this normalizing method forested hillslopes and sparse meadows dried at 2 day shrublands and riparian areas at 1 day and permanent wetlands did not dry out although these average values are useful for approximating seasonal water loss from shallow soils the random forest model suggested that sharp decreases in soil moisture occurred at the end of may corresponding to the end of snowmelt and in late june corresponding to peak temperatures rather than drying proceeding uniformly throughout the summer fig 8 b similarly nonlinear drying trends were observed at the weather station tdr profiles fig c 1 3 3 2 model simulations of soil moisture response to landscape change fig 9 a and c shows the results of upscaling the random forest model to the whole icb as shown the resulting soil moisture predictions appear reasonable no unrealistically high vwc values were predicted fig 9 c and the spatial patterns appear realistically correlated and do not display isolated erratic high or low values including in areas of the watershed where no observations were made fig 9 b and d shows an example of modeled difference in vwc between current conditions and fire suppressed conditions specifically this difference is calculated by modeling vwc with contemporary vegetation and fire history and then subtracting modeled vwc using 1970 conditions both the contemporary and 1970 models set the date to mid august and set the year covariate to 2014 effectively using 2014 climate a positive value in fig 9 b indicates that soil moisture is higher under 2014 conditions relative to 1970 at the basin scale minimal differences in spatially averaged surface soil moisture are predicted between the fire suppressed and contemporary conditions changes in mean basin scale vwc 0 02 for any model version dramatic changes however were predicted in the wetness of individual sites under all tested versions of the statistical models burned forest sites that regenerated with dense meadows potentially wetland vegetation increased in predicted summer vwc by as much as 0 31 figs 10 and 9 d variability in the vwc changes at these sites were associated with differences in tpi larger increases in valley bottoms and fire history larger increases following low severity fire relative to high severity fire see fig 11 these large local increases in soil moisture however were offset by widespread minor decreases in soil moisture with the greatest decreases down to 0 24 modeled in locations where conifers encroached on meadows using 2015 or 2016 as the contemporary year instead of 2014 resulted in only small differences in the map and magnitude of change the small magnitude of basin scale change can be attributed to the relatively small changes in vwc estimated for the most common vegetation transitions for example from 1970 to present 55 of the icb s vegetated area was either permanently forested or burned and regrew as conifer forest table 5 burning these areas did not result in large predicted changes in vwc at most these sites increased in vwc by 0 02 or decreased by 0 05 table 5 the largest changes in vwc were associated with vegetation transitions that impacted less than 2 of the basin area table 5 fig 9 d 4 discussion this study set out to determine how the changing fire regime in the icb may have impacted its hydrology by addressing a suite of related questions about soil moisture i was it a useful indicator of ecologically relevant water availability ii was vegetation a valuable proxy for soil moisture spatial variability and iii how did topography and fire history influence soil moisture the combination of field measurements and statistical modeling at icb provides insights into all these topics the study period of 2014 2016 coincided with a period of extended and severe drought in california characterized by both low precipitation and high temperatures dettinger and anderson 2015 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 although the summer of 2016 followed a winter of near average precipitation the sierra nevada was still considered to be in extreme to exceptional drought http www droughtmonitor unl edu our results might be different if we were using measurements from a non drought summer understanding hydrologic dynamics during drought conditions however is disproportionately important since small changes in water availability can have a very large impact during times of water limitation 4 1 is surface soil moisture a useful indicator of ecologically relevant water availability both leaf water potential and continuous soil moisture measurements suggest that surface soil moisture provides a proxy for plant available water or soil profile water storage in the icb fig 3 the relationship between shallow soil moisture and leaf water potentials in plants was variable presumably due to variations in plant morphology subsurface heterogeneity and potentially variable rates of night time transpiration which inhibit equilibration between leaf and root zone water potentials dawson et al 2007 sellin 1999 despite very dry soil conditions measured at some sites plant water potentials remained relatively high this may be related to the availability of non soil water reservoirs for instance conifers in the sierra nevada may obtain as much as a third of their water from fractured rock beneath the developed soil bales et al 2011 royce and barbour 2001 nonetheless our small number of measurements from large deep rooted conifers had the lowest measured leaf water potential in areas with the driest measured surface soil moisture figs 3 a and b 1 strong correlations between surface and deep continuous soil moisture measurements support the value of shallow soil moisture as a proxy for site water availability fig 3 b and c though these correlations vary with time depth and vegetation cover type despite the close relationship between shallow and deeper soil moisture the relationship was non stationary over the summer and the non stationarity varied with vegetation conditions soils at the instrumented wetland site which had been forested prior to 2004 remained saturated at depth all summer while in the forested site summer soil moisture was fairly constant with depth and in the shrubland deeper soils contained twice as much water as shallow soil in the early summer of 2016 fig c 1 these data raise the intriguing prospect that vegetation conversions from forest to shrubland or meadows could increase deep soil moisture stores significantly despite only minor changes being observed in surface soil moisture a prospect consistent with the shallower rooting depth of shrubs grasses relative to mature trees using the weather station data to extrapolate soil moisture changes in the top meter of soil we estimated a 7 increase in mean watershed soil moisture in early summer of 2014 relative to 1970 compared to an estimated 2 drop in shallow soil moisture alone appendix e this extrapolation has high uncertainty given the limited number of deep vwc measurements but illuminates a possibility that deeper soil moisture stores are increasing due to fire regime shifts even in some places where surface soil moisture is not strongly affected the general trends of our results would not change however with those areas that transition from conifer to dense meadow still experiencing the greatest increases in moisture appendix e 4 2 model performance the linear and random forest models gave similar results in terms of covariates influence on vwc as well as the predicted upscaled spatial pattern of soil moisture the model predictions were also stable to the tested variations of model structure or input data treatment using cross validation we found model correlation to test data of approximately 0 81 using random forest and 0 79 using the linear model this was stable across different cross validation exercises undertaken these model fits are strong in comparison to similar statistical models used to predict soil moisture in other studies e g western et al 1999 found model predictions to have ρ 0 78 for vwc on individual days whereas our model has higher ρ and spans a range of dates and are comparable to the performance of remotely sensed soil moisture products e g chan et al 2016 found a mean correlation of 0 78 between time series of satellite derived soil moisture and measured data 4 3 is vegetation a viable proxy for soil moisture vegetation was the strongest predictor of soil moisture status within the icb eclipsing topographic factors the next most important predictors and fire history which are discussed below the importance of vegetation was strongly driven by the large differences in wetness between wetlands and other vegetation types fig 4 as discussed in the introduction we anticipated this strong relationship between moisture and vegetation because multiple feedbacks influence their interactions vegetation changes can alter soil moisture through changes to water and energy balances while soil moisture levels partially determine the type of vegetation which will establish following a disturbance while the causal links between moisture and vegetation cannot be determined via this data analysis the association of different vegetation types and transitions with different soil moisture states holds across the icb providing an avenue for using vegetation change as a proxy albeit an imperfect proxy for hydrologic change 4 4 how did topography and fire history influence soil moisture topography and particularly the topographic wetness index was an important determinant of wetness within vegetation types valley bottoms and other topographically convergent locations as well as higher elevations were associated with higher soil moisture surprisingly south facing slopes had higher soil moisture than north facing slopes once other factors were controlled for however this effect was not strong model results suggested that amongst conifer forests soil moisture was elevated in both unburned areas and high severity burn areas and lower in areas with low moderate severity fire elevated moisture following high severity fire can be explained by reduced evaporating leaf area and plant water demand high moisture in unburned sites could be due to reduced soil evaporation under unburned canopies or it is possible that contemporary unburned sites failed to burn in the first place because of their relatively wet conditions amongst the remaining vegetation classes soil moisture was generally lower in sites with frequent or severe fire histories interpreting the causal influence of fire on water availability is complicated in the icb because moisture availability and topography also determine where fires occur in this basin kane et al 2015 thus low soil moisture in frequently or severely burned sites fig 7 g and h could reflect the effect of vegetation change on soil moisture status or it could reflect the propensity for dry sites to burn more frequently the potential for dry sites to promote burning may also have caused the statistical model to overestimate soil moisture in the unburned 1970 scenario 1 dry fire prone coniferous sites may be very rare within the basin today and thus were not captured in the observations we made after 40 years of managed wildfire 2 unburned or low fire severity conifer sites may have escaped high severity fire due to pre existing wet conditions overall these issues may have biased the estimates of hydrologic change in the basin towards drying 4 5 influences of a changing fire regime on basin hydrology overall the changing fire regime in the icb appears to have impacted the hydrology of the basin but in a highly spatially variable fashion fig 9 large increases in water availability were associated with the 2 of the basin area where burned forests regenerated as meadows other vegetation transitions which occupy a larger proportion of the basin resulted in minor changes in soil moisture the sign of which varied with local topography and fire history table 5 since fire regime induced forest loss occurred over some 20 of the basin boisramé et al 2017b the constrained nature of the wet up is suggestive of the confluence of other topographic fire history or unobserved factors that govern the nature of these vegetation transitions and hydrologic changes there was large variability in soil moisture within vegetation transitions for example some areas where conifer transitioned to dense meadow following fire saw no change in soil moisture while others saw vwc increases up to 0 31 fig 10 this variability was largely driven by topography flat landscapes tpi near zero were sometimes associated with decreased vwc in new dense meadows fig 11 and also experienced the greatest drying from 1970 to the present day under other vegetation transitions not shown the largest modeled increases in vwc occurred in post fire meadows that formed in topographically convergent areas convergent sites however did not always transition to dense meadows following stand replacing fires showing that topography is not a perfect predictor of moisture increases the wet meadow areas sampled were variable in their water sources some appear to be strongly snowpack dependent revealed by wetter conditions in the near average snow year of 2016 compared to extremely low snowpack in 2015 and some appear to be more dependent on summer rainfall drier conditions in 2016 than 2015 mirroring trends in summer rainfall between the years this could be due to variations in water sources ranging from observable sources such as streams to unobservable sources such as springs or seeps ratliff 1985 the diversity of hydrological drivers and responses associated with the sampled meadows is suggestive of a complex suite of processes linking vegetation soil moisture topography and climate lowry et al 2011 rodriguez iturbe et al 2007 all of which can interact with shape and be shaped by shifts in vegetation due to changing fire regimes neary et al 2005 a deeper understanding of subsurface flow processes in icb would allow us to better estimate past soil moisture distributions but at present we are restricted to statistical relationships between soil moisture and surface topography which cannot capture the effects of flows from springs although conifer to dense meadow transitions and the associated increases in water availability are only associated with a small area in the icb these increases in water availability could nonetheless provide important hydrologic refugia for water dependent plants or animals mclaughlin et al 2017 wetlands also sustain summer baseflow in small streams and thus have an impact on downstream ecosystems these transitions from relatively dry forests to wetter meadows may be an example of alternative stable states ridolfi et al 2006 in areas that are prone to high soil water storage due to topography and or subsurface flow paths forests can provide stabilizing feedback if the trees high levels of transpiration maintain groundwater levels low enough for more trees to establish on the other hand wet meadows can remain stable via multiple mechanisms that maintain high water tables which then limit tree establishment fletcher et al 2014 ridolfi et al 2006 a dry period can switch the system from the meadow stable state to the forested stable state by initiating a period of conifer encroachment helms 1987 while fire or some other cause of tree mortality can return a forest to a stable meadow state fletcher et al 2014 in either case the vegetation transition is accompanied by a self reinforcing transition in water storage it is also possible that some of these meadows represent unstable states if water levels are low enough that conifer establishment is not strongly drought dependent frequent disturbances such as fire may be necessary to prevent transitions back to forest helms 1987 either way observed land cover changes boisramé et al 2017b and the moisture changes modeled here suggest that a frequent fire regime is necessary for the long term maintenance of at least some of the wet meadows in the icb and thus the maintenance of associated high subsurface water storage 4 6 future work ongoing observations at the weather stations described here aim to explore how changes in vegetation canopy impact microclimatic conditions and local scale water balance as an initial exploration of how vegetation changes may translate into changes in hydrologic drivers it is possible that water stores in deeper soils or in the unmonitored fractured bedrock have increased due to the change in fire regime future work using hydrologic modeling will explore these possibilities 5 conclusion statistical models of the icb indicate that vegetation can provide a useful proxy for soil moisture availability and thus potentially its changes over time provided that topographic and fire history effects can be controlled for vegetation was the most important predictor of variations in surface soil moisture and surface soil moisture was related to both plant available water and to measures of water availability in the surface 1m of soils thus topographic and vegetation spatial information provided a scaling approach to link site based observations to basin wide soil moisture regimes such an approach is widely applicable to watersheds with variable vegetation cover observable using remote sensing the model results did not indicate large changes in basin averaged surface soil moisture in the icb following restoration of the fire regime individual locations exhibited large increases in soil moisture following fire induced vegetation conversions while much of the remainder of the basin showed no change or weak drying trends the basin scale estimates may be biased towards under estimating the hydrologic impacts of these managed wildfire regime however due to a likely bias towards observing relatively wet contemporary coniferous forests and possibly greater differences in deep soil moisture stores than shallow between vegetation types process hydrologic modeling is being used to further investigate these changes the most dramatic fire related vwc increases shown by statistical models were associated with locations that were forested in 1970 experienced high severity fire and were colonized by dense meadow according to the model most of these areas had elevated soil moisture compared to other forested areas even before burning and became even wetter following the vegetation shift fig 10 based on this result and observations in the field we believe that areas that transition from forest to dense meadow rather than to a more xeric vegetation type following fire have local topography and geology which facilitates high soil moisture storage in these areas such areas may even have been wetlands in the past but in relatively dry years during fire suppressed periods trees were able to colonize helms 1987 norman and taylor 2005 and the high water demand of these trees further reduced the soil moisture once these trees and their high transpiration demand were removed enough water was available for the soil to come closer to saturation making the ground less favorable to tree seedling growth and more favorable for grasses and forbs managed wildfire has wrought large changes in vegetation cover and structure in the icb and these have numerous documented benefits to resilience and ecological health boisramé et al 2017a collins and stephens 2007 ponisio et al 2016 while we do not find evidence of large hydrologic responses to these changes the hydrologic shifts that have occurred are likely to be broadly positive creating ecologically and hydrologically valuable wet summer habitat given the uncertainties associated with the statistical modeling approach taken here further efforts to apply process models to and ultimately improve hydrological monitoring of basins experiencing vegetation change through managed wildfire regimes should remain a research

facility gif berkeley edu appendix a properties of sampling locations our sampling strategy attempted to cover the widest range of geographic variables possible within the icb this attempt was limited by safety and accessibility of many areas of the watershed although we did not sample the steepest parts of the icb as they are prohibitively difficult to access for measurements the steepest areas are mainly rock therefore they have few fires and do not store much soil moisture making them less relevant to our study although our measurement sites do not always cover the full range of variability in physical characteristics the measured span does include the median watershed value for every covariate table a 1 appendix b leaf water potential measurements this appendix presents details of the leaf water potential measurements used to relate surface vwc to root zone soil saturation fig b 1 shows a stronger relationship between water potential measured in psi and surface soil water content in the pre dawn measurements compared to those in the afternoon certain species separate well in the afternoon measurements p jeffreyi has relatively low afternoon leaf water potentials indicating that they are not losing much water to transpiration the salix species on the other hand all have high afternoon leaf water potentials suggesting high levels of transpiration appendix c continuous measurements three temporary weather stations installed in july 2015 monitor temperature relative humidity soil moisture soil temperature wind speed and solar radiation in the icb measurements are recorded every 10 minutes using a campbell scientific cr1000 datalogger http www campbellsci com all three stations are within an area that has burned twice most recently in 2004 one station is in a low severity burn area with an intact mature mixed conifer canopy the other two stations are in nearby burned areas with no mature trees within at least 25m one of these non forested stations is dominated by shrubs and the other is in a wet dense meadow dominated by grasses these stations are located within 200 m of each other in the southwest region of illilouette creek basin at an elevation of approximately 2100 m close to the mean elevation of the forested area within the icb which is 2270 m they are located uphill of the nearest trails and are over 3km from the nearest road and therefore should not be affected by human infrastructure time domain reflectomer tdr probes were installed at three depths ranging from 12 cm to 100 cm at each weather station in order to capture subsurface water storage dynamics fig c 1 soil from three depths within each of the pits dug for these installations was analyzed by the uc davis analytical laboratory for soil texture and percent organic matter anlab ucdavis edu the surface top 10 cm wet meadow soil sample was 13 organic matter all other soil samples consisted of over 87 sand particles and less than 5 organic matter even the deeper wet meadow soils classifying them as loamy sand appendix d model details we tested all covariates for collinearity and found no correlations with absolute value above 0 7 which is a common cutoff to determine if collinearity will impact a model s ability to determine the impact of individual predictors dormann et al 2013 shmueli 2010 we also tested the collinearity of all gridded data used in the model not just locations where we measured and the only high collinearity was between times burned and time since fire correlation coefficient of 0 83 table d 1 even twi and slope which we would expect to be closely related only had a correlation coefficient of 0 25 and upslope area and twi had a correlation coefficient of 0 47 because of these fairly low correlation coefficients we determined that each of these three covariates provided different information to the model and chose to include them all as predictors there were three pairs of numerical non categorical covariates used in the random forest model with correlation above 0 4 in absolute value table d 1 looking at all gridded data used in the model not just locations where we measured the pairwise correlations were not always the same as for our measured locations table d 1 we also found relatively high correlations 0 4 between geographic location given by latitude and longitude and elevation as well as times burned for this reason as well as low statistical significance in initial regression analysis latitude and longitude were not included in the model but this information still shows that there are spatial relationships that govern different covariates there were also correlations between 1970 vegetation and time since fire due to wetland vegetation rarely burning but this is not included in table d 1 as vegetation is categorical rather than a numerical covariate soil moisture changes throughout summer can be highly nonlinear and the changes over summer can be very different in different locations figs c 1 and d 1 for this reason we explored the option of creating separate model fits for early summer prior to july 15 and late summer after july 15 for most model coefficients there were not significant differences between fitting data from the two different time periods fig d 2 a formal definition of partial dependence for random forest models is provided here for clarification define a model f x where x contains p covariates xj with n observations each an individual value within xj is given by x j k j 1 p k 1 n the partial dependence f x j k of an individual covariate value x j k is found by taking the average value of f using the given x j k across all possible values for the other covariates d 1 f x j k 1 n i 1 n f x 1 i x j 1 i x j k x j 1 i x p i calculating f x j k for k 1 n gives a plot of the mean value of f x for a given value of xj or the partial dependence of f on xj appendix e deeper soil moisture the soil moisture data in appendix c suggests that the difference between shallow and deep soil moisture is greater in shrubs and wetlands than it is in closed canopy forests this could mean that soil moisture changes resulting from conifer removal may be greater at depth than in surface soil top 12 cm as a preliminary exercise to test the significance of this we extrapolated the 0 1 m depth averaged soil moisture values from the weather stations to the full watershed using vegetation maps we assumed that the relationship between shallow and deep soil moisture fits a separate linear equation for each vegetation type mean vwc over top 1 m c 1 v c 2 v mean vwc over top 12 cm where c 1 v and c 2 v are coefficients unique to each vegetation type v the stationarity of these coefficients over time and space cannot be verified given the limited number of deep vwc measurements available however further work using additional buried sensors and or hydrologic models may validate this estimate using summer soil moisture data from the three weather stations we calculated the coefficients given in table e 1 applying the appropriate linear equation to the surface soil moisture estimates in each grid cell of our basin scale model gives an estimated 1 meter averaged soil moisture value we used the coefficients for shrub to estimate soil moisture for sparse meadows under the assumption that sparse meadows and shrublands both have relatively shallow rooted vegetation and that sparse meadow moisture regimes are likely more similar to shrublands than they are to wet meadows the results of this exercise showed a 7 increase in soil moisture across the whole watershed under 2014 conditions compared to if the watershed had remained fire suppressed for comparison the model of surface soil moisture showed a 2 decrease in surface soil moisture averaged across the basin this increase in mean soil moisture for the top meter is mainly driven by a large increase in deep soil moisture under the drier dense meadows fig e 1 a compared to the smaller increases in surface soil moisture alone for the same vegetation transitions fig e 2 a there are also slight increases in soil moisture over the top meter when transitioning from conifer to shrubs or sparse meadow fig e 1 b and c with the largest changes occurring in areas that were already at the wetter end of the range for comparison surface soil moisture was predicted to change very little or slightly decrease under transitions from conifer to shrubs or sparse meadows fig e 2 b and c because we only have one location with deep soil moisture measurements under each vegetation type these estimates of change in deeper soil moisture are highly uncertain however this analysis does illustrate the possibility that transitions from conifer to other vegetation types could increase total soil water stores to a greater degree than is observed using surface soil moisture alone 
878,many forested mountain watersheds worldwide evolved with frequent fire which twentieth century fire suppression activities eliminated resulting in unnaturally dense forests with high water demand restoration of pre suppression forest composition and structure through a variety of management activities could improve forest resilience and water yields this study explores the potential for managed wildfire whereby naturally ignited fires are allowed to burn to alter the water balance interest in this type of managed wildfire is increasing yet its long term effects on water balance are uncertain we use soil moisture as a spatially distributed hydrologic indicator to assess the influence of vegetation fire history and landscape position on water availability in the illilouette creek basin in yosemite national park over 6000 manual surface soil moisture measurements were made over a period of three years and supplemented with continuous soil moisture measurements over the top 1m of soil in three sites random forest and linear mixed effects models showed a dominant effect of vegetation type and history of vegetation change on measured soil moisture contemporary and historical vegetation maps were used to upscale the soil moisture observations to the basin and infer soil moisture under fire suppressed conditions little change in basin averaged soil moisture was inferred due to managed wildfire but the results indicated that large localized increases in soil moisture had occurred which could have important impacts on local ecology or downstream flows keywords wildfire mixed conifer wetland shrub sierra nevada soil moisture 1 introduction the importance of forested montane watersheds for water supply in many regions worldwide has long raised the question of whether forest management could be used to enhance water yields baker 1986 hawthorne et al 2013 hibbert 1965 kattelmann et al 1983 lesch and scott 1997 troendle 1983 more recently the potential for such management actions to improve forest health and productivity in fire suppressed forests has raised the prospect of a win win scenario for ecology and water supply fire suppression has led to unnaturally dense forests in many parts of the world including california s sierra nevada collins et al 2011 mcintyre et al 2015 forest management that reduces tree density could increase growth rates of the remaining trees bréda et al 1995 ruprecht and stoneman 1993 reduce competition between trees for scarce resources grant et al 2013 and reduce the potential for catastrophic wildfire aust and blinn 2004 kauffman 2004 pollet and omi 2002 thus improving forest resilience in turn reduced water demand in thinned forests can result in higher water availability downstream and increasing non forested wetland area can increase a watershed s capacity for water storage dubé et al 1995 fletcher et al 2014 soil moisture is a hydrologic variable that integrates all of these processes as subsurface stores provide a source of water for both vegetation needs and streamflow generation and changing soil moisture reflects changes in local water balance the hydrologic impacts of forest management practices are highly uncertain scientific studies are limited and have mixed results for example observed flow increases following forest thinning range from as little as 1 to 70 kattelmann et al 1983 lesch and scott 1997 differences in outcome appear to depend on many factors including the specifics of the forest treatment local topography vegetation type and weather baker 1986 hawthorne et al 2013 problematically increases in water yield typically persist for only 5 years following forest treatments brown et al 2005 suggesting that frequent re treatment would be needed to sustain water supply benefits such high frequencies may impose important feasibility constraints on the implementation of labor intensive management efforts conventional forest management practices such as thinning clearing or prescribed fire may also be difficult to upscale to the point where they can have meaningful impacts on water resources thus identifying alternative and scalable forest management strategies would be attractive managed wildfire may offer such an approach under this management strategy naturally ignited fires are allowed to burn provided a fire management plan is identified and clear conditions for fire operations are in place e g to prevent air quality impacts or protect sensitive areas the fire return interval in many fire prone mountain watersheds is relatively short e g 7 15 years in the mid pine belt in the sierra nevada collins and stephens 2007 meaning that this approach can alter the understory and ground litter collins et al 2016 stephens et al 2009 reduce forest density and leaf area kane et al 2014 and replace land cover boisramé et al 2017a on timescales commensurate with those of hydrologic recovery from such disturbance managed wildfire policies have been implemented long term in only a few watersheds in these locations they are associated with large scale reductions in forest cover and density over multi decadal timescales boisramé et al 2017b kane et al 2014 these changes may have reduced the extent of severe fires collins and stephens 2007 lowered drought induced forest mortality relative to neighboring basins boisramé et al 2017a and increased the biodiversity of pollinating insects ponisio et al 2016 these positive outcomes support the potential for managed wildfire to mimic some of the landscape scale benefits of thinning or patch felling at large scales and at relatively frequent intervals without requiring mechanized harvest and the associated costs labor and soil disturbance to date however the hydrologic impacts of managed wildfire are poorly understood the basins with long term managed wildfire regimes lack long term stream gauges and baseline i e pre treatment hydrologic measurements the study watershed considered here the illilouette creek basin icb is gauged after its confluence with the larger upper merced river while there may be a small signal of enhanced streamflow production at this gauge following the institution of the managed wildfire regime in the icb in 1972 boisramé et al 2017a analysis of flow trends offers little insight into the effects of the fire regime on basin hydrology both due to uncertainty caused by high interannual variability in flows and the basin aggregated nature of streamflow soil moisture provides a useful metric for observing sub watershed scale hydrology representing the local balance between precipitation deep drainage evapotranspiration and discharge soil moisture dynamics in a burned watershed are altered by a complex suite of hydrologically relevant processes initiated by wildfire brown et al 2005 for instance burning can have counteractive effects on the amount and timing of snowmelt inputs to groundwater stores blackened trees provide a source of long wave radiation and canopy losses reduce shading speeding melting and sublimation rates neary et al 2005 tague and dugger 2010 but canopy losses also reduce interception and can reduce long wave radiation enhancing snowpack accumulation and delaying snowmelt compared to dense forest ellis et al 2013 lundquist et al 2013 similarly although loss of mature trees can reduce transpiration bréda et al 1995 he et al 2013 ma et al 2010 rambo and north 2009 zhang et al 2001 loss of shading can increase soil evaporation biederman et al 2014 while regrowth of understory vegetation or young life stages can increase water demand reducing soil moisture levels lane et al 2010 neary et al 2005 tague and dugger 2010 vertessy et al 1995 2001 most literature regarding fire effects on watershed hydrologic balance focuses on large individual fires helvey 1980 langford 1976 e g or individual clearing thinning treatments brown et al 2005 rather than the long term effects of cumulative vegetation change thus the net hydrologic impact of managed wildfire over many decades and at basin scales remains uncertain the illilouette creek basin is one of two basins in california four in the western united states where a managed wildfire regime has been in place for multiple decades it holds wilderness status meaning that soil and surface hydrology are relatively undisturbed by humans although no direct observations of change in the basin hydrology during the institution of the managed wildfire regime are available there are no data for soil moisture streamflow or weather within the icb dating from its fire suppressed state fire effects on vegetation cover in the icb have been reconstructed from air photo records boisramé et al 2017b these reconstructions show that between 1970 when the basin was still fire suppressed and 2012 the watershed lost 24 of its conifer cover while dense meadow area increased by 155 shrub area by 35 and sparse meadow area by 199 boisramé et al 2017b the type of vegetation growing at a location is frequently correlated with local hydrological conditions e g araya et al 2011 milledge et al 2013 mountford and chapman 1993 for example lodgepole pine pinus contorta pico a common species in icb establishes in intermediately wet areas of meadows helms and ratliff 1987 while whitethorn ceanothus ceanothus cordulatus grows in exposed dry sites fites kaufman et al 2007 within the icb kane et al 2015 found relationships between water balance and forest structure suggesting that vegetation observations can be related to water availability and the history of vegetation change in the basin could therefore provide a proxy history of hydrologic changes in this study we use soil moisture to represent these hydrologic changes since it integrates shallow hydrologic fluxes and therefore is a useful spatially explicit indicator of water budget partitioning reconstructing hydrologic change as represented by changing soil moisture using vegetation is undoubtedly an approximate method but it overcomes major limitations of other approaches such as remote sensing of soil moisture related indices musick and pelletier 1988 which are precluded in areas with dense vegetation cover crist and cicone 1984 and thus cannot be used to examine the effects of transitions from forested to unforested sites this study aims to identify the effect of the changing fire regime on water availability in the icb by measuring surface soil moisture establishing its dependence on vegetation fire history and topography and using these relationships to extrapolate soil moisture observations to the basin scale under contemporary and historic vegetation distributions differences in these basin scale soil moisture surfaces would then provide an estimate of the change in soil moisture following the change in fire management in order to justify this modeling approach we first answer the following questions is surface soil moisture a useful indicator of ecologically relevant water storage as might be influenced by or might influence local vegetation is vegetation a useful indicator of surface soil moisture values under a given vegetation type can topography and fire history explain spatial variations in soil moisture ideally we would estimate total soil water storage using continuous moisture measurements over the depth of the soil profile at many locations this would give the most complete measure of the balance between precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff however wilderness regulations u s congress 1964 limited such observations which require disturbance of the soil profile and installation of temporary instrumentation to three sites in the icb therefore we relied primarily on spatially extensive but shallow top 12 cm soil moisture measurements 6000 in 90 sites made twice annually over three consecutive growing seasons 2014 through 2016 although surface soil moisture cannot be directly extrapolated to subsurface water storage it is often closely related to water table depth sörensen et al 2006 and plant available water gonzalez zamora et al 2016 all observations were made during drought years of varying characteristics and severity from extreme drought in 2014 2015 to near normal winter precipitation in 2015 2016 and therefore do not necessarily apply to wet years the observations were made at least nine years after the most recent large fire in the icb and do not capture short term post fire soil moisture responses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the illilouette creek basin icb is a 150 km2 basin within the upper merced watershed in yosemite national park california usa fig 1 spanning an 1800 m to 3000 m elevation range in the central sierra nevada this area experiences a mediterranean type climate with average january daily minimum temperatures ranging from 5 c to 1 c and average july daily maximum temperatures of 25 c 2000 2015 http www wrcc dri edu stations white wolf crane flat average annual precipitation oct sep ranged from 47 to 60 cm 2000 2015 dominated by winter snow the basin is covered by coniferous forests dominated by jeffrey pine pinus jeffreyi red fir abies magnifica white fir abies concolor and p contorta granite outcrops meadows and shrublands dominated by whitethorn ceanothus c cordulatus collins et al 2007 the area never experienced timber harvesting and likely had minimal impacts from livestock grazing collins and stephens 2007 fire suppression began in the icb in the late 19th century at a time when fire suppression was becoming common practice in many u s forests collins and stephens 2007 and the total area burned between 1880 and 1973 was only 0 08 km2 in 1972 the icb transitioned to a managed wildfire policy van wagtendonk 2007 resulting in a new fire regime with very similar fire frequency and extent to those inferred by tree ring analysis from the pre suppression period contemporary mean fire return intervals are 6 8 years compared to a 6 3 year mean from 1700 to 1900 collins and stephens 2007 during the managed wildfire period 30 fires exceeding 40 ha extent burned in the icb forming a mosaic of vegetation change where high severity burn patches intermix with intact forests collins and stephens 2010 fig 2 and leading to a large range in time since last fire and vegetation condition across the basin seventy five percent of the vegetated area and 52 of the total basin area have burned since 1972 2 2 field measurements surface soil moisture was mapped in the icb in the summers of 2014 2016 a total of 6220 measurements were made in 90 sites covering representative combinations of burn severity time since fire slope aspect elevation and vegetation cover fig 1 table a 1 thirty seven sites were selected to overlap with established research plots collins et al 2016 fifty three new sites were selected to represent combinations of slope aspect burn severity and vegetation cover omitted in the previous plots locations for most of these new sites were selected by identifying desired combinations of traits in arcgis http www arcgis com constraining locations to those accessible by foot and sampling randomly within the identified areas twelve of the new locations were chosen opportunistically once in the field the volumetric water content vwc of soils was measured by inserting a 12 cm time domain reflectomer tdr hydrosense ii probe vertically into the surface soils having first removed leaf litter or duff given the high degree of homogeneity amongst the granitic loamy sands in the icb a mineral soil calibration which typically has a 3 accuracy campbell scientific 2015 was used for all sites in common with other large scale surface soil moisture studies e g famiglietti et al 2008 the tdr measurements for all sites gave reasonable values compared to qualitative estimates of soil moisture based on feel and appearance of the soil some organic wetland soils are present in the basin although the tdr was not recalibrated for these soils maximum errors in vwc associated with tdr measurements in organic soils are reported as 0 05 roth et al 1992 much smaller than typical differences in moisture between wetland and mineral soil sites consistency of measurements between handheld instruments was verified throughout the 3 field seasons handheld instruments were also verified against the continuously measuring tdrs from three vertical arrays see below soil moisture was measured at each site one to six times during early and late summer when possible early summer measurements were made between may 21 and june 17 and late summer measurements between july 17 and august 9 fifty five sites were measured at least twice e g early and late summer measurements in one year 27 sites were measured at least four times and seven sites were measured six times both early and late summer measurements in all three years sites with highly variable soil moisture through time were high priorities for multiple measurements conversely only a subset of sites exhibiting very dry early summer soil moisture e g vwc 0 05 were re measured in late summer under the rationale that moisture conditions would remain similar across the dry summer months we avoided taking measurements during or immediately following heavy rainfall though a small number of measurements did occur within one day of precipitation both our continuously measuring soil moisture sensors see below and a subset of manual measurements taken before and after rainfall verified that individual summer storms affected surface soil moisture by a negligible amount compared to seasonal changes in most sites 30 evenly spaced soil moisture measurements 25 for repeat measures in homogeneous sites were made within a 30m by 30m grid additional measurements were made in heterogeneous sites one meter spaced measurements were made across a 30 m transect in sites with obvious strong gradients in soil moisture e g wetland sites bordered by dry uplands the standard error of the per site mean vwc over 25 30 measurements averaged 0 01 max of 0 07 standard errors were 10 of the mean in 56 of sites and 20 of the mean in 90 of sites at each site dominant vegetation cover to species level when possible slope aspect and the presence of burned snags or fire scarred trees were recorded sites were georeferenced using handheld garmin gpsmap 62st and 64st devices horizontal accuracy 3 10 m latitude and longitude were assigned to each measurement point based on location within the grid or transect locations were verified in arcmap 2 3 relating surface and root zone soil moisture under dry climatic conditions shallow soil moisture can become decoupled from water availability across the soil column grayson et al 1997 he et al 2013 which could confound both associations with vegetation and interpretation of shallow soil moisture patterns in terms of basin hydrology to establish relationships between shallow soil moisture and whole column water availability tdr measurements were compared to two independent metrics of subsurface water content i pre dawn leaf water potentials and ii three continuously reporting vertical soil moisture tdr arrays spanning the top 1m of soil 2 3 1 pre dawn leaf water potential measurements pre dawn measurements of leaf water potential provide a proxy for root zone water availability under the assumption that non transpiring plants reached hydraulic equilibrium with soil water potential overnight bréda et al 1995 dawson et al 2007 leaf water potential was measured with a pms 1505d pressure chamber http www pmsinstrument com following the methods of dawson and ehleringer 1993 pre dawn leaf water potential was measured in whitethorn ceanothus willow multiple unidentified salix species lodgepole pine jeffrey pine and aspen populus tremuloides at five sites co located with tdr measurements at least three individuals were measured per species per site and each site was measured in early and late summer these water potentials were then compared to surface soil moisture measurements 2 3 2 vertical tdr arrays weather stations including tdrs installed horizontally at 12 cm 60 cm and 1m beneath the soil surface 12 cm cs655 campbell scientific soil water content reflectometers tdrs http www campbellsci com were installed in july 2015 in loamy sand soils beneath different canopy types closed canopy post fire shrub and post fire wetland occurring within 200 m of each other see appendix c for details tdrs were installed horizontally into undisturbed soil and the access holes backfilled and compacted exact tdr depths vary slightly at each location due to reaching rock or the water table before 1 m but the soil was 90 cm deep at all three locations the tdrs record soil moisture every 10 minutes and enable continuous comparison of surface soil moisture to depth integrated water storage 2 4 spatial data topography vegetation cover and fire history were mapped for the icb using arcgis http www arcgis com site characteristics were extracted from these maps topographic covariates slope aspect elevation distance to nearest stream and upslope area were derived from a lidar elevation map of the icb coarsened to 10 m2 resolution from the original 1 m2 map kane et al 2015 several specific topographic indices were computed the aspect index was used to control for the influence of slope orientation on incident solar radiation rather than describing orientation according to compass direction the aspect index transforms orientation to a 0 1 scale south facing slopes 1 and north facing 0 as 0 5 1 c o s a s p e c t 30 kane et al 2015 the topographic wetness index twi accounts for how topography may predisopose a site to saturation via shallow subsurface flow twi is computed as l n a t a n s where a is the upslope contributing area and s the local slope the higher the twi the greater the topographic potential for saturation beven 1983 the topographic position index describes whether a site is in a valley tpi 0 a ridge tpi 0 or on a near planar slope tpi 0 it is computed as t p i i n t e l e v f o c a l m e a n e l e v a n n u l u s 150 300 5 where elev is the point s elevation in meters focalmean is a function which takes the mean elevation over a ring surrounding the point with inner diameter of 150m and outer diameter of 300 m and int refers to rounding the results to the nearest integer value weiss 2001 the ranges for all topographic and fire history values are given in table a 1 dominant vegetation cover in 1969 1970 at the end of the fire suppressed period and in 2012 following 40 years of managed wildfire was mapped from aerial imagery boisramé et al 2017b vegetation was classified as sparse meadow dense meadow shrub aspen and conifer dense meadows include wetlands and areas of dense herbaceous cover which cannot be reliably separated using imagery sparse meadows include sparse shrub and or herbaceous cover and are dominated by bare ground exposed bedrock and talus fields were excluded from our analyses these vegetation classifications were used for contemporary analysis upscaling and extrapolation to historical maps separately the observed dominance of lodgepole pine pico at a measurement site was considered an additional classifier for the contemporary analysis while pico could not reliably be identified separately from other conifer forest in aerial images it is often associated with wet conditions relative to other conifers and could thus be a useful indicator of hydrologic condition in the contemporary watershed time since fire and times burned since 1930 were computed from a digital fire atlas containing all recorded fire perimeters within yosemite national park available from irma nps gov portal if no fires occurred time since fire was set to 100 years fire severity was calculated using a relative version of the differenced normalized burn ratio rdnbr derived from landsat thematic mapper images boisramé et al 2017a collins et al 2009 thresholds for rdnbr fire severity classes unchanged low moderate and high were taken from miller and thode 2007 spatial covariates were extracted from the spatial datasets for each subsite using arcmap and compared to field notes to verify accuracy they were used in initial exploratory comparisons of soil moisture variability as well as co variates in the statistical models 2 5 other data weather data are incompletely observed across the icb and throughout the sierra nevada generally thus variability in weather conditions and potentially other unobserved time varying drivers of vwc variability was accounted for by using the year of measurement as a covariate in the statistical models of surface soil moisture described below for example 2015 had three times more summer precipitation than the other two years 120 mm in may september yosemite southern entrance station http www ncdc noaa gov while 2016 had the most winter precipitation 890 mm in the winter of 2015 2016 compared to 400 mm the previous two winters we were unable to improve model results by incorporating observations from nearby weather stations directly prior to analysis all covariates were tested to detect collinearity no correlation between covariates exceeded r 0 7 a common cutoff used to indicate unacceptable levels of collinearity dormann et al 2013 shmueli 2010 test models were run incorporating latitude and longitude as spatial predictors but these covariates showed both high collinearity with other covariates and low significance and were dropped from the final models for more details see appendix d 2 6 analysis of soil moisture variability soil moisture was related to site characteristics with statistical models trained on measured surface soil moisture all models were fit using r software http www r project org prior to model fitting data were manipulated to create a dataset in which predictor and explanatory variables were resolved at similar spatial scales and potential biases due to higher sampling frequency of certain sites were addressed as described below first because the spatial predictor data are available at scales of 10 m 30 m vwc measurements in each site were aggregated to the mean value under each dominant vegetation type within the site this coarsening reduces the influence of fine scale variations in for example microtopography which are not captured by the covariates the vegetation patch averaged data within individual sites are referred to as subsites the subsite data formed the basis for all modeling secondly the prioritization of highly time varying sites when sampling as described in section 2 2 meant that saturated sites in early summer and dry sites in late summer were under represented in the data set we used a gap filling algorithm to correct for this sampling bias towards variable sites gap filling used early late season measurements from a different year at the same site if available and with a scaled early or late season measurement if not scaling factors were based on the observed mean seasonal variations from sites with both early and late summer data 0 35 for early to late season scaling in dry sites or 1 4 for late to early season scaling of wet sites this method allowed us to fill in missing data in 59 of the 90 sites adding 91 data points to the original set of 347 subsite aggregated measurements thirty one gap filled points used data from the same time of year but a different year while 17 were in locations with no early summer measurements and 43 in locations with no late summer measurements we explored the effects of this gap filling on model results and verified that results were minimally sensitive to this approach in terms of both modeled vwc values prediction and the relationships between modeled vwc and covariates explanation although this analysis showed that missing data do not appear to be causing a significant bias in the results the gap filled dataset has been used throughout the modeling process to ensure that the data are balanced and complete 2 7 statistical models used two different statistical models were used to relate vwc to topographic vegetation and fire history predictors i a random forest model and ii a generalized linear mixed effects model both models predict continuously valued vwc using current vegetation type vegetation type in 1970 upslope area slope aspect index elevation topographic position index tpi topographic wetness index twi distance from nearest stream year of measurement 2014 2015 or 2016 day of year the measurement was taken e g 152 for june 1 years since last fire times burned since 1970 and maximum fire severity unchanged low moderate or high as covariates the current and 1970 vegetation types use the following categories sparse meadow dense meadow shrub aspen and conifer using two statistical approaches allowed us to capitalize on the relative advantages of each primarily the ability of a random forest model to address nonlinearity in relationships between covariates and outcomes and the relative ease of interpreting a linear regression model the comparison between the two modeling approaches also provides a check on the consistency of interpretations made from the data 2 7 1 random forest model random forest models predict a continuous variable by creating a large number of regression trees each based on a random subset of all possible covariates the predicted values from all of the trees is then averaged breiman 2001 each regression tree divides the data into smaller and smaller groups or nodes until a stopping criterion is reached the data in each parent node is divided into two child nodes based on one of the predictors and the division that maximizes the separation in values between the two child nodes is selected at each step the value of a new point in covariate space is computed by following the path from the first node to the appropriate terminal node the random forest method can describe non linear responses between variables and predictors and avoids over fitting that can result from using only one regression tree grömping 2009 kane et al 2015 prasad et al 2006 we used the randomforest package in r liaw and wiener 2002 to fit a random forest model and set the minimum node size to 5 and the number of trees to 500 the number that minimized the rmse of the model the impact of different covariates on modeled vwc was quantified using the importance and partial dependence the importance of a covariate in a random forest model is calculated using the change in model error when a covariate is included or excluded as a covariate when training the model liaw and wiener 2002 the partial dependence describes the response of a dependent variable to individual covariates while controlling for the effects of other covariates for example partial dependence could describe the influence of elevation on modelled vwc independently of variation in other covariates to assess the partial dependence vwc would be computed for all possible values of the other covariates vegetation cover slope aspect time since fire etc holding elevation constant the resulting vwc values would be averaged this procedure is repeated for different constant values of elevation to visualize the mean vwc response to changing elevation appendix d 2 7 2 linear mixed effects model the vwc data were also fit with a generalized linear mixed effects model referred to subsequently as linear model clark 2007 this statistical modelling method is widely used and can account for spatial autocorrelation between sub sites spatial autocorrelation is often exhibited by large scale moisture patterns western et al 1998 the linear model was trained on the same data as the random forest model using the lme function in r and assuming a spherical spatial correlation structure pinheiro et al 2015 vegetation cover was treated as a random effect as in chen et al 2012 omuto et al 2010 allowing each vegetation type to have a separate intercept we separated vegetation type by current and 1970 cover all other covariates were treated as fixed effects and were normalized to have values between 0 and 1 so that the magnitudes of model coefficients are comparable for the categorical covariates of measurement year fire severity and times burned we coded dummy variables set to 0 or 1 for each data point by category ucla statistical consulting group 2017 for example two dummy variables were created for year the first was set to 1 if the measurement year was 2014 and 0 otherwise the second variable was set to 1 if the measurement year was 2015 and 0 otherwise year 2016 was left as the intercept the coefficients on these variables represent the relative change in vwc in 2014 or 2015 compared to 2016 the final model takes the form v w c v e g x c 0 v e g i 1 n c i x i where vwc is the predicted water content veg is the vegetation transition from 1970 to 2012 c 0 is an intercept unique to each vegetation category x is a vector of n covariates and ci are model coefficients 2 7 3 model performance model performance was evaluated using a cross validation procedure in which all data measured within a random subset of x of all sites were selected as training data and used to predict vwc in the remaining 100 x of sites x varied from 70 90 of the data and 100 iterations of the cross validation were performed for each value of x this cross validation was designed to avoid spurious outcomes due to potential autocorrelation within sites i e across subsites model performance was evaluated using root mean squared error rmse and correlation coefficients the mean and range of model performance across all 100 iterations provides an indication of the model skill in extrapolating beyond the observation points 2 7 4 simulations of soil moisture response to landscape change once the statistical models were trained to field measurements of vwc the models were used to upscale soil moisture measurements to the whole icb on a 10 m resolution grid based on the maps of topographic covariates fire history and vegetation these watershed scale estimates were made using both contemporary and historical vegetation coverage and fire histories providing insight into potential changes in soil moisture induced by the managed wildfire policy to run the model to represent 1970 conditions the year covariate was set to either 2014 2015 or 2016 effectively modeling vwc subject to the land cover and fire history from 1970 modulated by 2014 2016 climatic conditions 3 results 3 1 field measurements 3 1 1 relating surface and root zone soil moisture both pre dawn leaf water potentials and comparisons between near surface and deeper subsurface soil moisture support the existence of a relationship between surface soil moisture and overall water availability at a measured site although this relationship is not perfect predawn leaf water potentials were correlated with shallow soil moisture with a correlation coefficient of 0 69 fig 3 a the greatest sensitivity of leaf water potential to vwc was observed for vwc below 0 08 a logarithmic function provided a good fit r 2 0 61 to the observed relationship between leaf water potential and soil moisture at the weather stations the correlation coefficient between daily vwc at 12 cm and at 60 cm during the summer months of may august was 0 98 for the closed canopy and shrub sites and 0 79 for the wet meadow site and correlation between 12 cm and 90 cm 1 m soil moisture was 0 95 for closed canopy 0 94 for shrub and 0 77 for wet meadow see fig c 1 for plots of soil moisture at all three depths combining data from all 3 stations shallow soil moisture was strongly correlated to 60 cm soil moisture ρ 0 96 in the months of may august and well correlated to deep soil moisture ρ 0 91 fig 3 b and c while surface soil moisture is not a one to one indicator of soil column water availability in the icb spatial variations in surface soil moisture appear to indicate spatial variation in water availability to plants and across the soil profile during the growing season 3 1 2 observed relationships between vwc and vegetation type summer surface soil moisture content varied strongly across vegetation types both in terms of mean or median vwc per vegetation type and in terms of the variability associated with each vegetation class to represent this within class variability data are presented as violin plots fig 4 these plots show the distributions of data in different categories of pre fire and contemporary vegetation persistent wetlands areas that were mapped as dense meadow from the 1969 1970 aerial photographs and continued to be identified as such in all subsequent mappings using more recent aerial photos had the highest moisture content of all sites conifer forests that burned and regenerated as dense meadows by 2012 were the next wettest vegetation category despite the drought conditions during the study saturated soil was present in some of the dense meadows and persistent wetlands through to the late summer in every year soil moisture measurements were bimodal for burned dense meadows all times and persistent wetlands late summer only with most measurements either very wet or very dry potentially due to small variations in elevation above a shallow water table in a mean sense dense meadows were distinct from and much wetter than other vegetation categories with mean vwc of 0 38 in may and 0 28 in august at the beginning of the summer persistent conifer sites had the next highest mean vwc 0 11 across all conifer species but dried rapidly and were comparable with other non wetland vegetation types by august 0 06 vwc there was a large range of variability within the conifer sites relative to other vegetation types conifer sites dominated by pico had significantly higher mean vwc throughout the summer than other non meadow vegetation 2 7 times higher under pico p 0001 according to one sided t test as discussed in section 2 4 pico sites were grouped with other conifers in the statistical model we verified that this grouping did not result in changes in predicted vwc of more than 0 03 compared to statistical models representing pico separately shrublands and sparse meadows had comparable mean soil moisture values at the end of may 0 10 and 0 09 respectively but the sparse meadows dried more rapidly dropping to 0 04 mean vwc by june data not shown compared to 0 07 for shrubs statistically different according to one sided t test p 001 the difference between june vwc values under these vegetation types is slightly lower and less significant when data is mean aggregated by site rather than using each individual measurement mean vwc 0 05 for sparse meadow and 0 07 for shrubs p 07 in june only 20 of vwc measurements in shrub sites fell below 0 03 whereas such low values were more common in sparse meadow or conifer sites 40 for both by august however all vegetation types except for dense meadow and pico had similar distributions of moisture 3 2 modeling results 3 2 1 model performance cross validation results indicated that the random forest model provided an excellent fit to training data mean pearson s correlation coefficient ρ 0 98 and a robust but weaker fit to test data mean ρ 0 81 random forest model fits to all 2014 2016 soil moisture observations are shown in fig 5 the linear mixed effects model did not fit the training data as well ρ 0 87 and achieved comparable performance to the random forest model when predicting test data ρ 0 79 the results shown in table 1 are representative of the full suite of cross validation exercises and show summary results for an 80 20 split between training and test data they suggest that the random forest model may be overfitting the training data shmueli 2010 given the similarity in model performance and to avoid duplication model results presented here primarily use the random forest model output which captures nonlinear relationships and avoids some unrealistic vwc predictions e g vwc 0 6 or vwc 0 made by the linear model we refer to the linear model results to assist in interpretation of soil moisture sensitivity to covariates and for checks on consistency between the models numerous consistency checks verified that details of the training data organization e g splitting versus lumping pico with other coniferous forests including or avoiding gapfilling to avoid early late season bias in dry wet sites did not significantly impact model predictions structure or performance for example there was a correlation of 0 99 between vwc values from a model trained on observed data only and values from a model trained on gap filled data the mean difference in vwc between these two versions of the random forest model was 0 01 with a maximum difference of 0 06 at any subsite primarily bias correction resulted in lower predictions of late summer soil moisture values relative to the raw data which we expect to be reasonable 3 2 2 sensitivity of vwc to landscape parameters and fire history as shown in fig 4 significant differences in soil moisture attributes arose between vegetation classes table 2 shows correlations between vwc and other landscape characteristics and suggests that there were not overriding individual correlations between vwc and topography fire history or time metrics upon controlling for covariates via statistical models however clear distinctions in the relative importance of the covariates influence on vwc emerged the random forest importance metric shows that contemporary vegetation was the most important predictor of soil water content and pre fire vegetation was also in the top three most important fig 6 and table 3 twi was one of the most important predictors of vwc in the random forest model and had moderate predictive power in the linear model slope had a strong influence on soil moisture in both models see table 3 fig 6 table 4 and fig d 2 both models agreed that years since fire and times burned did not have an important impact on vwc compared to other covariates the partial dependence metrics for the random forest model show that soil moisture is more likely to be high at sites with low slopes low topographic position index and near rivers or creeks that is in valley bottoms fig 7 b d and f soil moisture increased slightly with elevation and with aspect index fig 7 a and c topographic wetness index fig 7 e slope fig 7 b and upslope area produced threshold like responses in vwc locations that were unburned or burned at low severity were more likely to have high vwc fig 7 g i although this relationship varied with vegetation type for example soil under conifer stands that regrew following high severity fire had the highest mean vwc of all conifer stands data not shown the sign of the linear model coefficients for each covariate matched the sign of the slope of linear fits to the random forest partial dependencies with the exception of times burned which had low significance in the linear model tables 4 and 3 fig 7 in the linear model day of year had a greater coefficient than year 11 vs 3 confirming that within year variability is more important than interannual variability again in agreement with the random forest results topographic covariates generally had more influence on vwc than fire history according to the linear model in terms of coefficient magnitudes as well as statistical significance 3 3 time dependence of soil moisture the relationships in vwc between sites were consistent over all years but some variation in individual sites did occur from year to year and different years varied slightly in the mean for most sites 2014 which followed one of the lowest winter snowfalls on record across the sierra nevada had the lowest soil moisture this year to year variability had low importance in the random forest model relative to the vegetation and topographic differences fig 6 and table 3 there were notable small differences however mean vwc was 0 01 higher in 2016 the wettest year compared to 2014 the driest summer on average independent of all other covariates fig 8 a this difference in means was statistically significant p 1 e 10 according to a t test performed on 100 cross validation runs 3 3 1 summer moisture loss under different vegetation types in contrast to the small year to year variability within year variation was relatively large fig d 1 the rates of summer dry down could be estimated at 24 sites where soil moisture measurements were available at three dates usually may june and late july or early august by fitting a linear equation to the three data points this linear fit gave a mean net loss of approximately 0 1 0 2 mm day over the summer for all vegetation types except for permanently flooded meadows which did not dry this results in a mean vwc drop of approximately 0 09 0 12 across the summer the data were also normalized by dividing by the mean vwc at each site in order to give the slope of the linear fit the drying rate as a percent per day using this normalizing method forested hillslopes and sparse meadows dried at 2 day shrublands and riparian areas at 1 day and permanent wetlands did not dry out although these average values are useful for approximating seasonal water loss from shallow soils the random forest model suggested that sharp decreases in soil moisture occurred at the end of may corresponding to the end of snowmelt and in late june corresponding to peak temperatures rather than drying proceeding uniformly throughout the summer fig 8 b similarly nonlinear drying trends were observed at the weather station tdr profiles fig c 1 3 3 2 model simulations of soil moisture response to landscape change fig 9 a and c shows the results of upscaling the random forest model to the whole icb as shown the resulting soil moisture predictions appear reasonable no unrealistically high vwc values were predicted fig 9 c and the spatial patterns appear realistically correlated and do not display isolated erratic high or low values including in areas of the watershed where no observations were made fig 9 b and d shows an example of modeled difference in vwc between current conditions and fire suppressed conditions specifically this difference is calculated by modeling vwc with contemporary vegetation and fire history and then subtracting modeled vwc using 1970 conditions both the contemporary and 1970 models set the date to mid august and set the year covariate to 2014 effectively using 2014 climate a positive value in fig 9 b indicates that soil moisture is higher under 2014 conditions relative to 1970 at the basin scale minimal differences in spatially averaged surface soil moisture are predicted between the fire suppressed and contemporary conditions changes in mean basin scale vwc 0 02 for any model version dramatic changes however were predicted in the wetness of individual sites under all tested versions of the statistical models burned forest sites that regenerated with dense meadows potentially wetland vegetation increased in predicted summer vwc by as much as 0 31 figs 10 and 9 d variability in the vwc changes at these sites were associated with differences in tpi larger increases in valley bottoms and fire history larger increases following low severity fire relative to high severity fire see fig 11 these large local increases in soil moisture however were offset by widespread minor decreases in soil moisture with the greatest decreases down to 0 24 modeled in locations where conifers encroached on meadows using 2015 or 2016 as the contemporary year instead of 2014 resulted in only small differences in the map and magnitude of change the small magnitude of basin scale change can be attributed to the relatively small changes in vwc estimated for the most common vegetation transitions for example from 1970 to present 55 of the icb s vegetated area was either permanently forested or burned and regrew as conifer forest table 5 burning these areas did not result in large predicted changes in vwc at most these sites increased in vwc by 0 02 or decreased by 0 05 table 5 the largest changes in vwc were associated with vegetation transitions that impacted less than 2 of the basin area table 5 fig 9 d 4 discussion this study set out to determine how the changing fire regime in the icb may have impacted its hydrology by addressing a suite of related questions about soil moisture i was it a useful indicator of ecologically relevant water availability ii was vegetation a valuable proxy for soil moisture spatial variability and iii how did topography and fire history influence soil moisture the combination of field measurements and statistical modeling at icb provides insights into all these topics the study period of 2014 2016 coincided with a period of extended and severe drought in california characterized by both low precipitation and high temperatures dettinger and anderson 2015 griffin and anchukaitis 2014 although the summer of 2016 followed a winter of near average precipitation the sierra nevada was still considered to be in extreme to exceptional drought http www droughtmonitor unl edu our results might be different if we were using measurements from a non drought summer understanding hydrologic dynamics during drought conditions however is disproportionately important since small changes in water availability can have a very large impact during times of water limitation 4 1 is surface soil moisture a useful indicator of ecologically relevant water availability both leaf water potential and continuous soil moisture measurements suggest that surface soil moisture provides a proxy for plant available water or soil profile water storage in the icb fig 3 the relationship between shallow soil moisture and leaf water potentials in plants was variable presumably due to variations in plant morphology subsurface heterogeneity and potentially variable rates of night time transpiration which inhibit equilibration between leaf and root zone water potentials dawson et al 2007 sellin 1999 despite very dry soil conditions measured at some sites plant water potentials remained relatively high this may be related to the availability of non soil water reservoirs for instance conifers in the sierra nevada may obtain as much as a third of their water from fractured rock beneath the developed soil bales et al 2011 royce and barbour 2001 nonetheless our small number of measurements from large deep rooted conifers had the lowest measured leaf water potential in areas with the driest measured surface soil moisture figs 3 a and b 1 strong correlations between surface and deep continuous soil moisture measurements support the value of shallow soil moisture as a proxy for site water availability fig 3 b and c though these correlations vary with time depth and vegetation cover type despite the close relationship between shallow and deeper soil moisture the relationship was non stationary over the summer and the non stationarity varied with vegetation conditions soils at the instrumented wetland site which had been forested prior to 2004 remained saturated at depth all summer while in the forested site summer soil moisture was fairly constant with depth and in the shrubland deeper soils contained twice as much water as shallow soil in the early summer of 2016 fig c 1 these data raise the intriguing prospect that vegetation conversions from forest to shrubland or meadows could increase deep soil moisture stores significantly despite only minor changes being observed in surface soil moisture a prospect consistent with the shallower rooting depth of shrubs grasses relative to mature trees using the weather station data to extrapolate soil moisture changes in the top meter of soil we estimated a 7 increase in mean watershed soil moisture in early summer of 2014 relative to 1970 compared to an estimated 2 drop in shallow soil moisture alone appendix e this extrapolation has high uncertainty given the limited number of deep vwc measurements but illuminates a possibility that deeper soil moisture stores are increasing due to fire regime shifts even in some places where surface soil moisture is not strongly affected the general trends of our results would not change however with those areas that transition from conifer to dense meadow still experiencing the greatest increases in moisture appendix e 4 2 model performance the linear and random forest models gave similar results in terms of covariates influence on vwc as well as the predicted upscaled spatial pattern of soil moisture the model predictions were also stable to the tested variations of model structure or input data treatment using cross validation we found model correlation to test data of approximately 0 81 using random forest and 0 79 using the linear model this was stable across different cross validation exercises undertaken these model fits are strong in comparison to similar statistical models used to predict soil moisture in other studies e g western et al 1999 found model predictions to have ρ 0 78 for vwc on individual days whereas our model has higher ρ and spans a range of dates and are comparable to the performance of remotely sensed soil moisture products e g chan et al 2016 found a mean correlation of 0 78 between time series of satellite derived soil moisture and measured data 4 3 is vegetation a viable proxy for soil moisture vegetation was the strongest predictor of soil moisture status within the icb eclipsing topographic factors the next most important predictors and fire history which are discussed below the importance of vegetation was strongly driven by the large differences in wetness between wetlands and other vegetation types fig 4 as discussed in the introduction we anticipated this strong relationship between moisture and vegetation because multiple feedbacks influence their interactions vegetation changes can alter soil moisture through changes to water and energy balances while soil moisture levels partially determine the type of vegetation which will establish following a disturbance while the causal links between moisture and vegetation cannot be determined via this data analysis the association of different vegetation types and transitions with different soil moisture states holds across the icb providing an avenue for using vegetation change as a proxy albeit an imperfect proxy for hydrologic change 4 4 how did topography and fire history influence soil moisture topography and particularly the topographic wetness index was an important determinant of wetness within vegetation types valley bottoms and other topographically convergent locations as well as higher elevations were associated with higher soil moisture surprisingly south facing slopes had higher soil moisture than north facing slopes once other factors were controlled for however this effect was not strong model results suggested that amongst conifer forests soil moisture was elevated in both unburned areas and high severity burn areas and lower in areas with low moderate severity fire elevated moisture following high severity fire can be explained by reduced evaporating leaf area and plant water demand high moisture in unburned sites could be due to reduced soil evaporation under unburned canopies or it is possible that contemporary unburned sites failed to burn in the first place because of their relatively wet conditions amongst the remaining vegetation classes soil moisture was generally lower in sites with frequent or severe fire histories interpreting the causal influence of fire on water availability is complicated in the icb because moisture availability and topography also determine where fires occur in this basin kane et al 2015 thus low soil moisture in frequently or severely burned sites fig 7 g and h could reflect the effect of vegetation change on soil moisture status or it could reflect the propensity for dry sites to burn more frequently the potential for dry sites to promote burning may also have caused the statistical model to overestimate soil moisture in the unburned 1970 scenario 1 dry fire prone coniferous sites may be very rare within the basin today and thus were not captured in the observations we made after 40 years of managed wildfire 2 unburned or low fire severity conifer sites may have escaped high severity fire due to pre existing wet conditions overall these issues may have biased the estimates of hydrologic change in the basin towards drying 4 5 influences of a changing fire regime on basin hydrology overall the changing fire regime in the icb appears to have impacted the hydrology of the basin but in a highly spatially variable fashion fig 9 large increases in water availability were associated with the 2 of the basin area where burned forests regenerated as meadows other vegetation transitions which occupy a larger proportion of the basin resulted in minor changes in soil moisture the sign of which varied with local topography and fire history table 5 since fire regime induced forest loss occurred over some 20 of the basin boisramé et al 2017b the constrained nature of the wet up is suggestive of the confluence of other topographic fire history or unobserved factors that govern the nature of these vegetation transitions and hydrologic changes there was large variability in soil moisture within vegetation transitions for example some areas where conifer transitioned to dense meadow following fire saw no change in soil moisture while others saw vwc increases up to 0 31 fig 10 this variability was largely driven by topography flat landscapes tpi near zero were sometimes associated with decreased vwc in new dense meadows fig 11 and also experienced the greatest drying from 1970 to the present day under other vegetation transitions not shown the largest modeled increases in vwc occurred in post fire meadows that formed in topographically convergent areas convergent sites however did not always transition to dense meadows following stand replacing fires showing that topography is not a perfect predictor of moisture increases the wet meadow areas sampled were variable in their water sources some appear to be strongly snowpack dependent revealed by wetter conditions in the near average snow year of 2016 compared to extremely low snowpack in 2015 and some appear to be more dependent on summer rainfall drier conditions in 2016 than 2015 mirroring trends in summer rainfall between the years this could be due to variations in water sources ranging from observable sources such as streams to unobservable sources such as springs or seeps ratliff 1985 the diversity of hydrological drivers and responses associated with the sampled meadows is suggestive of a complex suite of processes linking vegetation soil moisture topography and climate lowry et al 2011 rodriguez iturbe et al 2007 all of which can interact with shape and be shaped by shifts in vegetation due to changing fire regimes neary et al 2005 a deeper understanding of subsurface flow processes in icb would allow us to better estimate past soil moisture distributions but at present we are restricted to statistical relationships between soil moisture and surface topography which cannot capture the effects of flows from springs although conifer to dense meadow transitions and the associated increases in water availability are only associated with a small area in the icb these increases in water availability could nonetheless provide important hydrologic refugia for water dependent plants or animals mclaughlin et al 2017 wetlands also sustain summer baseflow in small streams and thus have an impact on downstream ecosystems these transitions from relatively dry forests to wetter meadows may be an example of alternative stable states ridolfi et al 2006 in areas that are prone to high soil water storage due to topography and or subsurface flow paths forests can provide stabilizing feedback if the trees high levels of transpiration maintain groundwater levels low enough for more trees to establish on the other hand wet meadows can remain stable via multiple mechanisms that maintain high water tables which then limit tree establishment fletcher et al 2014 ridolfi et al 2006 a dry period can switch the system from the meadow stable state to the forested stable state by initiating a period of conifer encroachment helms 1987 while fire or some other cause of tree mortality can return a forest to a stable meadow state fletcher et al 2014 in either case the vegetation transition is accompanied by a self reinforcing transition in water storage it is also possible that some of these meadows represent unstable states if water levels are low enough that conifer establishment is not strongly drought dependent frequent disturbances such as fire may be necessary to prevent transitions back to forest helms 1987 either way observed land cover changes boisramé et al 2017b and the moisture changes modeled here suggest that a frequent fire regime is necessary for the long term maintenance of at least some of the wet meadows in the icb and thus the maintenance of associated high subsurface water storage 4 6 future work ongoing observations at the weather stations described here aim to explore how changes in vegetation canopy impact microclimatic conditions and local scale water balance as an initial exploration of how vegetation changes may translate into changes in hydrologic drivers it is possible that water stores in deeper soils or in the unmonitored fractured bedrock have increased due to the change in fire regime future work using hydrologic modeling will explore these possibilities 5 conclusion statistical models of the icb indicate that vegetation can provide a useful proxy for soil moisture availability and thus potentially its changes over time provided that topographic and fire history effects can be controlled for vegetation was the most important predictor of variations in surface soil moisture and surface soil moisture was related to both plant available water and to measures of water availability in the surface 1m of soils thus topographic and vegetation spatial information provided a scaling approach to link site based observations to basin wide soil moisture regimes such an approach is widely applicable to watersheds with variable vegetation cover observable using remote sensing the model results did not indicate large changes in basin averaged surface soil moisture in the icb following restoration of the fire regime individual locations exhibited large increases in soil moisture following fire induced vegetation conversions while much of the remainder of the basin showed no change or weak drying trends the basin scale estimates may be biased towards under estimating the hydrologic impacts of these managed wildfire regime however due to a likely bias towards observing relatively wet contemporary coniferous forests and possibly greater differences in deep soil moisture stores than shallow between vegetation types process hydrologic modeling is being used to further investigate these changes the most dramatic fire related vwc increases shown by statistical models were associated with locations that were forested in 1970 experienced high severity fire and were colonized by dense meadow according to the model most of these areas had elevated soil moisture compared to other forested areas even before burning and became even wetter following the vegetation shift fig 10 based on this result and observations in the field we believe that areas that transition from forest to dense meadow rather than to a more xeric vegetation type following fire have local topography and geology which facilitates high soil moisture storage in these areas such areas may even have been wetlands in the past but in relatively dry years during fire suppressed periods trees were able to colonize helms 1987 norman and taylor 2005 and the high water demand of these trees further reduced the soil moisture once these trees and their high transpiration demand were removed enough water was available for the soil to come closer to saturation making the ground less favorable to tree seedling growth and more favorable for grasses and forbs managed wildfire has wrought large changes in vegetation cover and structure in the icb and these have numerous documented benefits to resilience and ecological health boisramé et al 2017a collins and stephens 2007 ponisio et al 2016 while we do not find evidence of large hydrologic responses to these changes the hydrologic shifts that have occurred are likely to be broadly positive creating ecologically and hydrologically valuable wet summer habitat given the uncertainties associated with the statistical modeling approach taken here further efforts to apply process models to and ultimately improve hydrological monitoring of basins experiencing vegetation change through managed wildfire regimes should remain a research

facility gif berkeley edu appendix a properties of sampling locations our sampling strategy attempted to cover the widest range of geographic variables possible within the icb this attempt was limited by safety and accessibility of many areas of the watershed although we did not sample the steepest parts of the icb as they are prohibitively difficult to access for measurements the steepest areas are mainly rock therefore they have few fires and do not store much soil moisture making them less relevant to our study although our measurement sites do not always cover the full range of variability in physical characteristics the measured span does include the median watershed value for every covariate table a 1 appendix b leaf water potential measurements this appendix presents details of the leaf water potential measurements used to relate surface vwc to root zone soil saturation fig b 1 shows a stronger relationship between water potential measured in psi and surface soil water content in the pre dawn measurements compared to those in the afternoon certain species separate well in the afternoon measurements p jeffreyi has relatively low afternoon leaf water potentials indicating that they are not losing much water to transpiration the salix species on the other hand all have high afternoon leaf water potentials suggesting high levels of transpiration appendix c continuous measurements three temporary weather stations installed in july 2015 monitor temperature relative humidity soil moisture soil temperature wind speed and solar radiation in the icb measurements are recorded every 10 minutes using a campbell scientific cr1000 datalogger http www campbellsci com all three stations are within an area that has burned twice most recently in 2004 one station is in a low severity burn area with an intact mature mixed conifer canopy the other two stations are in nearby burned areas with no mature trees within at least 25m one of these non forested stations is dominated by shrubs and the other is in a wet dense meadow dominated by grasses these stations are located within 200 m of each other in the southwest region of illilouette creek basin at an elevation of approximately 2100 m close to the mean elevation of the forested area within the icb which is 2270 m they are located uphill of the nearest trails and are over 3km from the nearest road and therefore should not be affected by human infrastructure time domain reflectomer tdr probes were installed at three depths ranging from 12 cm to 100 cm at each weather station in order to capture subsurface water storage dynamics fig c 1 soil from three depths within each of the pits dug for these installations was analyzed by the uc davis analytical laboratory for soil texture and percent organic matter anlab ucdavis edu the surface top 10 cm wet meadow soil sample was 13 organic matter all other soil samples consisted of over 87 sand particles and less than 5 organic matter even the deeper wet meadow soils classifying them as loamy sand appendix d model details we tested all covariates for collinearity and found no correlations with absolute value above 0 7 which is a common cutoff to determine if collinearity will impact a model s ability to determine the impact of individual predictors dormann et al 2013 shmueli 2010 we also tested the collinearity of all gridded data used in the model not just locations where we measured and the only high collinearity was between times burned and time since fire correlation coefficient of 0 83 table d 1 even twi and slope which we would expect to be closely related only had a correlation coefficient of 0 25 and upslope area and twi had a correlation coefficient of 0 47 because of these fairly low correlation coefficients we determined that each of these three covariates provided different information to the model and chose to include them all as predictors there were three pairs of numerical non categorical covariates used in the random forest model with correlation above 0 4 in absolute value table d 1 looking at all gridded data used in the model not just locations where we measured the pairwise correlations were not always the same as for our measured locations table d 1 we also found relatively high correlations 0 4 between geographic location given by latitude and longitude and elevation as well as times burned for this reason as well as low statistical significance in initial regression analysis latitude and longitude were not included in the model but this information still shows that there are spatial relationships that govern different covariates there were also correlations between 1970 vegetation and time since fire due to wetland vegetation rarely burning but this is not included in table d 1 as vegetation is categorical rather than a numerical covariate soil moisture changes throughout summer can be highly nonlinear and the changes over summer can be very different in different locations figs c 1 and d 1 for this reason we explored the option of creating separate model fits for early summer prior to july 15 and late summer after july 15 for most model coefficients there were not significant differences between fitting data from the two different time periods fig d 2 a formal definition of partial dependence for random forest models is provided here for clarification define a model f x where x contains p covariates xj with n observations each an individual value within xj is given by x j k j 1 p k 1 n the partial dependence f x j k of an individual covariate value x j k is found by taking the average value of f using the given x j k across all possible values for the other covariates d 1 f x j k 1 n i 1 n f x 1 i x j 1 i x j k x j 1 i x p i calculating f x j k for k 1 n gives a plot of the mean value of f x for a given value of xj or the partial dependence of f on xj appendix e deeper soil moisture the soil moisture data in appendix c suggests that the difference between shallow and deep soil moisture is greater in shrubs and wetlands than it is in closed canopy forests this could mean that soil moisture changes resulting from conifer removal may be greater at depth than in surface soil top 12 cm as a preliminary exercise to test the significance of this we extrapolated the 0 1 m depth averaged soil moisture values from the weather stations to the full watershed using vegetation maps we assumed that the relationship between shallow and deep soil moisture fits a separate linear equation for each vegetation type mean vwc over top 1 m c 1 v c 2 v mean vwc over top 12 cm where c 1 v and c 2 v are coefficients unique to each vegetation type v the stationarity of these coefficients over time and space cannot be verified given the limited number of deep vwc measurements available however further work using additional buried sensors and or hydrologic models may validate this estimate using summer soil moisture data from the three weather stations we calculated the coefficients given in table e 1 applying the appropriate linear equation to the surface soil moisture estimates in each grid cell of our basin scale model gives an estimated 1 meter averaged soil moisture value we used the coefficients for shrub to estimate soil moisture for sparse meadows under the assumption that sparse meadows and shrublands both have relatively shallow rooted vegetation and that sparse meadow moisture regimes are likely more similar to shrublands than they are to wet meadows the results of this exercise showed a 7 increase in soil moisture across the whole watershed under 2014 conditions compared to if the watershed had remained fire suppressed for comparison the model of surface soil moisture showed a 2 decrease in surface soil moisture averaged across the basin this increase in mean soil moisture for the top meter is mainly driven by a large increase in deep soil moisture under the drier dense meadows fig e 1 a compared to the smaller increases in surface soil moisture alone for the same vegetation transitions fig e 2 a there are also slight increases in soil moisture over the top meter when transitioning from conifer to shrubs or sparse meadow fig e 1 b and c with the largest changes occurring in areas that were already at the wetter end of the range for comparison surface soil moisture was predicted to change very little or slightly decrease under transitions from conifer to shrubs or sparse meadows fig e 2 b and c because we only have one location with deep soil moisture measurements under each vegetation type these estimates of change in deeper soil moisture are highly uncertain however this analysis does illustrate the possibility that transitions from conifer to other vegetation types could increase total soil water stores to a greater degree than is observed using surface soil moisture alone 
879,subsurface co2 injection and storage alters formation pressure changes of pore pressure may result in fault reactivation and hydraulic fracturing if the pressure exceeds the corresponding thresholds most simulation models predict such thresholds utilizing relatively homogeneous reservoir rock models and do not account for co2 dissolution in the brine phase to calculate pore pressure evolution this study presents an estimation of reservoir capacity in terms of allowable injection volume and rate utilizing the frio co2 injection site in the coast of the gulf of mexico as a case study the work includes laboratory core testing well logging data analyses and reservoir numerical simulation we built a fine scale reservoir model of the frio pilot test in our in house reservoir simulator ipars integrated parallel accurate reservoir simulator we first performed history matching of the pressure transient data of the frio pilot test and then used this history matched reservoir model to investigate the effect of the co2 dissolution into brine and predict the implications of larger co2 injection volumes our simulation results including co2 dissolution exhibited 33 lower pressure build up relative to the simulation excluding dissolution capillary heterogeneity helps spread the co2 plume and facilitate early breakthrough formation expansivity helps alleviate pore pressure build up simulation results suggest that the injection schedule adopted during the actual pilot test very likely did not affect the mechanical integrity of the storage complex fault reactivation requires injection volumes of at least about sixty times larger than the actual injected volume at the same injection rate hydraulic fracturing necessitates much larger injection rates than the ones used in the frio pilot test tested rock samples exhibit ductile deformation at in situ effective stresses hence we do not expect an increase of fault permeability in the frio sand even

owen et al 1987 the frio co2 injection pilot project injected about 1600 metric tons of co2 in unconsolidated sands of the frio formation at a location near dayton texas the first injection test targeted the upper frio formation frio c brine bearing oligocene age sand in a fault bounded formation hovorka et al 2004 the formation is adjacent to a salt dome and is located below the highly

2006 doughty et al 2008 the purpose of this study is to investigate pore pressure build up induced by co2 injection in heterogeneous and compartmentalized poorly consolidated sands we utilize the frio co2 project as a case study the paper starts with a description of the reservoir model petrophysical and geomechanical properties based on laboratory experiments and well logging analyses and the compositional phase behavior model then we show the results of history matching for the actual injection schedule and extend conclusions for larger injection volumes and rates we conclude with an evaluation of expected geomechanical perturbations and limits for injection volumes and rates based on the current in situ state of stress and compartmentalization assumption 2 frio i reservoir model 2 1 reservoir geometry boundary conditions and simulation grid the detailed area of study das is a subdomain of interest in the larger frio reservoir which includes injection and observation wells the das boundaries are determined by faults and a salt dome north east of the reservoir fig 1 a the reservoir dips 16 towards the south west we adopted no flow boundary conditions for all four boundaries because reservoirs and aquifers in these relatively ductile formations tend to be compartmentalized the lower end of the reservoir is idealized as an elongated section of 12 km long enough to satisfy history matching under the assumption of compartmentalization fig 1 b fault 2 and 3 are represented by low permeability planes embedded in the middle of the das area all four faults are normal faults having same strike about n45 e but with different dip angles as interpreted from seismic images and earlier developed models hovorka et al 2006 table 1 the total thickness of the model is 30 m 100 ft evenly divided into 50 grid blocks of 0 6 m 2 ft perpendicular to bedding in the x direction parallel to the bedding plane the model is divided into 78 grid blocks in the y direction 853 m and 71 grid blocks in the z direction 12 192 m the injection zone approximately 49 m by 61 m 160 ft by 200 ft is refined parallel to the bedding y and z directions with 1 5 m 5 ft grid blocks and the surrounding

porosity and permeability experimental measurements as well as well logging analysis data courtesy of the gccc provided petrophysical properties and geomechanical properties for populating the reservoir model the well logging data analysis is used to calculate porosity and permeability from data spaced every 0 15 m 0 5 ft we corrected measured neutron porosity ϕ n and density porosity ϕ d

k fig 2 ghomian 2008 fig 3 shows the resulting corrected porosity and permeability including layers above and below the injection zone reservoir properties were averaged arithmetically from the calculated data namely the grid block spatial scale is 0 6 m 2 ft see fig 3 a and b for interpolated values of porosity and permeability we adjusted the ratio between vertical and horizontal permeabilities to 1 3 in order to achieve history matching in the pressure response hovorka et al 2006 applied 1 10 for the reservoir permeability anisotropy ratio however our fine vertical discretization of 0 6 m 2 ft allows us to handle directly vertical heterogeneity frio c sandstone core photos and ct images exhibit weak lamination in the perforation interval 1543 2 1548 4 m 5053 5070 ft strong laminations appear below the perforation depth at a scale of less than 2 cm we did not account for variation of permeability and porosity in horizontal direction because of limited information available just from one well 2 2 2 capillary pressure and relative permeability capillary pressure measurements from micp tests of 10 cores from frio sand suggest that the layered

pressure and relative permeability as shown in fig 4 c 2 2 3 geomechanical properties we conducted a multistage deviatoric loading test to evaluate formation compressibility strength and post peak failure behavior of the frio c sand the multistage loading consisted of increasing deviatoric stress at three different constant confining stresses 3 4 mpa 500 psi 6 9 mpa 1000 psi and 10 3 mpa 1500 psi fig 5 a during the first two loading stages the sample was loaded until the onset of dilative behavior by increasing deviatoric stress fig 5 c the last loading stage went into shear yield the sand resulting friction angle is about 38 and the cohesive strength is zero fig 5 d the sand undergoes ductile deformation at peak stress the formation compressibility is estimated separately in section 2 2 5 at the reservoir stress condition calculated in section 2 2 4 2 2 4 in situ stresses we estimated the magnitude and direction of principal stresses using an overburden total vertical stress gradient of 20 5 mpa km 0 907 psi ft hovorka et al 2003 and considered the effect of the rising salt dome on dome hoop stresses minimum principal stress oriented in circumferential direction nikolinakou et al 2014 we assumed limit frictional equilibrium in the sand unit zoback 2007 a friction angle for frio sand from section 2 2 and a normal faulting regime from the seismic interpretation

pp was 14 8 mpa 2153 psi and calculated sv is 31 6 mpa 4580 4 psi using ϕ 38 fig 5 d eq 9 provides a lower bound estimate of minimum principal total stress equal to 18 8 mpa 2734 psi stress anisotropy may decrease with time due to visco elastic stress relaxation sone and zoback 2014a 2014b we utilize the calculated minimum horizontal stress and vertical stress to estimate the possibility of fault reactivation and fracture opening upon pore pressure change but did not intend to calculate the intermediate stress shmax hovorka et al 2003 calculated formation fracture pressure equal to 26 6 mpa

strain condition usually more appropriate for reservoir stress paths tends to be larger than the bulk compressibility dudley et al 2016 the model assumes constant formation compressibility throughout the reservoir 2 3 reservoir simulator 2 3 1 simulation methodology the compositional flow model in ipars uses the peng robinson cubic equation of state pr eos for describing fluid phase behavior the conservation equations for each component eqs 12 13 are discretized in time using the backward euler scheme resulting in a fully implicit system in pressure and concentration unknowns a lowest order mixed finite element method equivalent to cell centered finite differences was used for the spatial discretization the component concentration equations can be written as 12 t ϕ n i f i α ϕ s α d i α

using the rachford rice equation rachford rice 1952 and isofugacity criteria further details regarding the compositional flow formulation phase behavior model and numerical solution scheme can be found in singh and wheeler 2016 ipars compositional flow module has been used extensively for evaluating various sequestration and gas injection scenarios delshad et al 2011 kong et al 2015 although the pr eos is developed for non polar molecules such as hydrocarbons ipars allows water phase properties to be calculated using pr eos this is achieved by modifying the binary interaction parameters bip for the components in this study we used two components co2 and brine and tuned the bips of the pr eos to match experimentally observed solubility of co2 in brine table 5 shows the eos parameters used in this study the calculations further assume co2 and brine as chemical components wherein the co2 component can exist in both gaseous and aqueous phases the brine component is considered to exist only in the liquid phase we considered two approaches for studying co2 migration discussed in detail in section 3 4 the partially miscible case uses pr eos for calculating both gas and aqueous phase properties the immiscible case uses pr eos and slightly compressible approach for gas and aqueous phase respectively a tensor product refinement was used to better capture changes in the das where the injection and observation wells are located this approach is especially useful when limited amount of reservoir properties are available from well logs seismic observations and geological models for detailed calculation near the injector although the numerical simulation model used tensor product refinements current ipars capabilities allow computationally efficient local adaptive mesh refinement for long term evaluation of multiple sequestration scenarios 2 3 2 simulation description reservoir simulation included various cases table 6 baseline scenario history match case bc partially miscible immiscible flooding case to compare with baseline scenario im and sensitivity analysis cases varying injection rates ir both partially miscible and immiscible we performed history matching with the model described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 the initial pressure was determined using equilibrium calculation as a preprocessing step the binary interaction coefficient for brine and co2 b i c h 2 o c o 2 interaction was evaluated according to the relationship introduced by kong et al 2013 14 b i c h 2 o c o 2 0 093625 4 861 10 4 t 113 2 29 10 7 s where t is temperature f and s is salinity ppm the binary coefficient was calcualted to be 0 06212 at a reservoir temperature of 134 f 56 7 c and brine salinity of 93 000 ppm we assumed constant reservoir temperature in simulations the objective of co2 injection simulations was to quantify the maximum injection volume required for the fluid pressure to reactivate faults or fracture the injector we examined the effect of co2 solubility on pore pressure build up computing the immiscible and miscible scenarios described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 history match fig 6 shows history matching of pressure responses for four injection cycles in the base case including injection and shut in periods for both the injection and observation wells the pressure response in the first injection cycle does not coincide with simulation results this peak might have occurred due to effects of formation damage or near wellbore perforation complexity the co2 breakthrough time predicted by the numerical simulation was 2 3 days compared to 2 1 days observed in the field fig 7 shows snapshots of the co2 plume migration up to 60 days after injection the co2 plume moves toward the observation well due to buoyancy but does not cross low permeability layers fig 7 a shows the total co2 concentration co2 lb mol pore volume ft3 in both gas phase and dissolved phase while fig 7 b shows co2 saturation of the gas phase only bulk supercritical co2 initially the two figures show similar co2 saturation distribution since the co2 has not dissolved extensively into brine yet after 30 days of the injection the difference between figs 7 a and b demonstrates a considerable amount of dissolved co2 around injection zone approximately 50 3 2 injection rate to induce fault reactivation this section applied results of reservoir simulation to determine critical pore pressures and injection rates for fault reactivation the principal stresses at each fault are calculated as a function of depth table 1 and fig 8 the stress tensor in geographical coordinates sg is obtained by applying a transformation matrix r1 to the principal stress tensor 15 s g r 1 t s r 1 r 1 t s 1 0 0 0 s 2 0 0 0 s 3 r 1 where 16 r 1 cos a cos b sin a cos b sin b cos a sin b sin c sin a cos c sin a sin b sin c cos a cos c cos b sin c cos a sin b cos c sin a sin c sin a sin b cos c cos a sin c cos b cos c and euler rotation angles a 44 85 b 90 and c 0 for the location shown in fig 1 zoback 2007 then we calculate the magnitudes of shear stress τ and normal stress sn on the fault plane from the projection of sg using the respective fault strikes and dip transformation vectors nn and nd function of fault strike str and dip 17 τ s g n n t n d s g sin s t r sin d i p cos s t r sin d i p cos d i p t sin s t r cos d i p cos s t r c o s d i

initial pore and stress before injection and calculated following procedure in section 2 2 4 and at fault reactivation the values of principal stresses change depending on the depth the mohr circles are close to the failure criterion and represent the state of stress in the sand layer the failure line represents the yield limit of the entire fault across several layers fault reactivation requires τ σn μ at prescribed fault orientation fluid injection and decrease of effective stresses may cause shearing in the sand interval but not necessarily fault reactivation along the entire fracture plane that connects sand and shale intervals we adopted this simplification to account for fault orientation in the analysis fig 9 shows the maximum amount of co2 injection without causing fault reactivation as a function of injection rate the maximum cumulative amount of co2 injection is about 100 000 tons and the amount depends on injection rate through a power law relationship the first location of fault reactivation is fault 2 for all injection rate cases table 7 extremely high injection rates over 10 000 tons day may fracture the well before causing fault reactivation overall the results indicate that the first frio pilot test injected less than 1 6 of the maximum possible amount of co2 storage without perturbing faults fig 9 assumption of negligible rock compressibility results in a reduction of storage capacity by a factor of ten these values are provided as an illustrative comparison for compartmentalized reservoirs in formations near the limit of stress equilibrium actual predictions need to measure in situ stress magnitude and orientation and should account for flow boundary conditions that may allow for leaks at faults tertiary unconsolidated sands and mudrocks at frio do not exhibit brittle deformation during shearing fig 5 a shows strain hardening behavior of frio sand at in situ effective stresses large induced seismicity events and failure localization and local increases in permeability are less likely to occur in geological formations that sustain large plastic strains at yield 3 3 injection rate to induce open mode fractures fig 9 summarizes simulation results showing the maximum amounts of co2 injection needed to fracture the injection well assuming that bottom hole pressure reaches the initial minimum principal stress no poroelastic effects and zero fault leakage upon reactivation if faults allow for leaks then an open mode fracture may not develop due to the pore pressure control at faults based on the results continuing injection of co2 at lower injection rates below 10 000 tons per day may cause fault reactivation first rather than an open mode fracture once the fault reactivates the reservoir may not be compartmentalized anymore and an open mode fracture may not occur at all injection rates above 10 000 tons per day can cause hydraulic fracturing before fault reactivation and are not affected by domain size because of the sharp pressure gradient developed around the injection wellbore table 7 hovorka et al 2003 suggested a maximum injection rate of 250 tons per day injection pressure and rate used at the first frio pilot test seems to be significantly below thresholds for developing open mode fractures 3 4 pore pressure reduction due to co2 dissolution into brine the immiscible two phase fluid flow simulation simulation im shows 75 9 kpa 11 psi higher pressure response compared to compositional simulation simulation bc due to no dissolution of co2 into the brine fig 6 the amount of dissolved co2 in simulation bc increases with time as the plume spreads in the brine saturated reservoir the binary interaction coefficient one of the key parameters for co2 solubility in brine has large effects on the pore pressure for a given injection scenario at the end of injection approximately 20 of the co2 was dissolved in the brine after 20 days of the end of injection 44 of the injected co2 was dissolved into the brine and eventually 91 of the co2 was dissolved after 95 days in the entire reservoir i e just 9 of injected co2 remained in bulk phase co2 solubility in frio brine is about 1 6 mol l fig 7 the co2 plume in immiscible simulations im is thinner and moves faster than in the history match simulation bc results indicate that co2 dissolution contributes a fair proportion to trapping for small co2 injection volumes co2 dissolution in the brine phase alleviates pore pressure build up and extends injection times without affecting mechanical stability compared to the immiscible case fig 9 based on simulation with extended range of injection rate and volume we predict that injection could have been carried out for an additional 200 days at 260 tons per day the amount of co2 injection considering dissolution is 20 to 60 higher than the amount assuming immiscible conditions for various injection rates the effect of dissolution on pore pressure build up is stronger in rocks with low pore compressibility 3 5 pore pressure reduction due rock volumetric deformation formation compressibility cr is one of the key mechanical properties determining pore pressure build up in compartmentalized reservoirs non zero formation compressibility or expansivity allows pore space expansion and relieves the pore pressure build up at the injection well zero formation compressibility results in a steady increase of wellbore pressure for rate specified injection well in fact the pressure build up is twice for zero formation compressibility compared to the field observations at both injection and observation wells our simulation results show flattening pressure transient curve during constant injection rate using the formation compressibility estimated from the laboratory accurate compressibility calculations are critically important to reduce uncertainty in predictions of pore pressure buildup and potential geomechanical events 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the geomechanical implications of injecting co2 in a fault bounded reservoir comprised by tertiary sediments we used the frio pilot co2 sequestration project as a case study and matched field data we also predicted long term storage feasibility by means of numerical simulation the history matched simulation was used as the base case to conduct injection rate sensitivity studies in order to predict thresholds for geomechanical perturbations simulations results show that the history matched simulation shows a considerable amount of dissolved co2 in brine for a hundred days after the injection was completed co2 dissolution into brine reduce tens of psi pore pressure build up and result in 91 trapping after 95 days for an injection of 1600 tons of co2 in the first frio pilot project simulations using a large range of injection rates show that fault reactivation is likely to occur after the injection of about 100 000 tons assuming perfect compartmentalization sixty times of the amount injected at the first frio pilot project the actual amount of injection for fault reactivation would depend on accurately determined in situ stresses and flow boundary conditions storage volume decreases with injection rate following a power law relationship high reservoir permeability high formation compressibility and low co2 viscosity render hydraulic fracturing of the injector unlikely pore pressure build up transfers quickly to neighboring faults for injection rates smaller than 10 000 tons day the deformational behavior of the tested unconsolidated sediments at yield shear stresses tends to be ductile rather than brittle and may not create significant seismic events or localize channels of high permeability upon fault reactivation future works

879,subsurface co2 injection and storage alters formation pressure changes of pore pressure may result in fault reactivation and hydraulic fracturing if the pressure exceeds the corresponding thresholds most simulation models predict such thresholds utilizing relatively homogeneous reservoir rock models and do not account for co2 dissolution in the brine phase to calculate pore pressure

study the work includes laboratory core testing well logging data analyses and reservoir numerical simulation we built a fine scale reservoir model of the frio pilot test in our in house reservoir simulator ipars integrated parallel accurate reservoir simulator we first performed history matching of the pressure transient data of the frio pilot test and then used this history matched reservoir model to investigate the effect of the co2 dissolution into brine and predict the implications of larger co2 injection volumes our simulation results including co2 dissolution exhibited 33 lower pressure build up relative to the simulation excluding dissolution capillary heterogeneity helps spread the co2 plume and facilitate early breakthrough formation expansivity helps alleviate pore pressure build up simulation results suggest that the injection schedule adopted during the actual pilot test very likely did not affect the mechanical integrity of the storage complex fault reactivation requires injection volumes of at least about sixty times larger than the actual injected volume at the same injection rate hydraulic fracturing necessitates much larger injection rates than the ones used in the frio pilot test tested rock samples exhibit ductile deformation at in situ effective stresses hence we do not expect an increase of fault permeability in the frio sand even

a formation 110 m 360 ft below the first project injection zone at the same injection rate monitoring devices did not detect leakage nor induced seismicity from the frio injection tests hovorka et al 2006 doughty et al 2008 the purpose of this study is to investigate pore pressure build up induced by co2 injection in heterogeneous and compartmentalized poorly consolidated sands we utilize the frio co2 project as a case study the paper starts with a description of the reservoir model petrophysical and geomechanical properties based on laboratory experiments and well logging analyses and the

frio c sandstone and in situ stresses frio c sand is composed of subarkosic fine grained moderately sorted quartz and feldspar sand grains with minor amounts of illite smectite and calcite kharaka et

calculated data namely the grid block spatial scale is 0 6 m 2 ft see fig 3 a and b for interpolated values of porosity and permeability we adjusted the ratio between vertical and horizontal permeabilities to 1 3 in order to achieve history matching in the pressure response hovorka et al 2006 applied 1 10 for the reservoir permeability anisotropy ratio however our fine vertical discretization of 0 6 m 2 ft allows us to handle directly vertical heterogeneity frio c sandstone core photos and ct images exhibit weak lamination in the perforation interval 1543 2 1548 4 m 5053 5070 ft strong laminations appear below the perforation depth at a scale of less than 2 cm we did not account for variation of permeability and porosity in horizontal direction because of limited information available just from one well 2 2 2 capillary pressure and relative permeability capillary pressure measurements from micp tests of 10 cores from frio sand suggest that the layered

pressure and relative permeability as shown in fig 4 c 2 2 3 geomechanical properties we conducted a multistage deviatoric loading test to evaluate formation compressibility strength and post peak failure behavior of the frio c sand the multistage loading consisted of increasing deviatoric stress at three different constant confining stresses 3 4 mpa 500 psi 6 9 mpa 1000 psi and 10 3 mpa 1500 psi fig 5 a during the first two loading stages the sample was loaded until the onset of dilative behavior by increasing deviatoric stress fig 5 c the last loading stage went into shear yield the sand resulting friction angle is about 38 and the cohesive strength is zero fig 5 d the sand undergoes ductile deformation at peak stress the formation compressibility is estimated separately in section 2 2 5 at the reservoir stress condition calculated in section 2 2 4 2 2 4 in situ stresses we estimated the magnitude and direction of principal stresses using an overburden total vertical stress gradient of 20 5 mpa km 0 907 psi ft hovorka et al 2003 and considered the effect of the rising salt dome on dome hoop stresses minimum principal stress oriented in circumferential direction nikolinakou et al 2014 we assumed limit frictional equilibrium in the sand unit zoback 2007 a friction angle for frio sand from section 2 2 and a normal faulting regime from the seismic interpretation

pp was 14 8 mpa 2153 psi and calculated sv is 31 6 mpa 4580 4 psi using ϕ 38 fig 5 d eq 9 provides a lower bound estimate of minimum principal total stress equal to 18 8 mpa 2734 psi stress anisotropy may decrease with time due to visco elastic stress relaxation sone and zoback 2014a 2014b we utilize the calculated minimum horizontal stress and vertical stress to estimate the possibility of fault reactivation and fracture opening upon pore pressure change but did not intend to calculate the intermediate stress shmax hovorka et al 2003 calculated formation fracture pressure equal to 26 6 mpa

frio v1 sample fig 5 c we measure unloading compressibility because co2 injection causes a decrease of effective stress the unloading formation compressibility at 8 25 mpa of confining pressure equal

δ v p δ p p δ ɛ v o l δ p c 1 ϕ the measured value is similar to the rock pore compressibility estimation of frio east texas reported by carpenter and spencer 1940 the compressibility for uni axial strain condition usually more appropriate for reservoir stress paths tends to be larger than the bulk compressibility dudley et al 2016 the model assumes constant formation compressibility throughout the reservoir 2 3 reservoir simulator 2 3 1 simulation methodology the compositional flow model in ipars uses the peng robinson cubic equation of state pr eos for describing fluid phase behavior the conservation equations for each component eqs 12 13 are discretized in time using the backward euler scheme resulting in a fully implicit system in pressure and concentration unknowns a lowest order mixed finite element method equivalent to cell centered finite differences was used for the spatial discretization the component concentration equations can be written as 12 t ϕ n i f i α ϕ s α d i α

using the rachford rice equation rachford rice 1952 and isofugacity criteria further details regarding the compositional flow formulation phase behavior model and numerical solution scheme can be found in singh and wheeler 2016 ipars compositional flow module has been used extensively for evaluating various sequestration and gas injection scenarios delshad et al 2011 kong et al 2015 although the pr eos is developed for non polar molecules such as hydrocarbons ipars allows water phase properties to be calculated using pr eos this is achieved by modifying the binary interaction parameters bip for the components in this study we used two components co2 and brine and tuned the bips of the pr eos to match experimentally observed solubility of co2 in brine table 5 shows the eos parameters used in this study the calculations further assume co2 and brine as chemical components wherein the co2 component can exist in both gaseous and aqueous phases the brine component is considered to exist only in the liquid phase we considered two approaches for studying co2 migration discussed in detail in section 3 4 the partially miscible case uses pr eos for calculating both gas and aqueous phase properties the immiscible case uses pr eos and slightly compressible approach for gas and aqueous phase respectively a tensor product refinement was used to better capture changes in the das where the injection and observation wells are located this approach is especially useful when limited amount of reservoir properties are available from well logs seismic observations and geological models for detailed calculation near the injector although the numerical simulation model used tensor product refinements current ipars capabilities allow computationally efficient local adaptive mesh refinement for long term evaluation of multiple sequestration scenarios 2 3 2 simulation description reservoir simulation included various cases table 6 baseline scenario history match case bc partially miscible immiscible flooding case to compare with baseline scenario im and sensitivity analysis cases varying injection rates ir both partially miscible and immiscible we performed history matching with the model described in sections 2 1 and 2 2 the initial pressure was determined using equilibrium calculation as a preprocessing step the binary interaction coefficient for brine and co2 b i c h 2 o c o 2 interaction was evaluated according to the relationship introduced by kong et al 2013 14 b i c h 2 o c o 2 0 093625 4 861 10 4 t 113 2 29 10 7 s where t is temperature f and s is salinity ppm the binary coefficient was calcualted to be 0 06212 at a reservoir temperature of 134 f 56 7 c and brine salinity of 93 000 ppm we assumed constant reservoir temperature in simulations the objective of co2 injection simulations was to quantify the maximum injection volume required for the fluid pressure to reactivate faults or fracture the injector we examined the effect of co2 solubility on pore pressure build up computing the immiscible and miscible scenarios described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 history match fig 6 shows history matching of pressure responses for four injection cycles in the base case including injection and shut in periods for both the injection and observation wells the pressure response in the first injection cycle does not coincide with simulation results this peak might have occurred due to effects of formation damage or near wellbore perforation complexity the co2 breakthrough time predicted by the numerical simulation was 2 3 days compared to 2 1 days observed in the field fig 7 shows snapshots of the co2 plume migration up to 60 days after injection the co2 plume moves toward the observation well due to buoyancy but does not cross low permeability layers fig 7 a shows the total co2 concentration co2 lb mol pore volume ft3 in both gas phase and dissolved phase while fig 7 b shows co2 saturation of the gas phase only bulk supercritical co2 initially the two figures show similar co2 saturation distribution since the co2 has not dissolved extensively into brine yet after 30 days of the injection the difference between figs 7 a and b demonstrates a considerable amount of dissolved co2 around injection zone approximately 50 3 2 injection rate to induce fault reactivation this section applied results of reservoir simulation to determine critical pore pressures and injection rates for fault reactivation the principal stresses at each fault are calculated as a function of depth table 1 and fig 8 the stress tensor in geographical coordinates sg is obtained by applying a transformation matrix r1 to the principal stress tensor 15 s g r 1 t s r 1 r 1 t s 1 0 0 0 s 2 0 0 0 s 3 r 1 where 16 r 1 cos a cos b sin a cos b sin b cos a sin b sin c sin a cos c sin a sin b sin c cos a cos c cos b sin c cos a sin b cos c sin a sin c sin a sin b cos c cos a sin c cos b cos c and euler rotation angles a 44 85 b 90 and c 0 for the location shown in fig 1 zoback 2007 then we calculate the magnitudes of shear stress τ and normal stress sn on the fault plane from the projection of sg using the respective fault strikes and dip transformation vectors nn and nd function of fault strike str and dip 17 τ s g n n t n d s g sin s t r sin d i p cos s t r sin d i p cos d i p t sin s t r cos d i p cos s t r c o s d i

initial pore and stress before injection and calculated following procedure in section 2 2 4 and at fault reactivation the values of principal stresses change depending on the depth the mohr circles are close to the failure criterion and represent the state of stress in the sand layer the failure line represents the yield limit of the entire fault across several layers fault reactivation requires τ σn μ at prescribed fault orientation fluid injection and decrease of effective stresses may cause shearing in the sand interval but not necessarily fault reactivation along the entire fracture plane that connects sand and shale intervals we adopted this simplification to account for fault orientation in the analysis fig 9 shows the maximum amount of co2 injection without causing fault reactivation as a function of injection rate the maximum cumulative amount of co2 injection is about 100 000 tons and the amount depends on injection rate through a power law relationship the first location of fault reactivation is fault 2 for all injection rate cases table 7 extremely high injection rates over 10 000 tons day may fracture the well before causing fault reactivation overall the results indicate that the first frio pilot test injected less than 1 6 of the maximum possible amount of co2 storage without perturbing faults fig 9 assumption of negligible rock compressibility results in a reduction of storage capacity by a factor of ten these values are provided as an illustrative comparison for compartmentalized reservoirs in formations near the limit of stress equilibrium actual predictions need to measure in situ stress magnitude and orientation and should account for flow boundary conditions that may allow for leaks at faults tertiary unconsolidated sands and mudrocks at frio do not exhibit brittle deformation during shearing fig 5 a shows strain hardening behavior of frio sand at in situ effective stresses large induced seismicity events and failure localization and local increases in permeability are less likely to occur in geological formations that sustain large plastic strains at yield 3 3 injection rate to induce open mode fractures fig 9 summarizes simulation results showing the maximum amounts of co2 injection needed to fracture the injection well assuming that bottom hole pressure reaches the initial minimum principal stress no poroelastic effects and zero fault leakage upon reactivation if faults allow for leaks then an open mode fracture may not develop due to the pore pressure control at faults based on the results continuing injection of co2 at lower injection rates below 10 000 tons per day may cause fault reactivation first rather than an open mode fracture once the fault reactivates the reservoir may not be compartmentalized anymore and an open mode fracture may not occur at all injection rates above 10 000 tons per day can cause hydraulic fracturing before fault reactivation and are not affected by domain size because of the sharp pressure gradient developed around the injection wellbore table 7 hovorka et al 2003 suggested a maximum injection rate of 250 tons per day injection pressure and rate used at the first frio pilot test seems to be significantly below thresholds for developing open mode fractures 3 4 pore pressure reduction due to co2 dissolution into brine the immiscible two phase fluid flow simulation simulation im shows 75 9 kpa 11 psi higher pressure response compared to compositional simulation simulation bc due to no dissolution of co2 into the brine fig 6 the amount of dissolved co2 in simulation bc increases with time as the plume spreads in the brine saturated reservoir the binary interaction coefficient one of the key parameters for co2 solubility in brine has large effects on the pore pressure for a given injection scenario at the end of injection approximately 20 of the co2 was dissolved in the brine after 20 days of the end of injection 44 of the injected co2 was dissolved into the brine and eventually 91 of the co2 was dissolved after 95 days in the entire reservoir i e just 9 of injected co2 remained in bulk phase co2 solubility in frio brine is about 1 6 mol l fig 7 the co2 plume in immiscible simulations im is thinner and moves faster than in the history match simulation bc results indicate that co2 dissolution contributes a fair proportion to trapping for small co2 injection volumes co2 dissolution in the brine phase alleviates pore pressure build up and extends injection times without affecting mechanical stability compared to the immiscible case fig 9 based on simulation with extended range of injection rate and volume we predict that injection could have been carried out for an additional 200 days at 260 tons per day the amount of co2 injection considering dissolution is 20 to 60 higher than the amount assuming immiscible conditions for various injection rates the effect of dissolution on pore pressure build up is stronger in rocks with low pore compressibility 3 5 pore pressure reduction due rock volumetric deformation formation compressibility cr is one of the key mechanical properties determining pore pressure build up in compartmentalized reservoirs non zero formation compressibility or expansivity allows pore space expansion and relieves the pore pressure build up at the injection well zero formation compressibility results in a steady increase of wellbore pressure for rate specified injection well in fact the pressure build up is twice for zero formation compressibility compared to the field observations at both injection and observation wells our simulation results show flattening pressure transient curve during constant injection rate using the formation compressibility estimated from the laboratory accurate compressibility calculations are critically important to reduce uncertainty in predictions of pore pressure buildup and potential geomechanical events 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the geomechanical implications of injecting co2 in a fault bounded reservoir comprised by tertiary sediments we used the frio pilot co2 sequestration project as a case study and matched field data we also predicted long term storage feasibility by means of numerical simulation the history matched simulation was used as the base case to conduct injection rate sensitivity studies in order to predict thresholds for geomechanical perturbations simulations results show that the history matched simulation shows a considerable amount of dissolved co2 in brine for a hundred days after the injection was completed co2 dissolution into brine reduce tens of psi pore pressure build up and result in 91 trapping after 95 days for an injection of 1600 tons of co2 in the first frio pilot project simulations using a large range of injection rates show that fault reactivation is likely to occur after the injection of about 100 000 tons assuming perfect compartmentalization sixty times of the amount injected at the first frio pilot project the actual amount of injection for fault reactivation would depend on accurately determined in situ stresses and flow boundary conditions storage volume decreases with injection rate following a power law relationship high reservoir permeability high formation compressibility and low co2 viscosity render hydraulic fracturing of the injector unlikely pore pressure build up transfers quickly to neighboring faults for injection rates smaller than 10 000 tons day the deformational behavior of the tested unconsolidated sediments at yield shear stresses tends to be ductile rather than brittle and may not create significant seismic events or localize channels of high permeability upon fault reactivation future works
