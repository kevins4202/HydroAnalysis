12815,the combined application of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and magnetic coagulation mc is a new method of enhancing nitrogen and phosphorus removal of wastewater treatment plants with limited land occupation this had been successfully used in a full scale 30 000 m3 d wastewater treatment plant in guangdong province china the effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n total phosphorus tp and suspended solid ss stabilized at 11 6 3 9 1 4 1 3 0 28 0 11 and 2 2 1 2 mg l when the corresponding influent concentrations were 81 7 27 5 15 2 3 0 1 40 0 29 and 42 19 mg l respectively which could steadily meet the designed discharge standard even though the land occupation was merely at 2000 m2 regarding the mbbr effluent the mc process sufficiently removed residual ss tp and some cod within 3 min of sedimentation which ensured that the discharge reached the designed standard the relative abundance of nitrifying genera of the secondary mbbr was higher than that of the primary mbbr leading to a greater nh4 n removal ability for the secondary mbbr meanwhile the primary mbbr was superior to the secondary mbbr in terms of organic matter removal the suspended carrier was more competent in enriching nitrifiers than the activated sludge highlighting the significant advantage of mbbr however the suspended carrier was insufficient in enriching phosphorus removal bacteria as compared with the activated sludge leading to a poor biological tp removal efficiency of the mbbr process further research is needed to improve the biological phosphorus removal ability of mbbr graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords moving bed biofilm reactor magnetic coagulation combined application full scale nitrifying genera 1 introduction with the rapid economic development in china water quality requirements have become more stringent over the last decades at present most existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china use the conventional activated sludge cas process as a secondary bioprocess in removing pollutants and nutrients 1 however with increasingly restrictive measures concerning wastewater treatment the existing activated sludge plants are overloaded and do not comply with the limits indicated by chinese legislation meanwhile with the consumption of construction land and the rise in land prices land shortage has become a typical factor that hampers the construction of wwtps in china given the above conditions developing highly efficient and land saving sewage treatment processes is necessary in this regard the use of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr as an upgrading process of activated sludge has attracted great attention and has been widely applied in the wastewater treatment industry across the world 2 3 in the absence of activated sludge the performance of mbbr completely depends on the operation of plastic biofilm carriers where biofilms can attach mbbr has the following advantages over the cas system and fixed biomass systems 4 6 no clogging cost effectiveness low sludge production low head loss and high efficiency under extreme conditions these stable performance characteristics make mbbr suitable for the new construction and retrofitting of existing wwtps mbbrs are used in high loading wastewater treatment processes which can efficiently enrich functional bacteria and reduce the corresponding footprint 2 3 7 8 however they cannot remove suspended solids therefore they are still combined with precipitation processes to achieve solid liquid separation in the effluent coagulation flocculation is extensively used as a solid liquid separation technology in tertiary treatment processes which depends on the application of polyaluminum chloride pac and polyacrylamide pam however conventional coagulation is a time consuming process that requires 30 min for the settling period 9 additionally conventional coagulation has other drawbacks in treating municipal and industrial wastewater such as low floc strength poor density and loose structure magnetic coagulation mc is a high efficiency solid liquid separation technology that depends on the application of magnetic powder 10 11 the addition of magnetic powder in the mc system could accelerate the formation of flocs which facilitates more efficient solid liquid separation than that of conventional coagulation 12 13 mc has a higher superficial loading rate than that of conventional coagulation thereby decreasing the required land area in addition the mc process has attracted great attention because of its easy separation of loaded magnetic seeding from solutions using an external magnetic field it is an alternative to conventional high density sedimentation and air flotation processes and had been used in advanced treatments of wwtps and micro polluted water to our knowledge the effluent quality of wwtps cannot meet pollutant discharge standards after merely a single process thus combining high efficiency processes is essential in further orienting the wastewater treatment field mbbr and mc are a typical land saving secondary biological process and a tertiary treatment process respectively and their combined application mbbr mc is a new strategy for enhancing nitrogen and phosphorus removal with small footprints that comply with the development tendency of the wastewater treatment industry because there is no activated sludge in the system the solid flux of mbbr is lower than those of cas and integrated fixed activated sludge therefore mbbr can be directly combined with mc without a secondary sedimentation tank further highlighting the small footprint of mbbr mc 8 12 it is an optimized process combination suitable for land constrained wwtps in full scale wwtps the combination of mbbr and conventional coagulation was successfully implemented suggesting the feasibility of mbbr mc 2 however few studies focused on the combined application of mbbr and mc a full scale project was thus performed in south china where mbbr and mc were set up simultaneously to meet the needs of urban development a study was conducted based on this project the aims of the present study were to i investigate the long term performance of the combination of mbbr and mc in practical engineering ii determine the pollutant removal ability of suspended carriers iii evaluate the solid liquid separation ability of the mc process and iv analyze the microbial community structure related to the nitrogen and phosphorus removal of biofilms through high throughput sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of the full scale project a 60000 m3 d wwtp is located in guangdong province labeled as pcag in this study it officially began operating in 2005 and its secondary and tertiary processes are the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process and conventional coagulation process fig 1 respectively however the rapid development of the local society led to an increase in the sewage treatment volume and the excessive wastewater flow was 30 000 m3 d in pcag the reserved land occupation of this wwtp was merely 2000 m2 meaning that the cas process could not meet the mentioned requirement consequently the composite process of mbbr and mc was used in this project successfully labeled as pmbbr in this research as shown in fig 1 the wastewater from the pretreatment process was pumped into the primary and secondary mbbr tanks subsequently the mc process was used to separate the wastewater and suspended solids the effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n total phosphorus tp and suspended solid ss of pmbbr must steadily meet the first level a standard of the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb 18918 2002 the excess sludge of pmbbr and pcag was collected dewatered and transported outward the vertical view of pmbbr is shown in fig 2 the pretreatment process equipment was constructed using reinforced concrete including the fine grid device the rotational flow grit and the lift pump the mbbr consisted of two parallel groups of biological tanks and each group contained two cylindrical tanks made of steel the plastic suspended carriers had a specific surface area of 800 m2 m3 with a 50 filling ratio and the magnetic levitation fan kept the dissolved oxygen do concentration at 2 5 mg l the mc unit consisted of two groups of integrated equipment and each group contained a coagulation flocculation tank and two sedimentation tanks the land occupation of mbbr and mc in this project was 450 m2 and 320 m2 respectively corresponding to the hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 0 and 0 5 h the effective content of pac in this project was 31 8 g al3 l and its consumption ranged from 1 6 to 3 2 m3 d depending on the influent tp concentrations the consumptions of pam and magnetic powder were also kept at 15 and 100 kg d respectively 2 2 analytical methods codcr bod5 nh4 n no3 n tp ss mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined according to the chinese nepa standard methods 14 the influent of the fine grid was used in the batch experiments which were conducted to determine the discrepancy of the suspended carriers at the stable stage all the batch experiments were performed in a 5000 ml counting cup and air was introduced into the counting cup using an air diffuser to supply oxygen the suspended carrier used in this batch experiment was from primary and secondary mbbr tanks in pmbbr the do temperature and carrier fill fraction in the batch experiments were consistent with those in the full scale project the samples were taken at an interval of 30 min to analyze the concentrations of cod bod5 nh4 n and tp the performance of the mc process was also determined by batch sedimentation experiments at the stable stage the effluent of the secondary mbbr was used as the trial water and the cod tp and ss were measured the magnetic powder pac pam and trial water were added into a 5000 ml counting cup to mix completely by hand followed by a standing precipitation phase following previous studies 11 15 the sample times in the sedimentation phase were modified to 0 1 2 3 5 7 10 15 20 and 30 min in this study to completely reflect the removal efficiency of cod tp and ss the control group without the addition of pac pam and magnetic powder was used to reflect the natural settlement properties of the biofilms in the mbbr system s0 the group with the addition of pac and pam could indicate the settlement properties of biofilms in the absence of magnetic powder s1 whereas the group with the addition of pac pam and magnetic powder could demonstrate the actual sedimentation effect of the magnetic powder s2 the al3 pam and magnetic powder concentrations in the batch experiment were kept at 3 0 mg l 0 5 mg l and 3 g l respectively the biodegradability of the effluent from the secondary mbbr was appraised by the delayed aeration experiment which had the same do temperature and carrier fill fraction as those of the full scale tank the suspended carrier of the delayed aeration experiment was captured from the primary mbbr and the cod concentrations at 0 30 60 90 and 120 min were measured 2 3 microbial community analysis there were three kinds of samples in the experiments activated sludge sas and biofilms in suspended carriers from the primary mbbr tank smbbr1 and secondary mbbr tank smbbr2 activated sludge samples under steady states were taken from pcag and then evenly mixed using a stirrer the biofilm in the mbbr tank was scraped from the surface of the suspended carrier and compared with the activated sludge on the same day the genomic dna of the activated sludge and biofilm samples was extracted directly using the e z n a mag bind soil dna kit omega genomic integrity was detected using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and genomic dna concentration was detected using a qubit3 0 dna kit polymerase chain reaction pcr amplifications were performed using the primers 341f 805r the pcr products were subjected to agarose electrophoresis and the pcr products were recovered using a dna gel recovery kit sanprep the recovered dna was accurately quantified using a qubit3 0 dna detection kit and sequenced after mixing in equal amounts 1 1 while mixing in equal amounts the amount of dna of each sample was 10 ng and the sample was finally sequenced on a computer at 20 pmol high throughput sequencing of the samples was completed using the illumina miseq sequencing platform sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units otus the rdp classifier was used to annotate the species classification of each sequence and the alignment threshold was set to 70 3 results and discussion 3 1 wwtp performance the addition of plastic carriers into the mbbr tank was completed in may 2020 and the performance of pmbbr was stable since june 2020 the variations of cod nh4 n tp and ss concentrations in the influent and effluent were monitored continuously from june 2020 to september 2020 table 1 the influent quality slightly fluctuated because of the effects of fitful rain in the research phase and the average cod nh4 n tp and ss concentrations in the influent were 81 7 27 5 15 2 3 0 1 40 0 29 and 42 19 mg l respectively the cod nh4 n tp and ss concentrations in the effluent decreased to 11 6 3 9 1 4 1 3 0 28 0 11 and 2 2 1 2 mg l respectively corresponding to the removal efficiencies of 77 0 12 3 89 0 9 0 76 1 9 6 and 92 1 12 4 the effluent quality could steadily reach the design standard indicating the successful combined application of mbbr and mc in pmbbr the effluent cod nh4 n tp and ss concentrations of pcag could also meet the design standard during the same period however the hrt of the secondary and tertiary treatments in pcag 10 0 and 8 0 h were greater than those in pmbbr highlighting the simplicity of pmbbr a previous 28 800 m3 d project combined mbrr and the conventional coagulation sedimentation process in western europe and its removal efficiencies for cod tn and tp were 91 85 and 97 respectively 2 similarly the combination of mbbr and coagulation flotation was also applied in norway where mbbr originated and was first promoted 2 the successful implementation of pmbbr proved that the combined mbbr mc process is a feasible novel tactic for the construction of new land saving wwtps the transformation of cod bod5 nh4 n no3 n tp and ss is a complex process related to organic matter removal nitrification phosphorus uptake and flocculation settling processes thus the variations of cod bod5 nh4 n no3 n tp and ss concentrations along the process were determined to further determine the contaminant removal ability in pmbbr the water samples were taken from the influent grit chamber effluent primary mbbr effluent secondary mbbr effluent and mc effluent as shown in fig 3a the cod and bod5 concentrations slightly decreased from 98 5 10 2 and 40 4 4 9 mg l to 96 1 10 5 and 40 0 4 9 mg l respectively indicating that the grit chamber had no effective capacity to remove organic matter from the influent bod5 decreased to 8 4 0 8 4 1 0 7 and 3 1 0 4 mg l in the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively and the removal rates were 78 0 2 5 10 8 2 3 and 2 3 0 5 relative to the influent the cod decreased to 41 9 4 6 28 5 4 1 and 20 1 3 1 mg l for the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively corresponding to the removal rates of 55 0 0 4 13 4 4 0 and 8 7 3 6 relative to the influent previous study 16 17 confirmed that the biofilm attached to a suspended carrier had abundant heterotrophic bacteria explaining why the cod and bod5 concentrations in the effluent of mbbr in pmbbr steadily met the design standard the removal rates of cod and bod5 in the primary mbbr were higher than those in the secondary mbbr demonstrating that the organic matter removal capacity of the primary mbbr was higher than that of the secondary mbbr and that the primary mbbr was mainly responsible for the removal of organic matter the primary mbbr prioritized the removal of organic matter because of the chronological order of the wastewater treatment process because of the bod5 depletion in the primary mbbr tank the organic load in the secondary mbbr was lower than that in the primary mbbr which could explain the difference in organic matter removal between the primary and secondary mbbr the variations of the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations along the pmbbr process are shown in fig 3b the nh4 n concentrations were 20 8 1 9 and 20 4 1 9 mg l in the influent and grit chamber effluent respectively suggesting that the grit chamber could not remove nh4 n from the wastewater the nh4 n concentrations decreased from 20 4 1 9 mg l to 13 0 1 7 0 8 0 4 and 0 7 0 3 mg l in the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively meanwhile the no3 n concentrations increased from 0 0 0 0 mg l to 7 4 1 6 19 0 2 0 and 19 2 2 3 mg l in the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively which originated from the conversion of nh4 n the nh4 n removal efficiency reached 34 8 14 4 and 59 4 12 1 in the primary and secondary mbbr relative to the influent showing that nh4 n was mainly removed in the mbbr tank previous research reported that the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria in a suspended carrier was higher than that in activated sludge 18 which might be the reason why the mbbr could achieve rapid nh4 n removal at an hrt of merely 2 0 h in pmbbr the nh4 n removal capacity of the secondary mbbr was higher than that of the primary mbbr and the secondary mbbr undertook the main task of removing nh4 n which resulted from organic pollution from the perspective of a full scale project design the primary aerobic mbbr is usually used to remove organic matter nevertheless the secondary aerobic mbbr was responsible for removing nh4 n because of the discrepancy in the microbial communities heterotrophic bacteria were responsible for the organic pollutant removal whereas autotrophic bacteria e g nitrifying bacteria were responsible for the nh4 n removal in the mbbr system 19 previous researchers pointed out that heterotrophic bacteria are more competitive than autotrophic bacteria because of the high metabolic growth rate of the former 20 this means that the organic load should be kept as low as possible to promote nitrification in mbbr during the operation of pmbbr the organic matter had adverse effects on nh4 n removal in the primary mbbr whereas the exhaustion of organic pollutants in the primary mbbr benefited the nitrification in the secondary mbbr these could explain the difference in the nh4 n removal between the primary and secondary mbbr the concentration changes of tp and ss are summarized in fig 3c and d the tp concentrations had no obvious change in the grit chamber and were kept at 1 82 0 31 and 1 82 0 30 mg l in the influent and grit chamber effluent respectively the tp concentrations decreased to 1 53 0 27 1 45 0 26 and 0 34 0 07 mg l in the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively however the tp removal efficiency reached 20 1 8 2 and 60 4 11 7 in mbbr and mc relative to the influent respectively illustrating that the phosphorus removal mainly depended on the mc process in pmbbr wang et al 2006 21 reported that the aerobic mbbr process merely removed 10 of tp without the aid of chemical precipitation the biological phosphorus removal efficiency in pmbbr was low as there was no strict anaerobic zone to start the biological removal process the ss concentration had no significant change in the grit chamber effluent whereas it increased from 61 6 mg l to 73 5 and 77 6 mg l as the wastewater was treated by the primary and secondary mbbr respectively the increment of the ss in the mbbr tank resulted from the conversion of organic pollutants and δss δcod and δss δbod5 were just 0 24 and 0 45 in pmbbr respectively both the full scale mbbr project in western europe and previous studies confirmed that δss δcod ranged from 0 2 to 0 3 g ss g cod 2 22 δss δbod5 was 0 6 in the cas system 23 higher than that in pmbbr in this study indicating that the low biomass yield of the mbbr process was a significant advantage the ss concentration in pmbbr declined from 77 6 to 4 9 0 6 mg l after the mc process suggesting its sufficiency in removing ss from the mbbr process 3 2 assessment of suspended carriers with the increment of the operation time the biofilm of the suspended carriers in pmbbr gradually stabilized in august 2020 as shown in fig s1 the suspended carriers from the primary mbbr tank tended to become black and their biomass was kept at 3 22 0 12 g mlss m2 however the suspended carriers from the secondary mbbr tank were brown and their biomass was only 0 88 0 03 g mlss m2 the biomass of the suspended carriers from the primary mbbr tank was higher than that of the suspended carriers from the secondary mbbr which was caused by the discrepancy in contaminant loads between the two mbbr tanks the mlvss mlss ratios of the biofilms in the primary and secondary mbbr were 0 81 0 02 and 0 81 0 01 under stable conditions respectively higher than those of the activated sludge in pcag 0 71 0 01 these demonstrated that the organic compound content of the biofilms was higher than that of the activated sludge the formation of the biofilms depended on the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances epss which facilitated the construction of the biofilm skeleton 24 previous research reported that the eps content of biofilms is higher than that of activated sludge when the carbon nitrogen ratio is 3 1 25 which might explain why the mlvss mlss ratio of the biofilms was higher than that of the activated sludge in this study some studies pointed out that a high organic matter content leads to the poor settling characteristic of biofilms detached from the mbbr 26 28 emphasizing the necessity of combining mbbr with a novel high efficiency solid liquid separation technology the cod and bod5 removal ability of the suspended carriers is illustrated in fig 4a and b as regards the carrier from the primary mbbr the cod and bod5 concentrations declined from 97 4 5 5 and 40 8 1 5 mg l to 21 4 5 0 and 2 8 0 7 mg l respectively as the operation time increased from 0 to 120 min meanwhile for the carrier from the secondary mbbr the cod and bod5 concentrations declined from 92 2 6 4 and 36 9 1 0 mg l to 35 6 4 0 and 4 2 0 4 mg l as the operation time increased from 0 to 120 min respectively the decreased values of cod and bod5 for the carrier from the primary mbbr were greater than those from the secondary mbbr indicating that the carrier from the primary mbbr had a stronger organic matter removal ability than that of the carrier from the secondary mbbr after a long term operation this was the reason why the primary mbbr had higher organic matter removal ability than the secondary mbbr previous researchers found that the removal rate of organic compounds decreases by stage in a multistage mbbr especially for the elimination of refractory organic micropollutants 29 30 the nh4 n removal ability of the suspended carriers is shown in fig 4c for the carrier from the primary mbbr the nh4 n concentration decreased from 20 3 1 6 to 10 7 0 9 mg l as the operation time increased from 0 to 120 min meanwhile for the carrier from the secondary mbbr the nh4 n concentration decreased from 20 1 2 3 to 0 7 0 5 mg l as the operation time increased from 0 to 90 min these demonstrated that the carrier from the secondary mbbr had a more rapid nh4 n removal rate than that of the carrier from the primary mbbr which was the reason why the secondary mbbr had a higher nh4 n removal ability than that of the primary mbbr generally concerning the two serially connected fully aerated mbbr most of the organic matter was removed by the primary mbbr and the secondary mbbr subsequently promoted nitrification 31 this explained why the suspended carriers from the primary and secondary mbbr played different roles in the removal of organic pollutants and nh4 n in pmbbr the phosphorus removal ability of the suspended carriers is shown in fig 4d as regards the carriers from the primary and secondary mbbr the tp concentration decreased from 1 55 0 06 and 1 53 0 05 mg l to 1 32 0 06 and 1 30 0 04 mg l respectively this indicated that the tp removal efficiency was limited for the suspended carriers the low biological phosphorus removal ability of the biofilms was related to the lack of an anoxic zone in this study in addition compared with the activated sludge biofilms with greater sludge ages are not conducive to biological phosphorus removal which could explain the low biological tp removal efficiency of the suspended carriers 32 34 in actual cases combining mbbr and activated sludge is a common strategy in implementing biological phosphorus removal 7 however it could not meet limited land occupation requirements in contrast the combination of mbbr and mc applies the land saving concept into practice nevertheless the low biological phosphorus removal efficiency is a disadvantage that must be further studied and solved in future innovations 3 3 evaluation of the mc process industrial development inevitably leads to the release of trace refractory pollutants into municipal wwtps affecting the performance of biological sewage treatment processes the tertiary treatment process in wwtps might thus play an auxiliary role in removing a fraction of residual refractory pollutants after the sewage biological treatment process the biodegradability of the effluent from the secondary mbbr is illustrated in fig s2 the cod concentration merely decreased from 29 3 0 6 to 27 6 0 7 mg l as the experimental time increased from 0 to 120 min this demonstrated the poor biodegradability of the effluent after the biological treatment process therefore the residual organic matter in the effluent from the secondary mbbr was removed using a highly sufficient physicochemical process rather than a biological process for the effluent of the secondary mbbr the cod removal ability of the mc process was evaluated by batch experiments of sedimentation fig 5a as the experiment time increased from 0 to 30 min the cod concentration in s0 decreased from 28 4 0 3 to 27 0 0 1 mg l this indicated the limited organic pollutant removal ability of a simple sedimentation process the cod concentration in s1 plunged from 28 6 0 4 to 20 9 0 3 mg l in the first 7 min of the operation and then slowly decreased to 21 4 0 3 mg l from the 7th min to the 30th min this indicated that pac and pam apparently enhanced the organic matter removal of the sedimentation process with a rapid rate the cod concentration in s2 plunged from 28 8 1 2 to 20 1 0 1 mg l in the first 3 min of the operation time which subsequently decreased to 19 1 0 3 mg l from the 3rd min to the 30th min the cod removal in s2 was thus faster than that in s1 demonstrating that the addition of magnetic powder significantly improved the performance of pac and pam for cod removal because of the poor biodegradability of the effluent from the secondary mbbr fig s2 the effective removal of cod in s2 illustrated that the mc process could remove part of the refractory organic matter ensuring compliance with effluent quality standards the variations of the ss concentrations during the batch experiments of sedimentation are shown in fig 5b which reveals the ss removal ability of the mc process for the effluent of the secondary mbbr the ss in the effluent from the secondary mbbr originated from the shedding biofilm of the carriers and the ss of the influent the ss concentration in s0 and s1 decreased from 75 6 1 0 and 77 1 0 8 mg l to 4 5 0 3 and 2 7 0 1 mg l respectively as the experiment time increased from 0 to 20 min then they tended to stabilize in the last 10 min of the operation time the ss concentration in s1 was obviously lower than that in s0 from 0 to 20 min indicating that the simultaneous addition of pac and pam stimulated the ss removal as compared with natural sedimentation pac is a common inorganic flocculant used in wwtps and could hydrolyze and polymerize to form multiple aluminum hydroxyl compounds which effectively absorb impurities and colloidal substances promoting flocculation meanwhile as a common coagulant aid in wwtps pam could promote aggregation the simultaneous application of pac and pam is a traditional practice in removing ss from aquatic environments the ss concentration in s2 plunged from 77 8 2 6 to 3 3 0 3 mg l in the first 3 min of the operation time and had no significant change in the last 27 min the ss removal speed in s2 was greater than that in s1 illustrating that the addition of magnetic powder efficiently improved the performance of pac and pam for ss removal from effluents from biological processes the tp removal ability of the mc process is shown in fig 5c the tp concentration in s0 almost had no change and it was kept at 1 45 1 51 mg l during the whole experiment this indicated that a simple sedimentation process could not remove phosphorus efficiently the tp concentration in s1 suddenly declined from 1 48 0 05 to 0 45 0 01 mg l in the first 7 min of the operation time and then it continuously declined to 0 38 0 01 mg l from the 7th min to the 30th min the variations of the tp concentration in s1 demonstrated that the simultaneous addition of pac and pam helped remove phosphorus efficiently the aluminum ions released from pac could also react with phosphate ions to form aluminum phosphate which might further promote tp removal the tp concentration in s2 sharply declined from 1 48 0 08 to 0 41 0 02 mg l in the first 3 min of the operation time which subsequently gradually declined to 0 35 0 01 mg l from the 3rd to the 30th min the tp removal speed in s2 was greater than that in s1 demonstrating that the magnetic powder effectively enhanced the performance of pac and pam in removing residual phosphorus from effluents from biological treatment processes this result indirectly proved the protection function of the mc process which ensured that the effluent tp concentration met the designed discharge standard the traditional flocculation sedimentation process depended on the addition of pac and pam to promote contaminant removal from wastewater nevertheless the mc process was an enhanced solid liquid separation technology that evolved from the traditional flocculation sedimentation process the present results of the batch experiment elucidated that the mc process could realize quick sedimentation within 3 min this result was similar to that of lv et al 2019 10 who reported that the sedimentation time of the mc process could be shortened to 2 5 min lv et al 2019 10 also stated that magnetic powder served as nuclei to intensify the formation of flocs which confirmed the superiority of the mc process over the traditional flocculation sedimentation process 3 4 microbial community analysis the performance of wwtps is related to the microbial communities of the activated sludge and biofilm these microbial communities were analyzed through high throughput sequencing in this study as shown in table 2 the good s coverage ranged from 0 990 to 0 993 in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 which suggested that most of the species were covered by the obtained sequences chao1 index was used to characterize the richness of the microbial communities whereas the shannon index was employed to characterize diversity 35 the chao1 index in sas 1804 8 was higher than that in smbbr1 1479 4 whereas the shannon index in smbbr1 5 256 was higher than that in sas 5 217 these results indicated that the activated sludge had a higher microbial richness but a lower microbial diversity than those of the biofilms for the same influent the chao1 and shannon indices in smbbr2 were 1068 6 and 4 106 respectively which were the lowest among the three samples previous studies pointed out that low pollutant concentrations could lead to decreases in microbial diversity and richness 36 37 the significant consumption of organic matter and nh4 n in the primary mbbr caused a low pollutant concentration for the secondary mbbr which explains why the chao1 and shannon indices in smbbr2 were the lowest in this study as shown in fig s3 the rarefaction curves of sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 all approached plateaus which indicated that the sequence libraries established in the present experiments were enough to analyze the richness and diversity of the microbial communities the similarities and differences between the microbial communities were compared using a venn diagram fig s4 the total number of otus in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 was 2277 and the number of shared otus in all three samples was 352 only 15 5 of the total otus the shared otus at phylum level included proteobacteria 40 2 chloroflexi 17 2 bacteroidetes 10 4 actinobacteriota 7 8 nitrospirota 5 8 patescibacteria 3 7 firmicutes 3 2 acidobacteriota 3 1 campilobacterota 2 8 and others 3 8 the shared otus indicated that some microorganisms always coexisted in the activated sludge and biofilm the numbers of unique otus in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 were 843 326 and 171 respectively and they accounted for 58 8 of the total number of otus this further illustrated the significant differences in the microbial compositions between the activated sludge and the biofilms according to the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis fig s5 the three samples were divided into two groups as follows a sas and b smbbr1 and smbbr2 the compositions of the microbial communities were further compared at phylum and genus levels to better describe the phylogenetic differences between the three samples as shown in fig 6a the relative abundances of the dominant phyla proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidota actinobacteria patescibacteria acidobacteriota and nitrospirota were 22 8 52 6 9 4 25 5 3 3 14 0 3 3 11 7 0 5 7 9 0 5 6 0 and 0 6 15 8 in the three samples respectively the difference in the relative abundance at different phyla illustrated that the microbial community structures of the activated sludge and the suspended carriers were different the top 23 abundant genera were selected to further investigate the similarities and discrepancies of the microbial communities fig 6b nitrospira and nitrolancea were reported to be associated with nitrification 38 40 and their relative abundances were respectively 0 56 and 0 13 in sas 0 87 and 4 38 in smbbr1 and 15 82 and 5 77 in smbbr2 the relative abundances of nitrospira and nitrolancea in smbbr2 were higher than those in smbbr1 consistent with the performance of nh4 n removal of the suspended carriers from the primary and secondary mbbr this result indicated that the suspended carrier from the secondary mbbr was more conducive to enriching nitrifiers than that from the primary mbbr in an aerated biofilm system without an anoxia process which led to the higher nh4 n removal rate of the secondary mbbr than that of the primary mbbr the relative abundances of nitrospira and nitrolancea in smbbr1 and smbbr2 were higher than those in sas demonstrating that the suspended carrier was a better medium for enriching nitrifiers than the activated sludge the superiority of the suspended carriers used in the nitrifier accumulation facilitated the successful implementation of pmbbr with limited land occupation acinetobacter was confirmed to be linked to biological phosphorus removal 41 and its relative abundances were 2 08 0 05 and 0 11 in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 respectively the relative abundances of acinetobacter in sas were higher than those in smbbr1 and smbbr2 showing that the biofilm was insufficient for capturing the phosphorus removing bacteria in contrast to the activated sludge the most abundant genera in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 were caldilinea thiothrix and pseudomonas respectively caldilinea and thiothrix are two common denitrifying filamentous bacteria that could reduce nitrate to nitrite in anoxic conditions 42 43 the relative abundance of caldilinea in sas was 17 86 whereas it was not found in smbbr1 and smbbr2 this showed that the activated sludge favored the growth of caldilinea compared with the biofilm kragelund et al 44 reported that caldilinea play an important structural role in sludge floc formation which might be the reason for its dominance in sas meanwhile the relative abundances of thiothrix were 16 54 in smbbr1 but merely 0 17 and 1 46 in sas and smbbr2 respectively trubitsyn et al 2013 43 found that thiothrix is responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite under anaerobic conditions and the coupling with oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds the relative abundance of pseudomonas in smbbr2 was 25 62 but lower than 1 in sas and smbbr1 pseudomonas is useful in aerobic denitrification and could remove some parts of refractory organic matter which especially suitably exists in low strength wastewater 45 47 in this study the significant consumption of organic matter in the primary mbbr cut off the organic load of the secondary mbbr which might explain the overgrowth of pseudomonas in smbbr2 besides the above mentioned denitrifying genera some others were also detected in the activated sludge and mbbr in this study combining the dominant genera in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 by pca analysis in fig s6 some denitrification related genera existed primarily in smbbr1 or smbbr2 such as bradyrhizobium rhodococcus rhodobacter thermomonas flavobacterium and hydrogenophaga 48 53 these kinds of genera were speculated to be suitable for living in biofilms however denitrifying genera such as dechloromonas steroidobacter thauera and ignavibacterium 54 57 existed primarily in sas which led to the speculation that they favorably grow in activated sludge the different relative abundances of denitrifying genera between the activated sludge and mbbr require further future studies 4 conclusions a 30000 m3 d wwtp was implemented in guangdong province which combined a two stage aerobic mbbr and the mc process the effluent steadily met the designed discharge standard even though the land occupation was merely 2000 m2 this indicates that the combined mbbr mc process is an effective strategy for the construction of land saving wwtp corresponding to the effluent of the mbbr process the mc process sufficiently removed residual ss tp and some cod within a 3 min sedimentation which ensured that the discharge reached the design standard the relative abundance of the nitrifying genera of the secondary mbbr was higher than that of the primary mbbr leading to a higher nh4 n removal ability for the secondary mbbr meanwhile the primary mbbr was superior to the secondary mbbr in terms of organic matter removal the suspended carrier was more competent in enriching nitrifiers than the activated sludge which was a significant advantage of mbbr however the suspended carriers were insufficient for enriching phosphorus removing bacteria compared with the activated sludge leading to the poor biological tp removal efficiency of the mbbr process this disadvantage must be further studied in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

12815,the combined application of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr and magnetic coagulation mc is a new method of enhancing nitrogen and phosphorus removal of wastewater treatment plants with limited land occupation this had been successfully used in a full scale 30 000 m3 d wastewater treatment plant in guangdong province china the effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n total phosphorus tp and suspended solid ss stabilized at 11 6 3 9 1 4 1 3 0 28 0 11 and 2 2 1 2 mg l when the corresponding influent concentrations were 81 7 27 5 15 2 3 0 1 40 0 29 and 42 19 mg l respectively which could steadily meet the designed discharge standard even though the land occupation was merely at 2000 m2 regarding the mbbr effluent the mc process sufficiently removed residual ss tp and some cod within 3 min of sedimentation which ensured that the discharge reached the designed standard the relative abundance of nitrifying genera of the secondary mbbr was higher than that of the primary mbbr leading to a greater nh4 n removal ability for the secondary mbbr meanwhile the primary mbbr was superior to the secondary mbbr in terms of organic matter removal the suspended carrier was more competent in enriching nitrifiers than the activated sludge highlighting the significant advantage of mbbr however the suspended carrier was insufficient in enriching phosphorus removal bacteria as compared with the activated sludge leading to a poor biological tp removal efficiency of the mbbr process further research is needed to improve the biological phosphorus removal ability of mbbr graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords moving bed biofilm reactor magnetic coagulation combined application full scale nitrifying genera 1 introduction with the rapid economic development in china water quality requirements have become more stringent over the last decades at present most existing wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china use the conventional activated sludge cas process as a secondary bioprocess in removing pollutants and nutrients 1 however with increasingly restrictive measures concerning wastewater treatment the existing activated sludge plants are overloaded and do not comply with the limits indicated by chinese legislation meanwhile with the consumption of construction land and the rise in land prices land shortage has become a typical factor that hampers the construction of wwtps in china given the above conditions developing highly efficient and land saving sewage treatment processes is necessary in this regard the use of moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr as an upgrading process of activated sludge has attracted great attention and has been widely applied in the wastewater treatment industry across the world 2 3 in the absence of activated sludge the performance of mbbr completely depends on the operation of plastic biofilm carriers where biofilms can attach mbbr has the following advantages over the cas system and fixed biomass systems 4 6 no clogging cost effectiveness low sludge production low head loss and high efficiency under extreme conditions these stable performance characteristics make mbbr suitable for the new construction and retrofitting of existing wwtps mbbrs are used in high loading wastewater treatment processes which can efficiently enrich functional bacteria and reduce the corresponding footprint 2 3 7 8 however they cannot remove suspended solids therefore they are still combined with precipitation processes to achieve solid liquid separation in the effluent coagulation flocculation is extensively used as a solid liquid separation technology in tertiary treatment processes which depends on the application of polyaluminum chloride pac and polyacrylamide pam however conventional coagulation is a time consuming process that requires 30 min for the settling period 9 additionally conventional coagulation has other drawbacks in treating municipal and industrial wastewater such as low floc strength poor density and loose structure magnetic coagulation mc is a high efficiency solid liquid separation technology that depends on the application of magnetic powder 10 11 the addition of magnetic powder in the mc system could accelerate the formation of flocs which facilitates more efficient solid liquid separation than that of conventional coagulation 12 13 mc has a higher superficial loading rate than that of conventional coagulation thereby decreasing the required land area in addition the mc process has attracted great attention because of its easy separation of loaded magnetic seeding from solutions using an external magnetic field it is an alternative to conventional high density sedimentation and air flotation processes and had been used in advanced treatments of wwtps and micro polluted water to our knowledge the effluent quality of wwtps cannot meet pollutant discharge standards after merely a single process thus combining high efficiency processes is essential in further orienting the wastewater treatment field mbbr and mc are a typical land saving secondary biological process and a tertiary treatment process respectively and their combined application mbbr mc is a new strategy for enhancing nitrogen and phosphorus removal with small footprints that comply with the development tendency of the wastewater treatment industry because there is no activated sludge in the system the solid flux of mbbr is lower than those of cas and integrated fixed activated sludge therefore mbbr can be directly combined with mc without a secondary sedimentation tank further highlighting the small footprint of mbbr mc 8 12 it is an optimized process combination suitable for land constrained wwtps in full scale wwtps the combination of mbbr and conventional coagulation was successfully implemented suggesting the feasibility of mbbr mc 2 however few studies focused on the combined application of mbbr and mc a full scale project was thus performed in south china where mbbr and mc were set up simultaneously to meet the needs of urban development a study was conducted based on this project the aims of the present study were to i investigate the long term performance of the combination of mbbr and mc in practical engineering ii determine the pollutant removal ability of suspended carriers iii evaluate the solid liquid separation ability of the mc process and iv analyze the microbial community structure related to the nitrogen and phosphorus removal of biofilms through high throughput sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of the full scale project a 60000 m3 d wwtp is located in guangdong province labeled as pcag in this study it officially began operating in 2005 and its secondary and tertiary processes are the anaerobic anoxic oxic aao process and conventional coagulation process fig 1 respectively however the rapid development of the local society led to an increase in the sewage treatment volume and the excessive wastewater flow was 30 000 m3 d in pcag the reserved land occupation of this wwtp was merely 2000 m2 meaning that the cas process could not meet the mentioned requirement consequently the composite process of mbbr and mc was used in this project successfully labeled as pmbbr in this research as shown in fig 1 the wastewater from the pretreatment process was pumped into the primary and secondary mbbr tanks subsequently the mc process was used to separate the wastewater and suspended solids the effluent concentrations of cod nh4 n total phosphorus tp and suspended solid ss of pmbbr must steadily meet the first level a standard of the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb 18918 2002 the excess sludge of pmbbr and pcag was collected dewatered and transported outward the vertical view of pmbbr is shown in fig 2 the pretreatment process equipment was constructed using reinforced concrete including the fine grid device the rotational flow grit and the lift pump the mbbr consisted of two parallel groups of biological tanks and each group contained two cylindrical tanks made of steel the plastic suspended carriers had a specific surface area of 800 m2 m3 with a 50 filling ratio and the magnetic levitation fan kept the dissolved oxygen do concentration at 2 5 mg l the mc unit consisted of two groups of integrated equipment and each group contained a coagulation flocculation tank and two sedimentation tanks the land occupation of mbbr and mc in this project was 450 m2 and 320 m2 respectively corresponding to the hydraulic retention time hrt of 2 0 and 0 5 h the effective content of pac in this project was 31 8 g al3 l and its consumption ranged from 1 6 to 3 2 m3 d depending on the influent tp concentrations the consumptions of pam and magnetic powder were also kept at 15 and 100 kg d respectively 2 2 analytical methods codcr bod5 nh4 n no3 n tp ss mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss were determined according to the chinese nepa standard methods 14 the influent of the fine grid was used in the batch experiments which were conducted to determine the discrepancy of the suspended carriers at the stable stage all the batch experiments were performed in a 5000 ml counting cup and air was introduced into the counting cup using an air diffuser to supply oxygen the suspended carrier used in this batch experiment was from primary and secondary mbbr tanks in pmbbr the do temperature and carrier fill fraction in the batch experiments were consistent with those in the full scale project the samples were taken at an interval of 30 min to analyze the concentrations of cod bod5 nh4 n and tp the performance of the mc process was also determined by batch sedimentation experiments at the stable stage the effluent of the secondary mbbr was used as the trial water and the cod tp and ss were measured the magnetic powder pac pam and trial water were added into a 5000 ml counting cup to mix completely by hand followed by a standing precipitation phase following previous studies 11 15 the sample times in the sedimentation phase were modified to 0 1 2 3 5 7 10 15 20 and 30 min in this study to completely reflect the removal efficiency of cod tp and ss the control group without the addition of pac pam and magnetic powder was used to reflect the natural settlement properties of the biofilms in the mbbr system s0 the group with the addition of pac and pam could indicate the settlement properties of biofilms in the absence of magnetic powder s1 whereas the group with the addition of pac pam and magnetic powder could demonstrate the actual sedimentation effect of the magnetic powder s2 the al3 pam and magnetic powder concentrations in the batch experiment were kept at 3 0 mg l 0 5 mg l and 3 g l respectively the biodegradability of the effluent from the secondary mbbr was appraised by the delayed aeration experiment which had the same do temperature and carrier fill fraction as those of the full scale tank the suspended carrier of the delayed aeration experiment was captured from the primary mbbr and the cod concentrations at 0 30 60 90 and 120 min were measured 2 3 microbial community analysis there were three kinds of samples in the experiments activated sludge sas and biofilms in suspended carriers from the primary mbbr tank smbbr1 and secondary mbbr tank smbbr2 activated sludge samples under steady states were taken from pcag and then evenly mixed using a stirrer the biofilm in the mbbr tank was scraped from the surface of the suspended carrier and compared with the activated sludge on the same day the genomic dna of the activated sludge and biofilm samples was extracted directly using the e z n a mag bind soil dna kit omega genomic integrity was detected using 1 agarose gel electrophoresis and genomic dna concentration was detected using a qubit3 0 dna kit polymerase chain reaction pcr amplifications were performed using the primers 341f 805r the pcr products were subjected to agarose electrophoresis and the pcr products were recovered using a dna gel recovery kit sanprep the recovered dna was accurately quantified using a qubit3 0 dna detection kit and sequenced after mixing in equal amounts 1 1 while mixing in equal amounts the amount of dna of each sample was 10 ng and the sample was finally sequenced on a computer at 20 pmol high throughput sequencing of the samples was completed using the illumina miseq sequencing platform sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic units otus the rdp classifier was used to annotate the species classification of each sequence and the alignment threshold was set to 70 3 results and discussion 3 1 wwtp performance the addition of plastic carriers into the mbbr tank was completed in may 2020 and the performance of pmbbr was stable since june 2020 the variations of cod nh4 n tp and ss concentrations in the influent and effluent were monitored continuously from june 2020 to september 2020 table 1 the influent quality slightly fluctuated because of the effects of fitful rain in the research phase and the average cod nh4 n tp and ss concentrations in the influent were 81 7 27 5 15 2 3 0 1 40 0 29 and 42 19 mg l respectively the cod nh4 n tp and ss concentrations in the effluent decreased to 11 6 3 9 1 4 1 3 0 28 0 11 and 2 2 1 2 mg l respectively corresponding to the removal efficiencies of 77 0 12 3 89 0 9 0 76 1 9 6 and 92 1 12 4 the effluent quality could steadily reach the design standard indicating the successful combined application of mbbr and mc in pmbbr the effluent cod nh4 n tp and ss concentrations of pcag could also meet the design standard during the same period however the hrt of the secondary and tertiary treatments in pcag 10 0 and 8 0 h were greater than those in pmbbr highlighting the simplicity of pmbbr a previous 28 800 m3 d project combined mbrr and the conventional coagulation sedimentation process in western europe and its removal efficiencies for cod tn and tp were 91 85 and 97 respectively 2 similarly the combination of mbbr and coagulation flotation was also applied in norway where mbbr originated and was first promoted 2 the successful implementation of pmbbr proved that the combined mbbr mc process is a feasible novel tactic for the construction of new land saving wwtps the transformation of cod bod5 nh4 n no3 n tp and ss is a complex process related to organic matter removal nitrification phosphorus uptake and flocculation settling processes thus the variations of cod bod5 nh4 n no3 n tp and ss concentrations along the process were determined to further determine the contaminant removal ability in pmbbr the water samples were taken from the influent grit chamber effluent primary mbbr effluent secondary mbbr effluent and mc effluent as shown in fig 3a the cod and bod5 concentrations slightly decreased from 98 5 10 2 and 40 4 4 9 mg l to 96 1 10 5 and 40 0 4 9 mg l respectively indicating that the grit chamber had no effective capacity to remove organic matter from the influent bod5 decreased to 8 4 0 8 4 1 0 7 and 3 1 0 4 mg l in the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively and the removal rates were 78 0 2 5 10 8 2 3 and 2 3 0 5 relative to the influent the cod decreased to 41 9 4 6 28 5 4 1 and 20 1 3 1 mg l for the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively corresponding to the removal rates of 55 0 0 4 13 4 4 0 and 8 7 3 6 relative to the influent previous study 16 17 confirmed that the biofilm attached to a suspended carrier had abundant heterotrophic bacteria explaining why the cod and bod5 concentrations in the effluent of mbbr in pmbbr steadily met the design standard the removal rates of cod and bod5 in the primary mbbr were higher than those in the secondary mbbr demonstrating that the organic matter removal capacity of the primary mbbr was higher than that of the secondary mbbr and that the primary mbbr was mainly responsible for the removal of organic matter the primary mbbr prioritized the removal of organic matter because of the chronological order of the wastewater treatment process because of the bod5 depletion in the primary mbbr tank the organic load in the secondary mbbr was lower than that in the primary mbbr which could explain the difference in organic matter removal between the primary and secondary mbbr the variations of the nh4 n and no3 n concentrations along the pmbbr process are shown in fig 3b the nh4 n concentrations were 20 8 1 9 and 20 4 1 9 mg l in the influent and grit chamber effluent respectively suggesting that the grit chamber could not remove nh4 n from the wastewater the nh4 n concentrations decreased from 20 4 1 9 mg l to 13 0 1 7 0 8 0 4 and 0 7 0 3 mg l in the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively meanwhile the no3 n concentrations increased from 0 0 0 0 mg l to 7 4 1 6 19 0 2 0 and 19 2 2 3 mg l in the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively which originated from the conversion of nh4 n the nh4 n removal efficiency reached 34 8 14 4 and 59 4 12 1 in the primary and secondary mbbr relative to the influent showing that nh4 n was mainly removed in the mbbr tank previous research reported that the relative abundance of nitrifying bacteria in a suspended carrier was higher than that in activated sludge 18 which might be the reason why the mbbr could achieve rapid nh4 n removal at an hrt of merely 2 0 h in pmbbr the nh4 n removal capacity of the secondary mbbr was higher than that of the primary mbbr and the secondary mbbr undertook the main task of removing nh4 n which resulted from organic pollution from the perspective of a full scale project design the primary aerobic mbbr is usually used to remove organic matter nevertheless the secondary aerobic mbbr was responsible for removing nh4 n because of the discrepancy in the microbial communities heterotrophic bacteria were responsible for the organic pollutant removal whereas autotrophic bacteria e g nitrifying bacteria were responsible for the nh4 n removal in the mbbr system 19 previous researchers pointed out that heterotrophic bacteria are more competitive than autotrophic bacteria because of the high metabolic growth rate of the former 20 this means that the organic load should be kept as low as possible to promote nitrification in mbbr during the operation of pmbbr the organic matter had adverse effects on nh4 n removal in the primary mbbr whereas the exhaustion of organic pollutants in the primary mbbr benefited the nitrification in the secondary mbbr these could explain the difference in the nh4 n removal between the primary and secondary mbbr the concentration changes of tp and ss are summarized in fig 3c and d the tp concentrations had no obvious change in the grit chamber and were kept at 1 82 0 31 and 1 82 0 30 mg l in the influent and grit chamber effluent respectively the tp concentrations decreased to 1 53 0 27 1 45 0 26 and 0 34 0 07 mg l in the effluent of the primary mbbr secondary mbbr and mc tanks respectively however the tp removal efficiency reached 20 1 8 2 and 60 4 11 7 in mbbr and mc relative to the influent respectively illustrating that the phosphorus removal mainly depended on the mc process in pmbbr wang et al 2006 21 reported that the aerobic mbbr process merely removed 10 of tp without the aid of chemical precipitation the biological phosphorus removal efficiency in pmbbr was low as there was no strict anaerobic zone to start the biological removal process the ss concentration had no significant change in the grit chamber effluent whereas it increased from 61 6 mg l to 73 5 and 77 6 mg l as the wastewater was treated by the primary and secondary mbbr respectively the increment of the ss in the mbbr tank resulted from the conversion of organic pollutants and δss δcod and δss δbod5 were just 0 24 and 0 45 in pmbbr respectively both the full scale mbbr project in western europe and previous studies confirmed that δss δcod ranged from 0 2 to 0 3 g ss g cod 2 22 δss δbod5 was 0 6 in the cas system 23 higher than that in pmbbr in this study indicating that the low biomass yield of the mbbr process was a significant advantage the ss concentration in pmbbr declined from 77 6 to 4 9 0 6 mg l after the mc process suggesting its sufficiency in removing ss from the mbbr process 3 2 assessment of suspended carriers with the increment of the operation time the biofilm of the suspended carriers in pmbbr gradually stabilized in august 2020 as shown in fig s1 the suspended carriers from the primary mbbr tank tended to become black and their biomass was kept at 3 22 0 12 g mlss m2 however the suspended carriers from the secondary mbbr tank were brown and their biomass was only 0 88 0 03 g mlss m2 the biomass of the suspended carriers from the primary mbbr tank was higher than that of the suspended carriers from the secondary mbbr which was caused by the discrepancy in contaminant loads between the two mbbr tanks the mlvss mlss ratios of the biofilms in the primary and secondary mbbr were 0 81 0 02 and 0 81 0 01 under stable conditions respectively higher than those of the activated sludge in pcag 0 71 0 01 these demonstrated that the organic compound content of the biofilms was higher than that of the activated sludge the formation of the biofilms depended on the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances epss which facilitated the construction of the biofilm skeleton 24 previous research reported that the eps content of biofilms is higher than that of activated sludge when the carbon nitrogen ratio is 3 1 25 which might explain why the mlvss mlss ratio of the biofilms was higher than that of the activated sludge in this study some studies pointed out that a high organic matter content leads to the poor settling characteristic of biofilms detached from the mbbr 26 28 emphasizing the necessity of combining mbbr with a novel high efficiency solid liquid separation technology the cod and bod5 removal ability of the suspended carriers is illustrated in fig 4a and b as regards the carrier from the primary mbbr the cod and bod5 concentrations declined from 97 4 5 5 and 40 8 1 5 mg l to 21 4 5 0 and 2 8 0 7 mg l respectively as the operation time increased from 0 to 120 min meanwhile for the carrier from the secondary mbbr the cod and bod5 concentrations declined from 92 2 6 4 and 36 9 1 0 mg l to 35 6 4 0 and 4 2 0 4 mg l as the operation time increased from 0 to 120 min respectively the decreased values of cod and bod5 for the carrier from the primary mbbr were greater than those from the secondary mbbr indicating that the carrier from the primary mbbr had a stronger organic matter removal ability than that of the carrier from the secondary mbbr after a long term operation this was the reason why the primary mbbr had higher organic matter removal ability than the secondary mbbr previous researchers found that the removal rate of organic compounds decreases by stage in a multistage mbbr especially for the elimination of refractory organic micropollutants 29 30 the nh4 n removal ability of the suspended carriers is shown in fig 4c for the carrier from the primary mbbr the nh4 n concentration decreased from 20 3 1 6 to 10 7 0 9 mg l as the operation time increased from 0 to 120 min meanwhile for the carrier from the secondary mbbr the nh4 n concentration decreased from 20 1 2 3 to 0 7 0 5 mg l as the operation time increased from 0 to 90 min these demonstrated that the carrier from the secondary mbbr had a more rapid nh4 n removal rate than that of the carrier from the primary mbbr which was the reason why the secondary mbbr had a higher nh4 n removal ability than that of the primary mbbr generally concerning the two serially connected fully aerated mbbr most of the organic matter was removed by the primary mbbr and the secondary mbbr subsequently promoted nitrification 31 this explained why the suspended carriers from the primary and secondary mbbr played different roles in the removal of organic pollutants and nh4 n in pmbbr the phosphorus removal ability of the suspended carriers is shown in fig 4d as regards the carriers from the primary and secondary mbbr the tp concentration decreased from 1 55 0 06 and 1 53 0 05 mg l to 1 32 0 06 and 1 30 0 04 mg l respectively this indicated that the tp removal efficiency was limited for the suspended carriers the low biological phosphorus removal ability of the biofilms was related to the lack of an anoxic zone in this study in addition compared with the activated sludge biofilms with greater sludge ages are not conducive to biological phosphorus removal which could explain the low biological tp removal efficiency of the suspended carriers 32 34 in actual cases combining mbbr and activated sludge is a common strategy in implementing biological phosphorus removal 7 however it could not meet limited land occupation requirements in contrast the combination of mbbr and mc applies the land saving concept into practice nevertheless the low biological phosphorus removal efficiency is a disadvantage that must be further studied and solved in future innovations 3 3 evaluation of the mc process industrial development inevitably leads to the release of trace refractory pollutants into municipal wwtps affecting the performance of biological sewage treatment processes the tertiary treatment process in wwtps might thus play an auxiliary role in removing a fraction of residual refractory pollutants after the sewage biological treatment process the biodegradability of the effluent from the secondary mbbr is illustrated in fig s2 the cod concentration merely decreased from 29 3 0 6 to 27 6 0 7 mg l as the experimental time increased from 0 to 120 min this demonstrated the poor biodegradability of the effluent after the biological treatment process therefore the residual organic matter in the effluent from the secondary mbbr was removed using a highly sufficient physicochemical process rather than a biological process for the effluent of the secondary mbbr the cod removal ability of the mc process was evaluated by batch experiments of sedimentation fig 5a as the experiment time increased from 0 to 30 min the cod concentration in s0 decreased from 28 4 0 3 to 27 0 0 1 mg l this indicated the limited organic pollutant removal ability of a simple sedimentation process the cod concentration in s1 plunged from 28 6 0 4 to 20 9 0 3 mg l in the first 7 min of the operation and then slowly decreased to 21 4 0 3 mg l from the 7th min to the 30th min this indicated that pac and pam apparently enhanced the organic matter removal of the sedimentation process with a rapid rate the cod concentration in s2 plunged from 28 8 1 2 to 20 1 0 1 mg l in the first 3 min of the operation time which subsequently decreased to 19 1 0 3 mg l from the 3rd min to the 30th min the cod removal in s2 was thus faster than that in s1 demonstrating that the addition of magnetic powder significantly improved the performance of pac and pam for cod removal because of the poor biodegradability of the effluent from the secondary mbbr fig s2 the effective removal of cod in s2 illustrated that the mc process could remove part of the refractory organic matter ensuring compliance with effluent quality standards the variations of the ss concentrations during the batch experiments of sedimentation are shown in fig 5b which reveals the ss removal ability of the mc process for the effluent of the secondary mbbr the ss in the effluent from the secondary mbbr originated from the shedding biofilm of the carriers and the ss of the influent the ss concentration in s0 and s1 decreased from 75 6 1 0 and 77 1 0 8 mg l to 4 5 0 3 and 2 7 0 1 mg l respectively as the experiment time increased from 0 to 20 min then they tended to stabilize in the last 10 min of the operation time the ss concentration in s1 was obviously lower than that in s0 from 0 to 20 min indicating that the simultaneous addition of pac and pam stimulated the ss removal as compared with natural sedimentation pac is a common inorganic flocculant used in wwtps and could hydrolyze and polymerize to form multiple aluminum hydroxyl compounds which effectively absorb impurities and colloidal substances promoting flocculation meanwhile as a common coagulant aid in wwtps pam could promote aggregation the simultaneous application of pac and pam is a traditional practice in removing ss from aquatic environments the ss concentration in s2 plunged from 77 8 2 6 to 3 3 0 3 mg l in the first 3 min of the operation time and had no significant change in the last 27 min the ss removal speed in s2 was greater than that in s1 illustrating that the addition of magnetic powder efficiently improved the performance of pac and pam for ss removal from effluents from biological processes the tp removal ability of the mc process is shown in fig 5c the tp concentration in s0 almost had no change and it was kept at 1 45 1 51 mg l during the whole experiment this indicated that a simple sedimentation process could not remove phosphorus efficiently the tp concentration in s1 suddenly declined from 1 48 0 05 to 0 45 0 01 mg l in the first 7 min of the operation time and then it continuously declined to 0 38 0 01 mg l from the 7th min to the 30th min the variations of the tp concentration in s1 demonstrated that the simultaneous addition of pac and pam helped remove phosphorus efficiently the aluminum ions released from pac could also react with phosphate ions to form aluminum phosphate which might further promote tp removal the tp concentration in s2 sharply declined from 1 48 0 08 to 0 41 0 02 mg l in the first 3 min of the operation time which subsequently gradually declined to 0 35 0 01 mg l from the 3rd to the 30th min the tp removal speed in s2 was greater than that in s1 demonstrating that the magnetic powder effectively enhanced the performance of pac and pam in removing residual phosphorus from effluents from biological treatment processes this result indirectly proved the protection function of the mc process which ensured that the effluent tp concentration met the designed discharge standard the traditional flocculation sedimentation process depended on the addition of pac and pam to promote contaminant removal from wastewater nevertheless the mc process was an enhanced solid liquid separation technology that evolved from the traditional flocculation sedimentation process the present results of the batch experiment elucidated that the mc process could realize quick sedimentation within 3 min this result was similar to that of lv et al 2019 10 who reported that the sedimentation time of the mc process could be shortened to 2 5 min lv et al 2019 10 also stated that magnetic powder served as nuclei to intensify the formation of flocs which confirmed the superiority of the mc process over the traditional flocculation sedimentation process 3 4 microbial community analysis the performance of wwtps is related to the microbial communities of the activated sludge and biofilm these microbial communities were analyzed through high throughput sequencing in this study as shown in table 2 the good s coverage ranged from 0 990 to 0 993 in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 which suggested that most of the species were covered by the obtained sequences chao1 index was used to characterize the richness of the microbial communities whereas the shannon index was employed to characterize diversity 35 the chao1 index in sas 1804 8 was higher than that in smbbr1 1479 4 whereas the shannon index in smbbr1 5 256 was higher than that in sas 5 217 these results indicated that the activated sludge had a higher microbial richness but a lower microbial diversity than those of the biofilms for the same influent the chao1 and shannon indices in smbbr2 were 1068 6 and 4 106 respectively which were the lowest among the three samples previous studies pointed out that low pollutant concentrations could lead to decreases in microbial diversity and richness 36 37 the significant consumption of organic matter and nh4 n in the primary mbbr caused a low pollutant concentration for the secondary mbbr which explains why the chao1 and shannon indices in smbbr2 were the lowest in this study as shown in fig s3 the rarefaction curves of sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 all approached plateaus which indicated that the sequence libraries established in the present experiments were enough to analyze the richness and diversity of the microbial communities the similarities and differences between the microbial communities were compared using a venn diagram fig s4 the total number of otus in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 was 2277 and the number of shared otus in all three samples was 352 only 15 5 of the total otus the shared otus at phylum level included proteobacteria 40 2 chloroflexi 17 2 bacteroidetes 10 4 actinobacteriota 7 8 nitrospirota 5 8 patescibacteria 3 7 firmicutes 3 2 acidobacteriota 3 1 campilobacterota 2 8 and others 3 8 the shared otus indicated that some microorganisms always coexisted in the activated sludge and biofilm the numbers of unique otus in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 were 843 326 and 171 respectively and they accounted for 58 8 of the total number of otus this further illustrated the significant differences in the microbial compositions between the activated sludge and the biofilms according to the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean analysis fig s5 the three samples were divided into two groups as follows a sas and b smbbr1 and smbbr2 the compositions of the microbial communities were further compared at phylum and genus levels to better describe the phylogenetic differences between the three samples as shown in fig 6a the relative abundances of the dominant phyla proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidota actinobacteria patescibacteria acidobacteriota and nitrospirota were 22 8 52 6 9 4 25 5 3 3 14 0 3 3 11 7 0 5 7 9 0 5 6 0 and 0 6 15 8 in the three samples respectively the difference in the relative abundance at different phyla illustrated that the microbial community structures of the activated sludge and the suspended carriers were different the top 23 abundant genera were selected to further investigate the similarities and discrepancies of the microbial communities fig 6b nitrospira and nitrolancea were reported to be associated with nitrification 38 40 and their relative abundances were respectively 0 56 and 0 13 in sas 0 87 and 4 38 in smbbr1 and 15 82 and 5 77 in smbbr2 the relative abundances of nitrospira and nitrolancea in smbbr2 were higher than those in smbbr1 consistent with the performance of nh4 n removal of the suspended carriers from the primary and secondary mbbr this result indicated that the suspended carrier from the secondary mbbr was more conducive to enriching nitrifiers than that from the primary mbbr in an aerated biofilm system without an anoxia process which led to the higher nh4 n removal rate of the secondary mbbr than that of the primary mbbr the relative abundances of nitrospira and nitrolancea in smbbr1 and smbbr2 were higher than those in sas demonstrating that the suspended carrier was a better medium for enriching nitrifiers than the activated sludge the superiority of the suspended carriers used in the nitrifier accumulation facilitated the successful implementation of pmbbr with limited land occupation acinetobacter was confirmed to be linked to biological phosphorus removal 41 and its relative abundances were 2 08 0 05 and 0 11 in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 respectively the relative abundances of acinetobacter in sas were higher than those in smbbr1 and smbbr2 showing that the biofilm was insufficient for capturing the phosphorus removing bacteria in contrast to the activated sludge the most abundant genera in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 were caldilinea thiothrix and pseudomonas respectively caldilinea and thiothrix are two common denitrifying filamentous bacteria that could reduce nitrate to nitrite in anoxic conditions 42 43 the relative abundance of caldilinea in sas was 17 86 whereas it was not found in smbbr1 and smbbr2 this showed that the activated sludge favored the growth of caldilinea compared with the biofilm kragelund et al 44 reported that caldilinea play an important structural role in sludge floc formation which might be the reason for its dominance in sas meanwhile the relative abundances of thiothrix were 16 54 in smbbr1 but merely 0 17 and 1 46 in sas and smbbr2 respectively trubitsyn et al 2013 43 found that thiothrix is responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite under anaerobic conditions and the coupling with oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds the relative abundance of pseudomonas in smbbr2 was 25 62 but lower than 1 in sas and smbbr1 pseudomonas is useful in aerobic denitrification and could remove some parts of refractory organic matter which especially suitably exists in low strength wastewater 45 47 in this study the significant consumption of organic matter in the primary mbbr cut off the organic load of the secondary mbbr which might explain the overgrowth of pseudomonas in smbbr2 besides the above mentioned denitrifying genera some others were also detected in the activated sludge and mbbr in this study combining the dominant genera in sas smbbr1 and smbbr2 by pca analysis in fig s6 some denitrification related genera existed primarily in smbbr1 or smbbr2 such as bradyrhizobium rhodococcus rhodobacter thermomonas flavobacterium and hydrogenophaga 48 53 these kinds of genera were speculated to be suitable for living in biofilms however denitrifying genera such as dechloromonas steroidobacter thauera and ignavibacterium 54 57 existed primarily in sas which led to the speculation that they favorably grow in activated sludge the different relative abundances of denitrifying genera between the activated sludge and mbbr require further future studies 4 conclusions a 30000 m3 d wwtp was implemented in guangdong province which combined a two stage aerobic mbbr and the mc process the effluent steadily met the designed discharge standard even though the land occupation was merely 2000 m2 this indicates that the combined mbbr mc process is an effective strategy for the construction of land saving wwtp corresponding to the effluent of the mbbr process the mc process sufficiently removed residual ss tp and some cod within a 3 min sedimentation which ensured that the discharge reached the design standard the relative abundance of the nitrifying genera of the secondary mbbr was higher than that of the primary mbbr leading to a higher nh4 n removal ability for the secondary mbbr meanwhile the primary mbbr was superior to the secondary mbbr in terms of organic matter removal the suspended carrier was more competent in enriching nitrifiers than the activated sludge which was a significant advantage of mbbr however the suspended carriers were insufficient for enriching phosphorus removing bacteria compared with the activated sludge leading to the poor biological tp removal efficiency of the mbbr process this disadvantage must be further studied in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

12816,the present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of reusing dyeing wastewaters treated by electrochemical oxidation eo with a boron doped diamond anode in new dyeing processes a wool fabric was dyed with acid dye telon blue rr using avolan ul 75 and sodium sulfate as dyeing auxiliaries and the wastewater obtained was treated by eo at different applied current densities and treatment times the treated wastewater was then reused in the dyeing process being the resulting wastewater submitted to a new eo treatment and a posterior reuse in another dyeing cycle the successive dyeing processes were evaluated in terms of dye uptake colour difference δe and colour fastness to washing in all eo treatments before and after the reuse complete discolouration of the effluents was observed alongside with partial organic compounds mineralization for all the applied experimental conditions salt content was recovered in full eliminating the need of salt addition in the reused dyeing baths the dyeing processes performed with treated wastewater presented increased dye uptakes with consequent darker colour of the dyed fabrics suggesting that the amount of dye in the reuse dyeing baths could be reduced moreover higher affinity between the dye and the wool fabric was observed when using treated wastewaters with lower organic load and higher mineralization degree for these wastewater conditions obtained at the highest applied current density and treatment time studied a reduction of 15 in dye concentration resulted in a δe of 1 19 complying with the less restrictive δe requirements graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords textile wastewater wastewater reuse telon blue rr electrochemical oxidation boron doped diamond anode data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the growing water scarcity worldwide has forced the adoption of restrictive environmental policies to protect this resource as consequence the availability of freshwater has diminished and the costs of its usage have increased which represents a constraint for water intensive industries like textile industry to overcome this constraint industries need to adopt new water management strategies that reduce the freshwater consumption the reuse of treated wastewater has been highlighted within the eu water policy as an important measure to contribute to a more efficient resource economy 1 however most of the technologies applied to wastewaters treatment are unable to achieve the quality required for its reuse especially when the wastewater is severely contaminated by recalcitrant pollutants generate sludge or concentrates that require further treatment and or present unaffordable costs for the wastewater recycling 2 due to the extensive use of synthetic organic dyes among other chemicals that present high stability under sunlight and resistance to microbial attack and temperature the wastewater produced by the textile industry is very difficult to treat hampering its possible reuse 2 3 thus in the past years several studies have been focused on the development of technologies that enable the treatment of textile industry wastewater tw to comply with the reuse standards 4 14 according to some authors not only the removal of dyes and other pollutants should be addressed when considering a tw treatment for reuse purposes but also the recovery of salts and other constituents that might be reused in the industrial process 9 11 15 also due to the great variability in tw composition as it is a mixture of streams resulting from different processes the possible streams separation should be considered to increase tw treatability and reuse options 16 being the dyeing process the most intensive water and chemicals consumer in the textile industry generating the largest effluent stream with minimally known composition it has been pointed as a good candidate to provide a reusable wastewater after treatment 12 among the technologies studied for the treatment and reuse of textile dyeing baths the electrochemical oxidation eo process has gained increasing attention due to the promising results achieved according to the results described in the literature the treatment of textile dyeing baths by eo not only allows the reuse of the treated baths in new dyeing processes drastically reducing the water consumption but also allows the recovery of salts significantly reducing their consumption in new dyeing baths 4 9 11 12 in fact eo is the most popular electrochemical procedure for removing organic pollutants from wastewaters providing a simple and clean treatment method that does not produce sludge or concentrates 2 when using an appropriate anode material eo enables the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals which can unselectively promote the mineralization of a wide range of organic pollutants 2 from the different anode materials that have been used in the eo of persistent pollutants boron doped diamond bdd attains the best results due to their unique chemical electrochemical and structural stabilities that allow their use at high potentials where most organic pollutants can be oxidized 2 17 18 despite that its application in the eo treatment of textile dyeing baths for reuse purposes has been poorly reported hence the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential consecutive reuse of a wool dyeing wastewater treated by eo using a bdd anode and the feasibility of this process to be utilized as a water economy strategy in the textile industry the influence of eo operational variables namely applied current density and duration of the treatment on the quality of the treated wastewater in terms of pollutants removal and salts recovery and on the quality of the subsequent dyeing processes was assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 dyeing wastewater the dyeing wastewater used in this study was obtained from the dyeing process of a wool fabric utilizing the acid dye telon blue rr c i acid blue 62 dystar and as dyeing auxiliaries avolan ul 75 tanatex an aqueous preparation of alkylaminopolyglycol ether sulfate that is used as leveling agent in the dyeing of wool and sodium sulfate pronalab used to increase the leveling effect fig 1 presents the molecular structure of the utilized dye it was used 100 wool twill fabric weight 351 6 g m 2 and a finesse of yarn warp and weft of 100 tex the dyeing process was carried out in sealed stainless steel mini reactors using a mathis labomat type bfa 12 equipment and following the standard procedure for wool dyeing described in the dystar catalogue wool dyes high performance product ranges to meet all requirements dystar the fabric dyeing bath ratio was 1 50 5 g of wool fabric per 250 ml of dyeing bath and the dyeing bath consisted in an aqueous solution containing 1 of dye fabric w w 2 g l 1 of sodium sulfate and 1 of avolan ul 75 fabric w w at a ph of 3 5 which was adjusted utilizing a sulfuric acid aqueous solution 0 1 mol l 1 the dyeing program involved a heating step from room temperature up to 98 c at 2 c min followed by a 30 min period at this final temperature after this period the mini reactors were maintained in the apparatus for cooling to room temperature then the wool dyed fabrics were removed from the mini reactors and rinsed thoroughly with water to remove the unfixed dye and dried at room conditions the dyeing wastewater was collected for subsequent characterization and utilization in the eo experiments the dye uptake 88 1 and the concentration of the residual dye in the exhausted dyeing baths 22 2 mg l 1 were estimated from absorbance abs measurements at the wavelength of the dye maximum absorbance 637 nm table 1 presents the main characteristics of the dyeing wastewater obtained 2 2 electrochemical treatment the electrochemical treatment of the dyeing wastewater was conducted in batch mode with stirring 300 rpm using an undivided cylindrical cell containing 250 ml of wastewater a commercial si bdd anode purchased from neocoat and a stainless steel cathode each one with an immersed area of 10 cm2 were utilized as electrodes they were placed in parallel with an inter electrode gap of 0 5 cm and were centered in the electrochemical cell eo experiments were performed at different applied current densities namely 20 30 40 and 60 ma cm 2 utilizing a gw lab dc model gps 3030d 0 30 v 0 3 a as power supply at 20 ma cm 2 the eo experiments duration was 6 h at higher applied current densities the experiments were run for 3 and 6 h 2 3 reuse experiments the strategy adopted in this study is summarized in fig 2 the dyeing wastewaters treated at different eo experimental conditions were reused in new dyeing baths prior to its utilization the sulfate ion concentration in the treated wastewaters was determined to evaluate the necessity of adding sodium sulfate in the new dyeing baths the obtained results showed that the addition of sodium sulfate to the new dyeing baths was not required thus only the dye telon blue rr and the avolan ul 75 were added to the dyeing baths prepared with the treated wastewaters as for the primary dyeing the ph of the dyeing baths was adjusted to 3 5 the dyeing procedure was like that described in section 2 1 the wastewater generated during dyeing process with treated wastewater was collected and submitted to a 2nd electrochemical treatment and reuse cycle the 2nd electrochemical treatment was performed under similar experimental conditions of the first treatment and the 2nd reuse cycle followed the procedure described for the first reuse 2 4 analytical methods uv visible absorption spectrophotometric analyses were performed at a shimatzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer chemical oxygen demand cod was determined through the closed reflux titrimetric method following the standard procedures 19 for dissolved organic carbon doc determinations a shimadzu toc vcph analyser was used being the samples previously filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters high performance liquid chromatography hplc was used for sulfate ion quantification following the procedure described elsewhere 20 ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured respectively with a hanna ph meter hi 931400 and a mettler toledo conductivity meter seveneasy s30k the identification of the carboxylic acids in the treated wastewaters was performed by ion exclusion chromatography according to the procedure described elsewhere 21 oxalic maleic oxamic formic and acetic acids were analysed being the retention times of 6 4 7 8 8 9 13 4 and 14 6 min respectively the cielab colour system was applied to evaluate the total colour difference δe between the wool fabric samples dyed with the original dyeing bath prepared with fresh water and that dyed with the reused dyeing baths following the procedure described in the literature 5 spectrophotometric reflectance measurements were performed using a spectraflash sf 300x datacolor international usa reflectance spectrophotometer colour fastness to washing of the fabrics dyed with the original dyeing bath and with the reused dyeing baths was evaluated following the procedure described in iso 105 c06 a2s 2010 22 these washing fastness tests were used to measure the migration of colour to a multifibre fabric to which the dyed fabric to be tested must be attached the multifibre fabric has a sequence of strips of different types of fibres such as acetate cotton polyamide polyester acrylic and wool all the chemicals used were either of analytical grade or hplc grade and were obtained from sigma aldrich rieder de haem merck fluka normapur and pronalab 3 results and discussion in a preliminary set of eo experiments the duration of the eo treatment required for the complete discolouration of the dyeing wastewater visual aspect at different applied current densities was studied it was observed that at 30 40 and 60 ma cm 2 complete discolouration occurred after 3 h of treatment at 20 ma cm 2 complete discolouration was only observed after 6 h of treatment this observation was in accordance with the dye removal which was evaluated through absorbance measurements at 637 nm the wavelength of maximum absorbance of the dye telon blue rr fig 3a the increase in the dye removal rate with applied current density is ascribed to the enhanced production of oxidative species at higher currents which promotes the faster dye degradation in a study performed by solano et al 23 where a textile dyeing wastewater was treated by electrooxidation using a bdd anode and in the presence of sulfate ions an increase in the dye removal rate with applied current density was also observed according to the authors this increase is due to the electrogeneration of peroxodisulfate from sulfate ions which is favoured at higher currents peroxodisulfate is a powerful oxidizing specie e 2 01 v that together with the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals e 2 7 v formed at the bdd anode promote the partial or complete mineralization of the organic compounds 24 25 moreover besides peroxodisulfate sulfate radical can be electrogenerated at bdd either by sulfate ions oxidation or by electrochemical activation of peroxodisulfate 24 25 sulfate radical with higher redox potential than that of hydroxyl radical and peroxodisulfate further contributes to the oxidation of the organic compounds 24 25 regarding the organic load removal although cod and doc removal rates also increased with the applied current density the highest cod and doc removal achieved after 6 h of treatment was of 75 showing that organic load removal is more difficult than discolouration according to the literature this harder cod and doc removal is because usually discolouration only involves a primary oxidation stage while cod and doc reductions may require more complex multistage oxidative reactions 26 nevertheless for all the applied current densities studied the final cod values achieved after 6 h of treatment resulted in a moderate quality water for reuse purposes in textile industry which according to the literature should present a maximum cod of 200 mg l 1 5 attending to the results obtained and aiming to evaluate two different criteria for the quality of the wastewater treated by eo i e complete discolouration and cod concentration eo treatment for wastewater reuse purpose was performed for 3 and 6 h at 30 40 and 60 ma cm 2 for the applied current density of 20 ma cm 2 the treatment was performed only for 6 h since after 3 h of treatment the colour was not completely removed a set of five eo assays were run at each experimental condition studied the treated wastewater obtained from the five assays performed at the same experimental conditions was combined in a single sample which was characterized and then utilized in the first reuse cycle table 2 presents the characterization of the dyeing wastewaters treated by eo at different experimental conditions and the specific energy consumptions esp attained by each treatment esp in wh g cod 1 was calculated by means of eq 1 where u is the cell voltage in v resulting from the applied current intensity i in a δt is the duration of the treatment in s v is the volume of treated wastewater in l and δcod is the removed cod in mg l 1 during δt 1 e sp u i δt 3 6 v δcod all the samples were colour and dye free visually transparent and with abs637nm 0 from table 2 it can be seen that cod and doc ranged between 77 and 198 mg l 1 and 24 68 mg l 1 respectively as already observed in the preliminary eo experiments the lowest cod and doc values were attained for the treatments with higher duration and performed at higher applied current densities nevertheless the process efficiency decreased with the increase in treatment duration and applied current density the lowest esp was attained by the eo treatment performed at 20 ma cm 2 during 6 h followed by the eo treatment performed at 30 ma cm 2 during 3 h according to the literature this loss in efficiency with the increase in applied current density is due to the increase in the number of secondary reactions such as oxygen evolution 27 although these secondary reactions are always present their rate increase with applied current density also at higher current densities the dye degradation becomes a diffusion controlled process thus reducing current efficiency the ph decreased slightly compared to that of the primary dyeing wastewater especially in the treatments with lower duration this trend in ph has been described in the literature as usual for eo with bdd anodes being the decrease in ph during the first hours ascribed to the formation of carboxylic acids and the posterior ph increase attributed to the oxidation of the carboxylic acids to co2 28 the existence of carboxylic acids in the treated samples was assessed by ion exclusion chromatography which revealed the presence of oxamic and oxalic acids the electrical conductivity of the treated samples was quite superior to that required for wastewater reuse purposes in textile industry 1 5 ms cm 1 5 which is mainly due to the sodium and sulfate ions whose concentration was practically unchanged during the eo treatment this fact is of extreme importance since it enables the reuse of the treated dyeing wastewater without being necessary the addition of sodium sulfate salt utilizing the different treated samples obtained from the different applied experimental conditions the first reuse cycle was performed three replicates for each treated wastewater following the same procedure described for the initial dyeing process but utilizing the treated wastewater instead of fresh water and without adding sodium sulfate as for the primary dyeing the ph of the dyeing baths was adjusted to 3 5 the dyeing process was evaluated in terms of dye uptake colour difference δe and colour fastness to washing the dyeing processes performed with treated wastewater attained higher dye uptake than the dyeing process utilizing fresh water fig 4 with no significant differences between the wastewaters treated at different experimental conditions this increased dye uptake can be related to the oxidation by products formed during the eo treatment either from the dye telon blue rr or from the avolan ul 75 utilized as leveling agent in fact avolan ul 75 oxidation and its oxidized metabolites cannot be disregarded since the leveling agent a complex organic compound is added in the same concentration of the dye the electrooxidation of an avolan ul 75 aqueous solution containing sodium sulfate at the same concentrations utilized in the dyeing baths was performed after 6 h treatment at 60 ma cm 2 cod and doc removals of 71 and 58 respectively were attained showing that the leveling agent is oxidized alongside the dye during the electrochemical treatment of the wool dyeing wastewater although in the present work the avolan ul 75 concentration was not monitored along the eo experiments neither where the oxidation by products formed from telon blue rr and avolan ul 75 oxidation it is most likely that similarly to the observed for the dye the avolan ul 75 is oxidized and only the oxidized metabolites are present at the end of the treatment these oxidized metabolites will influence the dyeing process either in the exhaustion or fixation stages 26 the higher dye absorption by the wool fabrics when using the treated effluents was also evidenced by the colour difference results table 3 δe value considers the differences between l a and b values of the fabrics dyed with treated wastewater and that of the fabric dyed with fresh water according to eq 2 where l represent the lightness of the colour l 0 yields black and l 100 indicates diffuse white a represent the colour position between red and green negative values indicate green and positive values indicate red and b represent the colour position between yellow and blue negative values indicate blue and positive values indicate yellow 5 2 δ e δ l 2 δ a 2 δ b 2 although there are restrictive controls that require a maximum δe of 1 0 the smallest value the human eye can detect according to din iso 11664 4 2012 06 29 only a δe above 1 5 is able to induce visible differences in the colour of the fabrics 5 table 3 presents negative δl for all the treated wastewaters indicating that the obtained fabrics were darker in agreement with a higher dye absorption to the fiber δa also presented negative values implying that the fabrics dyed with the treated wastewaters were greener compared to the reference fabric by contrast the high positive δb values indicate that the fabrics from the reuse dyeing process were much more yellow than the reference in fact δb parameter was the one that most contributed for the high δe attained these variations in the colour parameters are most likely related to the higher dye uptake observed for the dyeings with treated wastewater which as described above can be ascribed to the presence of the telon blue rr and avolan ul 75 oxidation by products 26 from the obtained results it could be noticed a relation between the cod of the treated wastewaters used in the dyeing process and the δe and δl fig 5 in general with the increase in the cod δl increases and consequently δe decreases since negative δl values represent darker colour of the fabrics these results indicate that more oxidized degradation products lead to higher affinity of the dye for the fabrics thus it can be considered that the different metabolites formed under different experimental conditions may have an influence on the dye affinity to the fiber in a previous study of the oxidation of textile effluent using na2so4 23 with applied current densities varying between 20 and 60 ma cm 2 different intermediates were identified for the different assays the authors concluded that increasing applied current density decreases the aromatic structures and enhances the aliphatic acids oxidation thus considering the ion exchange chromatographic results obtained in the present study which revealed the presence of oxamic and oxalic acids it seems that more oxidized degradation products namely the aliphatic acids present in the dyeing bath of the fabrics promote a higher affinity of the dye for the wool fabrics the colour fastness to washing was evaluated to verify differences between the primary dyed fabric and the fabrics dyed with the different treated wastewaters the colour transference was evaluated in a scale between 1 and 5 where 5 corresponds to no colour transference colour fastness to washing results presented in table 4 showed that the wool fabrics dyed with the treated wastewaters presented similar behaviour to that observed by the fabrics of the primary dyeing validating the utilization of the treated effluents in new dyeing processes regarding this parameter to evaluate the potential consecutive reuse of the treated wastewaters the wastewaters obtained from the first reuse cycle were submitted to a 2nd eo treatment at the same experimental conditions utilized in the first eo treatment and the obtained treated wastewaters were utilized in a 2nd reuse cycle the characterization of the dyeing wastewaters obtained from the first reuse cycle data presented in supplementary material table sm 1 shows lower dye content given by the absorbance at 637 nm in comparison to that of the primary dyeing wastewater which is in accordance with the higher dye absorption by the wool fabrics during the first reuse cycle nevertheless the cod and doc values were higher for the dyeing wastewaters obtained from the first reuse cycle since the treated wastewater utilized in the dyeing process already had initial cod and doc values of 77 198 mg l 1 and 24 68 mg l 1 respectively table 5 presents the characterization of the different wastewaters after the 2nd eo treatment as well as the specific energy consumptions attained for all the experimental conditions applied colour and dye were completely removed samples visually transparent and with abs637nm 0 although higher final values of cod and doc were attained compared to that of the first eo treatment cod and doc absolute removals were higher during the 2nd eo treatment which resulted in lower esp values than that of the first eo treatment these higher cod and doc absolute removals during the 2nd eo treatment are due to the higher initial cod and doc content of the wastewaters obtained from the first reuse cycle since for higher organics concentration the mass transfer limitations in the electrochemical cell are reduced and thus the eo process is more effective 30 as observed during the first eo treatment sulfate ions concentration was practically unchanged during the 2nd eo treatment enabling the use of the treated wastewaters in the 2nd reuse cycle without being necessary the addition of sodium sulfate salt the 2nd reuse cycle and its performance evaluation followed the procedure applied to the first reuse cycle utilizing the different treated samples obtained from the 2nd eo treatment although the samples obtained from the 2nd eo treatment presented higher cod and doc values than the samples utilized in the first reuse cycle similar performance was attained at the two dyeing processes as for the first reuse cycle dye uptake between 93 and 94 were observed for the 2nd reuse cycle supplementary material fig sm 1 confirming the higher dye absorption by the wool fabrics when using the effluents treated by eo regarding the colour differences table 6 the dyed fabrics obtained from the 2nd reuse cycle also presented a darker colour compared to that of the fabrics dyed with fresh water confirmed by the negative δl values and in agreement with a higher dye absorption the δe values presented by the dyed fabrics from the 2nd reuse cycle were slightly higher than that of the dyed fabrics from the first reuse cycle this increase in the δe values with the number of reuse cycles is in accordance with other studies reported in the literature and is ascribed to the consecutive accumulation of the degradation by products 26 the colour fastness to washing assays supplementary material table sm 2 showed no significant differences between the fabrics of the primary dyeing and the fabrics dyed with the treated wastewaters from the 2nd eo treatment the results obtained from the 1st and 2nd eo treatments show that the treatment effectiveness regarding the colour and organic load removals and the sodium sulfate recovery were not compromised by the reuse cycle nevertheless due to the residual organic load content from the 1st eo treatment the cod and doc concentrations after the 2nd eo treatment were increased which can be a constraint for further reuse cycles being eo process characterized by its versatility and ease in operation 31 operational parameters such as applied current density and treatment time can be easily adjusted according to the wastewater characteristics to fulfil the desired outcome thus the possible problem raised by the increase in the organic load content during the consecutive reuse cycles can be easily overcome allowing multiple reuse cycles even when the reuse of the wastewater is no longer an option because for instance the treatment cost has become too high eo treatment can be performed to achieve the minimum requirements to be discharge in a traditional biological treatment plant or to be reused in different applications such as facilities washing regarding the performance of the treated wastewater in new dyeing processes 1st and 2nd reuse cycles it could be seen that the use of the treated wastewater leads to increased telon blue rr uptake without affecting the colour fastness to washing results as consequence the dyed fabrics present darker colour being the δe requirements not complied this finding foresees the possible reduction of the amount of dye required for the dyeing process when using the treated wastewater in order to test this thesis new dyeing processes were performed where the dye concentration was reduced according to the obtained results more oxidized degradation products lead to higher affinity of the dye for the fabrics thus for the dyeing experiments utilizing reduced dye concentration it was chosen the treated wastewater at 60 ma cm 2 for 6 h after the 1st eo treatment the dyeing process followed the procedure described for the reuse cycles being the dye concentrations tested of 0 80 0 85 and 0 90 dye fabric w w table 7 presents the colour difference results between the wool fabric samples dyed with the original dyeing bath and those dyed with the treated wastewater at 60 ma cm 2 for 6 h utilizing reduced dye concentrations when reducing the dye concentration in 10 0 90 dye fabric w w δe value was lower than that obtained for the fabric dyed with 1 of dye 4 96 utilizing treated wastewater at the same eo experimental conditions still the fabric was darker and much yellower than the reference thus dyeing experiments were performed where the dye concentration was reduced in 20 although the δe value got closer to the δe requirements the fabric was now lighter than the reference considering these results a reduction in 15 of dye was evaluated being the obtained results close to the δe requirements these results confirm that when using treated wastewater the amount of dye required for an effective dyeing is inferior to that required when using fresh water as described above this outcome is probably related to the oxidized metabolites from the telon blue rr and avolan ul 75 oxidation which enhance the affinity of the dye for the fabrics this reduction in the amount of dye required to perform the dyeing combined with the sodium sulfate salt recovery making unnecessary its addition in new dyeing baths are promising features for the application of eo process with reuse purposes the electric energy consumption for the electrochemical cell operation at the different experimental conditions studied e in kwh m 3 was calculated by means of eq 3 where u is the average cell voltage in v resulting from the applied current intensity i in a δt is the duration of the treatment in h and v is the volume of treated wastewater in l 3 e u i δt v the electric energy consumptions varied from 22 1 to 103 7 kwh m 3 increasing with the applied current density and treatment time the lowest electric energy consumption attained by the 3 h treatment at 30 ma cm 2 corresponds to a treatment cost of approximately 3 14 m 3 considering an electric energy cost of 0 14 kwh 1 average cost in portugal in 2021 although this treatment cost is higher than others presented in the literature for dyeing wastewater reuse purposes it must be highlighted that no addition of reagents is required for the eo treatment process and that complete recovery of salts are attained eliminating the cost associated to the salt addition in new dyeing processes and the environmental implications of rejecting salts in the effluent furthermore considering the higher dye uptake observed when using the treated effluents lower concentration of acid dye telon blue rr is required for the dyeing thus lowering the costs related to the dye another advantage is that the dyeing wastewaters can be treated in situ through a versatile and ease in operation electrochemical cell installed in the dyeing plant which allows the adjustment of the operational parameters according to the wastewater characteristics and the desired outcome 4 conclusion electrochemical oxidation using a bdd anode is a feasible process to be employed as a water economy strategy in the textile industry it provides a discolourised treated effluent that can be reused in new dyeing processes besides the drastic reduction in water consumption eo treatment allows the full recovery of salts eliminating the need of salt addition in new dyeing baths furthermore the dyeing wastewaters treated by eo using a bdd anode lead to increased telon blue rr uptake during the dyeing process thus reducing the amount of dye required to perform the dyeing treated wastewaters with lower cod and doc eo at higher applied current

12816,the present study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of reusing dyeing wastewaters treated by electrochemical oxidation eo with a boron doped diamond anode in new dyeing processes a wool fabric was dyed with acid dye telon blue rr using avolan ul 75 and sodium sulfate as dyeing auxiliaries and the wastewater obtained was treated by eo at different applied current densities and treatment times the treated wastewater was then reused in the dyeing process being the resulting wastewater submitted to a new eo treatment and a posterior reuse in another dyeing cycle the successive dyeing processes were evaluated in terms of dye uptake colour difference δe and colour fastness to washing in all eo treatments before and after the reuse complete discolouration of the effluents was observed alongside with partial organic compounds mineralization for all the applied experimental conditions salt content was recovered in full eliminating the need of salt addition in the reused dyeing baths the dyeing processes performed with treated wastewater presented increased dye uptakes with consequent darker colour of the dyed fabrics suggesting that the amount of dye in the reuse dyeing baths could be reduced moreover higher affinity between the dye and the wool fabric was observed when using treated wastewaters with lower organic load and higher mineralization degree for these wastewater conditions obtained at the highest applied current density and treatment time studied a reduction of 15 in dye concentration resulted in a δe of 1 19 complying with the less restrictive δe requirements graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords textile wastewater wastewater reuse telon blue rr electrochemical oxidation boron doped diamond anode data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the growing water scarcity worldwide has forced the adoption of restrictive environmental policies to protect this resource as consequence the availability of freshwater has diminished and the costs of its usage have increased which represents a constraint for water intensive industries like textile industry to overcome this constraint industries need to adopt new water management strategies that reduce the freshwater consumption the reuse of treated wastewater has been highlighted within the eu water policy as an important measure to contribute to a more efficient resource economy 1 however most of the technologies applied to wastewaters treatment are unable to achieve the quality required for its reuse especially when the wastewater is severely contaminated by recalcitrant pollutants generate sludge or concentrates that require further treatment and or present unaffordable costs for the wastewater recycling 2 due to the extensive use of synthetic organic dyes among other chemicals that present high stability under sunlight and resistance to microbial attack and temperature the wastewater produced by the textile industry is very difficult to treat hampering its possible reuse 2 3 thus in the past years several studies have been focused on the development of technologies that enable the treatment of textile industry wastewater tw to comply with the reuse standards 4 14 according to some authors not only the removal of dyes and other pollutants should be addressed when considering a tw treatment for reuse purposes but also the recovery of salts and other constituents that might be reused in the industrial process 9 11 15 also due to the great variability in tw composition as it is a mixture of streams resulting from different processes the possible streams separation should be considered to increase tw treatability and reuse options 16 being the dyeing process the most intensive water and chemicals consumer in the textile industry generating the largest effluent stream with minimally known composition it has been pointed as a good candidate to provide a reusable wastewater after treatment 12 among the technologies studied for the treatment and reuse of textile dyeing baths the electrochemical oxidation eo process has gained increasing attention due to the promising results achieved according to the results described in the literature the treatment of textile dyeing baths by eo not only allows the reuse of the treated baths in new dyeing processes drastically reducing the water consumption but also allows the recovery of salts significantly reducing their consumption in new dyeing baths 4 9 11 12 in fact eo is the most popular electrochemical procedure for removing organic pollutants from wastewaters providing a simple and clean treatment method that does not produce sludge or concentrates 2 when using an appropriate anode material eo enables the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals which can unselectively promote the mineralization of a wide range of organic pollutants 2 from the different anode materials that have been used in the eo of persistent pollutants boron doped diamond bdd attains the best results due to their unique chemical electrochemical and structural stabilities that allow their use at high potentials where most organic pollutants can be oxidized 2 17 18 despite that its application in the eo treatment of textile dyeing baths for reuse purposes has been poorly reported hence the objective of this study was to evaluate the potential consecutive reuse of a wool dyeing wastewater treated by eo using a bdd anode and the feasibility of this process to be utilized as a water economy strategy in the textile industry the influence of eo operational variables namely applied current density and duration of the treatment on the quality of the treated wastewater in terms of pollutants removal and salts recovery and on the quality of the subsequent dyeing processes was assessed 2 materials and methods 2 1 dyeing wastewater the dyeing wastewater used in this study was obtained from the dyeing process of a wool fabric utilizing the acid dye telon blue rr c i acid blue 62 dystar and as dyeing auxiliaries avolan ul 75 tanatex an aqueous preparation of alkylaminopolyglycol ether sulfate that is used as leveling agent in the dyeing of wool and sodium sulfate pronalab used to increase the leveling effect fig 1 presents the molecular structure of the utilized dye it was used 100 wool twill fabric weight 351 6 g m 2 and a finesse of yarn warp and weft of 100 tex the dyeing process was carried out in sealed stainless steel mini reactors using a mathis labomat type bfa 12 equipment and following the standard procedure for wool dyeing described in the dystar catalogue wool dyes high performance product ranges to meet all requirements dystar the fabric dyeing bath ratio was 1 50 5 g of wool fabric per 250 ml of dyeing bath and the dyeing bath consisted in an aqueous solution containing 1 of dye fabric w w 2 g l 1 of sodium sulfate and 1 of avolan ul 75 fabric w w at a ph of 3 5 which was adjusted utilizing a sulfuric acid aqueous solution 0 1 mol l 1 the dyeing program involved a heating step from room temperature up to 98 c at 2 c min followed by a 30 min period at this final temperature after this period the mini reactors were maintained in the apparatus for cooling to room temperature then the wool dyed fabrics were removed from the mini reactors and rinsed thoroughly with water to remove the unfixed dye and dried at room conditions the dyeing wastewater was collected for subsequent characterization and utilization in the eo experiments the dye uptake 88 1 and the concentration of the residual dye in the exhausted dyeing baths 22 2 mg l 1 were estimated from absorbance abs measurements at the wavelength of the dye maximum absorbance 637 nm table 1 presents the main characteristics of the dyeing wastewater obtained 2 2 electrochemical treatment the electrochemical treatment of the dyeing wastewater was conducted in batch mode with stirring 300 rpm using an undivided cylindrical cell containing 250 ml of wastewater a commercial si bdd anode purchased from neocoat and a stainless steel cathode each one with an immersed area of 10 cm2 were utilized as electrodes they were placed in parallel with an inter electrode gap of 0 5 cm and were centered in the electrochemical cell eo experiments were performed at different applied current densities namely 20 30 40 and 60 ma cm 2 utilizing a gw lab dc model gps 3030d 0 30 v 0 3 a as power supply at 20 ma cm 2 the eo experiments duration was 6 h at higher applied current densities the experiments were run for 3 and 6 h 2 3 reuse experiments the strategy adopted in this study is summarized in fig 2 the dyeing wastewaters treated at different eo experimental conditions were reused in new dyeing baths prior to its utilization the sulfate ion concentration in the treated wastewaters was determined to evaluate the necessity of adding sodium sulfate in the new dyeing baths the obtained results showed that the addition of sodium sulfate to the new dyeing baths was not required thus only the dye telon blue rr and the avolan ul 75 were added to the dyeing baths prepared with the treated wastewaters as for the primary dyeing the ph of the dyeing baths was adjusted to 3 5 the dyeing procedure was like that described in section 2 1 the wastewater generated during dyeing process with treated wastewater was collected and submitted to a 2nd electrochemical treatment and reuse cycle the 2nd electrochemical treatment was performed under similar experimental conditions of the first treatment and the 2nd reuse cycle followed the procedure described for the first reuse 2 4 analytical methods uv visible absorption spectrophotometric analyses were performed at a shimatzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer chemical oxygen demand cod was determined through the closed reflux titrimetric method following the standard procedures 19 for dissolved organic carbon doc determinations a shimadzu toc vcph analyser was used being the samples previously filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters high performance liquid chromatography hplc was used for sulfate ion quantification following the procedure described elsewhere 20 ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured respectively with a hanna ph meter hi 931400 and a mettler toledo conductivity meter seveneasy s30k the identification of the carboxylic acids in the treated wastewaters was performed by ion exclusion chromatography according to the procedure described elsewhere 21 oxalic maleic oxamic formic and acetic acids were analysed being the retention times of 6 4 7 8 8 9 13 4 and 14 6 min respectively the cielab colour system was applied to evaluate the total colour difference δe between the wool fabric samples dyed with the original dyeing bath prepared with fresh water and that dyed with the reused dyeing baths following the procedure described in the literature 5 spectrophotometric reflectance measurements were performed using a spectraflash sf 300x datacolor international usa reflectance spectrophotometer colour fastness to washing of the fabrics dyed with the original dyeing bath and with the reused dyeing baths was evaluated following the procedure described in iso 105 c06 a2s 2010 22 these washing fastness tests were used to measure the migration of colour to a multifibre fabric to which the dyed fabric to be tested must be attached the multifibre fabric has a sequence of strips of different types of fibres such as acetate cotton polyamide polyester acrylic and wool all the chemicals used were either of analytical grade or hplc grade and were obtained from sigma aldrich rieder de haem merck fluka normapur and pronalab 3 results and discussion in a preliminary set of eo experiments the duration of the eo treatment required for the complete discolouration of the dyeing wastewater visual aspect at different applied current densities was studied it was observed that at 30 40 and 60 ma cm 2 complete discolouration occurred after 3 h of treatment at 20 ma cm 2 complete discolouration was only observed after 6 h of treatment this observation was in accordance with the dye removal which was evaluated through absorbance measurements at 637 nm the wavelength of maximum absorbance of the dye telon blue rr fig 3a the increase in the dye removal rate with applied current density is ascribed to the enhanced production of oxidative species at higher currents which promotes the faster dye degradation in a study performed by solano et al 23 where a textile dyeing wastewater was treated by electrooxidation using a bdd anode and in the presence of sulfate ions an increase in the dye removal rate with applied current density was also observed according to the authors this increase is due to the electrogeneration of peroxodisulfate from sulfate ions which is favoured at higher currents peroxodisulfate is a powerful oxidizing specie e 2 01 v that together with the highly reactive hydroxyl radicals e 2 7 v formed at the bdd anode promote the partial or complete mineralization of the organic compounds 24 25 moreover besides peroxodisulfate sulfate radical can be electrogenerated at bdd either by sulfate ions oxidation or by electrochemical activation of peroxodisulfate 24 25 sulfate radical with higher redox potential than that of hydroxyl radical and peroxodisulfate further contributes to the oxidation of the organic compounds 24 25 regarding the organic load removal although cod and doc removal rates also increased with the applied current density the highest cod and doc removal achieved after 6 h of treatment was of 75 showing that organic load removal is more difficult than discolouration according to the literature this harder cod and doc removal is because usually discolouration only involves a primary oxidation stage while cod and doc reductions may require more complex multistage oxidative reactions 26 nevertheless for all the applied current densities studied the final cod values achieved after 6 h of treatment resulted in a moderate quality water for reuse purposes in textile industry which according to the literature should present a maximum cod of 200 mg l 1 5 attending to the results obtained and aiming to evaluate two different criteria for the quality of the wastewater treated by eo i e complete discolouration and cod concentration eo treatment for wastewater reuse purpose was performed for 3 and 6 h at 30 40 and 60 ma cm 2 for the applied current density of 20 ma cm 2 the treatment was performed only for 6 h since after 3 h of treatment the colour was not completely removed a set of five eo assays were run at each experimental condition studied the treated wastewater obtained from the five assays performed at the same experimental conditions was combined in a single sample which was characterized and then utilized in the first reuse cycle table 2 presents the characterization of the dyeing wastewaters treated by eo at different experimental conditions and the specific energy consumptions esp attained by each treatment esp in wh g cod 1 was calculated by means of eq 1 where u is the cell voltage in v resulting from the applied current intensity i in a δt is the duration of the treatment in s v is the volume of treated wastewater in l and δcod is the removed cod in mg l 1 during δt 1 e sp u i δt 3 6 v δcod all the samples were colour and dye free visually transparent and with abs637nm 0 from table 2 it can be seen that cod and doc ranged between 77 and 198 mg l 1 and 24 68 mg l 1 respectively as already observed in the preliminary eo experiments the lowest cod and doc values were attained for the treatments with higher duration and performed at higher applied current densities nevertheless the process efficiency decreased with the increase in treatment duration and applied current density the lowest esp was attained by the eo treatment performed at 20 ma cm 2 during 6 h followed by the eo treatment performed at 30 ma cm 2 during 3 h according to the literature this loss in efficiency with the increase in applied current density is due to the increase in the number of secondary reactions such as oxygen evolution 27 although these secondary reactions are always present their rate increase with applied current density also at higher current densities the dye degradation becomes a diffusion controlled process thus reducing current efficiency the ph decreased slightly compared to that of the primary dyeing wastewater especially in the treatments with lower duration this trend in ph has been described in the literature as usual for eo with bdd anodes being the decrease in ph during the first hours ascribed to the formation of carboxylic acids and the posterior ph increase attributed to the oxidation of the carboxylic acids to co2 28 the existence of carboxylic acids in the treated samples was assessed by ion exclusion chromatography which revealed the presence of oxamic and oxalic acids the electrical conductivity of the treated samples was quite superior to that required for wastewater reuse purposes in textile industry 1 5 ms cm 1 5 which is mainly due to the sodium and sulfate ions whose concentration was practically unchanged during the eo treatment this fact is of extreme importance since it enables the reuse of the treated dyeing wastewater without being necessary the addition of sodium sulfate salt utilizing the different treated samples obtained from the different applied experimental conditions the first reuse cycle was performed three replicates for each treated wastewater following the same procedure described for the initial dyeing process but utilizing the treated wastewater instead of fresh water and without adding sodium sulfate as for the primary dyeing the ph of the dyeing baths was adjusted to 3 5 the dyeing process was evaluated in terms of dye uptake colour difference δe and colour fastness to washing the dyeing processes performed with treated wastewater attained higher dye uptake than the dyeing process utilizing fresh water fig 4 with no significant differences between the wastewaters treated at different experimental conditions this increased dye uptake can be related to the oxidation by products formed during the eo treatment either from the dye telon blue rr or from the avolan ul 75 utilized as leveling agent in fact avolan ul 75 oxidation and its oxidized metabolites cannot be disregarded since the leveling agent a complex organic compound is added in the same concentration of the dye the electrooxidation of an avolan ul 75 aqueous solution containing sodium sulfate at the same concentrations utilized in the dyeing baths was performed after 6 h treatment at 60 ma cm 2 cod and doc removals of 71 and 58 respectively were attained showing that the leveling agent is oxidized alongside the dye during the electrochemical treatment of the wool dyeing wastewater although in the present work the avolan ul 75 concentration was not monitored along the eo experiments neither where the oxidation by products formed from telon blue rr and avolan ul 75 oxidation it is most likely that similarly to the observed for the dye the avolan ul 75 is oxidized and only the oxidized metabolites are present at the end of the treatment these oxidized metabolites will influence the dyeing process either in the exhaustion or fixation stages 26 the higher dye absorption by the wool fabrics when using the treated effluents was also evidenced by the colour difference results table 3 δe value considers the differences between l a and b values of the fabrics dyed with treated wastewater and that of the fabric dyed with fresh water according to eq 2 where l represent the lightness of the colour l 0 yields black and l 100 indicates diffuse white a represent the colour position between red and green negative values indicate green and positive values indicate red and b represent the colour position between yellow and blue negative values indicate blue and positive values indicate yellow 5 2 δ e δ l 2 δ a 2 δ b 2 although there are restrictive controls that require a maximum δe of 1 0 the smallest value the human eye can detect according to din iso 11664 4 2012 06 29 only a δe above 1 5 is able to induce visible differences in the colour of the fabrics 5 table 3 presents negative δl for all the treated wastewaters indicating that the obtained fabrics were darker in agreement with a higher dye absorption to the fiber δa also presented negative values implying that the fabrics dyed with the treated wastewaters were greener compared to the reference fabric by contrast the high positive δb values indicate that the fabrics from the reuse dyeing process were much more yellow than the reference in fact δb parameter was the one that most contributed for the high δe attained these variations in the colour parameters are most likely related to the higher dye uptake observed for the dyeings with treated wastewater which as described above can be ascribed to the presence of the telon blue rr and avolan ul 75 oxidation by products 26 from the obtained results it could be noticed a relation between the cod of the treated wastewaters used in the dyeing process and the δe and δl fig 5 in general with the increase in the cod δl increases and consequently δe decreases since negative δl values represent darker colour of the fabrics these results indicate that more oxidized degradation products lead to higher affinity of the dye for the fabrics thus it can be considered that the different metabolites formed under different experimental conditions may have an influence on the dye affinity to the fiber in a previous study of the oxidation of textile effluent using na2so4 23 with applied current densities varying between 20 and 60 ma cm 2 different intermediates were identified for the different assays the authors concluded that increasing applied current density decreases the aromatic structures and enhances the aliphatic acids oxidation thus considering the ion exchange chromatographic results obtained in the present study which revealed the presence of oxamic and oxalic acids it seems that more oxidized degradation products namely the aliphatic acids present in the dyeing bath of the fabrics promote a higher affinity of the dye for the wool fabrics the colour fastness to washing was evaluated to verify differences between the primary dyed fabric and the fabrics dyed with the different treated wastewaters the colour transference was evaluated in a scale between 1 and 5 where 5 corresponds to no colour transference colour fastness to washing results presented in table 4 showed that the wool fabrics dyed with the treated wastewaters presented similar behaviour to that observed by the fabrics of the primary dyeing validating the utilization of the treated effluents in new dyeing processes regarding this parameter to evaluate the potential consecutive reuse of the treated wastewaters the wastewaters obtained from the first reuse cycle were submitted to a 2nd eo treatment at the same experimental conditions utilized in the first eo treatment and the obtained treated wastewaters were utilized in a 2nd reuse cycle the characterization of the dyeing wastewaters obtained from the first reuse cycle data presented in supplementary material table sm 1 shows lower dye content given by the absorbance at 637 nm in comparison to that of the primary dyeing wastewater which is in accordance with the higher dye absorption by the wool fabrics during the first reuse cycle nevertheless the cod and doc values were higher for the dyeing wastewaters obtained from the first reuse cycle since the treated wastewater utilized in the dyeing process already had initial cod and doc values of 77 198 mg l 1 and 24 68 mg l 1 respectively table 5 presents the characterization of the different wastewaters after the 2nd eo treatment as well as the specific energy consumptions attained for all the experimental conditions applied colour and dye were completely removed samples visually transparent and with abs637nm 0 although higher final values of cod and doc were attained compared to that of the first eo treatment cod and doc absolute removals were higher during the 2nd eo treatment which resulted in lower esp values than that of the first eo treatment these higher cod and doc absolute removals during the 2nd eo treatment are due to the higher initial cod and doc content of the wastewaters obtained from the first reuse cycle since for higher organics concentration the mass transfer limitations in the electrochemical cell are reduced and thus the eo process is more effective 30 as observed during the first eo treatment sulfate ions concentration was practically unchanged during the 2nd eo treatment enabling the use of the treated wastewaters in the 2nd reuse cycle without being necessary the addition of sodium sulfate salt the 2nd reuse cycle and its performance evaluation followed the procedure applied to the first reuse cycle utilizing the different treated samples obtained from the 2nd eo treatment although the samples obtained from the 2nd eo treatment presented higher cod and doc values than the samples utilized in the first reuse cycle similar performance was attained at the two dyeing processes as for the first reuse cycle dye uptake between 93 and 94 were observed for the 2nd reuse cycle supplementary material fig sm 1 confirming the higher dye absorption by the wool fabrics when using the effluents treated by eo regarding the colour differences table 6 the dyed fabrics obtained from the 2nd reuse cycle also presented a darker colour compared to that of the fabrics dyed with fresh water confirmed by the negative δl values and in agreement with a higher dye absorption the δe values presented by the dyed fabrics from the 2nd reuse cycle were slightly higher than that of the dyed fabrics from the first reuse cycle this increase in the δe values with the number of reuse cycles is in accordance with other studies reported in the literature and is ascribed to the consecutive accumulation of the degradation by products 26 the colour fastness to washing assays supplementary material table sm 2 showed no significant differences between the fabrics of the primary dyeing and the fabrics dyed with the treated wastewaters from the 2nd eo treatment the results obtained from the 1st and 2nd eo treatments show that the treatment effectiveness regarding the colour and organic load removals and the sodium sulfate recovery were not compromised by the reuse cycle nevertheless due to the residual organic load content from the 1st eo treatment the cod and doc concentrations after the 2nd eo treatment were increased which can be a constraint for further reuse cycles being eo process characterized by its versatility and ease in operation 31 operational parameters such as applied current density and treatment time can be easily adjusted according to the wastewater characteristics to fulfil the desired outcome thus the possible problem raised by the increase in the organic load content during the consecutive reuse cycles can be easily overcome allowing multiple reuse cycles even when the reuse of the wastewater is no longer an option because for instance the treatment cost has become too high eo treatment can be performed to achieve the minimum requirements to be discharge in a traditional biological treatment plant or to be reused in different applications such as facilities washing regarding the performance of the treated wastewater in new dyeing processes 1st and 2nd reuse cycles it could be seen that the use of the treated wastewater leads to increased telon blue rr uptake without affecting the colour fastness to washing results as consequence the dyed fabrics present darker colour being the δe requirements not complied this finding foresees the possible reduction of the amount of dye required for the dyeing process when using the treated wastewater in order to test this thesis new dyeing processes were performed where the dye concentration was reduced according to the obtained results more oxidized degradation products lead to higher affinity of the dye for the fabrics thus for the dyeing experiments utilizing reduced dye concentration it was chosen the treated wastewater at 60 ma cm 2 for 6 h after the 1st eo treatment the dyeing process followed the procedure described for the reuse cycles being the dye concentrations tested of 0 80 0 85 and 0 90 dye fabric w w table 7 presents the colour difference results between the wool fabric samples dyed with the original dyeing bath and those dyed with the treated wastewater at 60 ma cm 2 for 6 h utilizing reduced dye concentrations when reducing the dye concentration in 10 0 90 dye fabric w w δe value was lower than that obtained for the fabric dyed with 1 of dye 4 96 utilizing treated wastewater at the same eo experimental conditions still the fabric was darker and much yellower than the reference thus dyeing experiments were performed where the dye concentration was reduced in 20 although the δe value got closer to the δe requirements the fabric was now lighter than the reference considering these results a reduction in 15 of dye was evaluated being the obtained results close to the δe requirements these results confirm that when using treated wastewater the amount of dye required for an effective dyeing is inferior to that required when using fresh water as described above this outcome is probably related to the oxidized metabolites from the telon blue rr and avolan ul 75 oxidation which enhance the affinity of the dye for the fabrics this reduction in the amount of dye required to perform the dyeing combined with the sodium sulfate salt recovery making unnecessary its addition in new dyeing baths are promising features for the application of eo process with reuse purposes the electric energy consumption for the electrochemical cell operation at the different experimental conditions studied e in kwh m 3 was calculated by means of eq 3 where u is the average cell voltage in v resulting from the applied current intensity i in a δt is the duration of the treatment in h and v is the volume of treated wastewater in l 3 e u i δt v the electric energy consumptions varied from 22 1 to 103 7 kwh m 3 increasing with the applied current density and treatment time the lowest electric energy consumption attained by the 3 h treatment at 30 ma cm 2 corresponds to a treatment cost of approximately 3 14 m 3 considering an electric energy cost of 0 14 kwh 1 average cost in portugal in 2021 although this treatment cost is higher than others presented in the literature for dyeing wastewater reuse purposes it must be highlighted that no addition of reagents is required for the eo treatment process and that complete recovery of salts are attained eliminating the cost associated to the salt addition in new dyeing processes and the environmental implications of rejecting salts in the effluent furthermore considering the higher dye uptake observed when using the treated effluents lower concentration of acid dye telon blue rr is required for the dyeing thus lowering the costs related to the dye another advantage is that the dyeing wastewaters can be treated in situ through a versatile and ease in operation electrochemical cell installed in the dyeing plant which allows the adjustment of the operational parameters according to the wastewater characteristics and the desired outcome 4 conclusion electrochemical oxidation using a bdd anode is a feasible process to be employed as a water economy strategy in the textile industry it provides a discolourised treated effluent that can be reused in new dyeing processes besides the drastic reduction in water consumption eo treatment allows the full recovery of salts eliminating the need of salt addition in new dyeing baths furthermore the dyeing wastewaters treated by eo using a bdd anode lead to increased telon blue rr uptake during the dyeing process thus reducing the amount of dye required to perform the dyeing treated wastewaters with lower cod and doc eo at higher applied current densities and treatment durations lead to higher dye absorption to the fiber showing that degradation products with higher oxidation degree positively interfere in the dyeing process when reducing in 15 the concentration of telon blue rr in dyeing baths prepared with treated wastewater at 60 ma cm 2 for 6 h a total colour difference δe of 1 19 was attained complying with the less restrictive requirements the organic load of the treated effluent used in the 2nd reuse cycle was higher than that of the 1st reuse however similar performance was attained in the two dyeing processes confirming the higher telon blue rr absorption by the wool fabrics whenever treated wastewaters are utilized funding this work was supported by the fundação para a ciência e a tecnologia fct project uidb 00195

12817,a water and green ammonia recovery strategy for anaerobic digestion ad effluent treatment through a two stage membrane distillation 2s md was put forward in this study in the 1st stage the map monoammonium phosphate solution nh4h2po4 dap diammonium phosphate solution nh4 2hpo4 loop was used as the recyclable ammonia absorbent to recover ammonia from ad effluent the multicycle ammonia absorption regeneration experiments illustrated that the ammonia removal efficiency was stable 81 and the recovered ammonia solution was 1 05 mol l in the 2nd stage the water recovery experiments from ad effluent with different ammonia concentrations were conducted the results indicated that the water recovered from ammonia removed ad effluent could be adopted as the general industrial or agricultural water finally the economic evaluation demonstrated that the application of map solution as the recyclable ammonia absorbent was more economically efficient than the sulfuric acid solution the treatment cost and net profit of ad effluent treatment by 2s md were 1 73 m3 and 0 83 m3 respectively the 2s md can be acted as a valuable candidate strategy for sustainable green ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent keywords ammonia removal water recovery recyclable solvent membrane distillation anaerobic digestion effluent 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been extensively applied for livestock and poultry waste treatment by converting the biodegradable organic pollutants into organic fertilizers and biogas 1 the liquid effluent discharged from the ad digester has a high content of nutrients such as ammonium nitrogen phosphate and potassium 2 especially the total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration may be higher than 5000 mg n l 3 generally the amount of liquid effluent accounts for 80 of the total ad residues 4 given the high organic loading and nutrient concentration of ad effluent 5 it is vital to seek the appropriate treatment method for ad effluent 6 7 predictably if 6 2 billion m3 of ad effluent produced annually in china can be treated efficiently 5 about 3 1 31 million tons of nitrogen and about 5 89 billion m3 of reclaimed water may be recovered otherwise the potential environmental pollution may be caused by the direct application of these ad effluents 3 obviously recovering useful resources like ammonia nitrogen and water from the ad effluent is essential two possible procedures have been developed for recovering the ammonia nitrogen and water efficiently from the ad effluent the first procedure is to recover water from the acidified ad effluent and concentrate the nutrients such as ammonia nitrogen and phosphate simultaneously followed by the separation of ammonia nitrogen from the concentrated ad effluent after ph adjustment by adding the alkali this procedure may be chemical intensive because of the good acid base buffering performance of ad effluent 7 another procedure is ammonia nitrogen recovery from the ad effluent firstly and then water recovery from the treated ad effluent ensued ideally ammonia transfer from the ad effluent into the reclaimed water can be inhibited for achieving an improved water quality in this procedure 8 which makes it a promising approach for ad effluent treatment known as a typical thermally driven process membrane distillation md is a promising membrane technology for ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent because of the high volatility of ammonia and water 9 11 compared with these membrane processes including forward osmosis fo reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and microfiltration mf md operates at a lower hydrostatic pressure enabling fouling resistance the water recovery process via md is not limited by the concentration degree of treated wastewater in addition it is especially beneficial when the low grade or waste heat is available in the md process 7 12 15 as for ammonia recovery plenty of technologies such as ion exchange 16 nitrification denitrification 16 chemical precipitation 17 and air stripping 18 have been investigated however the ammonia recovery efficiency was not satisfied when treating ad effluent with the technologies mentioned above in terms of a combination of economic environmental and energy considerations 19 21 comparatively md seems a promising approach for fast ammonia recovery from ad effluent 9 wherein the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd 22 23 vacuum membrane distillation vmd 24 25 and sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd processes 26 have been extensively experimented typically due to the low free ammonia content the ph increment of feed ad effluent greatly relies on the consumption of alkali 9 11 on the permeate side acid solutions are always used for ammonia recovery 27 to reduce the alkali consumption vacuum or aeration was applied on the feed side 9 28 however the ammonia removal performance needs to be improved to minimize the acid solutions consumption vmd is put forward to recover ammonia but the separation factor is too low to be applied in industry 9 during the ammonia recovery the chemical consumption cost accounts for 48 of the operating cost 9 making the development of new technology featured with a low chemical consumption and a satisfied ammonia recovery performance important to solve these problems as mentioned above a novel two stage membrane distillation 2s md process is put forward in this study as shown in fig 1 ammonia is recovered from ad effluent in the 1st stage md and the water is recovered from the ammonia removed ad effluent in the 2nd stage md especially a dcmd based green ammonia recovery strategy is developed in the 1st stage md wherein recyclable ammonia receiving solution is adopted to get rid of the acid consumption required in the conventional dcmd process 29 and aeration is also combined to improve the ammonia recovery efficiency other than the exogenous alkali addition 30 in this strategy the monoammonium phosphate map nh4h2po4 solution is used as a recyclable ammonia receiving solution according to eq 1 map has an affinity toward free ammonia from ad effluent to form the ammonia rich map i e dap through the thermal regeneration of dap as reported by rice and busa 31 the aqueous ammonia solution with a concentration of 15 25 wt can be achieved ideally the map dap loop may be the good ammonia absorbent for recovering ammonia from ad effluent by dcmd to achieve a sustainable ad effluent treatment by the novel 2s md process 2 key problems should be investigated including the feasibility of adopting map solution as the stable ammonia absorbent for high performance ammonia recovery in the 1st stage md and the technical feasibility of clean water recovery from the alkaline ad effluent after ammonia removal in the 2nd stage md 1 nh 4 h 2 po 4 nh 3 absorbtion desorption nh 4 2 hpo 4 in this study ammonia recovery performance was experimentally investigated in the 1st stage md by using map solution and then ammonia desorption performance was also evaluated furthermore multicycle experiments were conducted to explore the stability of ammonia recovery using the map dap loop after ammonia recovery extensive investigations were performed in 2nd stage md to recover water from the treated ad effluent with different ammonia concentrations in terms of the water quality finally a techno economic evaluation was performed to provide a deep insight into the sustainable green ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent by the 2s md process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ad effluent was collected from a large scale biogas plant using pig manure as the substrate digestion temperature 35 c located at wuhan city hubei province china and it was stored anaerobically at the ambient temperature until no biogas was produced the ad effluent was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for about 20 min to remove particles and suspended solids before the experiments characteristics of ad effluent are listed in table 1 each liquid sample was measured at least three times to determine its average values and standard deviations the specific test methods for the samples can be found in the supporting information file the monoammonium phosphate solution map nh4h2po4 and diammonium phosphate solution dap nh4 2hpo4 with a purity content of 99 were purchased from sinopharm group chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 experimental setup fig 2 shows the experimental setup for water and green ammonia recovery from ad effluent based on the 2s md process in fig 2 the green part represents the green ammonia recovery process i e the 1st stage md and the blue part represents the water recovery process i e the 2nd stage md during the single md process the experimental setup is composed of a circulation system of ad effluent on the feed side a circulation system of receiving solution on the permeate side and a hollow fiber membrane contactor for ammonia recovery in the 1st stage md the real lab scale diagram of aeration assisted dcmd process is shown in fig a 1 an air pump chongqing yanlong machinery equipment co ltd china is placed in front of membrane contactor and the air flow rate is fixed at 0 6 l min monitored by a rotameter lzb 3 nanjing shunlaida co ltd china to reduce the membrane plugging risks and promote the aeration on the feed side the ad effluent flows through the shell side of membrane contactor while the receiving solution passes through the lumen side if map is used as the receiving solution for ammonia recovery the green aqueous ammonia solution can be obtained after the ammonia regeneration from the saturated ammonia absorbent for water recovery in the 2nd stage md the ad effluent flows through the lumen side of the membrane contactor while the receiving solution i e di water flows through the shell side the hydrophobic microporous polypropylene pp membrane contactors hangzhou jiefu membrane technology co ltd china are used for water and green ammonia recovery the properties of membrane contactors are listed in table a 1 in the supporting information file to explore the feasibility of using map as the recyclable ammonia absorbent the ammonia absorption performance of ammonium phosphate solution with different ammonia loadings α mol mol defined by the ratio of total ammonia nitrogen concentration to phosphate concentration was investigated the ammonia mass transfer coefficient was also tested using ad effluent with and without ph adjustment importantly ammonia regeneration performance of ammonia rich solution dap was conducted including the effects of key operating parameters like temperature system pressure and regeneration time finally the multicycle experiments of ammonia absorption regeneration were performed to explore the feasibility of the map dap loop as the recyclable ammonia absorbent in the 2nd stage md section the technical feasibility of clean water recovery from the alkaline ad effluent after ammonia removal was investigated ad effluents discharged from the 1st stage md with different ammonia concentrations were used as the feed solution in the dcmd process tan concentrations of ad effluents were set at 4 3 g n l 1 5 g n l 0 6 g n l or 0 003 g n l for mimicking the treated ad effluents with different ammonia removal performance in the 1st stage md the evaluation parameters of the recovered water including the tan concentration ec value and ions concentrations were detected the detailed experimental conditions were presented in the supporting information file 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 ammonia absorption performance at the ammonia absorption stage the overall mass transfer coefficient of ammonia k ov m s and ammonia flux j a g m2h are the important factors to measure the ammonia separation performance which can be determined in accordance with the following equations 9 32 2 k ov v 0 a a t ln c 0 a c t a 3 j a c 0 a v 0 a c t a v t a a t where c 0 a and c t a g l are the tan concentrations of ad effluent at the initial and any time t h in the ammonia recovery process respectively v 0 a and v t a l are the volumes of ad effluent at the initial and any time t h in the ammonia recovery process respectively a is the effective membrane area m2 the experimental tan concentration profile of ad effluent during ammonia removal is fitted to an exponential decay curve as shown in eq 4 for calculating the pseudo first order kinetics constant of tan removal k h 1 33 as shown in eq 5 the time constant τ h represents the time required to reduce the tan concentration by 1 1 e 63 of the initial tan concentration allowing a quantitative comparison between experimental results at different initial and final conditions 33 4 c t a c 0 a e kt 5 k 1 τ during ammonia absorption from ad effluent using map and h2so4 in the 1st stage md ammonia removal efficiency r m ammonia recovery efficiency r c and ammonia loss ratio η are adopted which can be determined using the following eqs 6 8 the ammonia removal efficiency is used to represent how much ammonia is released from the ad effluent during ammonia absorption while ammonia recovery efficiency represents how much ammonia is captured by ammonia absorbent the ammonia loss ratio then represents how much ammonia released from the ad effluent is not captured by ammonia absorbent clearly a high ammonia absorption ratio leads to a low η value 6 r m c 0 a v 0 a c t a v t a c 0 a v 0 a 100 7 r c n nh 3 p c 0 a v 0 a 100 8 η 1 r c r m 100 where n nh 3 p is the amount of ammonia absorbed by ammonia absorbent on the permeate side 2 3 2 ammonia regeneration performance at the ammonia desorption stage with the proceeding of ammonia absorption by map the receiving solution gradually transforms from the initial map to dap showing that the ammonia loading α mol mol increases in this study the ammonia loading is defined by the molar concentration ratio of total ammonia nitrogen mol l to the total phosphate concentration mol l clearly the ammonia loadings of map and dap are 1 0 and 2 0 mol mol respectively so according to the change of ammonia loading the ammonia regeneration efficiency ε from the ammonia rich phosphate solution can be evaluated by the following equation 29 9 ε α 0 α t α 0 1 100 where α 0 is the initial ammonia loading mol mol of ammonia rich phosphate solution α t is the ammonia loading mol mol of ammonium phosphate solution obtained experimentally at any time t h 1 is the ammonia loading mol mol of map solution 2 3 3 water recovery performance water flux j w kg m2h is used to assess the water recovery performance from the treated ad effluent by the 2nd stage md which is expressed according to the following equation 10 j w m w a t where a m2 is the membrane area δm w kg is the quantity of water transferred across the membrane during the time δt h the ammonia rejection efficiency β is adopted for showing how much ammonia i e tan can be retained in the ad effluent without being transferred into the recovered water the ammonia rejection efficiency is calculated according to the following equation 11 β c t w v t w c 0 w v 0 w 100 where c 0 w and c t w are the tan concentrations g l of ad effluent at the initial and time t h in the water recovery process respectively v 0 w and v t w l are the volumes of ad effluent at the initial and any time t h in water recovery process respectively the total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration c p g n l of the recovered water is calculated according to the following equation 12 c p c 0 w v 0 w c t w v t w c 0 w v 0 w 3 results and discussion 3 1 green ammonia recovery performance 3 1 1 ammonia absorption performance of map aqueous map and sulfuric acid h2so4 solutions were used as the ammonia absorbents to capture ammonia from the ph adjusted ad effluent in the 1st stage md the results indicate that whatever ammonia absorbent is adopted the ammonia removal efficiency r m increases while the ammonia flux j a g m2h decreases with the increase of operation time fig 3 the ammonia removal efficiency can reach above 98 after 12 h of operation by using both map and sulfuric acid as the absorbent however the total tan concentration in the ad effluent decreases with the increase of operation time resulting in the reduction of free ammonia content i e reduction in ammonia transfer driving force and consequently the drop in ammonia flux 19 notably there are no significant differences in the ammonia removal efficiency and ammonia flux between the map and h2so4 cases illustrating the comparable ammonia absorption performance between map and h2so4 as shown in fig 3b when h2so4 is adopted as the ammonia absorbent no ammonia loss is observed during ammonia recovery comparatively the ammonia loss ratio is ranged from about 9 to 2 3 in map case in the 12 h experiment process implying that some ammonia released from the ad effluent may not be completely captured by map hence map has a relatively lower ammonia absorption rate than that of h2so4 fortunately the overall ammonia loss ratio can be controlled below 2 implying a good ammonia recovery performance the ammonia recovery performance of map from ad effluents without ph adjustment and with ph adjustment by aeration or alkali addition are shown in fig 4 the mass transfer coefficient of ammonia k ov m s in the alkali addition case is the highest followed by the aeration case and then the case without ph adjustment fig 4a furthermore the change of kinetics constant k h 1 of tan removal versus ph adjustment method shows the same trend with k ov value 33 these results can be expected because the ad effluent adjusted by adding alkali can obtain the highest initial ph value meaning the highest free ammonia content in the ad effluent at the same temperature and consequently highest ammonia transfer driving force 34 35 additionally the ph value of ad effluent assisted by aeration is higher than that of ad effluent without adjustment this is attributed to the fact that co2 can be easily released from ad effluent under an aeration condition and the chemical equilibrium between nh4 and hco3 is broken to improve the ph value and free ammonia content 36 37 compared with the alkali addition the aeration assistance can not only reduce the chemical consumption but also mitigate the membrane fouling for ad effluent treatment by the md process 38 hence aeration may be a sustainable approach to enhance ammonia recovery performance as shown in fig 4 b in 12 h of operation the average ammonia loss ratio is observed to be about 4 2 11 5 and 0 5 for alkali addition aeration and no ph adjustment groups respectively the lowest ammonia loss ratio for the no ph adjustment group 0 5 might be mainly due to the lower free ammonia content in ad effluent and therefore the least ammonia volatilization the high ammonia loss ratio in the aeration case 11 5 is mainly due to the ammonia escaping into the air 28 certainly this ammonia loss ratio can be further decreased through operating parameters optimization if the tan removal performance from ad effluent and ammonia loss ratio are both considered aeration can also be accepted during ammonia removal process to get rid of the chemical s consumption 22 the effects of ammonia loading of receiving solution α mol mol on ammonia recovery performance are shown in fig 5 when the α value is 2 0 mol mol ammonia can be successfully removed from ad effluents and the ammonia removal efficiency decreases with the increase of the α value as shown in fig 5 a especially when α 2 0 mol mol meaning dap is adopted no ammonia removal happens from ad effluent implying the extremely low ammonia absorption rate by dap moreover when the α value increases from 1 0 mol mol to 1 8 mol mol the corresponding time constant increases sharply from 3 94 h to 12 34 h by about 213 2 and the corresponding mass transfer coefficient of ammonia k ov decreases sharply from 6 10 7 m s to 1 91 10 7 m s by about 68 fig 5b obviously the free active map molecules available to react with ammonia in the ammonium phosphate solution decrease with the increased α value causing the decrease in ammonia absorption rate thus leading to the increase in time constant additionally the increased α value also results in the increase of ammonia partial pressure over the ammonium phosphate solution and then the decrease of ammonia transfer driving force consequently the decrease of k ov and the increase of time constant when the α value of receiving solution is above 1 6 mol mol the ammonia removal performance reduces greatly fig 5 the results suggest that the α value of ammonium phosphate solution should be 1 6 mol mol in the real applications to achieve good ammonia removal performance this can provide technical guidance for the subsequent ammonia recovery process using ammonium phosphate solution as the ammonia absorbent 3 1 2 ammonia regeneration performance of nh3 rich absorbent practically after ammonia absorption from the ad effluent the formed ammonia rich absorbent will be regenerated to generate the green ammonia and ammonia lean absorbent for capturing ammonia again so it is necessary to investigate the ammonia regeneration performance of ammonia rich absorbents in this study the ammonia saturated absorbent i e dap was investigated preliminarily by the lab scale vacuum distillation in terms of the ammonia desorption performance as shown in fig 6 ammonia can be successfully regenerated from dap to form the green aqueous ammonia solution by vacuum distillation and the ammonia regeneration performance changes with the operating conditions with an increase in regeneration temperature at fixed system pressure the ammonia regeneration performance of dap rises represented by the elevated ammonia regeneration efficiency fig 6a and b this can be expected because a high reaction temperature can directly cause an increase in the ammonia regeneration rate and then a rise in the ammonia partial pressure over the dap solution i e an elevation in ammonia regeneration driving force consequently an improved ammonia regeneration efficiency 9 however the tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution decreases with the increase of temperature as shown in fig 6 a and b which can be explained by fact that the increment of water vapor flux is higher than that of ammonia flux 32 obviously a high regeneration temperature should be recommended for achieving a high ammonia regeneration performance and a high concentration of green ammonia formed a reduction in vacuum distillation pressure contributes to a drop of ammonia partial pressure in the gas phase showing an increase in the mass transfer driving force of ammonia regeneration at a fixed temperature 39 and thus a rise in ammonia regeneration efficiency as shown in fig 6 a and b for example when dap is regenerated at 90 c for 10 min the ammonia regeneration efficiency increases greatly from 4 14 for 60 kpa case to 27 73 for 10 kpa case by about 569 81 as shown in fig 6 b the tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution increases from 0 65 mol l to 12 94 mol l when the vacuum distillation pressure increases from 10 kpa to 60 kpa this is mainly because an increase in vacuum distillation pressure can cause a reduction degree of water vapor transfer flux higher than that of ammonia flux 24 notably although the tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution can reach up to above 12 mol l when dap is regenerated at 50 kpa and 90 c the ammonia loading of ammonia lean absorbent is still too high 1 9 mol mol to capture ammonia again if both a high ammonia regeneration efficiency and a high tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution are targeted 90 c and 40 kpa may be the better conditions for dap regeneration in this study as shown in fig 6 c extending the regeneration time is beneficial to achieving a high ammonia regeneration performance while it is not conducive to obtaining a high concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution under the conditions of 90 c 40 kpa and 90 min the ammonia regeneration efficiency of dap is 81 78 and the tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution is about 1 03 mol l certainly there is still room for further optimizing the ammonia regeneration process by various means such as increasing the dap concentration and selecting a low energy consumption reactor 3 1 3 ammonia absorption regeneration performance five sequential ammonia absorption regeneration cycles were investigated to confirm the stability of green ammonia recovery using the map dap loop in the 1st cycle dap was regenerated to generate the ammonia lean solvent in the first ammonia regeneration followed by ammonia absorption from the ad effluent using this ammonia lean solvent after ammonia absorption from ad effluent the ammonia rich solvent was regenerated to release the ammonia i e the recovered green ammonia and the lean solvent was recycled again for ammonia recovery as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a at every regeneration cycle the ammonia loading of ammonia rich solvent can be reduced to about 1 52 mol mol showing a relatively stable ammonia regeneration efficiency 36 45 49 24 as shown in fig 7 b and good stability of ammonia regeneration stage similarly at every absorption cycle the ammonia loading increases to about 1 9 2 0 mol mol indicating a stable ammonia absorption performance which can be seen from the stable ammonia removal efficiency 81 from the ad effluent fig 7a in addition as shown in fig 7 b the tan concentration of the recovered ammonia solution varied slightly from 0 94 mol l to 1 23 mol l averaged at 1 05 mol l during the five ammonia absorption regeneration cycles the renewable aqueous ammonia can be used as a biomass pretreatment additive for energy production 40 industrial feedstock for chemical production 41 or chemical absorbent for biogas upgrading 42 increasing the prevalence of applications and reducing the carbon footprint 43 clearly the map dap loop is suitable as the recyclable ammonia absorbent in the 1st stage md process to recover the green ammonia with a stable concentration from the ad effluent in a long term operation moreover compared with the typical method for recovering the green aqueous ammonia solution from the ad effluent i e the vacuum membrane distillation 9 the 1st stage md process adopting the recyclable ammonia absorbent map dap loop provided in this study can achieve a more stable yield of green ammonia with a higher concentration 3 2 water recovery performance from ammonia removed ad effluent the ad effluents with different ammonia concentrations were treated in the 2nd stage md to investigate the water recovery performance the changes in water flux j w kg m2 h and ammonia rejection efficiency β with the experimental time are shown in fig 8 a and b in all the groups the water flux decreases almost linearly with time this is mainly due to the increase in the salt concentration caused by the water loss in the ad effluent leading to the decrease of water vapor partial pressure over the ad effluent and then the drop in water vapor transfer driving force 44 accordingly with the continual mass transfer of water vapor the ad effluent is concentrated which causes an increase in the tan concentration of ad effluent 45 then an increase in the ammonia partial pressure over ad effluent and thus a rise in the ammonia transfer driving force across the membrane from ad effluent into the recovered water so regardless of the ad effluent with a high or low tan concentration the ammonia transfer increases inevitably with the experimental time 7 thus causing the ammonia rejection efficiency decreases linearly from about 100 to 6 18 for all the groups the ec value of recovered water decreases with the time as shown in fig 8 d which is highly in line with the trend of the tan concentration in the recovered water fig 8c indicating that the change of ec value is mainly induced by the penetration of ammonia across membrane 7 notably the lower the ammonia concentration of ad effluent the lower the ec value and tan concentration of recovered water for example when the ad effluents with the tan concentration of 4 3 g n l 1 5 g n l 0 6 g n l and 0 003 g n l are adopted for water recovery in the 2nd stage md process the corresponding tan concentration ec value of recovered water after 2 h operation is about 22 09 g n l 201 61 ms cm 10 3 g n l 78 48 ms cm 2 54 g n l 20 12 ms cm and 0 02 g n l 0 29 ms cm respectively thus it is vital to remove ammonia nitrogen as much as possible before water recovery to achieve high quality reclaimed water in addition to the tan concentration and ec value the ion concentration of recovered water in the experimental group with the tan concentration of 0 003 g n l is also determined as listed in table 2 clearly as shown in fig 8 c the ammonium nh4 ion concentration can be kept to 1 5 mg l after 18 h of operation while all other ion concentrations are below 0 09 mg l table 1 inferable the sole impurity in the recovered water is ammonium ion the primary volatile organic components like vfas are not detected in the recovered water while other organic components are concentrated in the feed this quality of recovered water can meet the water quality requirements for reclaimed water 46 which can be used as general industrial or agricultural water 3 3 economic evaluation of green ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent through 2s md the economic feasibility of green ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent by 2s md was evaluated in the 1st stage md process two kinds of ammonia absorbents including map solution and h2so4 solution were used for ammonia recovery with a targeted ammonia recovery efficiency 98 to generate the green ammonia and nh4 2so4 aqueous solutions respectively it should be noted that the formed aqueous ammonia solution in the map case was used to capture co2 for biogas upgrading to generate nh4hco3 different ph adjustment methods such as naoh cao waste alkali additions or aeration were used for different cases in the 2nd stage md process the water was recovered from the ammonia removed ad effluent furthermore the heat required in the 2s md process was from the natural gas combustion or waste heat recovery the net profit of the 2s md system was calculated as the difference between the by product profit and the cost of ad effluent treatment the main criteria for the economic evaluation were presented in tables a 5 and a 6 and the costs and profits for each treatment case were summarized in table a 7 in the supplement information fig 9 shows the costs and profits of ad effluent treatment for recovering ammonia and water in different cases in all the cases the system using map solution as the recyclable absorbent can obtain a profit higher than that using the h2so4 solution this is mainly because a much less chemical is consumed in 2s md process which results in a 219 37 reduction in the cost of chemical consumption furthermore the ad effluent treatment cost with ph adjusted by naoh addition is the highest followed by that with ph adjusted by cao addition aeration and waste alkali addition fig 9 when the heat was provided by natural gas and the map was used as the absorbent the ad effluent treatment cost using 2s md system is about 1 73 m3 ad effluent which is only 2 higher than that with ph adjusted by waste alkali 1 69 m3 ad effluent this might be due to the extra cost of equipment and electricity consumption for aeration compared to ph adjustment by adding naoh or cao the aeration method can be more economical which can also be confirmed by the reported results 34 if the net profit is targeted the combined utilization of the map dap loop and aeration technology in the 2s md process can provide a potential pathway to recover green ammonia and water from ad effluent notably the heat source has a significant effect on the net profit of ad effluent treatment by 2s md process featured with map dap loop and aeration for example the net profit of ad effluent is about 0 83 m3 when heat is produced by natural gas combustion while the net profit increases greatly to 1 62 m3 when using the waste heat fig 9 comparisons of ammonia and water recovery costs from wastewater are presented in table 3 at an initial tan concentration of 2 5 g n l the cost of ammonia recovery from leachate through ultrafiltration coupled with the md is the highest 7 52 9 11 m3 leachate which may be mainly due to the high cost of ultrafiltration pretreatment 19 the low cost of ammonia recovery through vmd without ph adjustment may be mainly attributed to the fact that the chemical costs of ph adjustment and ammonia absorbents are not required 9 as shown in table 3 the cost of the 2s md combined with ph aeration adjustment is 0 94 1 73 m3 ad effluent which is lower than the cost reported by ledda 18 4 62 m3 ad wastewater in which cost is mainly paid for nh4 2so4 concentrated ad effluent and clean water productions hence our two stage md process has a certain economic advantage based on the simultaneous recovery of water and green ammonia 4 conclusions in this study the novel two stage membrane distillation 2s md process allows the continuous recovery of ammonia and water from the ad effluent in the 1st stage md the monoammonium phosphate solution map nh4h2po4 acts as the recyclable ammonia absorbent for ammonia recovery where no significant difference in ammonia flux and ammonia removal efficiency between map and h2so4 absorbents was observed for the ammonia recovery process then the green ammonia is recovered from the ammonia saturated map i e diammonium phosphate solution dap nh4 2hpo4 by vacuum distillation the map dap loop is recycled and the renewable aqueous ammonia concentration is maintained at about 1 05 mol l in the multicycle ammonia absorption desorption experiments in the 2nd stage md water is recovered from the ad effluent with different ammonia concentrations the recovered water can be used as the general industrial or agricultural water with good and stable quality the economic analysis reveals the economic feasibility of water and green ammonia recovery from ad effluent through the 2s md process our results indicate that it is essential to optimize the technical parameters and

12817,a water and green ammonia recovery strategy for anaerobic digestion ad effluent treatment through a two stage membrane distillation 2s md was put forward in this study in the 1st stage the map monoammonium phosphate solution nh4h2po4 dap diammonium phosphate solution nh4 2hpo4 loop was used as the recyclable ammonia absorbent to recover ammonia from ad effluent the multicycle ammonia absorption regeneration experiments illustrated that the ammonia removal efficiency was stable 81 and the recovered ammonia solution was 1 05 mol l in the 2nd stage the water recovery experiments from ad effluent with different ammonia concentrations were conducted the results indicated that the water recovered from ammonia removed ad effluent could be adopted as the general industrial or agricultural water finally the economic evaluation demonstrated that the application of map solution as the recyclable ammonia absorbent was more economically efficient than the sulfuric acid solution the treatment cost and net profit of ad effluent treatment by 2s md were 1 73 m3 and 0 83 m3 respectively the 2s md can be acted as a valuable candidate strategy for sustainable green ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent keywords ammonia removal water recovery recyclable solvent membrane distillation anaerobic digestion effluent 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad has been extensively applied for livestock and poultry waste treatment by converting the biodegradable organic pollutants into organic fertilizers and biogas 1 the liquid effluent discharged from the ad digester has a high content of nutrients such as ammonium nitrogen phosphate and potassium 2 especially the total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration may be higher than 5000 mg n l 3 generally the amount of liquid effluent accounts for 80 of the total ad residues 4 given the high organic loading and nutrient concentration of ad effluent 5 it is vital to seek the appropriate treatment method for ad effluent 6 7 predictably if 6 2 billion m3 of ad effluent produced annually in china can be treated efficiently 5 about 3 1 31 million tons of nitrogen and about 5 89 billion m3 of reclaimed water may be recovered otherwise the potential environmental pollution may be caused by the direct application of these ad effluents 3 obviously recovering useful resources like ammonia nitrogen and water from the ad effluent is essential two possible procedures have been developed for recovering the ammonia nitrogen and water efficiently from the ad effluent the first procedure is to recover water from the acidified ad effluent and concentrate the nutrients such as ammonia nitrogen and phosphate simultaneously followed by the separation of ammonia nitrogen from the concentrated ad effluent after ph adjustment by adding the alkali this procedure may be chemical intensive because of the good acid base buffering performance of ad effluent 7 another procedure is ammonia nitrogen recovery from the ad effluent firstly and then water recovery from the treated ad effluent ensued ideally ammonia transfer from the ad effluent into the reclaimed water can be inhibited for achieving an improved water quality in this procedure 8 which makes it a promising approach for ad effluent treatment known as a typical thermally driven process membrane distillation md is a promising membrane technology for ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent because of the high volatility of ammonia and water 9 11 compared with these membrane processes including forward osmosis fo reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf and microfiltration mf md operates at a lower hydrostatic pressure enabling fouling resistance the water recovery process via md is not limited by the concentration degree of treated wastewater in addition it is especially beneficial when the low grade or waste heat is available in the md process 7 12 15 as for ammonia recovery plenty of technologies such as ion exchange 16 nitrification denitrification 16 chemical precipitation 17 and air stripping 18 have been investigated however the ammonia recovery efficiency was not satisfied when treating ad effluent with the technologies mentioned above in terms of a combination of economic environmental and energy considerations 19 21 comparatively md seems a promising approach for fast ammonia recovery from ad effluent 9 wherein the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd 22 23 vacuum membrane distillation vmd 24 25 and sweeping gas membrane distillation sgmd processes 26 have been extensively experimented typically due to the low free ammonia content the ph increment of feed ad effluent greatly relies on the consumption of alkali 9 11 on the permeate side acid solutions are always used for ammonia recovery 27 to reduce the alkali consumption vacuum or aeration was applied on the feed side 9 28 however the ammonia removal performance needs to be improved to minimize the acid solutions consumption vmd is put forward to recover ammonia but the separation factor is too low to be applied in industry 9 during the ammonia recovery the chemical consumption cost accounts for 48 of the operating cost 9 making the development of new technology featured with a low chemical consumption and a satisfied ammonia recovery performance important to solve these problems as mentioned above a novel two stage membrane distillation 2s md process is put forward in this study as shown in fig 1 ammonia is recovered from ad effluent in the 1st stage md and the water is recovered from the ammonia removed ad effluent in the 2nd stage md especially a dcmd based green ammonia recovery strategy is developed in the 1st stage md wherein recyclable ammonia receiving solution is adopted to get rid of the acid consumption required in the conventional dcmd process 29 and aeration is also combined to improve the ammonia recovery efficiency other than the exogenous alkali addition 30 in this strategy the monoammonium phosphate map nh4h2po4 solution is used as a recyclable ammonia receiving solution according to eq 1 map has an affinity toward free ammonia from ad effluent to form the ammonia rich map i e dap through the thermal regeneration of dap as reported by rice and busa 31 the aqueous ammonia solution with a concentration of 15 25 wt can be achieved ideally the map dap loop may be the good ammonia absorbent for recovering ammonia from ad effluent by dcmd to achieve a sustainable ad effluent treatment by the novel 2s md process 2 key problems should be investigated including the feasibility of adopting map solution as the stable ammonia absorbent for high performance ammonia recovery in the 1st stage md and the technical feasibility of clean water recovery from the alkaline ad effluent after ammonia removal in the 2nd stage md 1 nh 4 h 2 po 4 nh 3 absorbtion desorption nh 4 2 hpo 4 in this study ammonia recovery performance was experimentally investigated in the 1st stage md by using map solution and then ammonia desorption performance was also evaluated furthermore multicycle experiments were conducted to explore the stability of ammonia recovery using the map dap loop after ammonia recovery extensive investigations were performed in 2nd stage md to recover water from the treated ad effluent with different ammonia concentrations in terms of the water quality finally a techno economic evaluation was performed to provide a deep insight into the sustainable green ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent by the 2s md process 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials ad effluent was collected from a large scale biogas plant using pig manure as the substrate digestion temperature 35 c located at wuhan city hubei province china and it was stored anaerobically at the ambient temperature until no biogas was produced the ad effluent was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for about 20 min to remove particles and suspended solids before the experiments characteristics of ad effluent are listed in table 1 each liquid sample was measured at least three times to determine its average values and standard deviations the specific test methods for the

sinopharm group chemical reagent co ltd china 2 2 experimental setup fig 2 shows the experimental setup for water and green ammonia recovery from ad effluent based on the 2s md process in fig 2 the

ad effluent flows through the shell side of membrane contactor while the receiving solution passes through the lumen side if map is used as the receiving solution for ammonia recovery the green aqueous ammonia solution can be obtained after the ammonia regeneration from the saturated ammonia absorbent for water recovery in the 2nd stage md the ad effluent flows through the lumen side of the membrane contactor while the receiving solution i e di water flows through the shell side the hydrophobic microporous polypropylene pp membrane contactors hangzhou jiefu membrane technology co ltd china are used for water and green ammonia recovery the properties of membrane contactors are listed in table a 1 in the supporting information file to explore the feasibility of using map as the recyclable ammonia absorbent the ammonia absorption performance of ammonium phosphate solution with different ammonia loadings α mol mol defined by the ratio of total ammonia nitrogen concentration to phosphate concentration was investigated the ammonia mass transfer coefficient was also tested using ad effluent with and without ph adjustment importantly ammonia regeneration performance of ammonia rich solution dap was conducted including the effects of key operating parameters like temperature system pressure and regeneration time finally the multicycle experiments of ammonia absorption regeneration were performed to explore the feasibility of the map dap loop as the recyclable ammonia absorbent in the 2nd stage md section the technical feasibility of clean water recovery from the alkaline ad effluent after ammonia removal was investigated ad effluents discharged from the 1st stage md with different ammonia concentrations were used as the feed solution in the dcmd process tan concentrations of ad effluents were set at 4 3 g n l 1 5 g n l 0 6 g n l or 0 003 g n l for mimicking the treated ad effluents with different ammonia removal performance in the 1st stage md the evaluation parameters of the recovered water including the tan concentration ec value and ions concentrations were detected the detailed experimental conditions were presented in the supporting information file 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 ammonia absorption performance at the ammonia absorption stage the overall mass transfer coefficient of ammonia k ov m s and ammonia flux j a g m2h are the important factors to measure the ammonia separation performance which can be determined in accordance with the following equations 9 32 2 k ov v 0 a a t ln c 0 a c t a 3 j a c 0 a v 0 a c t a v t a a t where c 0 a and c t a g l are the tan concentrations of ad effluent at the initial and any time t h in the ammonia recovery process respectively v 0 a and v t a l are the volumes of ad effluent at the initial and any time t h in the ammonia recovery process respectively a is the effective membrane area m2 the experimental tan concentration profile of ad effluent during ammonia removal is fitted to an exponential decay curve as shown in eq 4 for calculating the pseudo first order kinetics constant of tan removal k h 1 33 as shown in eq 5 the time constant τ h represents the time required to reduce the tan concentration by 1 1 e 63 of the initial tan concentration allowing a quantitative comparison between experimental results at different initial and final conditions 33 4 c t a c 0 a e kt 5 k 1 τ during ammonia absorption from ad effluent using map and h2so4 in the 1st stage md ammonia removal efficiency r m ammonia recovery efficiency r c and ammonia loss ratio η are adopted which can be determined using the following eqs 6 8 the ammonia removal efficiency is used to represent how much ammonia is released from the ad effluent during ammonia absorption while ammonia recovery efficiency represents how much ammonia is captured by ammonia absorbent the ammonia loss ratio then represents how much ammonia released from the ad effluent is not captured by ammonia absorbent clearly a high ammonia absorption ratio leads to a low η value 6 r m c 0 a v 0 a c t a v t a c 0 a v 0 a 100 7 r c n nh 3 p c 0 a v 0 a 100 8 η 1 r c r m 100 where n nh 3 p is the amount of ammonia absorbed by ammonia absorbent on the permeate side 2 3 2 ammonia regeneration performance at the ammonia desorption stage with the proceeding of ammonia absorption by map the receiving solution gradually transforms from the initial map to dap showing that the ammonia loading α mol mol increases in this study the ammonia loading is defined by the molar concentration ratio of total ammonia nitrogen mol l to the total phosphate concentration mol l clearly the ammonia loadings of map and dap are 1 0 and 2 0 mol mol respectively so according to the change of ammonia loading the ammonia regeneration efficiency ε from the ammonia rich phosphate solution can be evaluated by the following equation 29 9 ε α 0 α t α 0 1 100 where α 0 is the initial ammonia loading mol mol of ammonia rich phosphate solution α t is the ammonia loading mol mol of ammonium phosphate solution obtained experimentally at any time t h 1 is the ammonia loading mol mol of map solution 2 3 3 water recovery performance water flux j w kg m2h is used to assess the water recovery performance from the treated ad effluent by the 2nd stage md which is expressed according to the following equation 10 j w m w a t where a m2 is the membrane area δm w kg is the quantity of water transferred across the membrane during the time δt h the ammonia rejection efficiency β is adopted for showing how much ammonia i e tan can be retained in the ad effluent without being transferred into the recovered water the ammonia rejection efficiency is calculated according to the following equation 11 β c t w v t w c 0 w v 0 w 100 where c 0 w and c t w are the tan concentrations g l of ad effluent at the initial and time t h in the water recovery process respectively v 0 w and v t w l are the volumes of ad effluent at the initial and any time t h in water recovery process respectively the total ammonia nitrogen tan concentration c p g n l of the recovered water is calculated according to the following equation 12 c p c 0 w v 0 w c t w v t w c 0 w v 0 w 3 results and discussion 3 1 green ammonia recovery performance 3 1 1 ammonia absorption performance of map aqueous map and sulfuric acid h2so4 solutions were used as the ammonia absorbents to capture ammonia from the ph adjusted ad effluent in the 1st stage md the results indicate that whatever ammonia absorbent is adopted the ammonia removal efficiency r m increases while the ammonia flux j a g m2h decreases with the increase of operation time fig 3 the ammonia removal efficiency can reach above 98 after 12 h of operation by using both map and sulfuric acid as the absorbent however the total tan concentration in the ad effluent decreases with the increase of operation time resulting in the reduction of free ammonia content i e reduction in ammonia transfer driving force and consequently the drop in ammonia flux 19 notably there are no significant differences in the ammonia removal efficiency and ammonia flux between the map and h2so4 cases illustrating the comparable ammonia absorption performance between map and h2so4 as shown in fig 3b when h2so4 is adopted as the ammonia absorbent no ammonia loss is observed during ammonia recovery comparatively the ammonia loss ratio is ranged from about 9 to 2 3 in map case in the 12 h experiment process implying that some ammonia released from the ad effluent may not be completely captured by map hence map has a relatively lower ammonia absorption rate than that of h2so4 fortunately the overall ammonia loss ratio can be controlled below 2 implying a good ammonia recovery performance the ammonia recovery performance of map from ad effluents without ph adjustment and with ph adjustment by aeration or alkali addition are shown in fig 4 the mass transfer coefficient of ammonia k ov m s in the alkali addition case is the highest followed by the aeration case and then the case without ph adjustment fig 4a furthermore the change of kinetics constant k h 1 of tan removal versus ph adjustment method shows the same trend with k ov value 33 these results can be expected because the ad effluent adjusted by adding alkali can obtain the highest initial ph value meaning the highest free ammonia content in the ad effluent at the same temperature and consequently highest ammonia transfer driving force 34 35 additionally the ph value of ad effluent assisted by aeration is higher than that of ad effluent without adjustment this is attributed to the fact that co2 can be easily released from ad effluent under an aeration condition and the chemical equilibrium between nh4 and hco3 is broken to improve the ph value and free ammonia content 36 37 compared with the alkali addition the aeration assistance can not only reduce the chemical consumption but also mitigate the membrane fouling for ad effluent treatment by the md process 38 hence aeration may be a sustainable approach to enhance ammonia recovery performance as shown in fig 4 b in 12 h of operation the average ammonia loss ratio is observed to be about 4 2 11 5 and 0 5 for alkali addition aeration and no ph adjustment groups respectively the lowest ammonia loss ratio for the no ph adjustment group 0 5 might be mainly due to the lower free ammonia content in ad effluent and therefore the least ammonia volatilization the high ammonia loss ratio in the aeration case 11 5 is mainly due to the ammonia escaping into the air 28 certainly this ammonia loss ratio can be further decreased through operating parameters optimization if the tan removal performance from ad effluent and ammonia loss ratio are both considered aeration can also be accepted during ammonia removal process to get rid of the chemical s consumption 22 the effects of ammonia loading of receiving solution α mol mol on ammonia recovery performance are shown in fig 5 when the α value is 2 0 mol mol ammonia can be successfully removed from ad effluents and the ammonia removal efficiency decreases with the increase of the α value as shown in fig 5 a especially when α 2 0 mol mol meaning dap is adopted no ammonia removal happens from ad effluent implying the extremely low ammonia absorption rate by dap moreover when the α value increases from 1 0 mol mol to 1 8 mol mol the corresponding time constant increases sharply from 3 94 h to 12 34 h by about 213 2 and the corresponding mass transfer coefficient of ammonia k ov decreases sharply from 6 10 7 m s to 1 91 10 7 m s by about 68 fig 5b obviously the free active map molecules available to react with ammonia in the ammonium phosphate solution decrease with the increased α value causing the decrease in ammonia absorption rate thus leading to the increase in time constant additionally the increased α value also results in the increase of ammonia partial pressure over the ammonium phosphate solution and then the decrease of ammonia transfer driving force consequently the decrease of k ov and the increase of time constant when the α value of receiving solution is above 1 6 mol mol the ammonia removal performance reduces greatly fig 5 the results suggest that the α value of ammonium phosphate solution should be 1 6 mol mol in the real applications to achieve good ammonia removal performance this can provide technical guidance for the subsequent ammonia recovery process using ammonium phosphate solution as the ammonia absorbent 3 1 2 ammonia regeneration performance of nh3 rich absorbent practically after ammonia absorption from the ad effluent the formed ammonia rich absorbent will be regenerated to generate the green ammonia and ammonia lean absorbent for capturing ammonia again so it is necessary to investigate the ammonia regeneration performance of ammonia rich absorbents in this study the ammonia saturated absorbent i e dap was investigated preliminarily by the lab scale vacuum distillation in terms of the ammonia desorption performance as shown in fig 6 ammonia can be successfully regenerated from dap to form the green aqueous ammonia solution by vacuum distillation and the ammonia regeneration performance changes with the operating conditions with an increase in regeneration temperature at fixed system pressure the ammonia regeneration performance of dap rises represented by the elevated ammonia regeneration efficiency fig 6a and b this can be expected because a high reaction temperature can directly cause an increase in the ammonia regeneration rate and then a rise in the ammonia partial pressure over the dap solution i e an elevation in ammonia regeneration driving force consequently an improved ammonia regeneration efficiency 9 however the tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution decreases with the increase of temperature as shown in fig 6 a and b which can be explained by fact that the increment of water vapor flux is higher than that of ammonia flux 32 obviously a high regeneration temperature should be recommended for achieving a high ammonia regeneration performance and a high concentration of green ammonia formed a reduction in vacuum distillation pressure contributes to a drop of ammonia partial pressure in the gas phase showing an increase in the mass transfer driving force of ammonia regeneration at a fixed temperature 39 and thus a rise in ammonia regeneration efficiency as shown in fig 6 a and b for example when dap is regenerated at 90 c for 10 min the ammonia regeneration efficiency increases greatly from 4 14 for 60 kpa case to 27 73 for 10 kpa case by about 569 81 as shown in fig 6 b the tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution increases from 0 65 mol l to 12 94 mol l when the vacuum distillation pressure increases from 10 kpa to 60 kpa this is mainly because an increase in vacuum distillation pressure can cause a reduction degree of water vapor transfer flux higher than that of ammonia flux 24 notably although the tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution can reach up to above 12 mol l when dap is regenerated at 50 kpa and 90 c the ammonia loading of ammonia lean absorbent is still too high 1 9 mol mol to capture ammonia again if both a high ammonia regeneration efficiency and a high tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution are targeted 90 c and 40 kpa may be the better conditions for dap regeneration in this study as shown in fig 6 c extending the regeneration time is beneficial to achieving a high ammonia regeneration performance while it is not conducive to obtaining a high concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution under the conditions of 90 c 40 kpa and 90 min the ammonia regeneration efficiency of dap is 81 78 and the tan concentration of obtained aqueous ammonia solution is about 1 03 mol l certainly there is still room for further optimizing the ammonia regeneration process by various means such as increasing the dap concentration and selecting a low energy consumption reactor 3 1 3 ammonia absorption regeneration performance five sequential ammonia absorption regeneration cycles were investigated to confirm the stability of green ammonia recovery using the map dap loop in the 1st cycle dap was regenerated to generate the ammonia lean solvent in the first ammonia regeneration followed by ammonia absorption from the ad effluent using this ammonia lean solvent after ammonia absorption from ad effluent the ammonia rich solvent was regenerated to release the ammonia i e the recovered green ammonia and the lean solvent was recycled again for ammonia recovery as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a at every regeneration cycle the ammonia loading of ammonia rich solvent can be reduced to about 1 52 mol mol showing a relatively stable ammonia regeneration efficiency 36 45 49 24 as shown in fig 7 b and good stability of ammonia regeneration stage similarly at every absorption cycle the ammonia loading increases to about 1 9 2 0 mol mol indicating a stable ammonia absorption performance which can be seen from the stable ammonia removal efficiency 81 from the ad effluent fig 7a in addition as shown in fig 7 b the tan concentration of the recovered ammonia solution varied slightly from 0 94 mol l to 1 23 mol l averaged at 1 05 mol l during the five ammonia absorption regeneration cycles the renewable aqueous ammonia can be used as a biomass pretreatment additive for energy production 40 industrial feedstock for chemical production 41 or chemical absorbent for biogas upgrading 42 increasing the prevalence of applications and reducing the carbon footprint 43 clearly the map dap loop is suitable as the recyclable ammonia absorbent in the 1st stage md process to recover the green ammonia with a stable concentration from the ad effluent in a long term operation moreover compared with the typical method for recovering the green aqueous ammonia solution from the ad effluent i e the vacuum membrane distillation 9 the 1st stage md process adopting the recyclable ammonia absorbent map dap loop provided in this study can achieve a more stable yield of green ammonia with a higher concentration 3 2 water recovery performance from ammonia removed ad effluent the ad effluents with different ammonia concentrations were treated in the 2nd stage md to investigate the water recovery performance the changes in water flux j w kg m2 h and ammonia rejection efficiency β with the experimental time are shown in fig 8 a and b in all the groups the water flux decreases almost linearly with time this is mainly due to the increase in the salt concentration caused by the water loss in the ad effluent leading to the decrease of water vapor partial pressure over the ad effluent and then the drop in water vapor transfer driving force 44 accordingly with the continual mass transfer of water vapor the ad effluent is concentrated which causes an increase in the tan concentration of ad effluent 45 then an increase in the ammonia partial pressure over ad effluent and thus a rise in the ammonia transfer driving force across the membrane from ad effluent into the recovered water so regardless of the ad effluent with a high or low tan concentration the ammonia transfer increases inevitably with the experimental time 7 thus causing the ammonia rejection efficiency decreases linearly from about 100 to 6 18 for all the groups the ec value of recovered water decreases with the time as shown in fig 8 d which is highly in line with the trend of the tan concentration in the recovered water fig 8c indicating that the change of ec value is mainly induced by the penetration of ammonia across membrane 7 notably the lower the ammonia concentration of ad effluent the lower the ec value and tan concentration of recovered water for example when the ad effluents with the tan concentration of 4 3 g n l 1 5 g n l 0 6 g n l and 0 003 g n l are adopted for water recovery in the 2nd stage md process the corresponding tan concentration ec value of recovered water after 2 h operation is about 22 09 g n l 201 61 ms cm 10 3 g n l 78 48 ms cm 2 54 g n l 20 12 ms cm and 0 02 g n l 0 29 ms cm respectively thus it is vital to remove ammonia nitrogen as much as possible before water recovery to achieve high quality reclaimed water in addition to the tan concentration and ec value the ion concentration of recovered water in the experimental group with the tan concentration of 0 003 g n l is also determined as listed in table 2 clearly as shown in fig 8 c the ammonium nh4 ion concentration can be kept to 1 5 mg l after 18 h of operation while all other ion concentrations are below 0 09 mg l table 1 inferable the sole impurity in the recovered water is ammonium ion the primary volatile organic components like vfas are not detected in the recovered water while other organic components are concentrated in the feed this quality of recovered water can meet the water quality requirements for reclaimed water 46 which can be used as general industrial or agricultural water 3 3 economic evaluation of green ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent through 2s md the economic feasibility of green ammonia and water recovery from ad effluent by 2s md was evaluated in the 1st stage md process two kinds of ammonia absorbents including map solution and h2so4 solution were used for ammonia recovery with a targeted ammonia recovery efficiency 98 to generate the green ammonia and nh4 2so4 aqueous solutions respectively it should be noted that the formed aqueous ammonia solution in the map case was used to capture co2 for biogas upgrading to generate nh4hco3 different ph adjustment methods such as naoh cao waste alkali additions or aeration were used for different cases in the 2nd stage md process the water was recovered from the ammonia removed ad effluent furthermore the heat required in the 2s md process was from the natural gas combustion or waste heat recovery the net profit of the 2s md system was calculated as the difference between the by product profit and the cost of ad effluent treatment the main criteria for the economic evaluation were presented in tables a 5 and a 6 and the costs and profits for each treatment case were summarized in table a 7 in the supplement information fig 9 shows the costs and profits of ad effluent treatment for recovering ammonia and water in different cases in all the cases the system using map solution as the recyclable absorbent can obtain a profit higher than that using the h2so4 solution this is mainly because a much less chemical is consumed in 2s md process which results in a 219 37 reduction in the cost of chemical consumption furthermore the ad effluent treatment cost with ph adjusted by naoh addition is the highest followed by that with ph adjusted by cao addition aeration and waste alkali addition fig 9 when the heat was provided by natural gas and the map was used as the absorbent the ad effluent treatment cost using 2s md system is about 1 73 m3 ad effluent which is only 2 higher than that with ph adjusted by waste alkali 1 69 m3 ad effluent this might be due to the extra cost of equipment and electricity consumption for aeration compared to ph adjustment by adding naoh or cao the aeration method can be more economical which can also be confirmed by the reported results 34 if the net profit is targeted the combined utilization of the map dap loop and aeration technology in the 2s md process can provide a potential pathway to recover green ammonia and water from ad effluent notably the heat source has a significant effect on the net profit of ad effluent treatment by 2s md process featured with map dap loop and aeration for example the net profit of ad effluent is about 0 83 m3 when heat is produced by natural gas combustion while the net profit increases greatly to 1 62 m3 when using the waste heat fig 9 comparisons of ammonia and water recovery costs from wastewater are presented in table 3 at an initial tan concentration of 2 5 g n l the cost of ammonia recovery from leachate through ultrafiltration coupled with the md is the highest 7 52 9 11 m3 leachate which may be mainly due to the high cost of ultrafiltration pretreatment 19 the low cost of ammonia recovery through vmd without ph adjustment may be mainly attributed to the fact that the chemical costs of ph adjustment and ammonia absorbents are not required 9 as shown in table 3 the cost of the 2s md combined with ph aeration adjustment is 0 94 1 73 m3 ad effluent which is lower than the cost reported by ledda 18 4 62 m3 ad wastewater in which cost is mainly paid for nh4 2so4 concentrated ad effluent and clean water productions hence our two stage md process has a certain economic advantage based on the simultaneous recovery of water and green ammonia 4 conclusions in this study the novel two stage membrane distillation 2s md process allows the continuous recovery of ammonia and water from the ad effluent in the 1st stage md the monoammonium phosphate solution map nh4h2po4 acts as the recyclable ammonia absorbent for ammonia recovery where no significant difference in ammonia flux and ammonia removal efficiency between map and h2so4 absorbents was observed for the ammonia recovery process then the green ammonia is recovered from the ammonia saturated map i e diammonium phosphate solution dap nh4 2hpo4 by vacuum distillation the map dap loop is recycled and the renewable aqueous ammonia concentration is maintained at about 1 05 mol l in the multicycle ammonia absorption desorption experiments in the 2nd stage md water is recovered from the ad effluent with different ammonia concentrations the recovered water can be used as the general industrial or agricultural water with good and stable quality the economic analysis reveals the economic feasibility of water and green ammonia recovery from ad effluent through the 2s md process our results indicate that it is essential to optimize the technical parameters and

effects on the environment 9 35 36 industries discard nitrophenols dyes containing wastes into water bodies without treating them 37 38 nitrophenols dyes are hazardous because of their high water solubility and carcinogenic and mutagenic properties the us environmental protection agency lists 4 nitrophenol as a priority contaminant because it can cause irritation skin allergies methemoglobin cyanosis and unconsciousness nitrophenols too can accumulate in human organs including the liver kidneys and lungs causing internal damage 39 furthermore certain dyes are not biodegradable and even at low concentrations pose a serious risk to humans and marine animals 40 among the numerous methods reported for the removal of these contaminants the catalytic reduction process has received the most attention the catalytic reduction of nitrophenols produces industrially important amines which are used as intermediates in a variety of synthesis processes in the form of imines azo and amides other important intermediates used in the dye pharmaceutical polymer and agricultural industries can be made from these compounds 41 43 the reduction of dyes gives reduced or degraded products that are less

and the reduction of each dye was replicated three times different dyes mo cr rb and mb were also reduced using n z and without any catalyst using only sodium borohydride the apparent first order kinetics using a n z 3 nanocomposite has been explained with the help of a model proposed by langmuir hinshelwood the concentration of sodium borohydride is much higher than that of nitrophenol or dye making it constant hence the reduction process follows the pseudo first order kinetics appropriately as defined by the equation given below 1 ln c t c 0 k app t where c0 and ct represent the concentrations of nitrophenol or dye at initial time t 0 and interval time t respectively and kapp s 1 represents the corresponding rate constant further eq 2 was used to calculate the normalized rate

reduction of pnp 0 16 mm by employing all the synthesized nanocomposites n z a n z 1 a n z 2 and a n z 3 are shown in fig 9 for reduction 100 μl of pnp 5 mm was mixed with 2 ml of water in a cuvette giving absorbance maxima at 317 nm then 1 ml of 40 mm freshly prepared sodium borohydride aqueous solution was added to the reaction the absorbance maxima shifted from 317 to 400 nm with the formation of phenolate ions and colour changed from light to deep yellow by adding 20 μl of catalyst reduction starts with a decrease in the absorbance maxima at 400 nm colour changes from deep yellow to the

reduction of pnp is shown in fig 10 for reduction 100 μl of pnp 5 mm was mixed with 2000 1970 μl water and then 1 ml of 40 mm sodium borohydride solution was added to the cuvette further different amounts of catalyst a n z 3 20 35 and 50 μl were added while keeping volume of cuvette constant 3 12 ml fig 10 a to c displays that as we increase the amount of catalyst from 20 μl to 35 μl reduction time of pnp decreases from 7 min to 3 min and with 50 μl of catalyst it increases slightly to 3 5 min the rate of reaction kapp ranges from 0 89 1 98 10 2 s 1 with an increase in catalyst s amount from 20 to 35 μl with obvious reason of increased surface area or active site of catalyst while decreases to 1 77 10 2 s 1 with further increase of catalyst to 50 μl which may be due to the possible agglomeration of catalyst to some extent in the system the kinetics of the reaction has been studied by plotting ct c0 and ln ct c0 against time s fig 10 d e eqs 1 and 2 are used to calculate the values of kapp and knor and the results are summarized in table 3 3 4 effect of concentration of pnp the effect of concentration of pnp on the reduction of pnp to para aminophenol while keeping the

ct c0 and ln ct c0 against time min as represented in fig 11e and f respectively 3 5 the influence of varying concentration of sodium borohydride catalyst and pnp on kapp for reduction of pnp the effect of the concentration of sodium borohydride 10 50 mm on pnp s 0 16 mm reduction was also examined without disturbing other variables the reaction rate constant kapp increases as the concentration of sodium borohydride increases from 10 to 40 mm and then becomes constant afterward as shown in fig s5a the effect of catalyst s amount on the reaction rate constant kapp is depicted in fig s5b the reaction rate constant kapp value increases as the catalyst s amount increases from 20 to 35 μl but the further increase of catalyst s amount to 50 μl did not increase the reaction rate in fig s5c the values of kapp decrease with increase in pnp s concentration 3 6 reduction of various nitrophenols the catalytic efficiency of a n z 3 nanocomposite was examined by utilizing it for the reduction of various nitrophenols such as pnp mnp onp and 2 4 6tnp at a concentration of 0 16 mm replicated thrice for each nitrophenol the amount of catalyst i e 20 μl 1 mg ml suspension of a n z 3

aminophenol and is reduced completely 7 min as shown in fig 12c the absorbance maxima due to 2 4 6 trinitrophenolate ion was observed at 390 nm which gradually decreased with the emergence of a new peak due to 2 4 6 triaminophenol at 308 nm and complete reduction was achieved in 13 min fig 12d the sodium borohydride concentration is in excess compared to the concentration of nitrophenols in all the reduction experiments hence the model proposed by langmuir hinshelwood for the first order kinetics defines their reduction the rate constant kapp values were obtained with the help of the linear plot between ln ct c0 and time s using eq 1 fig 12f the kapp values to reduce onp mnp pnp and 2 4 6tnp are 1 548 0 072 10 2 1 358 0 035 10 2 0 878 0 058 10 2 and 0 445 0 006 10 2 s 1 respectively the knor values calculated using eq 2 to reduce onp mnp pnp and 2 4 6tnp are 774 2 679 3 439 0 and 222 6 s 1 g 1 respectively the resultant kapp and knor values imply that the observed reduction sequence

presented in figs s6 and s7 respectively and reduction percentages are compiled in table s5 there has been no significant reduction observed in onp mnp and pnp while using n z and in the absence of any catalyst however using n z as a catalyst and in the absence of any catalyst for a long time of 30 min resulted in an 87 5 and 19 46 reduction of 2 4 6tnp respectively 3 7 reduction of various dyes the reduction of four dyes i e mo cr rb and mb was carried out with an excess of sodium borohydride using a n z 3 as a catalyst the concentration of dyes is 0 02 mm the concentration of sodium borohydride is 40 mm and the catalyst s amount is 20 μl from a suspension containing 1 mg ml of a n z 3 except for mb 100 μl was employed the absorbance maxima λmax of mo cr rb and mb with the addition of sodium borohydride were observed at 464 498 554 and 662 nm respectively as the a n z 3 catalyst was added to the reaction the absorbance maxima slowly decreased with the decolourization of the dye s solution indicating its reduction the complete reduction of mo cr rb and mb was achieved in 2 5 2 5 4 and 9 min respectively fig 13 the values of kapp for reducing mo cr rb and mb are 2 067 0 041 10 2 1 701 0 111 10 2 1 699 0 016 10 2 and 0 473 0 01 10 2 s 1 respectively as calculated using eq 1 the values of knor for reducing mo cr rb and mb are 1033 7 850 9 849 7 and 47 36 s 1 g 1 respectively using eq 2 ct c0 and ln ct c0 have been plotted against time s for their reduction as presented in fig 13e and f respectively and the results are tabulated in table 6 as reported and described previously 35 the catalytic reduction of mb and rb converts them into leuco mb and leuco rb respectively 44 45 however cr and mo on reduction break down into smaller fragments as illustrated in figs s8 and s9 respectively which have been analyzed using gc ms the reduction of various dyes 0 02 m was also performed using n z as a catalyst and without any catalyst using sodium borohydride as presented in figs s10 and s11 respectively and reduction percentages are compiled in table s6 using n z and in the absence of any catalyst no significant reduction of mo cr and mb was obtained however using n z as a catalyst and in the absence of any catalyst for a long time of 30 min resulted in a 13 30 and 13 09 reduction of rb respectively 3 8 reduction of nitrophenols mixture dyes mixture simulated sample industrial effluents eff1 and real sample dye bath effluents the catalytic reduction capability of a n z 3 nanocomposite was also evaluated against the mixtures of nitrophenols pnp mnp onp and 2 4 6tnp and dyes mo cr rb and mb and results are summarized in table s7 when catalyst was added to the mixtures of nitrophenol or dye no new peak appeared due to interaction of any dye nitrophenol with the catalyst indicating no interference of catalyst with the reduction process a mixture of nitrophenols after adding aqueous sodium borohydride solution gives absorbance maxima at 394 nm and after adding 20 μl of a n z 3 catalyst reduction starts with a decrease in absorption peak the reduction of a mixture of nitrophenols takes 8 min and has a reduction percentage of 95 84 fig 14a the absorbance maxima of a mixture of dyes with aqueous sodium borohydride solution appear at 554 nm and it starts decreasing on adding 20 μl of a n z 3 catalyst the reduction of a mixture of dyes occurs in 8 min with a reduction percentage of 90 13 fig 14b the reduction of individual dye component in a mixture of dyes was also calculated by observing decrease in absorbance at their individual absorbance maxima details of measurement and formula used are given in supporting file table s8 the reduction percentage of mo at λ 464 nm cr at λ 498 nm rb at λ 554 nm and mb at λ 662 nm are 71 97 79 90 90 13 and 89 74 respectively in a mixture of dyes in a mixture of dyes or nitrophenols the catalyst a n z 3 does not reduce a particular dye nitrophenol completely but it reduces efficiently the complete mixture as well as all individual component therefore the catalyst is not selective to a particular dye or nitrophenol in the mixtures to ensure the industrial importance of the catalyst a n z 3 eff1 and dbe were also reduced the reduction of eff1 2 ml of the effluent 1 ml 40 mm sodium borohydride solution starts with the addition of 20 μl of a n z 3 catalyst with a gradual decrease of absorbance maxima present at 400 nm the reduction percentage of eff1 was 92 64 in 6 min fig 14c at 520 nm the absorbance maxima of dbe 0 5 ml effluent 2 5 ml water 0 3 ml aqueous sodium borohydride solution 0 04 m appears which begins to decrease with the addition of 50 μl of a n z 3 catalyst as the dbe is gradually reduced with time a shift in λmax 520 nm was observed due to the presence of different effluents and complete reduction occurs in 12 min with a reduction percentage of 87 90 fig 14d a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe have also been reduced using n z as a catalyst and in absence of any catalyst table s7 the reduction percentage of a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe are 39 70 5 60 0 and 8 40 respectively in the long duration of 30 min using n z as a catalyst fig s12 in absence of any catalyst by using sodium borohydride alone reduction percentage of a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe is 32 30 7 20 0 and 7 50 respectively in the extended time of 30 min fig s13 3 9 reusability of catalyst a n z 3 for practical application reusability of the catalyst is a very significant factor the reusability of a n z 3 was investigated by repetitively using the same catalyst for reducing a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe up to five cycles as presented in fig 15 the catalytic efficacy of a n z 3 remained nearly constant up to five cycles with a mixture of nitrophenols eff1 and dbe in the case of a dyes mixture the reduction percentage decreased by 4 8 in the fifth cycle 3 10 mechanism the reduction reaction of pnp to para aminophenol using sodium borohydride as a reductant is well known this reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous due to the standard reduction potential values of the species involved e0 para nitrophenol para aminophenol 0 76 v e0 h3bo3 bh4ˉ 1 33 v however without a catalyst the reduction reaction cannot proceed immediately due to a high kinetic barrier caused by the negative properties of pnp and bh4ˉ which repel each other a catalyst acts as an electronic relay agent allowing the reduction to occur by enabling bh4ˉ to transfer electrons to pnp this implies that the reduction of pnp depends on the electron relay properties of the catalyst 35 53 54 in our studies we chose to test ternary mixed metal oxide system ag2o nio zno for reduction of nitrophenols or dyes in anticipation to get efficient catalytic results due to them in build in electric field the rapid catalytic reduction of pnp using ternary a n z 3 nanocomposite occurs in the following steps as per the published literature initially adsorption of para nitrophenolate ions and bh4ˉ occurs on the surface of a n z 3 catalyst via electrostatic interactions or van der waals forces adsorbed bh4ˉ ions react with water and release hˉ ion then the transfer of hydrogen ions and electrons facilitates through catalyst a n z 3 to the no2 group of pnp to produce para aminophenol in the last step the final product p aminophenol detaches from the catalyst s surface freeing up new available catalytic sites for the subsequent cycles fig 16 55 the same reduction pathway has been employed for other nitrophenols onp mnp and 2 4 6tnp and dyes mo cr rb and mb 35 56 57 the catalytic efficiency of synthesized ag2o nio zno nanocomposite is compared with already reported mixed metal oxide nanocomposites having ag2o nio and zno as one of the component table 7 the comparison concludes that as synthesized ternary nanocomposite of these metal oxides has higher catalytic efficiency than other similar reported binary ternary mixed metal oxides nanocomposites 4 conclusions nio zno n z nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by sol gel method using nickel and zinc nitrate salts as precursors and water as a solvent the as synthesized n z binary nanocomposite particle s size 31 59 5 03 nm was decorated by different molar ratios of silver oxide to synthesize ag2o nio zno ternary nanocomposites a n z 1 10 ag2o a n z 2 20 ag2o a n z 3 30 ag2o the fastest catalytic reduction of pnp was achieved by a n z 3 among three as synthesized catalysts further an optimized amount of a n z 3 was used to reduce various organic pollutants the values of kapp for nitrophenols onp mnp pnp and 2 4 6tnp ranges from 0 445 10 2 1 548 10 2 s 1 while for dyes mo cr rb and mb the values range from 0 473 10 2 2 067 10 2 s 1 the a n z 3 nanocomposite demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity to reduce the individual pollutants and their mixtures a n z 3 showed its industrial importance as a catalyst by reducing eff1 simulated industrial effluents sample and dbe a real industrial effluents sample the a n z 3 catalyst was reused up to five cycles with no discernible loss of catalytic activity for a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe therefore the as synthesized ternary mixed metal oxide nanocomposite a n z 3 easily reduces toxic dyes converts nitrophenols into valuable aminophenols and can be utilized to remove industrial organic pollutants in the wastewater credit authorship contribution statement pooja bhatia investigation data curation analysis methodology validation writing original

nanocomposites unique structural optical and thermal properties make them versatile allowing them to perform better in various technological applications 6 7 the excellent potential of metal oxide nanocomposites has been found in various research domains due to their characteristics such as high surface area thermal stability high porosity long lifetime low cost tuneable composition and tuneable morphology 8 10 the combination of two or more metal oxides gives the material exhibiting novel physical and chemical properties resulting in its high performance in different fields many binary composites are reported in the literature with diverse applications such as adsorption 9 gas sensing 11 photocatalysis 12 antimicrobial agent 13 as electrode material in supercapacitors and lithium ion batteries 14 15 a few ternary metal oxides viz cdo al2o3 nio 16 wo3 tio2 fe3o4 17 tio2 sio2 fe3o4 18 nio fe2o3 zno 19 nio cdo zno 20 nio fe2o3 cdo 21 tio2 sio2 fe3o4 22 cuo tio2 zno 23 zn

over cp ti commercially pure titanium and studied for its tribological electrochemical and biomedical characteristics 34 our previous work on nitrophenols and organic dyes has discussed their harmful effects on the environment 9 35 36 industries discard nitrophenols dyes containing wastes into water bodies without treating them 37 38 nitrophenols dyes are hazardous because of their high water solubility and carcinogenic and mutagenic properties the us environmental protection agency lists 4 nitrophenol as a priority contaminant because it can cause irritation skin allergies methemoglobin cyanosis and unconsciousness nitrophenols too can accumulate in human organs including the liver kidneys and lungs causing internal damage 39 furthermore certain dyes are not biodegradable and even at low concentrations pose a serious risk to humans and marine animals 40 among the numerous methods reported for the removal of these contaminants the catalytic reduction process has received the most attention the catalytic reduction of nitrophenols produces industrially important amines which are used as intermediates in a variety of synthesis processes in the form of imines azo and amides other important intermediates used in the dye pharmaceutical polymer and agricultural industries can be made from these compounds 41 43 the reduction of dyes gives reduced or degraded products that are less

the dye s solution indicating its reduction the complete reduction of mo cr rb and mb was achieved in 2 5 2 5 4 and 9 min respectively fig 13 the values of kapp for reducing mo cr rb and mb are 2 067 0 041 10 2 1 701 0 111 10 2 1 699 0 016 10 2 and 0 473 0 01 10 2 s 1 respectively as calculated using eq 1 the values of knor for reducing mo cr rb and mb are 1033 7 850 9 849 7 and 47 36 s 1 g 1 respectively using eq 2 ct c0 and ln ct c0 have been plotted against time s for their reduction as presented in fig 13e and f respectively and the results are tabulated in table 6 as reported and described previously 35 the catalytic reduction of mb and rb converts them into leuco mb and leuco rb respectively 44 45 however cr and mo on reduction break down into smaller fragments as illustrated in figs s8 and s9 respectively which have been analyzed using gc ms the reduction of various dyes 0 02 m was also performed using n z as a catalyst and without any catalyst using sodium borohydride as presented in figs s10 and s11 respectively and reduction percentages are compiled in table s6 using n z and in the absence of any catalyst no significant reduction of mo cr and mb was obtained however using n z as a catalyst and in the absence of any catalyst for a long time of 30 min resulted in a 13 30 and 13 09 reduction of rb respectively 3 8 reduction of nitrophenols mixture dyes mixture simulated sample industrial effluents eff1 and real sample dye bath effluents the catalytic reduction capability of a n z 3 nanocomposite was also evaluated against the mixtures of nitrophenols pnp mnp onp and 2 4 6tnp and dyes mo cr rb and mb and results are summarized in table s7 when catalyst was added to the mixtures of nitrophenol or dye no new peak appeared due to interaction of any dye nitrophenol with the catalyst indicating no interference of catalyst with the reduction process a mixture of nitrophenols after adding aqueous sodium borohydride solution gives absorbance maxima at 394 nm and after adding 20 μl of a n z 3 catalyst reduction starts with a decrease in absorption peak the reduction of a mixture of nitrophenols takes 8 min and has a reduction percentage of 95 84 fig 14a the absorbance maxima of a mixture of dyes with aqueous sodium borohydride solution appear at 554 nm and it starts decreasing on adding 20 μl of a n z 3 catalyst the reduction of a mixture of dyes occurs in 8 min with a reduction percentage of 90 13 fig 14b the reduction of individual dye component in a mixture of dyes was also calculated by observing decrease in absorbance at their individual absorbance maxima details of measurement and formula used are given in supporting file table s8 the reduction percentage of mo at λ 464 nm cr at λ 498 nm rb at λ 554 nm and mb at λ 662 nm are 71 97 79 90 90 13 and 89 74 respectively in a mixture of dyes in a mixture of dyes or nitrophenols the catalyst a n z 3 does not reduce a particular dye nitrophenol completely but it reduces efficiently the complete mixture as well as all individual component therefore the catalyst is not selective to a particular dye or nitrophenol in the mixtures to ensure the industrial importance of the catalyst a n z 3 eff1 and dbe were also reduced the reduction of eff1 2 ml of the effluent 1 ml 40 mm sodium borohydride solution starts with the addition of 20 μl of a n z 3 catalyst with a gradual decrease of absorbance maxima present at 400 nm the reduction percentage of eff1 was 92 64 in 6 min fig 14c at 520 nm the absorbance maxima of dbe 0 5 ml effluent 2 5 ml water 0 3 ml aqueous sodium borohydride solution 0 04 m appears which begins to decrease with the addition of 50 μl of a n z 3 catalyst as the dbe is gradually reduced with time a shift in λmax 520 nm was observed due to the presence of different effluents and complete reduction occurs in 12 min with a reduction percentage of 87 90 fig 14d a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe have also been reduced using n z as a catalyst and in absence of any catalyst table s7 the reduction percentage of a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe are 39 70 5 60 0 and 8 40 respectively in the long duration of 30 min using n z as a catalyst fig s12 in absence of any catalyst by using sodium borohydride alone reduction percentage of a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe is 32 30 7 20 0 and 7 50 respectively in the extended time of 30 min fig s13 3 9 reusability of catalyst a n z 3 for practical application reusability of the catalyst is a very significant factor the reusability of a n z 3 was investigated by repetitively using the same catalyst for reducing a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe up to five cycles as presented in fig 15 the catalytic efficacy of a n z 3 remained nearly constant up to five cycles with a mixture of nitrophenols eff1 and dbe in the case of a dyes mixture the reduction percentage decreased by 4 8 in the fifth cycle 3 10 mechanism the reduction reaction of pnp to para aminophenol using sodium borohydride as a reductant is well known this reaction is thermodynamically spontaneous due to the standard reduction potential values of the species involved e0 para nitrophenol para aminophenol 0 76 v e0 h3bo3 bh4ˉ 1 33 v however without a catalyst the reduction reaction cannot proceed immediately due to a high kinetic barrier caused by the negative properties of pnp and bh4ˉ which repel each other a catalyst acts as an electronic relay agent allowing the reduction to occur by enabling bh4ˉ to transfer electrons to pnp this implies that the reduction of pnp depends on the electron relay properties of the catalyst 35 53 54 in our studies we chose to test ternary mixed metal oxide system ag2o nio zno for reduction of nitrophenols or dyes in anticipation to get efficient catalytic results due to them in build in electric field the rapid catalytic reduction of pnp using ternary a n z 3 nanocomposite occurs in the following steps as per the published literature initially adsorption of para nitrophenolate ions and bh4ˉ occurs on the surface of a n z 3 catalyst via electrostatic interactions or van der waals forces adsorbed bh4ˉ ions react with water and release hˉ ion then the transfer of hydrogen ions and electrons facilitates through catalyst a n z 3 to the no2 group of pnp to produce para aminophenol in the last step the final product p aminophenol detaches from the catalyst s surface freeing up new available catalytic sites for the subsequent cycles fig 16 55 the same reduction pathway has been employed for other nitrophenols onp mnp and 2 4 6tnp and dyes mo cr rb and mb 35 56 57 the catalytic efficiency of synthesized ag2o nio zno nanocomposite is compared with already reported mixed metal oxide nanocomposites having ag2o nio and zno as one of the component table 7 the comparison concludes that as synthesized ternary nanocomposite of these metal oxides has higher catalytic efficiency than other similar reported binary ternary mixed metal oxides nanocomposites 4 conclusions nio zno n z nanocomposite was successfully synthesized by sol gel method using nickel and zinc nitrate salts as precursors and water as a solvent the as synthesized n z binary nanocomposite particle s size 31 59 5 03 nm was decorated by different molar ratios of silver oxide to synthesize ag2o nio zno ternary nanocomposites a n z 1 10 ag2o a n z 2 20 ag2o a n z 3 30 ag2o the fastest catalytic reduction of pnp was achieved by a n z 3 among three as synthesized catalysts further an optimized amount of a n z 3 was used to reduce various organic pollutants the values of kapp for nitrophenols onp mnp pnp and 2 4 6tnp ranges from 0 445 10 2 1 548 10 2 s 1 while for dyes mo cr rb and mb the values range from 0 473 10 2 2 067 10 2 s 1 the a n z 3 nanocomposite demonstrated outstanding catalytic activity to reduce the individual pollutants and their mixtures a n z 3 showed its industrial importance as a catalyst by reducing eff1 simulated industrial effluents sample and dbe a real industrial effluents sample the a n z 3 catalyst was reused up to five cycles with no discernible loss of catalytic activity for a mixture of nitrophenols or dyes eff1 and dbe therefore the as synthesized ternary mixed metal oxide nanocomposite a n z 3 easily reduces toxic dyes converts nitrophenols into valuable aminophenols and can be utilized to remove industrial organic pollutants in the wastewater credit authorship contribution statement pooja bhatia investigation data curation analysis methodology validation writing original

12819,membrane distillation md is one of the emerging methods that can be adopted for oily wastewater treatment however the problems associated with membrane surface fouling may impede its separation efficiency in this work we performed a fouling study using self synthesized polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf bentonite hollow fiber membrane hfm to treat palm oil mill effluent pome via direct contact membrane distillation dcmd to date there is no report on pome treatment using md technology based on pvdf bentonite hfm the fouling tendency was identified based on the membrane s permeate flux and pollutant rejection the fouled membranes after pome treatment were characterized based on its morphology functional group water contact angle surface roughness and mechanical strength the results showed that the average permeate flux of md was 3 34 kg m2 h over 72 h operation the membrane showed good performance in separating pollutants with 95 removal rate recorded for chemical oxygen demand nitrate nitrogen total suspended solid total dissolved solid color and turbidity however based on the post characterization analysis the used membranes still suffered from fouling after 72 h dcmd test thus an in depth investigation into the prevention and control of membrane fouling is still necessary for the pome treatment using dcmd keywords membrane distillation palm oil mill effluent pvdf bentonite membrane fouling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction palm oil mill effluent pome is a type of wastewater generated from the palm oil extraction process during the extraction process a significant amount of water is used to produce streams to sterilize palm fruit bunches and to clarify produced vegetable oil it is estimated that 5 tons of water are needed to generate 1 ton of crude palm oil with half of them ending up as wastewater i e pome 1 even though pome is nontoxic to environment direct disposal of it without having proper treatment can cause severe environmental pollution due to its high organic loads 2 3 typically pome would display high levels of chemical oxygen demand cod 15 000 100 000 mg l and biological oxygen demand bod 10 250 43 750 mg l 4 6 besides acidic pome is also very hot 80 90 c and possess an unpleasant odor although it is biodegradable it requires long duration to achieve complete degradation therefore it can be said that pome is considered harmful waste to the environment if discharged without going through proper treatment 2 4 6 7 95 of the pome constituents are water while the rest are water soluble components of palm fruits as well as suspended cellulosic materials like palm fiber 1 4 fat grease and oil residues 0 6 0 7 2 8 it also contains considerable amounts of plants nutrient such as nitrogen potassium magnesium calcium cadmium copper chromium and iron 9 some of the physicochemical properties of pome are listed in table 1 conventional anaerobic aerobic treatment is the most implemented ponding system in malaysia 4 6 15 17 this method is relatively simple and inexpensive but requires large area of lands 17 besides the processes rely only on microorganisms to slowly break down the organic matters furthermore biological treatment requires regular maintenance and monitoring as microorganisms are particularly sensitive to environmental changes extra care must be taken to guarantee that a favorable environment for microorganisms to grow is maintained on negative side different kinds of gases including methane carbon dioxide and trace amount of hydrogen sulphide could be emitted from anaerobic ponds and they are both odorous and corrosive 14 15 even though this method can reduce the pollutants concentration in pome the anaerobically treated effluents in most of the time do not meet the standard discharge limit set by the malaysia s department of environment doe 17 effort is being intensified using different technologies such as adsorption coagulation flocculation and membrane with the aim of producing satisfactory treated effluents 6 18 19 over the last half century many membrane separation methods are invented for new applications these include md which possesses several advantages including high pollutants removal efficiency high permeate flux low temperature and pressure as well as low energy consumption as waste heat can be used as energy source 19 21 unlike pressure driven membrane processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro which rely heavily on external osmotic pressure to operate md process can be operated via vapor pressure differential that exists between porous hydrophobic membrane surface 20 22 24 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system by far is the most preferable md configuration due to its ability to produce high permeate flux and simple design that can be easily manufactured during dcmd process hot feed solution is in direct contact with hot membrane surface normally skin layer whereas the cold permeate solution is in direct contact with the cold membrane surface the temperature difference between cold and hot solutions inside the membrane module results in a partial pressure difference across the membrane 20 21 23 25 since the membrane used for md must demonstrate hydrophobic characteristics it plays key role in preventing direct wetting from the feed solution 21 23 25 evaporation occurs at the membrane feed hot side and the produced vapor will transport across the membrane pores to the membrane permeate cold side at last vapor is condensed by cold solution 21 during md process foulants present in wastewater are unable to permeate through the membrane pores as hydrophobic membrane surface only permits water vapor to pass through this causes the foulants to deposit atop the membrane surface and or clog the membrane surface pores resulting in lower permeate flux and membrane pore wetting 20 21 since hollow fiber membrane hfm module possesses small flow channels foulants species could easily deposit on the membrane surface and lead to an increase in pressure drop to the point where the hydrostatic pressure exceeds the liquid entry pressure lep of membrane 26 fouling can be categorized into four i e inorganic fouling scaling biological fouling organic fouling and particulate colloidal fouling 20 21 27 biomass surfactants humid acid and oily substances are common compounds found in wastewater that can induce membrane pore wetting or fouling humid acid and oily substances may easily adsorb on hydrophobic membranes due to their affinity for hydrophobic surfaces whereas surfactants strongly wet the membrane surface when in contact with as aqueous solution containing hydrophobic species 28 membrane fouling is a major obstacle that limits the performance stability of md 29 the build up of undesirable substances on the membrane surface or within its pores has negative impact on md s performance 21 23 it might result in membrane deterioration early membrane replacement or even termination of operations if not handled correctly it is critical to minimize fouling and module degradation using appropriate membranes to preserve membrane efficiency and as a result reduce expenses associated with membrane module replacement md is gaining increasing importance in membrane process but membrane fouling still renders its large scale implementation in industry the novelty of this work is the fouling mechanism study of the self synthesized polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf bentonite hfm during pome treatment using md process currently there is no report on pome treatment using md technology based on composite hfm pome is typically treated with ultrafiltration uf or nf membranes but the fouling behavior of pressure driven uf nf membrane is completely different compared to the membrane used in md process which is driven by a partial vapor pressure difference pressure driven membrane processes are subject to severe fouling due to the compactness of fouling as they operate at high pressure in addition these membranes are usually hydrophilic in nature to allow water to pass through the membrane meanwhile md uses a hydrophobic membrane because the flux is induced by the temperature difference and the hydrophobic membrane prevents water from entering through the membrane in this work the effects of fouling on the permeate flux and pollutant rejection of pvdf bentonite hfm during dcmd of pome treatment were comprehensively investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 palm oil mill effluent sampling process the pome sample used in this study was collected from fgv palm industries sdn bhd gambang pahang coordinate 3 3830 n 103 0036 e the effluent was sampled from an anaerobic pond of the factory and was stored in an ice box immediately to preserve the organic and nitrogenous matters of the effluent the collected sample was then refrigerated at 4 c until it was used the effluent was analyzed using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater the cod ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and color of the sample were determined by uv vis spectrophotometer dr1900 hach using method 8000 8155 8039 and 8025 respectively total suspended solids tss and total dissolved solids tds meanwhile were analyzed using method 8158 and method 8163 respectively to measure the sample s turbidity turbidimeter 2100q hach was employed 2 2 chemicals polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf kynar 760 mw 440 000 g mol purchased from arkema inc philadelphia usa was used as the base polymer for hollow fiber membrane synthesis analytical grade n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp purity 99 5 purchased from merck was used as organic solvent to dissolve pvdf for the dope preparation bentonite clay powder al2h2na2o13si4 mw 422 29 g mol particle size 25 μm supplied by sigma aldrich was used as filler in the dope solution all materials and chemicals were used as received without prior treatment or modification 2 3 membrane fabrication the pvdf pellets and bentonite clay powder were dried separately in a vacuum oven for 60 min at 60 c to remove moisture the dope solution was then prepared by dissolving 12 wt pvdf pellets in 88 wt nmp under mechanical stirring at 60 c after pvdf was completely dissolved 0 30 wt bentonite clay powder was slowly added into the pvdf nmp solution with the mixture continuously stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained this dope formulation was selected because it produced a membrane with the best results from our laboratory screening work the pvdf bentonite hfms were fabricated via wet phase inversion method in which the detailed fabrication conditions can be found in table 2 2 4 performance evaluation of pome treatment using dcmd system the performances of the pvdf bentonite hfm in terms of water permeability and selectivity were determined using a laboratory scale dcmd system the pvdf bentonite hfms were tested using pome as the feed solution and distilled water as the condensing medium a stainless steel membrane module containing 20 strands of fibers was prepared and used to determine the performance of the membrane during dcmd process the membrane effective length is 0 205 m and its total effective surface area is 0 0103 m2 the system was designed to have two circulating streams i e a hot stream also known as feed stream which was circulated through the membrane shell side and a cold stream which was fed through the lumen side of the hollow fiber membrane the temperature of each solution was controlled at 60 1 c and 20 1 c using a coiled heater 830 protech and a chiller rt2 vivo respectively the operating pressure for feed and permeate was respectively fixed at 8 psi and 2 psi meanwhile the feed and permeate flow velocities were controlled at 0 467 m s and 0 106 m s respectively the membranes were tested for up to 72 h during 72 h dcmd testing period the feed solution was replaced with a new batch of pome daily to avoid significant changes in feed properties due to high rejection capacity of the dcmd system to monitor the membrane flux the weight of the permeate tank was consistently measured using a digital balance every 30 min the feed and permeate solution temperatures were also recorded to check the temperature consistency and to study the effect of temperature polarization the water sample inside the permeate tank was collected from time to time to determine the physicochemical properties of the treated pome prior to pome treatment the permeate flux j v of membrane kg m2 h was calculated based on eq 1 1 j v δw aδt where δw kg is the weight of permeate collected over a predetermined time δt h of dcmd process and a m2 is the effective membrane area of the module eq 2 was used to determine the rejection r of the membrane in terms of cod ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen tss tds color and turbidity 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where c p mg l and cf mg l are the permeate and feed concentration respectively 2 5 membrane characterization of fouled membrane the fouled pvdf bentonite membranes were analyzed using scanning electron microscope sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscope fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer and contact angle goniometer to study the changes in the membrane properties morphology after pome treatment prior to sem image analysis the dry fouled membrane samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen for few minutes before it was fractured the prepared samples were then coated with a platinum thin layer using a sputtering device the membrane surface and cross section were examined using sem tm 3030 plus hitachi an edx spectrometer using an acceleration voltage of 15 kv was used for elemental analysis to confirm the presence of contaminants on the outer layer of the fouled hfm the ftir spectra of the pristine membrane fouled membranes and pome solution were obtained using attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscope atr ftir nicolet 5700 thermo fisher scientific the spectra were recorded at a resolution between 650 and 4000 cm 1 a contact angle goniometer oca15plus dataphysics equipped with image processing software was used to evaluate the degree of membrane hydrophobicity based on the sessile drop technique using deionized water as the probe liquid the contact angle obtained was the angle between the surface of the dried membrane and a line tangent to the curved face of the water droplet at the point of three phase contact 30 the contact angle was measured on the outer surface of the pvdf bentonite membrane i e the side contacted the pome sample ten spots were randomly measured on each sample and averaged deionized water was carefully dropped through a syringe under ambient temperature onto the membrane surface the surface roughness of membranes before and after testing with pome was scanned using atomic force microscope afm hitachi afm5000 ii in a dimension of 5 μm 5 μm the purpose of the afm study is to support the contact angle analysis and analyze the fouling behavior of the membranes a tensile study of the pristine and fouled pvdf bentonite hfm membranes was performed in this study according to astm d3039 standard using an lrx 2 5 skn llyod instrument the membrane sample was clamped at both ends and pulled in tension at a constant elongation rate of 50 mm min with an initial gauge length of 50 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 dcmd test for short term evaluation the pvdf bentonite hfm was first tested with pome for a period of 2 h typically most md studies only tested the membrane for 2 3 h this short evaluation is intended in order to compare our findings with the relevant literature table 3 highlights the applications of dcmd in the treatment of oily wastewater originating from agricultural industries it should be noted that previous studies mainly dealt with wastewater from the olive grove industry which was highly dependent on the country of origin of the authors in contrast this study focuses on the oil palm industry as a primary source of revenue for malaysia as can be seen the average permeate flux from our study which is 3 45 0 51 kg m2 h is comparable to the data reported in the work of muhamad et al and carnevale et al 31 32 variation in permeate flux may be caused by wastewater types and membrane properties it is well known that polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polypropylene pp membranes are superior compared to pvdf membranes due to their higher degree of hydrophobicity in terms of pollutants removal limited data can be compared in table 3 as other studies place a greater focus on polyphenol recovery the pvdf bentonite hfm used in this study meanwhile achieved 99 74 cod rejection which demonstrated that only volatile compounds such as water vapor could pass through the hydrophobic membrane fig 1 shows the performance of dcmd in the treatment of pome for 8 h of operation with an initial permeate flux of 2 71 kg m2 h it should be noted that the highest permeate flux reached by the pvdf bentonite hfm was 5 12 kg m2 h at the third hour of the experiment with an average permeate flow of 4 04 kg m2 h the low flux obtained at the beginning of the dcmd test can be attributed to the insufficient latent heat of vaporization for mass transfer md flux is driven by a partial pressure difference induced by the temperature gradient between the hot and cold solution the permeate flux is proportional to the temperature difference and normally a high flux will be attained when the feed solution has high temperature this experiment set the feed temperature at 60 c while part of the thermal energy can be lost through conduction of the stainless steel membrane module as we conducted the experiment at room temperature heat losses to the environment at the start of the test are inevitable a study reported that heat loss as a result of conduction could reduce the thermal efficiency of the md process 36 in general the permeate flux and thermal efficiency of md process are more sensitive to the membrane properties such as membrane porosity tortuosity membrane thickness and membrane thermal conductivity at low feed bulk temperature rather than high feed bulk temperature because same membrane was used in this study we inferred that the main reason for the rise of the flux in the first 3 h of the operation is because of the increasing latent heat of vaporization and the membrane module was no longer absorbing thermal energy and became progressively stable at this stage the thermal energy can be used for evaporation with minimum heat loss by conduction and heat loss to the surroundings the positive trend may be attributed to greater evaporation efficiency the ratio of heat used for evaporation and total heat input into the module as mentioned by ismail et al 36 the heat of vaporization could not be assumed to be constant as it changed with temperature the suggested equation was adjusted based on tabulated data for saturated water vapor hfg 2 4324t 3167 2 the rate of steam production mainly depends on the temperature difference between cold and hot solutions circulated inside the membrane module nevertheless the membrane was able to recover at t 3 h and kept the performance with slight variations until the end of the operation about 33 of the flux reduction is observed after 3 h operation and the contributing factors are fouling and wetting problems although the membrane module no longer absorbs heat through conduction heat loss may occur due to the additional resistance to heat transfer from the membrane fouling furthermore the permeate flux decreases with the increase of the inlet temperature of permeate stream due to convective heat transfer as inlet temperature of the permeate increases heat transfer rate from the feed side tends to decrease accordingly this as a result increases the temperature of the interface between the membrane and the permeate channel and to a lesser extent the temperature of the interface between the membrane and the feed channel several approaches are available for estimating convective heat transfer coefficients in md modules these include computational fluid dynamics cfd correlations of nusselt numbers and experimental methods among these cfd is the most favorable option where local convective heat transfer coefficients are estimated using numerical solutions of the mass heat and momentum transport equations under defined boundary conditions 37 fig 2 shows the results of the physio chemical analysis of the permeate solution obtained by pvdf bentonite hfm after 8 h dcmd test the results indicated that the membrane performed well the removal efficiency of all parameters except ammoniacal nitrogen exceeded 95 removal rate of the tss was found to be 100 implying that the membrane could retain all suspended solids present in the pome meanwhile cod tds color and turbidity all were reported to have 99 removal efficiency the rejection rate of nitrate nitrogen was approximately 95 after 8 h testing in comparison to other types of contaminants ammonia rejection by md was relatively low and this could be due to the preferential generation of volatile ammonia gas and its adsorption via membrane pores during the heating process 21 it is interesting to note that permeate sample obtained from dcmd testing showed lower discharge values than the standard limits set by the local doe for pome 3 2 dcmd test for long term evaluation dcmd test was carried out for 72 h with 8 h operation per day for 9 days the tests were performed without any membrane cleaning between the days fig 1 shows the permeate flux variation with time for 72 h dcmd test as mentioned earlier the low flux recorded at the beginning of the experiment is due to conductive heat loss to the membrane and or surrounding in this prolonged study same batch of pome sample was used daily however the experiment was only carried out by maximum 8 h per day due to the lab restriction that prevented us to perform beyond typical working hours it must be noted that after each 8 h operation the membrane module was not disassembled from the setup and was continuously used for next day operation to study the fouling characteristics on the membrane surface as can be seen similar trends within the 8 h interval can be observed and the reason is due to heat loss to both the membrane module and environment the average flux for the first 48 h 6 days of operation was 4 00 0 97 kg m2 h the fluctuation is quite acceptable based on the efficiency of the mass transfer process within the membrane module the flux however dropped by about 30 between 48 h and 56 h on day 7 a further decrease in flux could be observed with a reduction of approximately 27 on day 8 before the permeate flux became stable the sudden drop in flux from 48 to 56 h operation can be explained by the decrease in the surface area of the membrane available for the evaporation process the permeate flux was reduced primarily as a result of membrane fouling and polarization effects similar to the short term study it is postulated that organic and inorganic matters present in the pome have accumulated on the outer surface of the hfm and adversely reduced the membrane pore dimension the foulant layer hinders the transport of water molecules in addition as the solute content of the feed solution increases the vapor pressure of the water will be negatively affected given that the transfer of water molecules across the membrane is controlled by the vapor pressure gradient a decrease in vapor pressure is another cause of a decrease in permeate flow 38 fig 2 demonstrates the rejection rate of different parameters obtained from the permeate samples over 72 h dcmd test the permeate sample was taken each day 8 h of dcmd test per day and analyzed accordingly the results revealed that the membrane performed remarkably well the effectiveness of cod tss and turbidity removal were over 99 meanwhile nitrate nitrogen tds and color rejection rates even reached 97 as shown in table 4 the permeate samples obtained by the membrane showed better discharge values than the discharge limit established by the malaysia s doe it is important to note that the rejection rate obtained by the pvdf bentonite membrane in this experiment was almost identical to that obtained in short term experiments the results suggested that the in house made membrane was effective to remove organic and inorganic matters from feed wastewater producing high quality permeable water regardless of the fouling problem the images of the sampling pond pome and final permeate after 72 h operation are presented in fig 3 3 3 membrane characterization after dcmd process 3 3 1 sem edx analysis fig 4 shows the sem images of pvdf bentonite membrane before and after dcmd test with pome as shown in fig 4 a ii b ii and c ii the outer surface of the used membrane was covered by an amorphous fouling layer caused by the highly concentrated organic matters in the feed wastewater meanwhile the small particles detected on the outer layer of the hfm in fig 4 a i could be attributed to the bentonite particles which has been confirmed through edx see fig 6 there was no severe accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface tested for 2 h and 8 h however the surface of membrane was greatly altered after 72 h experiment with significant amount of foulants deposited this developed cake atop the membrane and led to membrane flux deterioration it can be said that the longer the experiment the more substances would settle on the outer surface of the membrane organic and inorganic substances that could not pass through were then recirculated back to the feed tank causing the concentration of feed solution to increase over the time these substances build up on the membrane surface or within its pores could minimize water vapor from entering the membrane the assumption is supported by the decreasing flux trend observed in fig 1 the presence of bentonite in the membrane is able to develop smaller pore size which helps in hindering the penetration of foulants through the membrane based on the cross section sem images of the membranes at different operating times in fig 5 it can be observed that the foulants only deposited on the membrane surface and did not penetrate into the finger like structure of the hfm the results showed that that even though the membrane flux was gradually decreased its separation efficiencies could still be maintained see fig 2 the edx results in fig 6 showed that foreign elements were detected on the outer layer of the fouled membrane in general fluorine f oxygen o and carbon c elements are attributed to the organic structure of pvdf while silicon si aluminum al and sodium na are due to the existence of bentonite clay in the membrane matrix refer to fig 6 a other elements such as nitrogen n magnesium mg phosphorus p calcium ca and potassium k found on the outer surface of the used membranes are originated from pome that contains a considerable amounts of plant nutrients 6 9 plant nutrients such as n p k ca and mg are classified under macronutrients and are normally accounted for relatively large amounts in palm oil plantations fixation of plant nutrients from wastewater onto the outer membrane layer could be correlated with hydrophobic interactions between the membrane and plant nutrients it should be pointed out that the percentage weight of the elements could only be regarded as a qualitative analysis 3 3 2 ftir analysis fig 7 compares the ftir spectra of the membrane before and after pome treatment the spectra of pome showed wide spectrum absorption at 3352 cm 1 and this is designated for oh stretching vibrations of the carboxylic and alcoholic group 39 on the other hand the spectra of fouled membrane showed wide absorption band shifted slightly to 3282 cm 1 indicating the weakened hydrogen bonding in the carboxylic group 40 besides absorption band at around 1636 cm 1 for both pome and fouled membrane is due to co stretch of primary amide 40 there is no obvious similar peak between the fouled membrane and the pome this can be explained by the fact that the dcmd test was performed for short term analysis only 2 and 8 h and the pome components are not able to settle and remain on the top of the membrane however the detection of few similar peaks between the fouled membrane and the pome has proven the presence of organic matters on the outer layer of the membrane there is no apparent difference between the pristine membrane and the foulant membrane in terms of the ftir spectrum the peak at 1401 cm 1which represents ch2 wagging vibration is found for all fouled membranes the peaks at 872 and 839 cm 1 corresponding to the ccc asymmetrical stretching vibration and cf stretching vibration of pvdf respectively are also observed 3 3 3 surface hydrophobicity the surface contact angle of pvdf bentonite membrane was measured at 0 2 8 and 72 h time intervals based on the results in fig 8 the surface contact angle of pristine membrane is around 90 after 2 h dcmd tested with pome the surface contact angle of membrane was decreased to 84 85 further decrease in the contact angle 81 82 was observed after 8 h operation however the contact angle was increased to 100 after 72 h operation this phenomenon can be explained based on the nature of the foulant that is attached on the surface of the membrane the formation of cake is likely to affect the roughness of the membrane affecting the interaction of single water droplet with rougher membrane structure the hydrophobic membrane was adversely affected after being used for the pome treatment this is likely due to the fact that the components of the feed solution penetrated into the pores of the membrane creating flakes and blocking them this as a result reduced the rate of mass transfer the deposited foulants may increase the wettability of the membrane especially when the deposits are within the membrane pores therefore maintaining the hydrophobic characteristics of the membrane is essential to prevent pore wetting 41 the formation of fouling layers on the surface can have a substantial impact on surface hydrophobicity since foulants from pome are usually hydrophilic 21 41 pore wetting is inevitable when the surface of the membrane cannot maintain the hydrophobic feature this results in low permeate flux and low solute removal efficiency 3 3 4 surface roughness surface roughness plays an important role in particle adhesion fig 9 shows the 3d afm images of the pvdf bentonite hfm at different testing duration and its respective surface roughness value the results demonstrated a drastic increase in surface roughness from 22 nm for the pristine membrane to 50 nm for the membrane after 72 h dcmd test it should be noted that as the surface roughness increases two important points must be considered which are the possibility of the intensity of surface peaks increases due to the difference between depth and summit altitudes and the density of these ups and downs in the afm image 42 as can be seen the surface peaks of the fouled membrane 450 500 nm were much higher compared to the pristine membrane 200 nm edachery et al 43 reported that r a or rq rms roughness value cannot be well correlated to wettability behavior as they found that the surface roughness can either increase or decrease wettability this suggests that with an increase in grit size the contribution to the net r a of higher frequency roughness increases as shown in fig 9 there was no significant difference in surface roughness between the hfm membranes after 2 and 8 h of dcmd testing the results imply that the membrane was not severely contaminated by pollutants presented in feed this observation is coherent with the data from sem edx analysis while the majority of studies have agreed that there is a relationship between membrane wetting and surface roughness according to the wenzel and cassie baxter models this relationship is contradicted by our findings in the wenzel model the concept is liquid wets the surface completely while the cassie baxter assumes liquid drop sits on a patterned model surface that is made from solid surface pillar and air the increase in surface roughness is supposed to increase the membrane hydrophobicity however our pvdf bentonite hfm after 2 h and 8 h of dcmd tests were reported to be more hydrophilic after being used this could be due to the partial foulants attachment on the membrane surface that reduced the membrane hydrophobicity as previously mentioned the formation of fouling layers on the membrane surface can have a significant impact on surface hydrophobicity since pollutants from pome are usually hydrophilic 21 41 similar pattern was reported in the work of whang and zhang 44 in which they asserted that the rough surface could increase the effective contact area of the solid liquid interface favouring humidification of the water on the hydrophilic surface nanoscale surface roughness has a marked effect on the measured contact angles and therefore on the range and magnitude of interactions between the membrane and the foulants it is expected that hydrodynamic and physicochemical interactions will influence the measurement of the intrinsic bulk characteristics of a foulant when measuring on a fouled membrane in addition previous study showed that water contact angle is dependent on the pattern size and geometry of the sample surface topography can influence the transition of fluid from a state of high wettability to low wettability and vice versa 43 researchers tailored the surfaces in order to understand better the influence of small scale surface topography on wettability such as creating superhydrophobic surfaces 45 as presented in fig 9 the surface roughness of the fouled membrane was recorded at 50 68 nm after 72 h of pome treatment because the membrane was fully covered with the complex foulants see sem surface image in fig 4 c ii in this condition the contact angle obtained was mainly influenced by the properties of the thick fouling layer the adhesive free energy measured on the fouled membrane surface indicates the potential for subsequent deposition of impurities on the already fouled membrane surface for the membrane tested after 8 h of pome treatment it was obvious that the foulants were loosely attached to the rough surface and only partially obstruct the membrane pores 3 3 5 mechanical strength fig 10 compares the mechanical properties of the pvdf bentonite hfm before and after 72 h of dcmd test the results showed that the membrane tensile strength was slightly increased from 1 90 mpa to 2 07 mpa after 72 h treatment meanwhile the elongation at break was significantly reduced from 114 94 to 70 73 obviously the pristine membrane is more ductile than the fouled membrane the polymer structure of the membrane is always elastic to avoid fractures the fouled membrane however has a low ductility due to the presence of cake layer on the membrane surface this turned out as the weak point of the membrane the electrostatic interaction between the particles was found to be an important parameter for the thickness and structure of the fouling layers which is reflected in several modelling efforts describing the flux decline and structure of the fouling layer apart from the thickness and structure of the fouling layer its cohesive and adhesion strengths towards the membrane are also important these two criteria are essential to optimize the hydrodynamic forces required to prevent the formation of fouling layer during cross flow operations and to facilitate their elimination during cleaning cycles the marginal increment of the tensile strength of the fouled membranes can be assigned to the hydrogen bonding network between foulant membrane interactions 46 this physical cross linking enabled by the h bonding is supported in the ftir analysis whereas a weakened hydrogen bond in the carboxyl group was detected on the pvdf bentonite hfm after 72 h dcmd test zhou and mattsson 47 reported that the cohesive strength increased as the fouling became closer to the membrane surface this may be due to the higher local solid pressure on the fouling layers 3 3 6 membrane fouling membrane fouling in the md process can be categorized as inorganic scaling particulate colloidal fouling and biofouling 20 21 38 based on the sem edx and ftir analysis on the fouled membranes it can be inferred that the membrane fouling during pome treatment were caused by both organic and inorganic substances although the membranes were stable for the first 48 h operation the fouling could still be developed on the membrane surface due to the organic interaction between the pome and the membrane matrix the presence of foulants could slowly evolve into a thick layer i e cake and cover the surface pores of the membrane our findings showed that fouling only affects the outer layer of the membrane and does not take place within its cross section morphology once the cake is developed a stable water flux was able to attain in order to retrieve membrane water flux we recommend conducting backwashing using pure water or chemical solution for future work pome contains complex carbohydrate polymers hemicelluloses and lignocelluloses sugars arabinose xylose glucose galactose and mannose proteins and high in organic acids 48 these organic constituents are composed of both hydrophilic functional groups carboxyl and hydrophobic functional groups hydrocarbon chain because of their amphiprotic nature these organic components could adsorb onto the hydrophobic surface of the pvdf membrane 38 furthermore the hydrophilic functional groups in these organics altered the membrane morphology and its wettability which may have contributed to the onset of fouling and hydrophilization of the membrane surface the first layer of fouling produced on the membrane made it very easy for hydrophilic organic matters in wastewater to adhere to it which accelerated fouling inorganic fouling components such as ca and mg can strengthen the structure of deposits and make the fouling layer even more compact 38 4 conclusions pome can cause environmental pollution if discharged without proper treatment compared to the current conventional open ponding system md is considered a better alternative for pome treatment md could produce high quality treated water with reasonably good permeate flux based on the results the pvdf bentonite hfm was able to achieve permeate flux as high as 4 04 kg m2 h in addition the membrane also attained high contaminant removal rates producing high quality permeate except for ammonia nitrogen the removal efficiencies of membrane against other parameters including cod nitrate nitrogen tss tds color and turbidity were reported to be 95 post fouling characterization of the membrane after the dcmd process showed that the outer surface of the membrane was covered with a fouling layer caused by the pollutants this confirmed our membrane allowed only water vapor to pass through it while retaining other substances in conclusion dcmd is a promising process for pome treatment due to its excellent performance in obtaining high discharge efficiency as membrane fouling is still an obstacle to the development of large scale dcmd further investigation into the prevention and control of membrane fouling is needed for the pome treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

12819,membrane distillation md is one of the emerging methods that can be adopted for oily wastewater treatment however the problems associated with membrane surface fouling may impede its separation efficiency in this work we performed a fouling study using self synthesized polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf bentonite hollow fiber membrane hfm to treat palm oil mill effluent pome via direct contact membrane distillation dcmd to date there is no report on pome treatment using md technology based on pvdf bentonite hfm the fouling tendency was identified based on the membrane s permeate flux and pollutant rejection the fouled membranes after pome treatment were characterized based on its morphology functional group water contact angle surface roughness and mechanical strength the results showed that the average permeate flux of md was 3 34 kg m2 h over 72 h operation the membrane showed good performance in separating pollutants with 95 removal rate recorded for chemical oxygen demand nitrate nitrogen total suspended solid total dissolved solid color and turbidity however based on the post characterization analysis the used membranes still suffered from fouling after 72 h dcmd test thus an in depth investigation into the prevention and control of membrane fouling is still necessary for the pome treatment using dcmd keywords membrane distillation palm oil mill effluent pvdf bentonite membrane fouling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction palm oil mill effluent pome is a type of wastewater generated from the palm oil extraction process during the extraction process a significant amount of water is used to produce streams to sterilize palm fruit bunches and to clarify produced vegetable oil it is estimated that 5 tons of water are needed to generate 1 ton of crude palm oil with half of them ending up as wastewater i e pome 1 even though pome is nontoxic to environment direct disposal of it without having proper treatment can cause severe environmental pollution due to its high organic loads 2 3 typically pome would display high levels of chemical oxygen demand cod 15 000 100 000 mg l and biological oxygen demand bod 10 250 43 750 mg l 4 6 besides acidic pome is also very hot 80 90 c and possess an unpleasant odor although it is biodegradable it requires long duration to achieve complete degradation therefore it can be said that pome is considered harmful waste to the environment if discharged without going through proper treatment 2 4 6 7 95 of the pome constituents are water while the rest are water soluble components of palm fruits as well as suspended cellulosic materials like palm fiber 1 4 fat grease and oil residues 0 6 0 7 2 8 it also contains considerable amounts of plants nutrient such as nitrogen potassium magnesium calcium cadmium copper chromium and iron 9 some of the physicochemical properties of pome are listed in table 1 conventional anaerobic aerobic treatment is the most implemented ponding system in malaysia 4 6 15 17 this method is relatively simple and inexpensive but requires large area of lands 17 besides the processes rely only on microorganisms to slowly break down the organic matters furthermore biological treatment requires regular maintenance and monitoring as microorganisms are particularly sensitive to environmental changes extra care must be taken to guarantee that a favorable environment for microorganisms to grow is maintained on negative side different kinds of gases including methane carbon dioxide and trace amount of hydrogen sulphide could be emitted from anaerobic ponds and they are both odorous and corrosive 14 15 even though this method can reduce the pollutants concentration in pome the anaerobically treated effluents in most of the time do not meet the standard discharge limit set by the malaysia s department of environment doe 17 effort is being intensified using different technologies such as adsorption coagulation flocculation and membrane with the aim of producing satisfactory treated effluents 6 18 19 over the last half century many membrane separation methods are invented for new applications these include md which possesses several advantages including high pollutants removal efficiency high permeate flux low temperature and pressure as well as low energy consumption as waste heat can be used as energy source 19 21 unlike pressure driven membrane processes such as nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro which rely heavily on external osmotic pressure to operate md process can be operated via vapor pressure differential that exists between porous hydrophobic membrane surface 20 22 24 direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system by far is the most preferable md configuration due to its ability to produce high permeate flux and simple design that can be easily manufactured during dcmd process hot feed solution is in direct contact with hot membrane surface normally skin layer whereas the cold permeate solution is in direct contact with the cold membrane surface the temperature difference between cold and hot solutions inside the membrane module results in a partial pressure difference across the membrane 20 21 23 25 since the membrane used for md must demonstrate hydrophobic characteristics it plays key role in preventing direct wetting from the feed solution 21 23 25 evaporation occurs at the membrane feed hot side and the produced vapor will transport across the membrane pores to the membrane permeate cold side at last vapor is condensed by cold solution 21 during md process foulants present in wastewater are unable to permeate through the membrane pores as hydrophobic membrane surface only permits water vapor to pass through this causes the foulants to deposit atop the membrane surface and or clog the membrane surface pores resulting in lower permeate flux and membrane pore wetting 20 21 since hollow fiber membrane hfm module possesses small flow channels foulants species could easily deposit on the membrane surface and lead to an increase in pressure drop to the point where the hydrostatic pressure exceeds the liquid entry pressure lep of membrane 26 fouling can be categorized into four i e inorganic fouling scaling biological fouling organic fouling and particulate colloidal fouling 20 21 27 biomass surfactants humid acid and oily substances are common compounds found in wastewater that can induce membrane pore wetting or fouling humid acid and oily substances may easily adsorb on hydrophobic membranes due to their affinity for hydrophobic surfaces whereas surfactants strongly wet the membrane surface when in contact with as aqueous solution containing hydrophobic species 28 membrane fouling is a major obstacle that limits the performance stability of md 29 the build up of undesirable substances on the membrane surface or within its pores has negative impact on md s performance 21 23 it might result in membrane deterioration early membrane replacement or even termination of operations if not handled correctly it is critical to minimize fouling and module degradation using appropriate membranes to preserve membrane efficiency and as a result reduce expenses associated with membrane module replacement md is gaining increasing importance in membrane process but membrane fouling still renders its large scale implementation in industry the novelty of this work is the fouling mechanism study of the self synthesized polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf bentonite hfm during pome treatment using md process currently there is no report on pome treatment using md technology based on composite hfm pome is typically treated with ultrafiltration uf or nf membranes but the fouling behavior of pressure driven uf nf membrane is completely different compared to the membrane used in md process which is driven by a partial vapor pressure difference pressure driven membrane processes are subject to severe fouling due to the compactness of fouling as they operate at high pressure in addition these membranes are usually hydrophilic in nature to allow water to pass through the membrane meanwhile md uses a hydrophobic membrane because the flux is induced by the temperature difference and the hydrophobic membrane prevents water from entering through the membrane in this work the effects of fouling on the permeate flux and pollutant rejection of pvdf bentonite hfm during dcmd of pome treatment were comprehensively investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 palm oil mill effluent sampling process the pome sample used in this study was collected from fgv palm industries sdn bhd gambang pahang coordinate 3 3830 n 103 0036 e the effluent was sampled from an anaerobic pond of the factory and was stored in an ice box immediately to preserve the organic and nitrogenous matters of the effluent the collected sample was then refrigerated at 4 c until it was used the effluent was analyzed using standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater the cod ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and color of the sample were determined by uv vis spectrophotometer dr1900 hach using method 8000 8155 8039 and 8025 respectively total suspended solids tss and total dissolved solids tds meanwhile were analyzed using method 8158 and method 8163 respectively to measure the sample s turbidity turbidimeter 2100q hach was employed 2 2 chemicals polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf kynar 760 mw 440 000 g mol purchased from arkema inc philadelphia usa was used as the base polymer for hollow fiber membrane synthesis analytical grade n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp purity 99 5 purchased from merck was used as organic solvent to dissolve pvdf for the dope preparation bentonite clay powder al2h2na2o13si4 mw 422 29 g mol particle size 25 μm supplied by sigma aldrich was used as filler in the dope solution all materials and chemicals were used as received without prior treatment or modification 2 3 membrane fabrication the pvdf pellets and bentonite clay powder were dried separately in a vacuum oven for 60 min at 60 c to remove moisture the dope solution was then prepared by dissolving 12 wt pvdf pellets in 88 wt nmp under mechanical stirring at 60 c after pvdf was completely dissolved 0 30 wt bentonite clay powder was slowly added into the pvdf nmp solution with the mixture continuously stirred until a homogeneous solution was obtained this dope formulation was selected because it produced a membrane with the best results from our laboratory screening work the pvdf bentonite hfms were fabricated via wet phase inversion method in which the detailed fabrication conditions can be found in table 2 2 4 performance evaluation of pome treatment using dcmd system the performances of the pvdf bentonite hfm in terms of water permeability and selectivity were determined using a laboratory scale dcmd system the pvdf bentonite hfms were tested using pome as the feed solution and distilled water as the condensing medium a stainless steel membrane module containing 20 strands of fibers was prepared and used to determine the performance of the membrane during dcmd process the membrane effective length is 0 205 m and its total effective surface area is 0 0103 m2 the system was designed to have two circulating streams i e a hot stream also known as feed stream which was circulated through the membrane shell side and a cold stream which was fed through the lumen side of the hollow fiber membrane the temperature of each solution was controlled at 60 1 c and 20 1 c using a coiled heater 830 protech and a chiller rt2 vivo respectively the operating pressure for feed and permeate was respectively fixed at 8 psi and 2 psi meanwhile the feed and permeate flow velocities were controlled at 0 467 m s and 0 106 m s respectively the membranes were tested for up to 72 h during 72 h dcmd testing period the feed solution was replaced with a new batch of pome daily to avoid significant changes in feed properties due to high rejection capacity of the dcmd system to monitor the membrane flux the weight of the permeate tank was consistently measured using a digital balance every 30 min the feed and permeate solution temperatures were also recorded to check the temperature consistency and to study the effect of temperature polarization the water sample inside the permeate tank was collected from time to time to determine the physicochemical properties of the treated pome prior to pome treatment the permeate flux j v of membrane kg m2 h was calculated based on eq 1 1 j v δw aδt where δw kg is the weight of permeate collected over a predetermined time δt h of dcmd process and a m2 is the effective membrane area of the module eq 2 was used to determine the rejection r of the membrane in terms of cod ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen tss tds color and turbidity 2 r 1 c p c f 100 where c p mg l and cf mg l are the permeate and feed concentration respectively 2 5 membrane characterization of fouled membrane the fouled pvdf bentonite membranes were analyzed using scanning electron microscope sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray edx spectroscope fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer and contact angle goniometer to study the changes in the membrane properties morphology after pome treatment prior to sem image analysis the dry fouled membrane samples were immersed in liquid nitrogen for few minutes before it was fractured the prepared samples were then coated with a platinum thin layer using a sputtering device the membrane surface and cross section were examined using sem tm 3030 plus hitachi an edx spectrometer using an acceleration voltage of 15 kv was used for elemental analysis to confirm the presence of contaminants on the outer layer of the fouled hfm the ftir spectra of the pristine membrane fouled membranes and pome solution were obtained using attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared spectroscope atr ftir nicolet 5700 thermo fisher scientific the spectra were recorded at a resolution between 650 and 4000 cm 1 a contact angle goniometer oca15plus dataphysics equipped with image processing software was used to evaluate the degree of membrane hydrophobicity based on the sessile drop technique using deionized water as the probe liquid the contact angle obtained was the angle between the surface of the dried membrane and a line tangent to the curved face of the water droplet at the point of three phase contact 30 the contact angle was measured on the outer surface of the pvdf bentonite membrane i e the side contacted the pome sample ten spots were randomly measured on each sample and averaged deionized water was carefully dropped through a syringe under ambient temperature onto the membrane surface the surface roughness of membranes before and after testing with pome was scanned using atomic force microscope afm hitachi afm5000 ii in a dimension of 5 μm 5 μm the purpose of the afm study is to support the contact angle analysis and analyze the fouling behavior of the membranes a tensile study of the pristine and fouled pvdf bentonite hfm membranes was performed in this study according to astm d3039 standard using an lrx 2 5 skn llyod instrument the membrane sample was clamped at both ends and pulled in tension at a constant elongation rate of 50 mm min with an initial gauge length of 50 mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 dcmd test for short term evaluation the pvdf bentonite hfm was first tested with pome for a period of 2 h typically most md studies only tested the membrane for 2 3 h this short evaluation is intended in order to compare our findings with the relevant literature table 3 highlights the applications of dcmd in the treatment of oily wastewater originating from agricultural industries it should be noted that previous studies mainly dealt with wastewater from the olive grove industry which was highly dependent on the country of origin of the authors in contrast this study focuses on the oil palm industry as a primary source of revenue for malaysia as can be seen the average permeate flux from our study which is 3 45 0 51 kg m2 h is comparable to the data reported in the work of muhamad et al and carnevale et al 31 32 variation in permeate flux may be caused by wastewater types and membrane properties it is well known that polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe and polypropylene pp membranes are superior compared to pvdf membranes due to their higher degree of hydrophobicity in terms of pollutants removal limited data can be compared in table 3 as other studies place a greater focus on polyphenol recovery the pvdf bentonite hfm used in this study meanwhile achieved 99 74 cod rejection which demonstrated that only volatile compounds such as water vapor could pass through the hydrophobic membrane fig 1 shows the performance of dcmd in the treatment of pome for 8 h of operation with an initial permeate flux of 2 71 kg m2 h it should be noted that the highest permeate flux reached by the pvdf bentonite hfm was 5 12 kg m2 h at the third hour of the experiment with an average permeate flow of 4 04 kg m2 h the low flux obtained at the beginning of the dcmd test can be attributed to the insufficient latent heat of vaporization for mass transfer md flux is driven by a partial pressure difference induced by the temperature gradient between the hot and cold solution the permeate flux is proportional to the temperature difference and normally a high flux will be attained when the feed solution has high temperature this experiment set the feed temperature at 60 c while part of the thermal energy can be lost through conduction of the stainless steel membrane module as we conducted the experiment at room temperature heat losses to the environment at the start of the test are inevitable a study reported that heat loss as a result of conduction could reduce the thermal efficiency of the md process 36 in general the permeate flux and thermal efficiency of md process are more sensitive to the membrane properties such as membrane porosity tortuosity membrane thickness and membrane thermal conductivity at low feed bulk temperature rather than high feed bulk temperature because same membrane was used in this study we inferred that the main reason for the rise of the flux in the first 3 h of the operation is because of the increasing latent heat of vaporization and the membrane module was no longer absorbing thermal energy and became progressively stable at this stage the thermal energy can be used for evaporation with minimum heat loss by conduction and heat loss to the surroundings the positive trend may be attributed to greater evaporation efficiency the ratio of heat used for evaporation and total heat input into the module as mentioned by ismail et al 36 the heat of vaporization could not be assumed to be constant as it changed with temperature the suggested equation was adjusted based on tabulated data for saturated water vapor hfg 2 4324t 3167 2 the rate of steam production mainly depends on the temperature difference between cold and hot solutions circulated inside the membrane module nevertheless the membrane was able to recover at t 3 h and kept the performance with slight variations until the end of the operation about 33 of the flux reduction is observed after 3 h operation and the contributing factors are fouling and wetting problems although the membrane module no longer absorbs heat through conduction heat loss may occur due to the additional resistance to heat transfer from the membrane fouling furthermore the permeate flux decreases with the increase of the inlet temperature of permeate stream due to convective heat transfer as inlet temperature of the permeate increases heat transfer rate from the feed side tends to decrease accordingly this as a result increases the temperature of the interface between the membrane and the permeate channel and to a lesser extent the temperature of the interface between the membrane and the feed channel several approaches are available for estimating convective heat transfer coefficients in md modules these include computational fluid dynamics cfd correlations of nusselt numbers and experimental methods among these cfd is the most favorable option where local convective heat transfer coefficients are estimated using numerical solutions of the mass heat and momentum transport equations under defined boundary conditions 37 fig 2 shows the results of the physio chemical analysis of the permeate solution obtained by pvdf bentonite hfm after 8 h dcmd test the results indicated that the membrane performed well the removal efficiency of all parameters except ammoniacal nitrogen exceeded 95 removal rate of the tss was found to be 100 implying that the membrane could retain all suspended solids present in the pome meanwhile cod tds color and turbidity all were reported to have 99 removal efficiency the rejection rate of nitrate nitrogen was approximately 95 after 8 h testing in comparison to other types of contaminants ammonia rejection by md was relatively low and this could be due to the preferential generation of volatile ammonia gas and its adsorption via membrane pores during the heating process 21 it is interesting to note that permeate sample obtained from dcmd testing showed lower discharge values than the standard limits set by the local doe for pome 3 2 dcmd test for long term evaluation dcmd test was carried out for 72 h with 8 h operation per day for 9 days the tests were performed without any membrane cleaning between the days fig 1 shows the permeate flux variation with time for 72 h dcmd test as mentioned earlier the low flux recorded at the beginning of the experiment is due to conductive heat loss to the membrane and or surrounding in this prolonged study same batch of pome sample was used daily however the experiment was only carried out by maximum 8 h per day due to the lab restriction that prevented us to perform beyond typical working hours it must be noted that after each 8 h operation the membrane module was not disassembled from the setup and was continuously used for next day operation to study the fouling characteristics on the membrane surface as can be seen similar trends within the 8 h interval can be observed and the reason is due to heat loss to both the membrane module and environment the average flux for the first 48 h 6 days of operation was 4 00 0 97 kg m2 h the fluctuation is quite acceptable based on the efficiency of the mass transfer process within the membrane module the flux however dropped by about 30 between 48 h and 56 h on day 7 a further decrease in flux could be observed with a reduction of approximately 27 on day 8 before the permeate flux became stable the sudden drop in flux from 48 to 56 h operation can be explained by the decrease in the surface area of the membrane available for the evaporation process the permeate flux was reduced primarily as a result of membrane fouling and polarization effects similar to the short term study it is postulated that organic and inorganic matters present in the pome have accumulated on the outer surface of the hfm and adversely reduced the membrane pore dimension the foulant layer hinders the transport of water molecules in addition as the solute content of the feed solution increases the vapor pressure of the water will be negatively affected given that the transfer of water molecules across the membrane is controlled by the vapor pressure gradient a decrease in vapor pressure is another cause of a decrease in permeate flow 38 fig 2 demonstrates the rejection rate of different parameters obtained from the permeate samples over 72 h dcmd test the permeate sample was taken each day 8 h of dcmd test per day and analyzed accordingly the results revealed that the membrane performed remarkably well the effectiveness of cod tss and turbidity removal were over 99 meanwhile nitrate nitrogen tds and color rejection rates even reached 97 as shown in table 4 the permeate samples obtained by the membrane showed better discharge values than the discharge limit established by the malaysia s doe it is important to note that the rejection rate obtained by the pvdf bentonite membrane in this experiment was almost identical to that obtained in short term experiments the results suggested that the in house made membrane was effective to remove organic and inorganic matters from feed wastewater producing high quality permeable water regardless of the fouling problem the images of the sampling pond pome and final permeate after 72 h operation are presented in fig 3 3 3 membrane characterization after dcmd process 3 3 1 sem edx analysis fig 4 shows the sem images of pvdf bentonite membrane before and after dcmd test with pome as shown in fig 4 a ii b ii and c ii the outer surface of the used membrane was covered by an amorphous fouling layer caused by the highly concentrated organic matters in the feed wastewater meanwhile the small particles detected on the outer layer of the hfm in fig 4 a i could be attributed to the bentonite particles which has been confirmed through edx see fig 6 there was no severe accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface tested for 2 h and 8 h however the surface of membrane was greatly altered after 72 h experiment with significant amount of foulants deposited this developed cake atop the membrane and led to membrane flux deterioration it can be said that the longer the experiment the more substances would settle on the outer surface of the membrane organic and inorganic substances that could not pass through were then recirculated back to the feed tank causing the concentration of feed solution to increase over the time these substances build up on the membrane surface or within its pores could minimize water vapor from entering the membrane the assumption is supported by the decreasing flux trend observed in fig 1 the presence of bentonite in the membrane is able to develop smaller pore size which helps in hindering the penetration of foulants through the membrane based on the cross section sem images of the membranes at different operating times in fig 5 it can be observed that the foulants only deposited on the membrane surface and did not penetrate into the finger like structure of the hfm the results showed that that even though the membrane flux was gradually decreased its separation efficiencies could still be maintained see fig 2 the edx results in fig 6 showed that foreign elements were detected on the outer layer of the fouled membrane in general fluorine f oxygen o and carbon c elements are attributed to the organic structure of pvdf while silicon si aluminum al and sodium na are due to the existence of bentonite clay in the membrane matrix refer to fig 6 a other elements such as nitrogen n magnesium mg phosphorus p calcium ca and potassium k found on the outer surface of the used membranes are originated from pome that contains a considerable amounts of plant nutrients 6 9 plant nutrients such as n p k ca and mg are classified under macronutrients and are normally accounted for relatively large amounts in palm oil plantations fixation of plant nutrients from wastewater onto the outer membrane layer could be correlated with hydrophobic interactions between the membrane and plant nutrients it should be pointed out that the percentage weight of the elements could only be regarded as a qualitative analysis 3 3 2 ftir analysis fig 7 compares the ftir spectra of the membrane before and after pome treatment the spectra of pome showed wide spectrum absorption at 3352 cm 1 and this is designated for oh stretching vibrations of the carboxylic and alcoholic group 39 on the other hand the spectra of fouled membrane showed wide absorption band shifted slightly to 3282 cm 1 indicating the weakened hydrogen bonding in the carboxylic group 40 besides absorption band at around 1636 cm 1 for both pome and fouled membrane is due to co stretch of primary amide 40 there is no obvious similar peak between the fouled membrane and the pome this can be explained by the fact that the dcmd test was performed for short term analysis only 2 and 8 h and the pome components are not able to settle and remain on the top of the membrane however the detection of few similar peaks between the fouled membrane and the pome has proven the presence of organic matters on the outer layer of the membrane there is no apparent difference between the pristine membrane and the foulant membrane in terms of the ftir spectrum the peak at 1401 cm 1which represents ch2 wagging vibration is found for all fouled membranes the peaks at 872 and 839 cm 1 corresponding to the ccc asymmetrical stretching vibration and cf stretching vibration of pvdf respectively are also observed 3 3 3 surface hydrophobicity the surface contact angle of pvdf bentonite membrane was measured at 0 2 8 and 72 h time intervals based on the results in fig 8 the surface contact angle of pristine membrane is around 90 after 2 h dcmd tested with pome the surface contact angle of membrane was decreased to 84 85 further decrease in the contact angle 81 82 was observed after 8 h operation however the contact angle was increased to 100 after 72 h operation this phenomenon can be explained based on the nature of the foulant that is attached on the surface of the membrane the formation of cake is likely to affect the roughness of the membrane affecting the interaction of single water droplet with rougher membrane structure the hydrophobic membrane was adversely affected after being used for the pome treatment this is likely due to the fact that the components of the feed solution penetrated into the pores of the membrane creating flakes and blocking them this as a result reduced the rate of mass transfer the deposited foulants may increase the wettability of the membrane especially when the deposits are within the membrane pores therefore maintaining the hydrophobic characteristics of the membrane is essential to prevent pore wetting 41 the formation of fouling layers on the surface can have a substantial impact on surface hydrophobicity since foulants from pome are usually hydrophilic 21 41 pore wetting is inevitable when the surface of the membrane cannot maintain the hydrophobic feature this results in low permeate flux and low solute removal efficiency 3 3 4 surface roughness surface roughness plays an important role in particle adhesion fig 9 shows the 3d afm images of the pvdf bentonite hfm at different testing duration and its respective surface roughness value the results demonstrated a drastic increase in surface roughness from 22 nm for the pristine membrane to 50 nm for the membrane after 72 h dcmd test it should be noted that as the surface roughness increases two important points must be considered which are the possibility of the intensity of surface peaks increases due to the difference between depth and summit altitudes and the density of these ups and downs in the afm image 42 as can be seen the surface peaks of the fouled membrane 450 500 nm were much higher compared to the pristine membrane 200 nm edachery et al 43 reported that r a or rq rms roughness value cannot be well correlated to wettability behavior as they found that the surface roughness can either increase or decrease wettability this suggests that with an increase in grit size the contribution to the net r a of higher frequency roughness increases as shown in fig 9 there was no significant difference in surface roughness between the hfm membranes after 2 and 8 h of dcmd testing the results imply that the membrane was not severely contaminated by pollutants presented in feed this observation is coherent with the data from sem edx analysis while the majority of studies have agreed that there is a relationship between membrane wetting and surface roughness according to the wenzel and cassie baxter models this relationship is contradicted by our findings in the wenzel model the concept is liquid wets the surface completely while the cassie baxter assumes liquid drop sits on a patterned model surface that is made from solid surface pillar and air the increase in surface roughness is supposed to increase the membrane hydrophobicity however our pvdf bentonite hfm after 2 h and 8 h of dcmd tests were reported to be more hydrophilic after being used this could be due to the partial foulants attachment on the membrane surface that reduced the membrane hydrophobicity as previously mentioned the formation of fouling layers on the membrane surface can have a significant impact on surface hydrophobicity since pollutants from pome are usually hydrophilic 21 41 similar pattern was reported in the work of whang and zhang 44 in which they asserted that the rough surface could increase the effective contact area of the solid liquid interface favouring humidification of the water on the hydrophilic surface nanoscale surface roughness has a marked effect on the measured contact angles and therefore on the range and magnitude of interactions between the membrane and the foulants it is expected that hydrodynamic and physicochemical interactions will influence the measurement of the intrinsic bulk characteristics of a foulant when measuring on a fouled membrane in addition previous study showed that water contact angle is dependent on the pattern size and geometry of the sample surface topography can influence the transition of fluid from a state of high wettability to low wettability and vice versa 43 researchers tailored the surfaces in order to understand better the influence of small scale surface topography on wettability such as creating superhydrophobic surfaces 45 as presented in fig 9 the surface roughness of the fouled membrane was recorded at 50 68 nm after 72 h of pome treatment because the membrane was fully covered with the complex foulants see sem surface image in fig 4 c ii in this condition the contact angle obtained was mainly influenced by the properties of the thick fouling layer the adhesive free energy measured on the fouled membrane surface indicates the potential for subsequent deposition of impurities on the already fouled membrane surface for the membrane tested after 8 h of pome treatment it was obvious that the foulants were loosely attached to the rough surface and only partially obstruct the membrane pores 3 3 5 mechanical strength fig 10 compares the mechanical properties of the pvdf bentonite hfm before and after 72 h of dcmd test the results showed that the membrane tensile strength was slightly increased from 1 90 mpa to 2 07 mpa after 72 h treatment meanwhile the elongation at break was significantly reduced from 114 94 to 70 73 obviously the pristine membrane is more ductile than the fouled membrane the polymer structure of the membrane is always elastic to avoid fractures the fouled membrane however has a low ductility due to the presence of cake layer on the membrane surface this turned out as the weak point of the membrane the electrostatic interaction between the particles was found to be an important parameter for the thickness and structure of the fouling layers which is reflected in several modelling efforts describing the flux decline and structure of the fouling layer apart from the thickness and structure of the fouling layer its cohesive and adhesion strengths towards the membrane are also important these two criteria are essential to optimize the hydrodynamic forces required to prevent the formation of fouling layer during cross flow operations and to facilitate their elimination during cleaning cycles the marginal increment of the tensile strength of the fouled membranes can be assigned to the hydrogen bonding network between foulant membrane interactions 46 this physical cross linking enabled by the h bonding is supported in the ftir analysis whereas a weakened hydrogen bond in the carboxyl group was detected on the pvdf bentonite hfm after 72 h dcmd test zhou and mattsson 47 reported that the cohesive strength increased as the fouling became closer to the membrane surface this may be due to the higher local solid pressure on the fouling layers 3 3 6 membrane fouling membrane fouling in the md process can be categorized as inorganic scaling particulate colloidal fouling and biofouling 20 21 38 based on the sem edx and ftir analysis on the fouled membranes it can be inferred that the membrane fouling during pome treatment were caused by both organic and inorganic substances although the membranes were stable for the first 48 h operation the fouling could still be developed on the membrane surface due to the organic interaction between the pome and the membrane matrix the presence of foulants could slowly evolve into a thick layer i e cake and cover the surface pores of the membrane our findings showed that fouling only affects the outer layer of the membrane and does not take place within its cross section morphology once the cake is developed a stable water flux was able to attain in order to retrieve membrane water flux we recommend conducting backwashing using pure water or chemical solution for future work pome contains complex carbohydrate polymers hemicelluloses and lignocelluloses sugars arabinose xylose glucose galactose and mannose proteins and high in organic acids 48 these organic constituents are composed of both hydrophilic functional groups carboxyl and hydrophobic functional groups hydrocarbon chain because of their amphiprotic nature these organic components could adsorb onto the hydrophobic surface of the pvdf membrane 38 furthermore the hydrophilic functional groups in these organics altered the membrane morphology and its wettability which may have contributed to the onset of fouling and hydrophilization of the membrane surface the first layer of fouling produced on the membrane made it very easy for hydrophilic organic matters in wastewater to adhere to it which accelerated fouling inorganic fouling components such as ca and mg can strengthen the structure of deposits and make the fouling layer even more compact 38 4 conclusions pome can cause environmental pollution if discharged without proper treatment compared to the current conventional open ponding system md is considered a better alternative for pome treatment md could produce high quality treated water with reasonably good permeate flux based on the results the pvdf bentonite hfm was able to achieve permeate flux as high as 4 04 kg m2 h in addition the membrane also attained high contaminant removal rates producing high quality permeate except for ammonia nitrogen the removal efficiencies of membrane against other parameters including cod nitrate nitrogen tss tds color and turbidity were reported to be 95 post fouling characterization of the membrane after the dcmd process showed that the outer surface of the membrane was covered with a fouling layer caused by the pollutants this confirmed our membrane allowed only water vapor to pass through it while retaining other substances in conclusion dcmd is a promising process for pome treatment due to its excellent performance in obtaining high discharge efficiency as membrane fouling is still an obstacle to the development of large scale dcmd further investigation into the prevention and control of membrane fouling is needed for the pome treatment declaration of competing interest the authors
