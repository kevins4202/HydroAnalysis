18915,widespread chemical contamination represents one of the largest threats of the anthropocene the pesticide in water calculator pwc is a fate and transport model used by the environmental protection agency and health canada to estimate pesticide exposures in lentic freshwater ecosystems and make pesticide registration decisions here we show that maximum measured concentrations of 31 of herbicides and 42 of insecticides exceeded maximum estimated environmental concentrations eecs produced by the pwc suggesting that eecs often do not represent worst case exposure as they have been purported to do based on this observation we generated statistical models using eecs and over 600 000 field measurements of 31 common insecticides and herbicides to document if the congruence of eecs and maximum field measurements could be improved by accounting for environmental sampling effort number of times a pesticide is sampled and contaminant application factors commonly ignored in most fate and transport models for lentic systems variance in pesticide field measurements explained by eecs increased by 50 when sampling effort was included for lotic systems variance explained increased by only 4 most likely because lotic systems are sampled over 4 9 times as much as lentic systems including use more than doubled the ability of the eecs to predict maximum pesticides concentrations in lentic systems our results suggest that exposure characterization in risk assessment can likely be improved by considering sampling effort and use thus providing more defensible environmental

characterization estimated environmental concentrations 1 introduction chemical pollution represents one of the most widespread and destructive forms of human disturbance on earth bernhardt et al 2017 nel et al 2006 rhind 2009 threatening the health and wellbeing of humans braun 2017 kampa and castanas 2008 larsen et al 2017 and the environment fleeger et al 2003 meybeck and helmer 1989 rohr and mccoy 2010 the distribution of pesticides in particular is globally widespread in surface waters presenting a major threat to aquatic biodiversity beketov et al 2013 malaj et al 2014 stehle and schulz 2015 in the united states us more than 500 million pounds of active ingredients of pesticides are applied annually atwood and paisley jones 2017 leading to well documented contamination of freshwater systems dudgeon et al 2006 gilliom and hamilton 2006 stone et al 2014 that provide habitat for about 10 of all described taxa on earth strayer and dudgeon 2010 therefore the ability to predict levels of contamination in the field is critical to accurately assessing human and wildlife exposures and designing effective management strategies to minimize risks in sensitive systems fate and transport models are important tools for predicting contaminant exposures for instance the united states us environmental protection agency epa and health canada use the pesticide in water calculator pwc model to generate a peak estimated environmental concentration eec us epa 1992 of a focal pesticide in a standardized lentic waterbody that is a set distance from a site of application young 2016 the model calculates an eec based on inputs of pesticide traits e g half life and koc application amount and frequency based on crop of interest and soil and climatic characteristics based on crop and region of interest young 2016 eecs of a variety of chemicals including those that are not pesticides are used in human health and ecological risk assessments generally the epa uses the pwc to predict pesticide eecs in ponds and reservoirs which are used in ecological risk assessments and drinking water assessments respectively luo 2014 ecological risk assessments play a role in the registration of pesticide before they come to market and the reregistration of pesticides which occurs at least every 15 years once a pesticide is approved historically the maximum eec for pesticides has been regarded as a worst case chemical exposure scenario in freshwater systems by the epa us epa 1992 in risk assessment eecs are compared against toxicity values e g lc50 to characterize the likelihood of toxicity at a given level of exposure us epa 2004 1992 evaluation of eecs in this way informs the development of environmental standards policies guidelines and regulations as well as the registration and reregistration of chemicals for legal use us epa 2004 the availability of large scale data within the us on pesticide use baker and stone 2015 thelin and stone 2013 and monitoring read et al 2017 provides an opportunity for the accuracy of pwc exposure estimates to be evaluated and improved recently the ability of the european union s forum for the co ordination of pesticide fate models and their use focus model was evaluated for its accuracy in predicting worst case scenario exposures using monitoring data these evaluations revealed that the model performed poorly in predicting environmental concentration of insecticides and fungicides kn√§bel et al 2014 2012 the true or actual peak environmental concentration of any given pesticide is an extremely rare event in time and space leu et al 2005 stehle et al 2013 thurman et al 1991 and thus evaluating model predictions of peak environmental concentrations necessitates copious field measurements many more than are required to reliably predict mean environmental concentrations crawford 2004 fortunately over the last three decades federal agencies including the epa and us geological survey usgs have compiled hundreds of thousands of field measurements of pesticides from lotic streams and rivers and lentic ponds and reservoirs freshwater ecosystems across the us these publicly available data allow us here to 1 evaluate if eecs are indeed indicative of worst case exposure scenarios and 2 determine if the congruence between predicted eecs from the pwc and measured maximum concentrations of pesticides in the field can be improved an important consideration for evaluating the congruence between predicted eecs and measured maximum concentrations might be environmental sampling effort defined as the total number of times a pesticide is surveyed across locations and time if we are to determine how well maximum eecs predict maximum field concentrations of contaminants that are currently used we must account for the variance in maximum field concentrations that is a function of sampling effort for instance we propose that sampling effort should be related asymptotically to the maximum environmental concentration of a contaminant such that increases in sampling effort increase the likelihood of detecting the true peak environmental concentration at low gray section in fig 1 a but not high sampling efforts white section in fig 1a given this proposed relationship we hypothesize that incorporating information on environmental sampling effort will improve the ability of eecs to predict maximum environmental concentrations but only for systems that are not well sampled and thus fall on the section of the sampling effort maximum field concentration curve that is increasing rather than at or near the asymptote no study to our knowledge has incorporated sampling effort of monitoring data into their evaluations of the predictions of pesticide exposure models which could be an important consideration in assessing model accuracy the ability of eecs to predict maximum field concentrations might also be improved by accounting for multiple sources of contaminant use or release most fate and transport models including the pwc assume a single point source of contamination but measured concentrations in freshwater ecosystems are often the result of runoff and aerial deposition from multiple sources of contamination across the landscape the input of pesticides from multiple sources of contamination across the landscape is likely many orders of magnitude greater than application amounts on a single agricultural field larsen and noack 2017 the sole point source assumed by the pwc model the inaccurate assumption of a single point source could misrepresent the true or actual peak concentration in the environment that the pwc seeks to model thus we hypothesize that incorporating information on use of chemicals might improve the congruence between eecs and maximum field concentrations because use is a proxy for multiple sources of contamination within a watershed the usgs recently provided pesticide use estimates across the us allowing us to evaluate how a proxy for multiple sources of contamination within a watershed affects the ability of the pwc to predict maximum measured concentrations in the environment to test the hypotheses that the abilities of fate and transport models to predict maximum field concentrations can be improved by accounting for environmental sampling effort and contaminant release information we selected 31 of the most commonly used pesticides and compiled data describing their use application rate environmental mobility eecs from the pwc and maximum measured environmental concentrations in lentic and lotic systems only a single study has used measured environmental concentrations to validate eecs from the pwc however implications from this study are limited because few focal pesticides were evaluated environmental concentrations were taken from a limited geographic region a single state and eecs were not compared to maximum measured field concentrations xie et al 2018 we predicted that eecs would not represent worst case scenarios of exposure because eecs fail to incorporate multiple sources of contamination and instead model a commonly unrealistic single point source given the postulated importance of sampling effort we predicted that the pwc would more accurately predict maximum concentrations in lotic than lentic systems because lotic systems are sampled for pesticides nearly 4 9 times as much as lentic systems mean number standard deviation of lotic versus lentic samples per pesticide from federal databases 16 111 10 301 vs 3304 3005 finally we predicted that the pwc s predictions of maximum eecs could be improved by incorporating use or release information to account for likely multiple sources of pesticides to freshwater ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 pesticide selection our analyses focus on the 31 most commonly used herbicides and insecticides applied on corn in the us table 1 we focus on corn because corn was the most commonly harvested crop by area in the us from 1992 to 2012 the time span of current study us department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service making corn the most widespread source of pesticide contamination to aquatic systems of all crops to select this group of 31 pesticides we first ranked all insecticides and herbicides based on their estimated use in the us by summing 2006 county level pesticide use estimates from the estimated annual agricultural pesticide use dataset provided by pesticide national synthesis project of the national water quality assessment nawqa program us geological survey usgs https water usgs gov nawqa pnsp usage maps county level we classified each pesticide as an herbicide or insecticide using the primary use type classifications indicated by the pesticide action network pan pesticide database http www pesticideinfo org we excluded mineral or biologic e g bacteria pesticides because we were interested in examining the transport and fate of synthetic compounds from these most commonly used synthetic herbicides and insecticides we selected compounds that were detected in streams from 1992 to 2012 by the usgs nawqa program www waterqualitydata us portal obtained on 30 march 2017 finally we examined commercial product use labels and only included compounds that were used on corn because standard epa scenarios used in the calculation of eecs see below are more frequently available across geographic regions in the us for corn than other crops this selection process resulted in 16 herbicides and 15 insecticides table 1 2 2 building a dataset characterizing herbicides and insecticides we built a dataset describing each selected pesticides use application rate environmental mobility and persistence and maximum measured environmental concentration tables s1 and s2 for each compound we determined an estimate of national use by summing all county level pesticide estimates from the estimated annual agricultural pesticide use dataset from 1992 to 2012 these use estimates represent use for all crops maximum concentrations of pesticides in lotic systems were taken from stream survey data from 1992 to 2012 from the usgs nawqa program from https www waterqualitydata us obtained on 30 march 2017 filtered by nawqa program and stream site type the total number of stream surveys from which maximum concentrations were taken totaled 499 435 maximum concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems were taken from surveys of lakes reservoirs impoundments and wetlands from 1992 to 2012 available from national water quality monitoring council https www waterqualitydata us obtained on 9 november 2017 filtered by site type to include lakes reservoirs impoundments and wetlands the total number of surveys from these lentic systems from which maximum concentrations were taken totaled 129 471 for each pesticide a single maximum concentration was taken from across lentic and lotic survey locations and times to help ensure data quality for measured maximum concentrations we excluded data that were not measured in mass volume units e g Œºg l excluded measurements that were a result of qa qc for pesticide testing e g spiked water samples acting as controls and ensured all concentrations were converted to the same units e g Œºg l finally to help limit the influence of timing of sampling on detection of maximum concentrations we excluded samples that were triggered by a hydrologic event i e event based sampling such as a flood or a storm instead we focused on field samples that were gathered as part of routine based sampling efforts in preliminary analyses event based samples were included but did not change the results described in this current manuscript since we wanted to record maximum observed pesticide concentrations both filtered and whole water sample were considered more information regarding the methods of data collection for the resulting pesticide concentrations e g water sampling lab testing is provided in tables s3 and s4 we also recorded sampling effort for each pesticide in lentic and lotic systems which was the number of times a pesticide was surveyed for across locations and time in addition we gathered maximum field concentrations from lakes ponds agricultural ditches and tailwaters by reviewing the published scientific literature to evaluate whether maximum eecs are indeed worst case scenarios of exposure using the most information possible on maximum lentic concentrations we conducted a literature search using web of science and google scholar using combinations of the following terms concentration tailwater pond ditch runoff field concentration and the name of the focal pesticide e g atrazine in the final dataset we include only values from the literature that exceeded pesticide field database values in lentic systems individual maximum concentrations of pesticides gathered from databases or the literature represent observed maximum measured concentrations and not the true or actual peak concentrations which can only be greater than or equal to the maximum observed concentration crawford 2004 2 3 overview of the pwc model the pwc is a graphic user interface developed by the epa office of pesticide programs that links the output of the pesticide root zone model przm and the variable volume water model vvwm the pwc generates eecs for a fixed volume no flow 1 ha by 2 m farm pond or a 5 26 ha by 2 74 m reservoir based on runoff water suspended solids and pesticides and overspray from an adjacent 10 ha pesticide treated field burns 2000 young 2015 2016 the pwc uses mass balance equations and assumes that all materials in the two modeled compartments the water and sediment are at thermodynamic equilibrium the inflow of dissolved pesticides or drift is delivered to the water compartment and sorbed pesticides are delivered to both water and sediment pesticides are removed from the water body via sediment burial volatilization and degradation additional background on the pwc can be obtained from young 2016 2 4 generating estimated environmental concentrations data describing the environmental mobility and persistence of herbicides used in the calculation of eecs including koc water column metabolism half life benthic metabolism half life foliar half life aqueous photolysis half life molecular weight vapor pressure and solubility were taken primarily from the pesticide properties database from the university of hertfordshire ppdb https sitem herts ac uk aeru ppdb en values for hydrolysis half life and aerobic soil half life were taken from pan pesticide database when values were not available for certain pesticides from pan or ppdb we used data from the toxicology data network toxnet from the national institutes of health https toxnet nlm nih gov newtoxnet hsdb htm as indicated in tables s1 and s2 additional pesticide traits included henry s constant heat of henry air diffusion coefficient and application information tables s1 and s2 henry s constant and the heat of henry were taken from the epa s estimation program interface epi suite specifically henrywin henry s constant was calculated using the bond contribution method we calculated the air diffusion coefficient using the epa s on line tools for site assessment calculation https www3 epa gov ceampubl learn2model part two onsite estdiffusion ext html data concerning number of applications per year timing of applications and maximum recommended application rate and method were taken from us commercial pesticide product labels for herbicides product instructions for pre emergent applications for corn were followed when available we assumed that the last application of pre emergent herbicides would occur just after planting 12 days prior to corn emergence for herbicides that are exclusively applied post emergence we assumed applications would occur 10 days after corn emergence we assumed all herbicides would be applied by direct ground spray unless product labels indicated the need for soil incorporation in those cases applications were set to occur at the suggested depth of soil incorporation based on the product label for insecticides product application instructions for post emergent applications for corn were used when available we assumed that the first applications would occur 30 days after emergence by spray above the plant for insecticides that are applied pre emergence we assumed applications would occur 12 days before emergence by ground spray at the depth of soil incorporation according to the product labels using the epa s pesticide in water calculator v 1 52 pwc https www epa gov pesticide science and assessing pesticide risks models pesticide risk assessment pwc we generated eecs of the selected pesticides model inputs consisted of mobility persistence and application data for individual pesticide compounds tables s1 and s2 for all pesticide compounds water benthic and soil reference temperatures were assumed to be 23 c and photolysis reference latitude was 40 when foliar half life was not available for a given pesticide foliar half life was assumed not to be a large contributor to breakdown in the environment in the pwc model and was set to zero under the recommendation of the pwc user manual efficiency was set to 0 99 and drift was set to 0 01 for all pesticide compounds applications were assumed to occur every year for each pesticide compound eecs were generated for both ponds and reservoirs in each of five different states illinois mississippi north carolina ohio and pennsylvania which varied in their meteorological and geological model inputs provided by the pwc software this resulted in 10 eecs values for each pesticide we used the maximum eec of these 10 estimates for each pesticide in all statistical analyses while we generated all eecs based on use on corn because it is the most common crop in the us to assess how much the results might be sensitive to the use of a single crop we gathered eec estimates for each pesticide based on use on corn soybean and cotton where possible we then quantified how much variation in eecs there was within pesticides among crops versus among pesticides more variation among pesticides compared to within pesticides among crops would signify our findings are relatively robust based on corn alone we discovered that there was 4 times the variance among pesticides 47 4 than there was within pesticide among crops 11 7 suggesting that our analyses would likely not change substantially if we could better account for the local crop on which each pesticide was used mostly commonly supporting information fig s1 2 5 statistical analyses to determine how often maximum eecs represent worst case scenarios of pesticides in lentic systems we calculated the proportion of pesticides for which the maximum environmental concentrations in lentic systems exceeded maximum eecs from pwc models in this evaluation the point of comparison for the eec was the highest concentration of pesticide found in the water quality monitoring council database or in the literature we incorporated literature and database field measurements because we wanted to use all possible available data to describe maximum lentic field values in all other analyses we use maximum lentic field values from the national water quality monitoring council exclusively to ensure that the methods of estimating maximum lentic and lotic field concentrations were similar which is an important consideration for improving the congruences between eecs and field concentrations because inconsistencies in methodologies might bias analyses the literature concentrations had to be removed from these analyses because they did not use consistent sampling methodology across studies next we evaluated the effects of sampling effort on detection of maximum field concentrations in both lentic and lotic systems while eecs are not generally intended to represent lotic systems we sought to use lotic systems because of our hypothesis that increased sampling effort might increase the congruence between eecs and maximum field measurements lotic systems are much more sampled compared to lentic systems if we only considered sampling effort variation within lentic systems it is possible that we would not span a large enough range of sampling efforts to capture the hypothesized asymptotic section of the sampling effort maximum concentration curve in fact our concern was validated because lotic systems seem to be at or near the asymptote whereas many lentic systems appear to be on the section of the curve where increasing sampling effort increases the maximum eec to evaluate the effects of sampling effort on detection of maximum field concentrations in lentic and lotic systems we built two separate linear models lm function stats package r core team 2018 in which the response was either maximum lentic or lotic concentration and the predictor was sampling effort defined as the total number of times a pesticide was surveyed for between 1992 and 2012 respective to each system including surveys which resulted in no detection of the pesticide to evaluate if inclusion of sampling effort improved the congruence of maximum eecs with maximum field concentrations first we examined the effect of sampling effort on the relationship between maximum field concentration and maximum eec we extracted the residuals from a mixed model lmer function lme4 package bates et al 2015 with maximum field concentration as the response and maximum eec as the predictor with pesticide compound as the random effect these residuals became the response in a subsequent mixed model where the predictor was sampling effort and the random effect was pesticide compound next we compared models predicting maximum field concentrations from maximum eecs with and without observations weighted by sampling effort we constructed linear models lm function stats package r core team 2018 in which the response was either maximum field concentration detected in lentic from naqwa or lotic systems from national water quality monitoring council and the predictors were maximum eec pesticide type insecticide or herbicide and the interaction between these two predictors we ran each model with and without weighting observations by sampling effort in the evaluation of the effect of maximum field concentration on maximum eec in this set of analyses we used a one tailed hypothesis test because of the prediction that maximum field concentration would be positively associated with maximum eec to compare the amount of variance explained by each model we calculated adjusted r 2 values lastly we sought to evaluate if the congruence of eecs and maximum field concentrations in lentic systems could be improved by including pesticide use and release as a predictor we focus on improving eecs in reference to lentic field concentrations because the epa uses the pwc to predict pesticide eecs in ponds and reservoirs for ecological and drinking water risk assessments respectively luo 2014 we used multimodel inference mumin package barto≈Ñ 2016 which fits models using combinations of all predictors given in a global model and ranks candidate models by second order akaike information criteria corrected for small sample sizes aicc dredge function in our global model the response was maximum lentic concentration from the national water quality monitoring council and the predictors included maximum eec pesticide type pesticide use all two way and three way interactions between these factors since our purpose was to improve the ability of eecs to predict field concentrations we only considered candidate models that included maximum eec as a predictor to compare the influence of model factors across all candidate models akaike weights for each factor were summed across models to determine relative importance scores burnham and anderson 2002 to evaluate the amount of variance explained by the top model we calculated adjusted r 2 values in all statistical models in the present analyses all continuous variables were log10 transformed to meet assumptions of the analyses the data analyzed contained the 27 pesticides found in lentic systems when analyses pertained exclusively to lentic data or when lentic and lotic data were combined analyses of all 31 pesticides occurred when lotic data were examined exclusively e g for evaluation of inclusion of sampling weights in prediction of lentic field concentrations with eecs for all models to determine if the predictors significantly influenced the responses we used the anova function in the car package fox and weisberg 2011 Œ± 0 05 type ii ss figures were generated using visreg breheny and burchett 2016 and ggplot2 wickham 2009 packages r 3 2 1 statistical software r core team 2018 was used for all analyses 3 results 3 1 do eecs represent worst case scenarios of pesticides in lentic systems historically eecs have been described as worst case environmental concentrations us epa 1992 however maximum concentrations in lentic systems exceeded eecs for 31 3 of herbicides 5 of 16 and 41 7 of insecticides 5 of 12 suggesting that for many pesticides eecs did not represent worst case scenarios of exposure in lentic systems pesticides for which field measurements exceeded eecs include carbaryl phorate terbufos diazinon carbofuran glyphosate atrazine 2 4 d trifluralin and mcpa while this evaluation of pesticides as worst case scenarios might appear to contradict fig 2 the proportion of pesticides for which field values exceed eecs is based both on routine surveys of lentic systems by federal agencies and literature values all other analyses are based solely on survey data from federal agencies we evaluated eec exceedance values using all available data because eecs are seen as worst case scenarios by the epa suggesting that eecs should rarely if ever be exceeded by field measurements however for all other analyses which sought to determine if eec and environmental measurement congruence could be improved we excluded these literature values environmental concentrations reported in the literature are a product of considerable variation in field survey techniques and laboratory sample analyses to increase consistency of the methods and reduce variance in environmental measurements we used only values from federal databases for the remaining analyses 3 2 what is the effect of sampling effort on detection of maximum field concentrations we hypothesized that maximum field concentration would increase asymptotically with sampling effort fig 1a as sampling effort increases detected maximum field concentration should increase up to a point gray section of fig 1a after which increased sampling effort should have little to no association with maximum field concentration white section of fig 1a we observed this relationship in sampling effort according to environmental systems sampling effort was positively associated with maximum field concentration in lotic but not lentic systems fig 1b table 2 most likely because lotic systems were sampled 4 9 times as much as lentic systems mean number standard deviation of lotic versus lentic samples per pesticide 16 111 10 301 vs 3304 3005 thus observations from lentic systems seem to fall on the section of the hypothesized curve with a positive slope where increased sampling is associated with higher detected maximum field concentrations i e gray section of fig 1a in contrast observations from lotic systems seem to fall on the section of the curve closer to the asymptote so increases in sampling effort only have marginal effects on the maximum field concentration i e white section of fig 1a given this pattern we predicted that including sampling effort would improve the congruence of maximum eecs and maximum field concentrations in lentic but not lotic systems 3 3 can inclusion of sampling effort improve the congruence of maximum eecs and maximum field concentrations next we set out to evaluate if incorporating sampling effort into models could increase the variance in maximum field concentrations explained by maximum eecs even though the pwc intends to only predict eec values in lentic systems for this comparison we used both lentic and lotic systems because lotic systems are sampled more extensively than lentic systems allowing us to span a greater range of sampling efforts which increases the likelihood that we detect the hypothesized asymptote in the sampling effort maximum field concentration curve this is important because it reduces the likelihood of generating the misconception that all increases in sampling effort will increase detected maximum field concentrations first we examined the influence of sampling effort on the relationship between maximum field concentration and eecs we observed a positive effect of sampling effort on the residuals of a model predicting maximum field concentrations from maximum eecs fig 1c table 2 at low to medium relative levels of sampling effort log10 sampling effort 2 24 to 3 78 maximum eecs tended to overestimate observed maximum field concentrations which is represented by negative residuals and at medium to high relative levels of sampling effort log10 sampling effort 3 78 to 4 57 maximum eecs more often underestimated maximum field concentrations which is represented by positive residuals fig 1c we hypothesized that sampling effort should improve the fit of maximum eecs to maximum field concentrations for lentic systems more so than for lotic systems fig 2 table 2 because they are more well sampled the maximum eecs from the pwc which are purported to represent maximum concentrations of pesticides in ponds and reservoirs were not a significant predictor of maximum measured pesticide concentrations in lentic systems without weights but became nearly significant when weighting by sampling effort table 2 in fact weighting observations by lentic sampling effort increased the relative amount of variance explained by 50 fig 2a adjusted r 2 0 27 fig 2b adjusted r 2 0 18 regardless of whether we weighted by sampling effort or not there was a positive trend between herbicide eecs and measured concentrations of herbicides in lentic systems but there was no discernible relationship between insecticide eecs and lentic insecticide concentrations fig 2a and b in other words maximum eecs were a poor predictor of field concentrations for insecticides in lentic systems for lotic systems weighting observations by sampling effort increased the relative amount of variance explained by only 4 fig 2c adjusted r 2 0 54 fig 2d adjusted r 2 0 52 on the one hand one might not expect eecs intended for ponds and reservoirs to predict measured concentrations in flowing systems well because they are not meant to represent a flowing system but they do maximum eecs were a significant positive predictor of maximum measured concentration of herbicides and insecticides in lotic systems regardless of whether we weighted by sampling effort or not table 2 fig 2c and d 3 4 can the inclusion of pesticide use and release improve the congruence between maximum eecs and maximum field concentrations given that use of pesticides is at least six orders of magnitude greater than pesticide applications to an individual 10 ha field supporting information we hypothesized that inclusion of contaminant use and release could improve the ability of maximum eecs to predict maximum field concentrations because it might better capture multiple sources of pesticide contamination entering waterbodies based on model comparison the best fitting model of maximum measured concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems included maximum eec and estimated use model weight 0 42 in this best fitting model estimated pesticide use but not maximum eec significantly predicted maximum measured concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems table 2 in addition maximum eec and estimated pesticide use had the greatest relative importance scores fig 3 a the most salient point of this analysis is that the best fitting model more than doubled the ability of the pwc to predict maximum concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems adjusted r 2 0 64 vs adjusted r 2 0 27 which suggests that consideration of pesticide use in exposure models could improve our ability to accurately predict environmental concentrations estimated pesticide use was positively associated with maximum lentic concentration suggesting that pesticide use improves eec predictions of herbicides and insecticides fig 3b 4 discussion from an ecological risk assessment perspective the ability to accurately predict concentrations of chemical contaminants is essential for the creation of defensible environmental standards policies guidelines and regulations us epa 2004 consistent with our hypotheses we demonstrate that incorporating environmental sampling effort and contaminant use or release improves our ability to predict maximum field concentrations from eecs an approach that can be applied to other fate and transport models hence by leveraging over 600 000 field measurements of the most commonly used insecticides and herbicides to evaluate the pwc model we offer potential improvements to contaminant fate and transport models more generally sampling effort greatly improves the ability of eecs to predict the variance of field concentrations in poorly sampled lentic systems but only marginally improves prediction in well sampled lotic systems in addition inclusion of pesticide use as a measurement of multiple contaminant point sources more than doubled the ability of eecs to predict maximum concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems while these findings might not apply to pesticides that are only just coming to market these findings have important implications for currently used pesticides that must be reregistered and reevaluated for environmental safety via risk assessment at least every 15 years in accordance with us law moreover the findings suggest that even for registration decisions eecs can underestimate maximum field concentrations because they do not account for multiple contaminant sources 4 1 the importance of sampling effort on the congruence between eecs and field concentrations when compared against maximum lentic field measurements maximum pesticide eecs produced by pwc models for ponds and reservoirs performed poorly for instance historically maximum eecs have been considered worst case scenarios of exposure us epa 1992 but our results show that this is a mischaracterization if a maximum eec is truly a worst case scenario of exposure we would expect that field concentrations of pesticides would rarely if ever fall above an eec but for about 30 40 of the most commonly used pesticides measured field values exceed eecs this finding is important because if risk assessors and policy makers consider maximum eecs as worst case concentrations to gauge the greatest potential for toxicity they would be underestimating levels of field exposures in many cases this difference between maximum eecs and maximum field measurements indicates the need to consider factors that might improve pwc models patterns of the observed relationship between sampling effort and maximum detected field concentrations lead us to the hypothesis that the importance of sampling effort on the ability of eecs to predict field concentration likely varies with lotic versus lentic systems because of differences in the amount of pesticide sampling effort in each system for instance lentic systems are sampled about 4 9 times as much as lotic systems because the relationship between sampling effort and maximum field concentration in lotic systems is positive we hypothesized that sampling effort would be important for eecs to predict field concentrations in this system in contrast because sampling effort only has a marginal effect on maximum field concentrations in lotic systems we predicted that sampling effort would have little to no effect on the ability of eecs to predict field concentrations consistent with our hypothesis we show that the ability of maximum eecs to predict maximum field concentrations can be improved by weighting observations by sampling effort in both lentic and lotic systems but the magnitude of this improvement is greater for lentic than lotic systems weighting observation by sampling effort increased the relative amount of variance explained by 4 for lotic systems and 50 for lentic systems consequently these results demonstrate that accounting for contaminant sampling effort is important especially when sampling efforts fall within the range in which sampling effort is positively corelated with maximum field concentrations if scientists validate eecs by comparing maximum eecs to maximum environmental concentrations to determine if eecs are accurate or not they must account for the variance in maximum environmental concentrations that are a function of sampling effort by accounting for sampling effort scientists can more accurately determine if eecs are valid approximations of contaminant exposures in addition the influence of sampling effort on maximum measured concentrations likely varies across lentic and lotic systems in fast moving lotic systems at low sampling effort peak pesticide concentrations persist for only short periods of time cope 1966 thurman et al 1991 possibly making detectable maximum pesticide concentrations lower in comparison with slow moving lentic systems however as sampling effort increases in both lentic and lotic systems an asymptotic point might be reached in which increasing sampling effort does not increase maximum detected pesticide concentration covariance between sampling effort and water body type precluded evaluation of this interaction in the current study which could be an important topic for future research for insecticides in lentic systems even though the variance explained in maximum field concentrations by maximum eec increased when we accounted for sampling effort as represented by a shift in the dotted line closer to the 1 1 reference line in fig a compared to fig b the ability of eecs to predict field concentrations was still poor shallow slope of the dotted lines in fig a and b the inability of the maximum eecs to predict maximum field concentrations of insecticides compared to herbicides might be a function of pesticide use use of herbicides is about five times greater than insecticides in the us grube et al 2011 and so the power to detect an association between maximum herbicide eecs and maximum herbicide field concentrations should be greater than that for insecticides as a result maximum field concentration of herbicides might be closer to the true peak concentrations compared to insecticides 4 2 increasing the congruence of eecs and field concentrations with use and release even when field concentrations are the result of intensive sampling maximum eecs can still underestimate maximum field concentrations which is represented by positive residuals in fig 1c the assumption of a single point source likely results in this underestimation of the peak environmental concentrations by eecs for instance most fate and transport models including the pwc assume a single point source of contamination but measured concentrations of contaminants in freshwater ecosystems are often the result of runoff and aerial deposition from multiple sources of contamination across the landscape based on this motivation we attempted to improve the ability of eecs to predict field concentrations in lentic systems by accounting for pesticide use for both herbicides and insecticides pesticide use improved the ability of eecs to predict maximum concentrations in lentic systems more than doubling the variance explained compared to a model without use most notably when the model accounted for sampling effort and pesticide use the ability of eecs to predict maximum field concentrations in lentic systems went from no relationship fig 2a to a significant positive relationship fig 3b these results suggest that pesticide use at the level is likely an improved indicator of pesticide loading into a freshwater ecosystem than the single point source of contamination that is assumed in the current pwc model usgs pesticide use estimates are likely a conservative representation of pesticide inputs because they represent only agricultural applications and ignore pesticide applications in homes and industry 5 conclusions estimated environmental concentrations from contaminant fate and transport models are favored ways to characterize exposure risk by regulatory agencies because they are low cost low effort and provide consistent methodology for estimates across compounds us epa 1992 currently these models represent the best methods that have been developed to estimate concentrations of contaminants in the environment however these models stand to be improved to increase the accuracy of predictions especially during reregistration processes when additional data on use and environmental measurements are available using current use pesticides we demonstrate that not only are pesticide maximum eecs produced by the pwc model poor characterizations of worst case exposures but they also perform poorly at predicting concentrations of pesticides in their intended lentic systems across pesticide types the underlying pwc model can be assessed by comparing its eecs to large datasets of measured environmental concentrations an essential consideration in this comparison is the inclusion of sampling effort in addition including contaminant use as a proxy for multiple sources of contamination for currently used compounds can increase the variance in field concentration explained by eecs scientists active in the development of environmental fate and transport models recognize the importance of including multiple sources of contamination for instance models widely used in the united states and europe incorporate multiple point sources of contamination including the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 chimera fate morselli et al 2015 and stream eu lindim et al 2016 the inclusion of field survey information and use for pesticides is easily accomplished because these data are already included separately in the most current ecological risk assessments used for pesticide regulation farruggia and rossmeisl 2017 in general because of environmental laws and regulation requiring reporting of pollution including the emergency planning and community right to know act the resource conservation and recovery act the toxic substances control act the clean water act and the clean air act there is a clear understanding of the identity and amounts of multiple point sources of many contaminants from industry and agriculture so the amounts of contaminants released into the environment could be feasibly incorporated into eec models for currently used non pesticide contaminants as well given our results the next step for improvement of the pwc model would be for epa staff members to directly include pesticide use in the mechanistic model access to the proprietary computer code that underlies the pwc model prevented us from doing so in the current study improving the understanding of the determinants of maximum concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems is not only important for improving exposure characterization as a part of federal ecological risk assessment but is also critical for the understanding and protecting small freshwater bodies which provide critical habitat to communities of plants and animals balian et al 2008 strayer and dudgeon 2010 that contribute to the functioning of ecosystems costanza et al 2014 improvement of contaminant fate and distribution

18915,widespread chemical contamination represents one of the largest threats of the anthropocene the pesticide in water calculator pwc is a fate and transport model used by the environmental protection agency and health canada to estimate pesticide exposures in lentic freshwater ecosystems and make pesticide registration decisions here we show that maximum measured concentrations of 31 of herbicides and 42 of insecticides exceeded maximum estimated environmental concentrations eecs produced by the pwc suggesting that eecs often do not represent worst case exposure as they have been purported to do based on this observation we generated statistical models using eecs and over 600 000 field measurements of 31 common insecticides and herbicides to document if the congruence of eecs and maximum field measurements could be improved by accounting for environmental sampling effort number of times a pesticide is sampled and contaminant application factors commonly ignored in most fate and transport models for lentic systems variance in pesticide field measurements explained by eecs increased by 50 when sampling effort was included for lotic systems variance explained increased by only 4 most likely because lotic systems are sampled over 4 9 times as much as lentic systems including use more than doubled the ability of the eecs to predict maximum pesticides concentrations in lentic systems our results suggest that exposure characterization in risk assessment can likely be improved by considering sampling effort and use thus providing more defensible environmental standards and regulations graphical abstract image 1 keywords pesticide field concentration pesticide in water calculator pesticide regulation pond pollution exposure assessment exposure

nel et al 2006 rhind 2009 threatening the health and wellbeing of humans braun 2017 kampa and castanas 2008 larsen et al 2017 and the environment fleeger et al 2003 meybeck and helmer 1989 rohr and mccoy 2010 the distribution of pesticides in particular is globally widespread in surface waters presenting a major threat to aquatic biodiversity beketov et al 2013 malaj et al 2014 stehle and schulz 2015 in the united states us more than 500 million pounds of active ingredients of pesticides are applied annually atwood and paisley jones 2017 leading to well documented contamination of freshwater systems dudgeon et al 2006 gilliom and hamilton 2006 stone et al 2014 that provide habitat for about 10 of all described taxa on earth strayer and dudgeon 2010 therefore the ability to predict levels of contamination in the field is critical to accurately assessing human and wildlife exposures and designing effective management strategies to minimize risks in sensitive systems fate and transport models are important tools for predicting contaminant exposures for instance the united states us environmental protection agency epa and health canada use the pesticide in water calculator pwc model to generate a peak estimated environmental concentration eec us epa 1992 of a focal pesticide in a standardized lentic waterbody that is a set distance from a site of application young 2016 the model calculates an eec based on inputs of pesticide traits e g half life and koc application amount and frequency based on crop of interest and soil and climatic characteristics based on crop and region of interest young 2016 eecs of a variety of chemicals including those that are not pesticides are used in human health and ecological risk assessments generally the epa uses the pwc to predict pesticide eecs in ponds and reservoirs which are used in ecological risk assessments and drinking water assessments respectively luo 2014 ecological risk assessments play a role in the registration of pesticide before they come to market and the reregistration of pesticides which occurs at least every 15 years once a pesticide is approved historically the maximum eec for pesticides has been regarded as a worst case chemical exposure scenario in freshwater systems by the epa us epa 1992 in risk assessment eecs are compared against toxicity values e g lc50 to characterize the likelihood of toxicity at a given level of exposure us epa 2004 1992 evaluation of eecs in this way informs the development of environmental standards policies guidelines and regulations as well as the registration and reregistration of chemicals for legal use us epa 2004 the availability of large scale data within the us on pesticide use baker and stone 2015 thelin and stone 2013 and monitoring read et al 2017 provides an opportunity for the accuracy of pwc exposure estimates to be evaluated and improved recently the ability of the european union s forum for the co ordination of pesticide fate models and their use focus model was evaluated for its accuracy in predicting worst case scenario exposures using monitoring data these evaluations revealed that the model performed poorly in predicting environmental concentration of insecticides and fungicides kn√§bel et al 2014 2012 the true or actual peak environmental concentration of any given pesticide is an extremely rare event in time and space leu et al 2005 stehle et al 2013 thurman et al 1991 and thus evaluating model predictions of peak environmental concentrations necessitates copious field measurements many more than are required to reliably predict mean environmental concentrations crawford 2004 fortunately over the last three decades federal agencies including the epa and us geological survey usgs have compiled hundreds of thousands of field measurements of pesticides from lotic streams and rivers and lentic ponds and reservoirs freshwater ecosystems across the us these publicly available data allow us here to 1 evaluate if eecs are indeed indicative of worst case exposure scenarios and 2 determine if the congruence between predicted eecs from the pwc and measured maximum concentrations of pesticides in the field can be improved an important consideration for evaluating the congruence between predicted eecs and measured maximum concentrations might be environmental sampling effort defined as the total number of times a pesticide is surveyed across locations and time if we are to determine how well maximum eecs predict maximum field concentrations of contaminants that are currently used we must account for the variance in maximum field concentrations that is a function of sampling effort for instance we propose that sampling effort should be related asymptotically to the maximum environmental concentration of a contaminant such that increases in sampling effort increase the likelihood of detecting the true peak environmental concentration at low gray section in fig 1 a but not high sampling efforts white section in fig 1a given this proposed relationship we hypothesize that incorporating information on environmental sampling effort will improve the ability of eecs to predict maximum environmental concentrations but only for systems that are not well sampled and thus fall on the section of the sampling effort maximum field concentration curve that is increasing rather than at or near the asymptote no study to our knowledge has incorporated sampling effort of monitoring data into their evaluations of the predictions of pesticide exposure models which could be an important consideration in assessing model accuracy the ability of eecs to predict maximum field concentrations might also be improved by accounting for multiple sources of contaminant use or release most fate and transport models including the pwc assume a single point source of contamination but measured concentrations in freshwater ecosystems are often the result of runoff and aerial deposition from multiple sources of contamination across the landscape the input of pesticides from multiple sources of contamination across the landscape is likely many orders of magnitude greater than application amounts on a single agricultural field larsen and noack 2017 the sole point source assumed by the pwc model the inaccurate assumption of a single point source could misrepresent the true or actual peak concentration in the environment that the pwc seeks to model thus we hypothesize that incorporating information on use of chemicals might improve the congruence between eecs and maximum field concentrations because use is a proxy for multiple sources of contamination within a watershed the usgs recently provided pesticide use estimates across the us allowing us to evaluate how a proxy for multiple sources of contamination within a watershed affects the ability of the pwc to predict maximum measured concentrations in the environment to test the hypotheses that the abilities of fate and transport models to predict maximum field concentrations can be improved by accounting for environmental sampling effort and contaminant release information we selected 31 of the most commonly used pesticides and compiled data describing their use application rate environmental mobility eecs from the pwc and maximum measured environmental concentrations in lentic and lotic systems only a single study has used measured environmental concentrations to validate eecs from the pwc however implications from this study are limited because few focal pesticides were evaluated environmental concentrations were taken from a limited geographic region a single state and eecs were not compared to maximum measured field concentrations xie et al 2018 we predicted that eecs would not represent worst case scenarios of exposure because eecs fail to incorporate multiple sources of contamination and instead model a commonly unrealistic single point source given the postulated importance of sampling effort we predicted that the pwc would more accurately predict maximum concentrations in lotic than lentic systems because lotic systems are sampled for pesticides nearly 4 9 times as much as lentic systems mean number standard deviation of lotic versus lentic samples per pesticide from federal databases 16 111 10 301 vs 3304 3005 finally we predicted that the pwc s predictions of maximum eecs could be improved by incorporating use or release information to account for likely multiple sources of pesticides to freshwater ecosystems 2 methods 2 1 pesticide selection our analyses focus on the 31 most commonly used herbicides and insecticides applied on corn in the us table 1 we focus on corn because corn was the most commonly harvested crop by area in the us from 1992 to 2012 the time span of current study us department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service making corn the most widespread source of pesticide contamination to aquatic systems of all crops to select this group of 31 pesticides we first ranked all insecticides and herbicides based on their estimated use in the us by summing 2006 county level pesticide use estimates from the estimated annual agricultural pesticide use dataset provided by pesticide national synthesis project of the national water quality assessment nawqa program us geological survey usgs https water usgs gov nawqa pnsp usage maps county level we classified each pesticide as an herbicide or insecticide using the primary use type classifications indicated by the pesticide action network pan pesticide database http www pesticideinfo org we excluded mineral or biologic e g bacteria pesticides because we were interested in examining the transport and fate of synthetic compounds from these most commonly used synthetic herbicides and insecticides we selected compounds that were detected in streams from 1992 to 2012 by the usgs nawqa program www waterqualitydata us portal obtained on 30 march 2017 finally we examined commercial product use labels and only included compounds that were used on corn because standard epa scenarios used in the calculation of eecs see below are more frequently available across geographic regions in the us for corn than other crops this selection process resulted in 16 herbicides and 15 insecticides table 1 2 2 building a dataset characterizing herbicides and insecticides we built a dataset describing each selected pesticides use application rate environmental mobility and persistence and maximum measured environmental concentration tables s1 and s2 for each compound we determined an estimate of national use by summing all county level pesticide estimates from the estimated annual agricultural pesticide use dataset from 1992 to 2012 these use estimates represent use for all crops maximum concentrations of pesticides in lotic systems were taken from stream survey data from 1992 to 2012 from the usgs nawqa program from https www waterqualitydata us obtained on 30 march 2017 filtered by nawqa program and stream site type the total number of stream surveys from which maximum concentrations were taken totaled 499 435 maximum concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems were taken from surveys of lakes reservoirs impoundments and wetlands from 1992 to 2012 available from national water quality monitoring council https www waterqualitydata us obtained on 9 november 2017 filtered by site type to include lakes reservoirs impoundments and wetlands the total number of surveys from these lentic systems from which maximum concentrations were taken totaled 129 471 for each pesticide a single maximum concentration was taken from across lentic and lotic survey locations and times to help ensure data quality for measured maximum concentrations we excluded data that were not measured in mass volume units e g Œºg l excluded measurements that were a result of qa qc for pesticide testing e g spiked water samples acting as controls and ensured all concentrations were converted to the same units e g Œºg l finally to help limit the influence of timing of sampling on detection of maximum concentrations we excluded samples that were triggered by a hydrologic event i e event based sampling such as a flood or a storm instead we focused on field samples that were gathered as part of routine based sampling efforts in preliminary analyses event based samples were included but did not change the results described in this current manuscript since we wanted to record maximum observed pesticide concentrations both filtered and whole water sample were considered more information regarding the methods of data collection for the resulting pesticide concentrations e g water sampling lab testing is provided in tables s3 and s4 we also recorded sampling effort for each pesticide in lentic and lotic systems which was the number of times a pesticide was surveyed for across locations and time in addition we gathered maximum field concentrations from lakes ponds agricultural ditches and tailwaters by reviewing the published scientific literature to evaluate whether maximum eecs are indeed worst case scenarios of exposure using the most information possible on maximum lentic concentrations we conducted a literature search using web of science and google scholar using combinations of the following terms concentration tailwater pond ditch runoff field concentration and the name of the focal pesticide e g atrazine in the final dataset we include only values from the literature that exceeded pesticide field database values in lentic systems individual maximum concentrations of pesticides gathered from databases or the literature represent observed maximum measured concentrations and not the true or actual peak concentrations which can only be greater than or equal to the maximum observed concentration crawford 2004 2 3 overview of the pwc model the pwc is a graphic user interface developed by the epa office of pesticide programs that links the output of the pesticide root zone model przm and the variable volume water model vvwm the pwc generates eecs for a fixed volume no flow 1 ha by 2 m farm pond or a 5 26 ha by 2 74 m reservoir based on runoff water suspended solids and pesticides and overspray from an adjacent 10 ha pesticide treated field burns 2000 young 2015 2016 the pwc uses mass balance equations and assumes that all materials in the two modeled compartments the water and sediment are at thermodynamic equilibrium the inflow of dissolved pesticides or drift is delivered to the water compartment and sorbed pesticides are delivered to both water and sediment pesticides are removed from the water body via sediment burial volatilization and degradation additional background on the pwc can be obtained from young 2016 2 4 generating estimated environmental concentrations data describing the environmental mobility and persistence of herbicides used in the calculation of eecs including koc water column metabolism half life benthic metabolism half life foliar half life aqueous photolysis half life molecular weight vapor pressure and solubility were taken primarily from the pesticide properties database from the university of hertfordshire ppdb https sitem herts ac uk aeru ppdb en values for hydrolysis half life and aerobic soil half life were taken from pan pesticide database when values were not available for certain pesticides from pan or ppdb we used data from the toxicology data network toxnet from the national institutes of health https toxnet nlm nih gov newtoxnet hsdb htm as indicated in tables s1 and s2 additional pesticide traits included henry s constant heat of henry air diffusion coefficient and application information tables s1 and s2 henry s constant and the heat of henry were taken from the epa s estimation program interface epi suite specifically henrywin henry s constant was calculated using the bond contribution method we calculated the air diffusion coefficient using the epa s on line tools for site assessment calculation https www3 epa gov ceampubl learn2model part two onsite estdiffusion ext html data concerning number of applications per year timing of applications and maximum recommended application rate and method were taken from us commercial pesticide product labels for herbicides product instructions for pre emergent applications for corn were followed when available we assumed that the last application of pre emergent herbicides would occur just after planting 12 days prior to corn emergence for herbicides that are exclusively applied post emergence we assumed applications would occur 10 days after corn emergence we assumed all herbicides would be applied by direct ground spray unless product labels indicated the need for soil incorporation in those cases applications were set to occur at the suggested depth of soil incorporation based on the product label for insecticides product application instructions for post emergent applications for corn were used when available we assumed that the first applications would occur 30 days after emergence by spray above the plant for insecticides that are applied pre emergence we assumed applications would occur 12 days before emergence by ground spray at the depth of soil incorporation according to the product labels using the epa s pesticide in water calculator v 1 52 pwc https www epa gov pesticide science and assessing pesticide risks models pesticide risk assessment pwc we generated eecs of the selected pesticides model inputs consisted of mobility persistence and application data for individual pesticide compounds tables s1 and s2 for all pesticide compounds water benthic and soil reference temperatures were assumed to be 23 c and photolysis reference latitude was 40 when foliar half life was not available for a given pesticide foliar half life was assumed not to be a large contributor to breakdown in the environment in the pwc model and was set to zero under the recommendation of the pwc user manual efficiency was set to 0 99 and drift was set to 0 01 for all pesticide compounds applications were assumed to occur every year for each pesticide compound eecs were generated for both ponds and reservoirs in each of five different states illinois mississippi north carolina ohio and pennsylvania which varied in their meteorological and geological model inputs provided by the pwc software this resulted in 10 eecs values for each pesticide we used the maximum eec of these 10 estimates for each pesticide in all statistical analyses while we generated all eecs based on use on corn because it is the most common crop in the us to assess how much the results might be sensitive to the use of a single crop we gathered eec estimates for each pesticide based on use on corn soybean and cotton where possible we then quantified how much variation in eecs there was within pesticides among crops versus among pesticides more variation among pesticides compared to within pesticides among crops would signify our findings are relatively robust based on corn alone we discovered that there was 4 times the variance among pesticides 47 4 than there was within pesticide among crops 11 7 suggesting that our analyses would likely not change substantially if we could better account for the local crop on which each pesticide was used mostly commonly supporting information fig s1 2 5 statistical analyses to determine how often maximum eecs represent worst case scenarios of pesticides in lentic systems we calculated the proportion of pesticides for which the maximum environmental concentrations in lentic systems exceeded maximum eecs from pwc models in this evaluation the point of comparison for the eec was the highest concentration of pesticide found in the water quality monitoring council database or in the literature we incorporated literature and database field measurements because we wanted to use all possible available data to describe maximum lentic field values in all other analyses we use maximum lentic field values from the national water quality monitoring council exclusively to ensure that the methods of estimating maximum lentic and lotic field concentrations were similar which is an important consideration for improving the congruences between eecs and field concentrations because inconsistencies in methodologies might bias analyses the literature concentrations had to be removed from these analyses because they did not use consistent sampling methodology across studies next we evaluated the effects of sampling effort on detection of maximum field concentrations in both lentic and lotic systems while eecs are not generally intended to represent lotic systems we sought to use lotic systems because of our hypothesis that increased sampling effort might increase the congruence between eecs and maximum field measurements lotic systems are much more sampled compared to lentic systems if we only considered sampling effort variation within lentic systems it is possible that we would not span a large enough range of sampling efforts to capture the hypothesized asymptotic section of the sampling effort maximum concentration curve in fact our concern was validated because lotic systems seem to be at or near the asymptote whereas many lentic systems appear to be on the section of the curve where increasing sampling effort increases the maximum eec to evaluate the effects of sampling effort on detection of maximum field concentrations in lentic and lotic systems we built two separate linear models lm function stats package r core team 2018 in which the response was either maximum lentic or lotic concentration and the predictor was sampling effort defined as the total number of times a pesticide was surveyed for between 1992 and 2012 respective to each system including surveys which resulted in no detection of the pesticide to evaluate if inclusion of sampling effort improved the congruence of maximum eecs with maximum field concentrations first we examined the effect of sampling effort on the relationship between maximum field concentration and maximum eec we extracted the residuals from a mixed model lmer function lme4 package bates et al 2015 with maximum field concentration as the response and maximum eec as the predictor with pesticide compound as the random effect these residuals became the response in a subsequent mixed model where the predictor was sampling effort and the random effect was pesticide compound next we compared models predicting maximum field concentrations from maximum eecs with and without observations weighted by sampling effort we constructed linear models lm function stats package r core team 2018 in which the response was either maximum field concentration detected in lentic from naqwa or lotic systems from national water quality monitoring council and the predictors were maximum eec pesticide type insecticide or herbicide and the interaction between these two predictors we ran each model with and without weighting observations by sampling effort in the evaluation of the effect of maximum field concentration on maximum eec in this set of analyses we used a one tailed hypothesis test because of the prediction that maximum field concentration would be positively associated with maximum eec to compare the amount of variance explained by each model we calculated adjusted r 2 values lastly we sought to evaluate if the congruence of eecs and maximum field concentrations in lentic systems could be improved by including pesticide use and release as a predictor we focus on improving eecs in reference to lentic field concentrations because the epa uses the pwc to predict pesticide eecs in ponds and reservoirs for ecological and drinking water risk assessments respectively luo 2014 we used multimodel inference mumin package barto≈Ñ 2016 which fits models using combinations of all predictors given in a global model and ranks candidate models by second order akaike information criteria corrected for small sample sizes aicc dredge function in our global model the response was maximum lentic concentration from the national water quality monitoring council and the predictors included maximum eec pesticide type pesticide use all two way and three way interactions between these factors since our purpose was to improve the ability of eecs to predict field concentrations we only considered candidate models that included maximum eec as a predictor to compare the influence of model factors across all candidate models akaike weights for each factor were summed across models to determine relative importance scores burnham and anderson 2002 to evaluate the amount of variance explained by the top model we calculated adjusted r 2 values in all statistical models in the present analyses all continuous variables were log10 transformed to meet assumptions of the analyses the data analyzed contained the 27 pesticides found in lentic systems when analyses pertained exclusively to lentic data or when lentic and lotic data were combined analyses of all 31 pesticides occurred when lotic data were examined exclusively e g for evaluation of inclusion of sampling weights in prediction of lentic field concentrations with eecs for all models to determine if the predictors significantly influenced the responses we used the anova function in the car package fox and weisberg 2011 Œ± 0 05 type ii ss figures were generated using visreg breheny and burchett 2016 and ggplot2 wickham 2009 packages r 3 2 1 statistical software r core team 2018 was used for all analyses 3 results 3 1 do eecs represent worst case scenarios of pesticides in lentic systems historically eecs have been described as worst case environmental concentrations us epa 1992 however maximum concentrations in lentic systems exceeded eecs for 31 3 of herbicides 5 of 16 and 41 7 of insecticides 5 of 12 suggesting that for many pesticides eecs did not represent worst case scenarios of exposure in lentic systems pesticides for which field measurements exceeded eecs include carbaryl phorate terbufos diazinon carbofuran glyphosate atrazine 2 4 d trifluralin and mcpa while this evaluation of pesticides as worst case scenarios might appear to contradict fig 2 the proportion of pesticides for which field values exceed eecs is based both on routine surveys of lentic systems by federal agencies and literature values all other analyses are based solely on survey data from federal agencies we evaluated eec exceedance values using all available data because eecs are seen as worst case scenarios by the epa suggesting that eecs should rarely if ever be exceeded by field measurements however for all other analyses which sought to determine if eec and environmental measurement congruence could be improved we excluded these literature values environmental concentrations reported in the literature are a product of considerable variation in field survey techniques and laboratory sample analyses to increase consistency of the methods and reduce variance in environmental measurements we used only values from federal databases for the remaining analyses 3 2 what is the effect of sampling effort on detection of maximum field concentrations we hypothesized that maximum field concentration would increase asymptotically with sampling effort fig 1a as sampling effort increases detected maximum field concentration should increase up to a point gray section of fig 1a after which increased sampling effort should have little to no association with maximum field concentration white section of fig 1a we observed this relationship in sampling effort according to environmental systems sampling effort was positively associated with maximum field concentration in lotic but not lentic systems fig 1b table 2 most likely because lotic systems were sampled 4 9 times as much as lentic systems mean number standard deviation of lotic versus lentic samples per pesticide 16 111 10 301 vs 3304 3005 thus observations from lentic systems seem to fall on the section of the hypothesized curve with a positive slope where increased sampling is associated with higher detected maximum field concentrations i e gray section of fig 1a in contrast observations from lotic systems seem to fall on the section of the curve closer to the asymptote so increases in sampling effort only have marginal effects on the maximum field concentration i e white section of fig 1a given this pattern we predicted that including sampling effort would improve the congruence of maximum eecs and maximum field concentrations in lentic but not lotic systems 3 3 can inclusion of sampling effort improve the congruence of maximum eecs and maximum field concentrations next we set out to evaluate if incorporating sampling effort into models could increase the variance in maximum field concentrations explained by maximum eecs even though the pwc intends to only predict eec values in lentic systems for this comparison we used both lentic and lotic systems because lotic systems are sampled more extensively than lentic systems allowing us to span a greater range of sampling efforts which increases the likelihood that we detect the hypothesized asymptote in the sampling effort maximum field concentration curve this is important because it reduces the likelihood of generating the misconception that all increases in sampling effort will increase detected maximum field concentrations first we examined the influence of sampling effort on the relationship between maximum field concentration and eecs we observed a positive effect of sampling effort on the residuals of a model predicting maximum field concentrations from maximum eecs fig 1c table 2 at low to medium relative levels of sampling effort log10 sampling effort 2 24 to 3 78 maximum eecs tended to overestimate observed maximum field concentrations which is represented by negative residuals and at medium to high relative levels of sampling effort log10 sampling effort 3 78 to 4 57 maximum eecs more often underestimated maximum field concentrations which is represented by positive residuals fig 1c we hypothesized that sampling effort should improve the fit of maximum eecs to maximum field concentrations for lentic systems more so than for lotic systems fig 2 table 2 because they are more well sampled the maximum eecs from the pwc which are purported to represent maximum concentrations of pesticides in ponds and reservoirs were not a significant predictor of maximum measured pesticide concentrations in lentic systems without weights but became nearly significant when weighting by sampling effort table 2 in fact weighting observations by lentic sampling effort increased the relative amount of variance explained by 50 fig 2a adjusted r 2 0 27 fig 2b adjusted r 2 0 18 regardless of whether we weighted by sampling effort or not there was a positive trend between herbicide eecs and measured concentrations of herbicides in lentic systems but there was no discernible relationship between insecticide eecs and lentic insecticide concentrations fig 2a and b in other words maximum eecs were a poor predictor of field concentrations for insecticides in lentic systems for lotic systems weighting observations by sampling effort increased the relative amount of variance explained by only 4 fig 2c adjusted r 2 0 54 fig 2d adjusted r 2 0 52 on the one hand one might not expect eecs intended for ponds and reservoirs to predict measured concentrations in flowing systems well because they are not meant to represent a flowing system but they do maximum eecs were a significant positive predictor of maximum measured concentration of herbicides and insecticides in lotic systems regardless of whether we weighted by sampling effort or not table 2 fig 2c and d 3 4 can the inclusion of pesticide use and release improve the congruence between maximum eecs and maximum field concentrations given that use of pesticides is at least six orders of magnitude greater than pesticide applications to an individual 10 ha field supporting information we hypothesized that inclusion of contaminant use and release could improve the ability of maximum eecs to predict maximum field concentrations because it might better capture multiple sources of pesticide contamination entering waterbodies based on model comparison the best fitting model of maximum measured concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems included maximum eec and estimated use model weight 0 42 in this best fitting model estimated pesticide use but not maximum eec significantly predicted maximum measured concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems table 2 in addition maximum eec and estimated pesticide use had the greatest relative importance scores fig 3 a the most salient point of this analysis is that the best fitting model more than doubled the ability of the pwc to predict maximum concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems adjusted r 2 0 64 vs adjusted r 2 0 27 which suggests that consideration of pesticide use in exposure models could improve our ability to accurately predict environmental concentrations estimated pesticide use was positively associated with maximum lentic concentration suggesting that pesticide use improves eec predictions of herbicides and insecticides fig 3b 4 discussion from an ecological risk assessment perspective the ability to accurately predict concentrations of chemical contaminants is essential for the creation of defensible environmental standards policies guidelines and regulations us epa 2004 consistent with our hypotheses we demonstrate that incorporating environmental sampling effort and contaminant use or release improves our ability to predict maximum field concentrations from eecs an approach that can be applied to other fate and transport models hence by leveraging over 600 000 field measurements of the most commonly used insecticides and herbicides to evaluate the pwc model we offer potential improvements to contaminant fate and transport models more generally sampling effort greatly improves the ability of eecs to predict the variance of field concentrations in poorly sampled lentic systems but only marginally improves prediction in well sampled lotic systems in addition inclusion of pesticide use as a measurement of multiple contaminant point sources more than doubled the ability of eecs to predict maximum concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems while these findings might not apply to pesticides that are only just coming to market these findings have important implications for currently used pesticides that must be reregistered and reevaluated for environmental safety via risk assessment at least every 15 years in accordance with us law moreover the findings suggest that even for registration decisions eecs can underestimate maximum field concentrations because they do not account for multiple contaminant sources 4 1 the importance of sampling effort on the congruence between eecs and field concentrations when compared against maximum lentic field measurements maximum pesticide eecs produced by pwc models for ponds and reservoirs performed poorly for instance historically maximum eecs have been considered worst case scenarios of exposure us epa 1992 but our results show that this is a mischaracterization if a maximum eec is truly a worst case scenario of exposure we would expect that field concentrations of pesticides would rarely if ever fall above an eec but for about 30 40 of the most commonly used pesticides measured field values exceed eecs this finding is important because if risk assessors and policy makers consider maximum eecs as worst case concentrations to gauge the greatest potential for toxicity they would be underestimating levels of field exposures in many cases this difference between maximum eecs and maximum field measurements indicates the need to consider factors that might improve pwc models patterns of the observed relationship between sampling effort and maximum detected field concentrations lead us to the hypothesis that the importance of sampling effort on the ability of eecs to predict field concentration likely varies with lotic versus lentic systems because of differences in the amount of pesticide sampling effort in each system for instance lentic systems are sampled about 4 9 times as much as lotic systems because the relationship between sampling effort and maximum field concentration in lotic systems is positive we hypothesized that sampling effort would be important for eecs to predict field concentrations in this system in contrast because sampling effort only has a marginal effect on maximum field concentrations in lotic systems we predicted that sampling effort would have little to no effect on the ability of eecs to predict field concentrations consistent with our hypothesis we show that the ability of maximum eecs to predict maximum field concentrations can be improved by weighting observations by sampling effort in both lentic and lotic systems but the magnitude of this improvement is greater for lentic than lotic systems weighting observation by sampling effort increased the relative amount of variance explained by 4 for lotic systems and 50 for lentic systems consequently these results demonstrate that accounting for contaminant sampling effort is important especially when sampling efforts fall within the range in which sampling effort is positively corelated with maximum field concentrations if scientists validate eecs by comparing maximum eecs to maximum environmental concentrations to determine if eecs are accurate or not they must account for the variance in maximum environmental concentrations that are a function of sampling effort by accounting for sampling effort scientists can more accurately determine if eecs are valid approximations of contaminant exposures in addition the influence of sampling effort on maximum measured concentrations likely varies across lentic and lotic systems in fast moving lotic systems at low sampling effort peak pesticide concentrations persist for only short periods of time cope 1966 thurman et al 1991 possibly making detectable maximum pesticide concentrations lower in comparison with slow moving lentic systems however as sampling effort increases in both lentic and lotic systems an asymptotic point might be reached in which increasing sampling effort does not increase maximum detected pesticide concentration covariance between sampling effort and water body type precluded evaluation of this interaction in the current study which could be an important topic for future research for insecticides in lentic systems even though the variance explained in maximum field concentrations by maximum eec increased when we accounted for sampling effort as represented by a shift in the dotted line closer to the 1 1 reference line in fig a compared to fig b the ability of eecs to predict field concentrations was still poor shallow slope of the dotted lines in fig a and b the inability of the maximum eecs to predict maximum field concentrations of insecticides compared to herbicides might be a function of pesticide use use of herbicides is about five times greater than insecticides in the us grube et al 2011 and so the power to detect an association between maximum herbicide eecs and maximum herbicide field concentrations should be greater than that for insecticides as a result maximum field concentration of herbicides might be closer to the true peak concentrations compared to insecticides 4 2 increasing the congruence of eecs and field concentrations with use and release even when field concentrations are the result of intensive sampling maximum eecs can still underestimate maximum field concentrations which is represented by positive residuals in fig 1c the assumption of a single point source likely results in this underestimation of the peak environmental concentrations by eecs for instance most fate and transport models including the pwc assume a single point source of contamination but measured concentrations of contaminants in freshwater ecosystems are often the result of runoff and aerial deposition from multiple sources of contamination across the landscape based on this motivation we attempted to improve the ability of eecs to predict field concentrations in lentic systems by accounting for pesticide use for both herbicides and insecticides pesticide use improved the ability of eecs to predict maximum concentrations in lentic systems more than doubling the variance explained compared to a model without use most notably when the model accounted for sampling effort and pesticide use the ability of eecs to predict maximum field concentrations in lentic systems went from no relationship fig 2a to a significant positive relationship fig 3b these results suggest that pesticide use at the level is likely an improved indicator of pesticide loading into a freshwater ecosystem than the single point source of contamination that is assumed in the current pwc model usgs pesticide use estimates are likely a conservative representation of pesticide inputs because they represent only agricultural applications and ignore pesticide applications in homes and industry 5 conclusions estimated environmental concentrations from contaminant fate and transport models are favored ways to characterize exposure risk by regulatory agencies because they are low cost low effort and provide consistent methodology for estimates across compounds us epa 1992 currently these models represent the best methods that have been developed to estimate concentrations of contaminants in the environment however these models stand to be improved to increase the accuracy of predictions especially during reregistration processes when additional data on use and environmental measurements are available using current use pesticides we demonstrate that not only are pesticide maximum eecs produced by the pwc model poor characterizations of worst case exposures but they also perform poorly at predicting concentrations of pesticides in their intended lentic systems across pesticide types the underlying pwc model can be assessed by comparing its eecs to large datasets of measured environmental concentrations an essential consideration in this comparison is the inclusion of sampling effort in addition including contaminant use as a proxy for multiple sources of contamination for currently used compounds can increase the variance in field concentration explained by eecs scientists active in the development of environmental fate and transport models recognize the importance of including multiple sources of contamination for instance models widely used in the united states and europe incorporate multiple point sources of contamination including the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 chimera fate morselli et al 2015 and stream eu lindim et al 2016 the inclusion of field survey information and use for pesticides is easily accomplished because these data are already included separately in the most current ecological risk assessments used for pesticide regulation farruggia and rossmeisl 2017 in general because of environmental laws and regulation requiring reporting of pollution including the emergency planning and community right to know act the resource conservation and recovery act the toxic substances control act the clean water act and the clean air act there is a clear understanding of the identity and amounts of multiple point sources of many contaminants from industry and agriculture so the amounts of contaminants released into the environment could be feasibly incorporated into eec models for currently used non pesticide contaminants as well given our results the next step for improvement of the pwc model would be for epa staff members to directly include pesticide use in the mechanistic model access to the proprietary computer code that underlies the pwc model prevented us from doing so in the current study improving the understanding of the determinants of maximum concentrations of pesticides in lentic systems is not only important for improving exposure characterization as a part of federal ecological risk assessment but is also critical for the understanding and protecting small freshwater bodies which provide critical habitat to communities of plants and animals balian et al 2008 strayer and dudgeon 2010 that contribute to the functioning of ecosystems costanza et al 2014 improvement of contaminant fate and distribution

18916,most great lakes communities rely on culture based e coli methods for monitoring fecal indicator bacteria fib at recreational beaches these cultivation methods require 18 or more hours to generate results as a consequence public notifications about beach action value bav exceedance are based on prior day water quality rapid qpcr monitoring of bacteria in beach water solves the 24 h delay problem though the usepa approved qpcr method targets enterococci bacteria while great lakes communities are familiar with e coli monitoring for an e coli qpcr method to be useful for water quality management it is important to systematically characterize method performance and establish bavs for public notification purposes in this study we 1 evaluated a draft usepa e coli qpcr method 2 compared e coli qpcr measurements with two established fib e coli culture and enterococci qpcr results and explored potential strategies to establish e coli qpcr bav criteria in the absence of an epidemiological study based on analyses of 288 water samples collected from eight of chicago s lake michigan beaches the e coli qpcr method demonstrates acceptable performance characteristics the method is prone to low level dna contamination possibly originating from assay reagents derived from e coli bacteria both e coli and enterococci bavs were exceeded in approximately 18 of the samples e coli qpcr values were correlated with both e coli culture r 0 83 p 0 0001 and enterococci qpcr r 0 67 p 0 0001 values the approach recommended by the usepa in its technical support material tsm was used to generate candidate e coli qpcr bavs as was receiver operating characteristic roc analysis potential bav thresholds differed substantially ranging from 200 9 calibrator cell equivalents cce 100 ml roc analysis enterococci qpcr bav as the reference to 1000 cce 100 ml tsm analysis enterococci qpcr bav as the reference because we found that different approaches to establishing potential bavs generate quite different values guidance from usepa about approaches to defining comparable bavs would be useful graphical abstract image 1 keywords beach monitoring recreational water quality fecal indicator bacteria fib e coli quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr receiver operating characteristics roc 1 introduction escherichia coli e coli are fecal indicator bacteria fib commonly used for recreational water quality monitoring at freshwater beaches historically beach managers in the great lakes basin have employed culture based e coli methods rather than enterococci even though the u s environmental protection agency usepa has established water quality criteria for freshwater using both bacteria usepa 1986 2012 although culture based chromogenic substrate methods such as colilert are easy to use and relatively inexpensive they require 18 24 h of incubation since fib concentrations in water can change from day to day this turnaround time can often lead to incorrect assessment of beach water quality resulting in erroneous public health information kim and grant 2004 a recent study revealed that prior day e coli culture results are no better than chance alone at predicting current day water quality at chicago beaches dorevitch et al 2017 in 2012 the usepa released new recreational water quality criteria rwqc that included a rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr method for enterococci which unlike culture methods can generate results within 3 4 h for same day water quality notifications usepa 2012 not only are enterococci qpcr results rapid they appear to be better predictors of children s health risk than culture measures of enterococci despite the fact that qpcr may detect dead and non viable cells wade et al 2008 because several states including those in the great lakes basin have adopted e coli standards rather than enterococci standards for monitoring their freshwater and inland beaches usepa 2003 there is interest in developing a qpcr method to rapidly measure e coli in beach waters an e coli qpcr method has been described chern et al 2011 however the evaluation of that method focused on the affinity of different primer probe sets for e coli and a variety of related bacterial species thus a systematic characterization of e coli qpcr method performance is lacking likewise paired comparisons of e coli qpcr test results to currently approved fib test methods i e e coli culture and enterococci qpcr are also lacking assuming that an e coli qpcr testing method demonstrates acceptable performance beach mangers will need a beach action value bav for this method in order to use monitoring results for public notification epidemiologic data used to determine recreational water criteria values have shown that e coli measured by culture is predictive of the occurrence of gastrointestinal illness at freshwater recreation sites impacted by wastewater treatment plants dufour 1984 usepa 1986 although some studies of water quality using qpcr methods for e coli have been conducted none evaluated e coli qpcr results as a predictor of illness francy et al 2013b haugland et al 2005 lavender and kinzelman 2009 noble et al 2010 raith et al 2014 schang et al 2016 while multiple studies have assessed the relationship between the e coli culture and enterococci qpcr results few focus on comparisons between e coli culture and qpcr results on paired water samples lam et al 2014 noble et al 2010 both noble et al 2010 and lam et al 2014 reported significant linear relationships between e coli culture and qpcr concentrations however all but one of the test samples were marine waters at several racine wi beaches lavender and kinzelman 2009 found only moderately strong associations between e coli culture and e coli qpcr r2 0 47 to 0 56 to our knowledge there are currently no peer reviewed publications that have evaluated the e coli qpcr draft usepa method for routine beach water monitoring and notification purposes since establishing the 1986 water quality criteria based on epidemiologic studies the usepa more recently established the 2012 rwqc for enterococci measured using qpcr methods again using data from epidemiological studies usepa 2012 thus although new e coli qpcr laboratory methods have been developed strategies are needed to establish health based e coli qpcr bav that are tied to health risk technical support materials tsm linked to the 2012 rwqc were developed by usepa to provide guidance for establishing site specific recreational water quality criteria for newly developed indicators and methods under consideration for recreational water quality monitoring another analytic approach suitable for generating bavs for new testing methods is receiver operating

comparative cycle threshold Œ¥Œ¥ct method as described in method 1609 1 was used to calculate the ratio of target sequences in the samples and calibrators to generate calibrator cell equivalents cce for both e coli and enterococci the results for the qpcr tests were reported in cce per 100 ml water sample 2 5 data quality colilert quality control procedures included analysis of duplicate samples

coli as positive controls substances found in beach water samples can cause qpcr amplification inhibition and or poor dna recovery moderate degrees of matrix interference can be corrected by using the spc to adjust respective e coli and enterococci qpcr cycle threshold ct measurements on a sample basis however water sample results with a high degree of matrix interference 3ct shift between spc spikes in water samples and calibrator samples were considered not useable refer to method 1609 1 for a complete description of method procedures 2 6 data analysis datasets were generated in microsoft

interquartile ranges for both enterococci qpcr and e coli concentrations culture and qpcr frequency of bav exceedances were calculated for enterococci qpcr and e coli culture the lower limit of standard curve quantification lloscq for e coli qpcr assay was calculated from the upper 95 bound of the composite standard curve generated from all individual ct data points for each standard the normality of distribution of culture and qpcr results were determined using kolmogorov smirnov tests using p 0 05 to indicate normality since neither e coli nor enterococci results were normally distributed data were log10 transformed and the log transformed data approximated normality bivariate associations between continuous measures of culture and qpcr results were characterized by pearson correlation coefficients for log normally distributed data and spearman correlation coefficient for beach specific data that was not distributed normally or log normally kruskal wallis anova was used to determine if there were significant differences in concentrations e coli mpn e coli cce and enterococci cce between beaches followed by dunn s post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons for determining which beaches were different from one another all results and relationships were considered significant at alpha Œ± 0 05 the usepa tsm recommends the calculation of an index of agreement ia and pearson s correlation r squared r2 for the association between paired measurements of a new and an established method in our case the new alternative method e coli qpcr were paired separately with the two established reference methods e coli culture and enterococci qpcr per the tsm the alternative indicator is acceptable for establishing site specific water quality criteria or bav if the calculated ia is greater than 0 7 and or r2 is greater than 0 6 usepa 2014 if the ia is greater than or equal to 0 7 the new indicator bav is the same numerical criteria value of the reference method bav if this

the calculated r squared determines that the two methods are correlated i e r2 greater than 0 6 the new criteria or bav is derived through linear regression roc analysis was used to identify thresholds of e coli qpcr concentrations that are predictive of exceedance of the enterococci qpcr bav 1000 cce 100 ml and e coli culture bav 235 mpn 100 ml associated graphs were generated using the medcalc software medcalc version 18 for windows medcalc software ostend belgium to calculate the area under the curve auc an auc of 1 0 indicates perfect sensitivity and specificity whereas an auc of 0 5 suggests no discriminatory ability of the predictor comparable to chance alone the optimal e coli cce threshold value was defined as the point on the roc curve with the highest true positive and lowest false positive rate for predicting a respective bav exceedance 3 results 3 1 data quality 3 1 1 colilert quality control results all negative controls for colilert analyzed resulted in 1 mpn

information from the pooled five standard curves for e coli and from pooled 10 enterococci standard curves are summarized in table a 4 3 1 3 qpcr precision altogether 72 sets of enterococci calibrator samples were analyzed throughout the study period in the course of 36 days of e coli monitoring 36 sets of e coli calibrator samples were analyzed six replicates of one calibrator sample per day we observed high precision with very little variability of ct values in measurement on different days the coefficient of variation cv for the e coli and enterococci spc and for both the e coli and enterococci calibrator cells were low descriptive statistics for the calibrator samples and spc for both e coli and enterococci are summarized in table a 5 3 2 qpcr lower limit of standard curve quantification lloscq based on the lloscq calculation the calculated lloscq for e coli qpcr was a ct value of 37 27 corresponding to the lowest tsc used in constructing the standard curve a method for calculating the lower limit of quantification is not specified in the enterococci qpcr method method 1609 1 the lowest concentration used in constructing the enterococci standard curve was 11 78 tsc 5 Œºl the mean ct sd for detecting 11 78 tsc 5 Œºl of e coli and enterococci targets were similar 34 5 0 45 and 33 2 0 56 respectively 3 3 ntc and meb contamination in e coli qpcr and enterococci qpcr the ct values for the ntc and meb for the e coli qpcr runs were very similar with the average cts of approximately 38 for the e coli target range 36 40 as shown in table a 6 only 10 13 89 out of 72 reactions of ntc ct values for e coli were below the lloscq of 37 27 the number was much higher for meb ct values with 21 76 47 out of 216 reactions below the lloscq table a 6 this is consistent with the presence of extraneous e coli dna as a contaminant of the taq polymerase found in the environmental master mix in comparison the enterococci target was undetectable in 94 of the ntc n 144 and 91 of meb n 144 during the 36 days of testing with average ct of 39 7 for both ntc and meb table a 6 3 4 qpcr inhibition three samples 1 04 out of the 288 samples analyzed exceeded the 3 ct unit offset for spc target for both e coli and enterococci qpcr analyses all three samples had relatively high turbidity 5 47 ntu 14 6ntu for comparison the mean sd turbidity on dates that no samples were inhibited was 3 73 ntu 5 63 all remaining samples had offsets 3 cycles for spc target in both e coli and enterococci qpcr assays 3 5 comparisons between e coli culture e coli qpcr and enterococci qpcr

considerable variability among beaches table 1 the frequency of bav exceedance was more common at the two beaches with the highest median e coli concentrations montrose and rainbow beaches as well as north avenue beach similar to the culture results the e coli qpcr cces were significantly different between the beaches kruskal wallis test p 0 0001 with concentrations ranging from 9 to 39 431 cce

rainbow and 63rd street beach similar to e coli culture results ohio street beach had the lowest median e coli concentration by qpcr enterococci qpcr results from the eight beaches ranged from 3 to 47 484 cce 100 ml median enterococci concentrations were lowest at ohio street beach and highest at south shore and montrose beaches north avenue beach which frequently exceeded the e coli culture bav had the lowest frequency of exceeding the enterococci bav of 1000 cce 100 ml out of the total 285 samples that did not have inhibition 52 samples 18 2 exceeded the enterococci bav of 1000 cce 100 ml table 1 although the number of exceedances by e coli culture bav and enterococci qpcr bav were similar 18 the results were not always consistent among different beaches of the 52 samples that exceeded the enterococci qpcr bav only 25 48 also exceeded the e coli culture bav while 208 73 samples that did not exceed the enterococci qpcr bav also did not exceed the e coli culture bav 3 6 association between qpcr and culture measures of water quality the associations between log10 transformed culture and qpcr results are presented in fig 1 along with pearson s correlation coefficients r e coli qpcr was most strongly associated with same day colilert result r 0 83 p 0 0001 moderately strong and statistically significant correlations were also observed between enterococci qpcr and e coli qpcr r 0 67 p 0 0001 and between enterococci qpcr and same day culture results r 0 67 p 0 0001 lag e coli culture results e coli culture results from water samples collected for example on a monday that became available on tuesday were not associated with the tuesday s e coli r 0 12 p 0 08 or enterococci qpcr results r 0 09 p 0 17 this indicates that e coli culture results available to a beach manager on a given day from samples cultured the prior day is not predictive of current water quality the relationship between qpcr and culture results varied by beach as shown in table a 7 3 7 estimating potential e coli qpcr bav thresholds 3 7 1 index of agreement ia and r squared r2 results for ia and r2 are were tabulated with paired measurements all measurements above respective limit

as a reference in contrast it met both acceptability criteria ia 0 70 and r2 0 61 n 262 while using the e coli culture method as the reference in accordance with usepa guidance the e coli qpcr bav

optimized criteria level to best predict e coli culture bav exceedance and enterococci qpcr bav exceedance beach specific roc analysis resulted in a range of criteria values from 84 cce 100 ml to 1102 cce 100 ml as seen in table a 8 and table a 9 presented in the appendix the variability among beaches for location specific bavs was dependent upon the bav reference value chosen as the reference value if the same day e coli bav exceedance is used as the reference value the highest beach specific e coli qpcr bav is approximately four times higher than the lowest beach specific bav if the enterococci qpcr bav exceedance was used as the reference values the highest e coli qpcr bav is 10 times greater than the lowest beach specific bav the sensitivity and specificity associated with potential criterion values of same day culture e coli bav exceedance and qpcr enterococci bav exceedance also varied widely among the eight beaches table a 8 in the appendix demonstrates that e coli qpcr threshold values for three of the beaches north avenue south shore and calumet can be developed that are relatively sensitive and specific for exceeding the same day e coli culture bav with high aucs similarly table a 9 demonstrates that e coli qpcr threshold values for same two of the three beaches north avenue and calumet can be developed that are highly sensitive and specific for exceeding the enterococci qpcr bav with high aucs however the e coli qpcr threshold criteria differed from one another depending on whether the e coli culture or the enterococci qpcr bav value was used as the reference value 3 7 3 candidate e coli qpcr bav criteria thresholds four candidate e coli qpcr bavs table 3 were generated using two analytical approaches tsm and roc two bavs were used as references

exceedance of established bavs e coli culture and enterococci qpcr were compared table 3 sensitivity ranged from 0 58 to 0 81 table 3 indicating a failure to trigger beach advisories 19 42 of the time compared to the reference value of e coli qpcr bav 1000 cce 100 ml criteria no water sample exceeded the e coli candidate bavs when the enterococci qpcr results were below the enterococci qpcr bav perfect specificity 4 discussion 4 1 e coli qpcr method performance several metrics were used to assess the performance of the e coli qpcr method using dna standards and chicago beach water samples standard curves demonstrated exceptional linearity r2 0 999 and amplification efficiency e 1 00 well within the performance criteria recommended by qpcr experts r2 0 980 and e 0 90 to 1 10 bustin and nolan 2006 thermofisher scientific 2016 in addition the e coli qpcr method was able to routinely measure dna standard concentrations under 10 copies per reaction suggesting that this procedure is capable of measuring low levels of dna target in environmental samples in addition only 1 of recreational water samples n 3 showed evidence of matrix interference indicating that this method can routinely recover and amplify e coli dna targets in chicago area beach waters interestingly matrix interference only occurred in samples with above average turbidity suggesting that particulates suspended in the water column may influence method performance controls designed to identify contamination detected extraneous dna in 65 3 and 79 2 of e coli qpcr test reactions in the ntc n 72 and meb n 216 respectively but were consistently at low concentrations table a 6 as a result e coli qpcr estimate cce concentrations could be inflated however contamination levels were low maximum observed contamination 55 cce 100 ml and had minimal impact on water sample concentration estimates it is possible that contamination in e coli qpcr experiments originates from the reagents employed in this method likely the dna polymerase found in the environmental master mix it is common for taq dna polymerase to be manufactured via e coli cloning frahm and obst 2003 silkie et al 2008 and it is possible that trace quantities of e coli dna may be present leading to low levels of contamination in controls and water samples the addition of a qpcr reagent decontamination step or use of reagents with increased purification quality controls less bacterial dna might be useful to reduce false positives in e coli qpcr and to ensure more accurate concentration estimates albeit it might increase the time and cost required to analyze samples 4 2 e coli qpcr and fib paired measurements comparing paired measurements of a new alternative indicator methodology e coli qpcr with established fib procedures can reveal important information on the ability of the novel approach to identify fecal bacteria e coli qpcr results were strongly associated with same day e coli culture and enterococci qpcr findings across beach sites a similar trend was reported in studies conducted by lam et al 2014 and noble et al 2010 based on paired measurements of culture and qpcr methods for quantifying e coli in freshwater interestingly correlations between enterococci qpcr and e coli qpcr r 0 67 and between enterococci qpcr and same day e coli culture r 0 67 were weaker than the correlation between e coli qpcr and same day e coli culture r 0 83 suggesting that the target microbe enterococci or e coli rather than the measurement method culture or qpcr may have a stronger influence on the level of agreement between two water quality fecal indicator approaches this observation could have important ramifications when selecting a reference method to establish new bav criteria thresholds for an alternative indicator in the absence of an epidemiological study additional research is warranted to confirm this observation across a broader range of site locations 4 3 comparison of potential candidate bav criteria using different statistical approaches using the ia approach yielded reasonable agreement between results of e coli qpcr analyses and with both e coli culture and the enterococci qpcr reference methods at chicago beaches however the candidate bav for e coli qpcr method derived using the tsm calculation with enterococci qpcr as the reference was 4 25 times the bav threshold obtained from ia approach using e coli culture as the reference method since both e coli culture and enterococci qpcr methods are recommended by usepa for monitoring freshwater beaches one might assume that they indicate a comparable degree of health risk our study suggest that this would not be the case at non point impacted beaches in the chicago area it is not known whether there would be closer agreement among the candidate e coli qpcr bavs had this study been conducted at beaches impacted by wastewater discharge 4 4 relationships between e coli qpcr and established fib vary by beach site results from our study also indicated that e coli qpcr roc derived bavs differed from one another depending on whether the e coli culture or the enterococci qpcr bav value was used as the reference value in our study we found that using the e coli qpcr bav derived from the enterococci qpcr bav exceedance as the reference beach advisories would be twice as frequent than using the e coli qpcr bav derived using roc analysis with e coli culture bav exceedances as the reference since we do not have epidemiologic data linked to the water quality results it is not possible to determine whether enterococci qpcr or the e coli culture should be considered the gold standard predictor of health risk at these sites it is interesting to note that the e coli qpcr threshold value derived using the roc method with to enterococci bav as the anchor is about the same as the current culture bav of 235 mpn 100 ml however threshold values from beach specific analysis varied substantially from each other as did the sensitivity and specificity for bav exceedance a single criterion value for posting beach advisories might not be optimal for monitoring at similar nearby beaches whether this truly reflects site specific differences in health risk is not known although the overall percent of exceedances of e coli culture bav and enterococci qpcr bav were similar 18 the results were not always consistent among different beaches for example north avenue beach had total nine 25 e coli culture bav exceedances whereas only 3 8 3 enterococci qpcr exceedances on the other hand at ohio street beach e coli culture bav exceedance was less common 1 2 8 than enterococci qpcr bav exceedances total of 4 11 1 this discordance between the exceedance of bav using e coli culture and enterococci qpcr method suggest that these two methods may not provide comparable degree of public health protection at non point source impacted freshwater beaches currently bavs for different microbes e coli measured by culture enterococci measured by culture enterococci measured by qpcr are considered to be interchangeable at freshwater beaches several prior studies have also reported different levels of agreement between e coli culture and enterococci qpcr bav exceedances francy et al 2013a haugland et al 2014 sheth et al 2016 recent results from a 2015 2016 study at most of the same beaches as in our study had far more bav exceedances by e coli culture than by enterococci qpcr dorevitch et al 2017 our results suggest that the usepa should re evaluate the assumption of equivalence of these different methods at non point source impacted freshwater beaches and potentially revise guidance to state and local beach managers and others who ensure compliance with their water quality standards using the provisions listed in the 2012 rwqc 4 5 implications for water quality management this study has several implications for water quality management states and local governments might face challenges in their attempts to develop alternative bav criteria thresholds the statistical approaches that we used resulted in different e coli qpcr potential bav criteria thresholds ranging from 200 cce 100 ml to 1000 cce 100 ml using two usepa recommended fib protocols e coli culture and enterococci qpcr as reference methods it is not apparent which e coli qpcr bav would provide the same degree of health protection as those established for e coli culture or for enterococci qpcr which themselves do not appear to result in comparable beach management decisions in our setting our findings provide opportunities for policy makers to address the challenges of developing a site specific criterion or bav for alternative indicator method we found that the choice of the reference method used in tsm calculations influences the bav for the alternative indicator for that reason it would be useful to know if they should be considered comparable or whether the most conservative lowest bav should be used roc analysis which optimized sensitivity and specificity a dichotomous cut point rather than relying on the linear relationship between the two sets of continuous variables provided different bavs than the tsm method consideration should be given to use of the roc method in the establishment of alternative criteria 4 6 strengths and limitations chicago s diversion of treated wastewater and stormwater away from lake michigan makes its beaches relatively unique thus our findings may not be applicable in other settings the research took place over a single season and the analyses were conducted in a single laboratory it is not known whether the observed e coli qpcr associations with e coli culture and with enterococci qpcr results would be different in different settings or in the same setting at a different point in time a strength of this study is that it is the first to compare e coli culture results with rapid qpcr methods quantifying both e coli and enterococci using the same water samples on a daily basis we used multiple pieces of information including lag e coli culture same day e coli culture and same day enterococci qpcr to derive potential bav criteria thresholds for the draft usepa e coli qpcr the qpcr analyses were conducted in real time rather than after defrosting archived filters as would be the case if the methods were to be used for routine beach monitoring 5 conclusions the draft usepa qpcr method targeting e coli intended to be used for monitoring freshwater beaches demonstrated good technical performance based on the high frequencies of positive ntc and meb in e coli qpcr analysis but not enterococci qpcr analysis environmental master mix contamination by e coli dna is likely present however the degree of contamination is low and likely would have little impact on beach monitoring using tsm and roc analyses we were able to derive different candidate bav threshold values for e coli qpcr method using two usepa recommended fib culture and qpcr methods and corresponding health based bav criteria the finding that each method and reference fib measurement yielded different e coli qpcr bav highlights a need for further usepa guidelines about setting site specific alternative standards using alternative indicator and or methods to improve clarity and refine assumptions of comparability of bavs of different usepa approved methods for quantifying indicator bacteria given the availability of a qpcr method enterococci developed by usepa along with criteria values and bavs calibrated directly to observed health risk in epidemiological studies there is little reason to attempt developing bav criteria for other testing methods in the absence of clear information about how results of such water testing methods predict health risk declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18916,most great lakes communities rely on culture based e coli methods for monitoring fecal indicator bacteria fib at recreational beaches these cultivation methods require 18 or more hours to generate results as a consequence public notifications about beach action value bav exceedance are based on prior day water quality rapid qpcr monitoring of bacteria in beach water solves the 24 h delay problem though the usepa approved qpcr method targets enterococci bacteria while great lakes communities are familiar with e coli monitoring for an e coli qpcr method to be useful for water quality management it is important to systematically characterize method performance and establish bavs for public notification purposes in this study we 1 evaluated a draft usepa e coli qpcr method 2 compared e coli qpcr measurements with two established fib e coli culture and enterococci qpcr results and explored potential strategies to establish e coli qpcr bav criteria in the absence of an epidemiological study based on analyses of 288 water samples collected from eight of chicago s lake michigan beaches the e coli qpcr method demonstrates acceptable performance characteristics the method is prone to low level dna contamination possibly originating from assay reagents derived from e coli bacteria both e coli and enterococci bavs were exceeded in approximately 18 of the samples e coli qpcr values were correlated with both e coli culture r 0 83 p 0 0001 and enterococci qpcr r 0 67 p 0 0001 values the approach recommended by the usepa in its technical support material tsm was used to generate candidate e coli qpcr bavs as was receiver operating characteristic roc analysis potential bav thresholds differed substantially ranging from 200 9 calibrator cell equivalents cce 100 ml roc analysis enterococci qpcr bav as the reference to 1000 cce 100 ml tsm analysis enterococci qpcr bav as the reference because we found that different approaches to establishing potential bavs generate quite different values guidance from usepa about approaches to defining comparable bavs would be useful graphical abstract image 1 keywords beach monitoring recreational water quality fecal indicator bacteria fib e coli quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr receiver operating characteristics roc 1 introduction escherichia coli e coli are fecal indicator bacteria fib commonly used for recreational water quality monitoring at freshwater beaches historically beach managers in the great lakes basin have employed culture based e coli methods rather than enterococci even though the u s environmental protection agency usepa has established water quality criteria for freshwater using both bacteria usepa 1986 2012 although culture based chromogenic substrate methods such as colilert are easy to use and relatively inexpensive they require 18 24 h of incubation since fib concentrations in water can change from day to day this turnaround time can often lead to incorrect assessment of beach water quality resulting in erroneous public health information kim and grant 2004 a recent study revealed that prior day e coli culture results are no better than chance alone at predicting current day water quality at chicago beaches dorevitch et al 2017 in 2012 the usepa released new recreational water quality criteria rwqc that included a rapid quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr method for enterococci which unlike culture methods can generate results within 3 4 h for same day water quality notifications usepa 2012 not only are enterococci qpcr results rapid they appear to be better predictors of children s health risk than culture measures of enterococci despite the fact that qpcr may detect dead and non viable cells wade et al 2008 because several states including those in the great lakes basin have adopted e coli standards rather than enterococci standards for monitoring their freshwater and inland beaches usepa 2003 there is interest in developing a qpcr method to rapidly measure e coli in beach waters an e coli qpcr method has been described chern et al 2011 however the evaluation of that method focused on the affinity of different primer probe sets for e coli and a variety of related bacterial species thus a systematic characterization of e coli qpcr method performance is lacking likewise paired comparisons of e coli qpcr test results to currently approved fib test methods i e e coli culture and enterococci qpcr are also lacking assuming that an e coli qpcr testing method demonstrates acceptable performance beach mangers will need a beach action value bav for this method in order to use monitoring results for public notification epidemiologic data used to determine recreational water criteria values have shown that e coli measured by culture is predictive of the occurrence of gastrointestinal illness at freshwater recreation sites impacted by wastewater treatment plants dufour 1984 usepa 1986 although some studies of water quality using qpcr methods for e coli have been conducted none evaluated e coli qpcr results as a predictor of illness francy et al 2013b haugland et al 2005 lavender and kinzelman 2009 noble et al 2010 raith et al 2014 schang et al 2016 while multiple studies have assessed the relationship between the e coli culture and enterococci qpcr results few focus on comparisons between e coli culture and qpcr results on paired water samples lam et al 2014 noble et al 2010 both noble et al 2010 and lam et al 2014 reported significant linear relationships between e coli culture and qpcr concentrations however all but one of the test samples were marine waters at several racine wi beaches lavender and kinzelman 2009 found only moderately strong associations between e coli culture and e coli qpcr r2 0 47 to 0 56 to our knowledge there are currently no peer reviewed publications that have evaluated the e coli qpcr draft usepa method for routine beach water monitoring and notification purposes since establishing the 1986 water quality criteria based on epidemiologic studies the usepa more recently established the 2012 rwqc for enterococci measured using qpcr methods again using data from epidemiological studies usepa 2012 thus although new e coli qpcr laboratory methods have been developed strategies are needed to establish health based e coli qpcr bav that are tied to health risk technical support materials tsm linked to the 2012 rwqc were developed by usepa to provide guidance for establishing site specific recreational water quality criteria for newly developed indicators and methods under consideration for recreational water quality monitoring another analytic approach suitable for generating bavs for new testing methods is receiver operating

conditions of second variable i e e coli culture or enterococci qpcr bav exceedance roc has been previously applied to other water quality analyses to predict enterococci criteria value exceedance in relation to rainfall morrison et al 2003 and the presence of protozoan pathogens yavuz et al 2014 study objectives include 1 performance characterization of the e coli qpcr draft usepa method based on

and the meb filter was extracted in the same way as the sample and calibrator filters over the nine week duration of the study five standard curve assays were completed for e coli each standard curve

coli as positive controls substances found in beach water samples can cause qpcr amplification inhibition and or poor dna recovery moderate degrees of matrix interference can be corrected by using the spc to adjust respective e coli and enterococci qpcr cycle threshold ct measurements on a sample basis however water sample results with a high degree of matrix interference 3ct shift between spc spikes in water samples and calibrator samples were considered not useable refer to method 1609 1 for a complete description of method procedures 2 6 data analysis datasets were generated in microsoft excel 2010 and exported to sas software for windows version 9 4 sas institute cary nc for analyses graphs were produced using sas descriptive statistics were summarized as medians with the interquartile ranges for both enterococci qpcr and e coli concentrations culture and qpcr frequency of bav exceedances were calculated for enterococci qpcr and e coli culture the lower limit of standard curve quantification lloscq for e coli qpcr assay was calculated from the upper 95 bound of the composite standard curve generated from all individual ct data points for each standard the normality of distribution of culture and qpcr results were determined using kolmogorov smirnov tests using p 0 05 to indicate normality since neither e coli nor enterococci results were normally distributed data were log10 transformed and the log transformed data approximated normality bivariate associations between continuous measures of culture and qpcr results were characterized by pearson correlation coefficients for log normally distributed data and spearman correlation coefficient for beach specific data that was not distributed normally or log normally kruskal wallis anova was used to determine if there were significant differences in concentrations e coli mpn e coli cce and enterococci cce between beaches followed by dunn s post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons for determining which beaches were different from one another all results and relationships were considered significant at alpha Œ± 0 05 the usepa tsm recommends the calculation of an index of agreement ia and pearson s correlation r squared r2 for the association between paired measurements of a new and an established method in our case the new alternative method e coli qpcr were paired separately with the two established reference methods e coli culture and enterococci qpcr per the tsm the alternative indicator is acceptable for establishing site specific water quality criteria or bav if the calculated ia is greater than 0 7 and or r2 is greater than 0 6 usepa 2014 if the ia is greater than or equal to 0 7 the new indicator bav is the same numerical criteria value of the reference method bav if this was true in our comparison of e coli qpcr to e coli culture the bav of e coli qpcr would be 235 cce 100 ml derived from the 235 mpn 100 ml bav of e coli culture however if the ia is less then 0 7 but the calculated r squared determines that the two methods are correlated i e r2 greater than 0 6 the new criteria or bav is derived through linear regression roc analysis was used to identify thresholds of e coli qpcr concentrations that are predictive of exceedance of the enterococci qpcr bav 1000 cce 100 ml and e coli culture bav 235 mpn 100 ml associated graphs were generated using the medcalc software medcalc version 18 for windows medcalc software ostend belgium to calculate the area under the curve auc an auc of 1 0 indicates perfect sensitivity and specificity whereas an auc of 0 5 suggests no discriminatory ability of the predictor comparable to chance alone the optimal e coli cce threshold value was defined as the point on the roc curve with the highest true positive and lowest false positive rate for predicting a respective bav exceedance 3 results 3 1 data quality 3 1 1 colilert quality control results all negative controls for colilert analyzed resulted in 1 mpn

data was defined by the r2 of standard curves the accuracy of the standard curves for both targets was high with an overall r2 of 0 999 for e coli and r2 of 0 965 for enterococci slope and intercept information from the pooled five standard curves for e coli and from pooled 10 enterococci standard curves are summarized in table a 4 3 1 3 qpcr precision altogether 72 sets of enterococci calibrator samples were analyzed throughout the study period in the course of 36 days of e coli monitoring 36 sets of e coli calibrator samples were analyzed six replicates of one calibrator sample per day we observed high precision with very little variability of ct values in measurement on different days the coefficient of variation cv for the e coli and enterococci spc and for both the e coli and enterococci calibrator cells were low descriptive statistics for the calibrator samples and spc for both e coli and enterococci are summarized in table a 5 3 2 qpcr lower limit of standard curve quantification lloscq based on the lloscq calculation the calculated lloscq for e coli qpcr was a ct value of 37 27 corresponding to the lowest tsc used in constructing the standard curve a method for calculating the lower limit of quantification is not specified in the enterococci qpcr method method 1609 1 the lowest concentration used in constructing the enterococci standard curve was 11 78 tsc 5 Œºl the mean ct sd for detecting 11 78 tsc 5 Œºl of e coli and enterococci targets were similar 34 5 0 45 and 33 2 0 56 respectively 3 3 ntc and meb contamination in e coli qpcr and enterococci qpcr the ct values for the ntc and meb for the e coli qpcr runs were very similar with the average cts of approximately 38 for the e coli target range 36 40 as shown in table a 6 only 10 13 89 out of 72 reactions of ntc ct values for e coli were below the lloscq of 37 27 the number was much higher for meb ct values with 21 76 47 out of 216 reactions below the lloscq table a 6 this is consistent with the presence of extraneous e coli dna as a contaminant of the taq polymerase found in the environmental master mix in comparison the enterococci target was undetectable in 94 of the ntc n 144 and 91 of meb n 144 during the 36 days of testing with average ct of 39 7 for both ntc and meb table a 6 3 4 qpcr inhibition three samples 1 04 out of the 288 samples analyzed exceeded the 3 ct unit offset for spc target for both e coli and enterococci qpcr analyses all three samples had relatively high turbidity 5 47 ntu 14 6ntu for comparison the mean sd turbidity on dates that no samples were inhibited was 3 73 ntu 5 63 all remaining samples had offsets 3 cycles for spc target in both e coli and enterococci qpcr assays 3 5 comparisons between e coli culture e coli qpcr and enterococci qpcr results a total of 288 e coli culture results were generated with results ranging from 2 mpn 100 ml to 2419 mpn 100 ml with a median interquartile range of 59 mpn 100 ml 22 162 mpn 100 ml as summarized in table 1 the median e coli concentrations were highest at montrose beach followed by rainbow beach the lowest median concentration was observed at ohio street beach kruskal wallis tests showed that the e coli concentrations were significantly different between the 8 beaches tested p 0 0001 out of the total 288 samples 52 samples 18 1 exceeded the e coli bav of 235 mpn 100 ml with considerable variability among beaches table 1 the frequency of bav exceedance was more common at the two beaches with the highest median e coli concentrations montrose and rainbow beaches as well as north avenue beach similar to the culture results the e coli qpcr cces were significantly different between the beaches kruskal wallis test p 0 0001 with concentrations ranging from 9 to 39 431 cce

rainbow and 63rd street beach similar to e coli culture results ohio street beach had the lowest median e coli concentration by qpcr enterococci qpcr results from the eight beaches ranged from 3 to 47 484 cce 100 ml median enterococci concentrations were lowest at ohio street beach and highest at south shore and montrose beaches north avenue beach which frequently exceeded the e coli culture bav had the lowest frequency of exceeding the enterococci bav of 1000 cce 100 ml out of the total 285 samples that did not have inhibition 52 samples 18 2 exceeded the enterococci bav of 1000 cce 100 ml

became available on tuesday were not associated with the tuesday s e coli r 0 12 p 0 08 or enterococci qpcr results r 0 09 p 0 17 this indicates that e coli culture results available to a beach manager on a given day from samples cultured the prior day is not predictive of current water quality the relationship between qpcr and culture results varied by beach as shown in table a 7 3 7

optimized criteria level to best predict e coli culture bav exceedance and enterococci qpcr bav exceedance beach specific roc analysis resulted in a range of criteria values from 84 cce 100 ml to 1102 cce 100 ml as seen in table a 8 and table a 9 presented in the appendix the variability among beaches for location specific bavs was dependent upon the bav reference value chosen as the reference value if the same day e coli bav exceedance is used as the reference value the highest beach specific e coli qpcr bav is approximately four times higher than the lowest beach specific bav if the enterococci qpcr bav exceedance was used as the reference values the highest e coli qpcr bav is 10 times greater than the lowest beach specific bav the sensitivity and specificity associated with potential criterion values of same day culture e coli bav exceedance and qpcr enterococci bav exceedance also varied widely among the eight beaches table a 8 in the appendix demonstrates that e coli qpcr threshold values for three of the beaches north avenue south shore and calumet can be developed that are relatively sensitive and specific for exceeding the same day e coli culture bav with high aucs similarly table a 9 demonstrates that e coli qpcr threshold values for same two of the three beaches north avenue and calumet can be developed that are highly sensitive and specific for exceeding the enterococci qpcr bav with high aucs however the e coli qpcr threshold criteria differed from one another depending on whether the e coli culture or the enterococci qpcr bav value was used as the reference value 3 7 3 candidate e coli qpcr bav criteria thresholds four candidate e coli qpcr bavs table 3 were generated using two analytical approaches tsm and roc two bavs were used as references for each approach that for the e coli culture method 235 mpn 100 ml and for the enterococci qpcr method 1000 cce 100 ml the ability of the four candidate e coli qpcr bav to correctly identify exceedance of established bavs e coli culture and enterococci qpcr were compared table 3 sensitivity ranged from 0 58 to 0 81 table 3 indicating a failure to trigger beach advisories 19 42 of the time compared to the reference value of e coli qpcr bav 1000 cce 100 ml criteria no water sample exceeded the e coli candidate bavs when the enterococci qpcr results were below the enterococci qpcr bav perfect specificity 4 discussion 4 1 e coli qpcr method performance several metrics were used to assess the performance of the e coli qpcr method using dna standards and chicago beach water samples standard curves demonstrated exceptional linearity r2 0 999 and amplification efficiency e 1 00 well within the performance criteria recommended by qpcr experts r2 0 980 and e 0 90 to 1 10 bustin and nolan 2006 thermofisher scientific 2016 in addition the e coli qpcr method was able to routinely measure dna standard concentrations under 10 copies per reaction suggesting that this procedure is capable of measuring low levels of dna target in environmental samples in addition only 1 of recreational water samples n 3 showed evidence of matrix interference indicating that this method can routinely recover and amplify e coli dna targets in chicago area beach waters interestingly matrix interference only occurred in samples with above average turbidity suggesting that particulates suspended in the water column may influence method performance controls designed to identify contamination detected extraneous dna in 65 3 and 79 2 of e coli qpcr test reactions in the ntc n 72 and meb n 216 respectively but were consistently at low concentrations table a 6 as a result e coli qpcr estimate cce concentrations could be inflated however contamination levels were low maximum observed contamination 55 cce 100 ml and had minimal impact on water sample concentration estimates it is possible that contamination in e coli qpcr experiments originates from the reagents employed in this method likely the dna polymerase found in the environmental master mix it is common for taq dna polymerase to be manufactured via e coli cloning frahm and obst 2003 silkie et al 2008 and it is possible that trace quantities of e coli dna may be present leading to low levels of contamination in controls and water samples the addition of a qpcr reagent decontamination step or use of reagents with increased purification quality controls less bacterial dna might be useful to reduce false positives in e coli qpcr and to ensure more accurate concentration estimates albeit it might increase the time and cost required to analyze samples 4 2 e coli qpcr and fib paired measurements comparing paired measurements of a new alternative indicator methodology e coli qpcr with established fib procedures can reveal important information on the ability of the novel approach to identify fecal bacteria e coli qpcr results were strongly associated with same day e coli culture and enterococci qpcr findings across beach sites a similar trend was reported in studies conducted by lam et al 2014 and noble et al 2010 based on paired measurements of culture and qpcr methods for quantifying e coli in freshwater interestingly correlations between enterococci qpcr and e coli qpcr r 0 67 and between enterococci qpcr and same day e coli culture r 0 67 were weaker than the correlation between e coli qpcr and same day e coli culture r 0 83 suggesting that the target microbe enterococci or e coli rather than the measurement method culture or qpcr may have a stronger influence on the level of agreement between two water quality fecal indicator approaches this observation could have important ramifications when selecting a reference method to establish new bav criteria thresholds for an alternative indicator in the absence of an epidemiological study additional research is warranted to confirm this observation across a broader range of site locations 4 3 comparison of potential candidate bav criteria using different statistical approaches using the ia approach yielded reasonable agreement between results of e coli qpcr analyses and with both e coli culture and the enterococci qpcr reference methods at chicago beaches however the candidate bav for e coli qpcr method derived using the tsm calculation with enterococci qpcr as the reference was 4 25 times the bav threshold obtained from ia approach using e coli culture as the reference method since both e coli culture and enterococci qpcr methods are recommended by usepa for monitoring freshwater beaches one might assume that they indicate a comparable degree of health risk our study suggest that this would not be the case at non point impacted beaches in the chicago area it is not known whether there would be closer agreement among the candidate e coli qpcr bavs had this study been conducted at beaches impacted by wastewater discharge 4 4 relationships between e coli qpcr and established fib vary by beach site results from our study also indicated that e coli qpcr roc derived bavs differed from one another depending on whether the e coli culture or the enterococci qpcr bav value was used as the reference value in our study we found that using the e coli qpcr bav derived from the enterococci qpcr bav exceedance as the reference beach advisories would be twice as frequent than using the e coli qpcr bav derived using roc analysis with e coli culture bav exceedances as the reference since we do not have epidemiologic data linked to the water quality results it is not possible to determine whether enterococci qpcr or the e coli culture should be considered the gold standard predictor of health risk at these sites it is interesting to note that the e coli qpcr threshold value derived using the roc method with to enterococci bav as the anchor is about the same as the current culture bav of 235 mpn 100 ml however threshold values from beach specific analysis varied substantially from each other as did the sensitivity and specificity for bav exceedance a single criterion value for posting beach advisories might not be optimal for monitoring at similar nearby beaches whether this truly reflects site specific differences in health risk is not known although the overall percent of exceedances of e coli culture bav and enterococci qpcr bav were similar 18 the results were not always consistent among different beaches for example north avenue beach had total nine 25 e coli culture bav exceedances whereas only 3 8 3 enterococci qpcr exceedances on the other hand at ohio street beach e coli culture bav exceedance was less common 1 2 8 than enterococci qpcr bav exceedances total of 4 11 1 this discordance between the exceedance of bav using e coli culture and enterococci qpcr method suggest that these two methods may not provide comparable degree of public health protection at non point source impacted freshwater beaches currently bavs for different microbes e coli measured by culture enterococci measured by culture enterococci measured by qpcr are considered to be interchangeable at freshwater beaches several prior studies have also reported different levels of agreement between e coli culture and enterococci qpcr bav exceedances francy et al 2013a haugland et al 2014 sheth et al 2016 recent results from a 2015 2016 study at most of the same beaches as in our study had far more bav exceedances by e coli culture than by enterococci qpcr dorevitch et al 2017 our results suggest that the usepa should re evaluate the assumption of equivalence of these different methods at non point source impacted freshwater beaches and potentially revise guidance to state and local beach managers and others who ensure compliance with their water quality standards using the provisions listed in the 2012 rwqc 4 5 implications for water quality management this study has several implications for water quality management states and local governments might face challenges in their attempts to develop alternative bav criteria thresholds the statistical approaches that we used resulted in different e coli qpcr potential bav criteria thresholds ranging from 200 cce 100 ml to 1000 cce 100 ml using two usepa recommended fib protocols e coli culture and enterococci qpcr as reference methods it is not apparent which e coli qpcr bav would provide the same degree of health protection as those established for e coli culture or for enterococci qpcr which themselves do not appear to result in comparable beach management decisions in our setting our findings provide opportunities for policy makers to address the challenges of developing a site specific criterion or bav for alternative indicator method we found that the choice of the reference method used in tsm calculations influences the bav for the alternative indicator for that reason it would be useful to know if they should be considered comparable or whether the most conservative lowest bav should be used roc analysis which optimized sensitivity and specificity a dichotomous cut point rather than relying on the linear relationship between the two sets of continuous variables provided different bavs than the tsm method consideration should be given to use of the roc method in the establishment of alternative criteria 4 6 strengths and limitations chicago s diversion of treated wastewater and stormwater away from lake michigan makes its beaches relatively unique thus our findings may not be applicable in other settings the research took place over a single season and the analyses were conducted in a single laboratory it is not known whether the observed e coli qpcr associations with e coli culture and with enterococci qpcr results would be different in different settings or in the same setting at a different point in time a strength of this study is that it is the first to compare e coli culture results with rapid qpcr methods quantifying both e coli and enterococci using the same water samples on a daily basis we used multiple pieces of information including lag e coli culture same day e coli culture and same day enterococci qpcr to derive potential bav criteria thresholds for the draft usepa e coli qpcr the qpcr analyses were conducted in real time rather than after defrosting archived filters as would be the case if the methods were to be used for routine beach monitoring 5 conclusions the draft usepa qpcr method targeting e coli intended to be used for monitoring freshwater beaches demonstrated good technical performance based on the high frequencies of positive ntc and meb in e coli qpcr analysis but not enterococci qpcr analysis environmental master mix contamination by e coli dna is likely present however the degree of contamination is low and likely would have little impact on beach monitoring using tsm and roc analyses we were able to derive different candidate bav threshold values for e coli qpcr method using two usepa recommended fib culture and qpcr methods and corresponding health based bav criteria the finding that each method and reference fib measurement yielded different e coli qpcr bav highlights a need for further usepa guidelines about setting site specific alternative standards using alternative indicator and or methods to improve clarity and refine assumptions of comparability of bavs of different usepa approved methods for quantifying indicator bacteria given the availability of a qpcr method enterococci developed by usepa along with criteria values and bavs calibrated directly to observed health risk in epidemiological studies there is little reason to attempt developing bav criteria for other testing methods in the absence of clear information about how results of such water testing methods predict health risk declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

18917,this study focused on evaluating the use of powdered activated carbon pac adsorption for the treatability of various odor compounds with different structures the adsorption performance of 14 odor compounds under various pac dosages were fitted with two isotherm models the langmuir and freundlich models to evaluate the adsorption ability the results indicated that the adsorption capacities estimated from isotherm model predictions were not suitable for the evaluation of treatability of the odor compound due to the neglection of odor threshold a novel assessment method through the comparison of the residual concentration at an inflection point where the downward trend of the odor compound residual concentration and pac dosage curve starts to flatten and the corresponding threshold concentration was employed this assessment method considered the different thresholds of the various odor compounds and their absorbability by pac as well as the cost the results indicated that only the sulfur odor compounds including dimethyl disulfide diethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide were not suitable for pac treatment other odor compounds could be treated by pac with varying success the correlations between the adsorption capacity and the treatability of various odor compounds and their properties including the coefficient between octanol and water logkw solubility molar refractivity mr dipole and volume were also evaluated using the pearson and spearman correlation analysis the results indicated that there were not significant correlations between the adsorption capacity and the properties of the odor compounds while there were significant correlations between the treatability and logkw mr and volume the odor causing compound with a larger logkw mr and volume was more suitable to be treated by pac graphical abstract image 1 keywords powdered activated carbon odor compounds treatability adsorption adsorbate properties 1 introduction taste and odor t o

hydrogen sulfide and ammonia produced anaerobically are among the odorous compounds that are capable of producing odor in wastewater collection and treatment facilities talaiekhozani et al 2016 several advanced technologies including chemical oxidation adsorption catalytic and biological methods have been employed to deal with the t o compounds barbusinski et al 2017 antonopoulou et al 2014 among them adsorption by powdered activated carbon pac is one of the most utilized treatment processes matsui et al 2014 nowack et al 2004 a great amount of research has focused on the adsorption capacity of various pacs with various properties on the treatment of odor compounds bertone et al 2018 li et al 2002 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 kennedy and summers 2015 it has been found that pac with a bimodal pore distribution a high surface area and a low bulk density generally attained a higher adsorption of the odor compounds yu et al studied five types of pac in geosmin and 2 mib removal and concluded that the pac micropores were a significant indicator in the adsorption of odor compounds yu et al 2007 newcombe et al found that mib adsorption was mainly related to the micropore volumes within the pore size range of 10 and 12 √• newcombe et al 2002 considine et al also reported that an increase in the carbon oxygen content at a constant pore volume lead to a decrease in the amount of 2 mib adsorbed considine et al 2001 in wastewater treatment sulfur compounds are the most widely studied vega et al studied the activated carbon ac adsorption performance for sulfur compounds and found that an increase in the oxygen group did not enhance the adsorption capacities for dimethyl sulfide dms and dimethyl disulfide dmds and an increase in the phenolic group in the ac surface would increase the adsorption capacity of ethyl mercaptan vega et al 2015 however previous research mainly focused on the ac properties on the adsorption ability of odor compounds especially geosmin and 2 mib in addition to geosmin 2 mib and sulfur compounds there are many other types of odor compounds however there are very few studies focused on the adsorption ability differences among various odor compounds it has been well recognized that geosmin was more easily removed than 2 mib and this finding has been mainly explained by their differences in hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity matsui et al 2015 other than geosmin and 2 mib li et al have studied the pac adsorption capacity of two fishy odor compounds trans trans 2 4 heptadienal tt24hept and e e 2 4 decadienal using several kinetics and isotherm models they found that e e 2 4 decadienal with a higher hydrophobicity achieved a higher adsorption capacity than tt24hept li et al 2015 boraphech and thiravetyan also applied the langmuir isotherm model to analyze several carbon adsorbents in trimethylamine adsorption boraphech and thiravetyan 2015 however these studies only use isotherm models to estimate the adsorption capacities of several odor compounds which is not sufficient to assess whether the odor problem could be effectively treated by pac due to the large gap among the thresholds of various odor compounds the odor problem caused by the odor compound not only depends on its adsorption ability but also relies on its threshold an odor compound with high adsorption capacity but has extremely low threshold may not be reduced below its threshold on the contrary an odor compound with low adsorption capacity and high threshold may be easily treated by pac therefore new treatability assessment methods which could consider both the adsorption ability and the different thresholds needs to be developed in addition the effects of the properties of the odor compounds on the treatability by pac still need to be further understood in this study the adsorption of 14 odor compounds including 2 earthy musty 5 fishy 3 septic and 5 chemical odor compounds with pac were systematically investigated the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied and their adsorption capacity and performance were also compared in addition their treatability was evaluated in terms of a novel method considering adsorption ability and marginal effect the correlations among the adsorption capacity treatability and odor compounds properties were statistically analyzed to further understand the difference between odor compound adsorption and real odor removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the 14 odor compounds as shown in table 1 were all purchased from o2si america and their names abbreviations and thresholds are listed in table 1 nacl was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and was calcined at 450 c for 2 h stock solutions of the 14 odor compounds were prepared in methanol hplc grade j t baker center valley pa usa all other solutions were prepared using deionized water di water the pac used in this study was a coal based activated carbon with an iodine value of 1000 mg g 1 which is a commonly used pac in water treatment plant due to its low cost zheng et al 2018 ningxia guanghua co ltd china the bet brunauer emmett teller surface areas and pore size distributions of pac sample were characterized by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms measured at 77 k using an autosorb quantachrome usa computer controlled surface analyzer the specific properties of the pac are as follows specific area is 1630 m2 g 1 average pore size is 4 25 nm total pore volume is 0 29 ml g 1 and micropore specific area is 518 57 m2 g 1 the micropores of the carbon are concentrated in the 2 3 nm width range as shown in fig 1 a the phpzc was determined by the indirect titration method matsui et al 2015 the phpzc is 10 05 as shown in fig 1 b the pac stock solution was prepared by dispersing 1 g activated carbon in 1 l di water 2 2 adsorption experiment and odor compound measurement prior to the adsorption experiment pac was washed with di water until a constant neutral ph about 7 50 of the filtrates was observed and then the carbon was dried at 105 c for 6 h in an oven isotherm experiments were conducted with a pac dosage from 0 to 100 mg l 1 in 40 ml glass bottles high pac dosage was applied to guarantee that high initial odor compound concentration could be reduced to below threshold and reach the adsorption limit the ph of the water samples in the adsorption experiment was varied from 6 90 to 7 30 the final ph at the end of 24 h was varied from 8 15 to 8 85 the initial concentration was set to 10 50 times the corresponding threshold instead of a unified concentration this could avoid the case in which an odor compound with a high threshold could more easily be reduced to its threshold deionized water spiked with odor compound was used here to make this study more concentrated on the odor compound itself and avoid the interference of other substances the adsorption time was 24 h at the end of the adsorption experiment the suspension was withdrawn by an injection syringe and filtered through a glass fiber membrane whatman gf c uk before the odor compound measurement and 10 ml water sample with addition of 3 0 g nacl was taken out for the odor compound measurement the odor compound concentration was determined immediately by using headspace solid phase microextraction spme combined with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms shimadzu japan yu et al 2014 the conditions for gc were as follows the initial column temperature was 40 c with 3 min hold then increased to 240 c at a rate of 8 c min 1 the mass spectrometer conditions were as follows ionization voltage 70 ev ion source temperature 230 c full scan mode with a range of 20 300 m z and scan velocity of 0 20 scans second 1 the fragment ion and retention time of the 14 odor compounds are shown in table s1 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 adsorption capacity the experimental data were fitted using different equilibrium models langmuir and freundlich model equations and constants are listed in ref li et al 2015 the actual adsorption capacity Œºg mg 1 qe was calculated according to the change of the concentration of the odor compounds before and after pac adsorption according to the following equation 1 q e c 0 c d p a c where c0 is the initial odor compound concentration Œºg l 1 c is the residual concentration at a certain pac dosage Œºg l 1 and dpac is the pac dosage mg l 1 2 3 2 the treatability assessment generally the concentration of the residual odor compounds after adsorption dramatically decreased with the dosage of pac and then leveled off typical concentration curves for the residual odor compounds are shown in fig 2 there are inflection points in these curves at which the decreasing trend starts to flatten in mathematics the inflection point of a differentiable function of one variable is a point on the graph of the function where the function s second derivative is zero therefore the inflection point was obtained by taking the second derivative of the curve then the treatability index ti of the odor compounds is calculated by the following equation 2 ti c t c ip c t where cip is the residual odor compound concentration at the inflection point Œºg l 1 and ct is the threshold concentration of the corresponding odor compound Œºg l 1 therefore it could be inferred that the ti value is smaller than 1 and a larger ti value indicates better treatability the treatability of the odor compounds is compared using the ti value as follows if the ti value is below zero the corresponding odor compound cannot be treated by pac t and the more negative values indicate worse performance if the ti value is between 0 and 1 the corresponding odor compound can be treated by pac t and the closer the ti value is to 1 the more easily the odor compound is treated by pac 2 3 3 correlation analysis the pearson correlation and spearman rank correlation analysis were employed to assess the correlations between treatability index or adsorption capacity and odor compounds properties 3 results and discussion as shown in fig 2 the residual concentrations of the 14 odor compounds gradually decreased with an increase in the pac dosage since there are large differences between the thresholds of these odor compounds for example the threshold for 24dcp is four orders of magnitude higher than that of the 2 4 6 tca comparing their adsorption at the same initial concentration is not reasonable the pac dosage ranged from 0 to 100 mg l 1 however for the tt24dda and 3mld adsorption processes though their initial concentrations of the odor compounds were relatively high among the 14 odor compounds the pac dosages were only 0 10 mg l 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively it could be inferred that these two odor compounds were more easily adsorbed by pac than the other odor compounds and that only a small quantity of pac was needed to reduce the concentrations to levels below threshold or even the detection limit unlike tt24dda and 3mld deds and dmds exhibited different adsorption behaviors though their initial concentrations were relatively low their residual concentrations were all above their respective thresholds even when the pac dosage reached 100 mg l 1 the adsorption performance of these 14 odor compounds are systematically evaluated as follows 3 1 the adsorption capacity of odor compounds to further diagnose the nature of adsorption equilibrium the shape of the isotherm curves was fitted with two adsorption models as shown in fig 3 the calculated parameters and correlation coefficients r2 for the freundlich and langmuir models are listed in table 2 for the langmuir modeling with an exception for 3mld r2 0 880 all of the adsorption isotherm curves for the odor compounds were well fitted with the langmuir models r2 0 90 the maximum adsorption capacity qm for each odor compound was also predicted by the langmuir model as shown in table 2 however the predicted qm was not consistent with the visualized data as illustrated in fig 3 for example the qms of the 2 mib and 2 4 6 tca predicted by the langmuir model were only 0 04 Œºg g 1 and 0 03 Œºg g 1 respectively which were much smaller than those of the dmts 0 57 Œºg g 1 and dmds 0 33 Œºg g 1 however it could be noted from fig 2 that the residual concentrations of dmds and dmts were still above their respective thresholds 30 and 7 5 ng l 1 even when the pac dosage reached 100 mg l 1 while for the 2 mib and 2 4 6 tca they required less than 40 mg l 1 and 20 mg l 1 respectively to decrease their concentrations to levels below their thresholds 10 and 2 ng l 1 in addition the isotherm curves of these odor compounds were not leveling off thus the predicted qm values were not reliable the langmuir model assumes a monolayer adsorption onto a surface of uniform energy and no transmigration of the adsorbate on the adsorbent surface tan et al 2009 hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 the freundlich isotherm assumptions which assume that the stronger binding sites are occupied first and that the binding strength decreases with increasing site occupation degree are based on the hypothesis of heterogeneous adsorbent surface energy or heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces tan et al 2008 2009 above all the langmuir model could only predict the qm of each odor compound through an empirical formula thus the langmuir model was not the best choice to assess the treatability the freundlich model was also applied to analyze the adsorption of the odor compounds it could be noted with the exception of tt24hept the adsorption isotherm curves of the other odor compounds were well fitted with the freundlich model r2 0 930 implying a good predictability by this model generally the kf value in the freundlich model is an indicator of the adsorption capacity and 1 n is an indicator of the adsorption favorability however as depicted in table 2 the dmds had a low kf and a high 1 n value which was inconsistent with the data shown in fig 2 a lower kf value usually means a smaller adsorption capacity and a higher 1 n value generally represents odor compounds that prefer to be adsorbed there is a contradiction between the judgment from kf and 1 n in addition the xylene also achieved a very high kf value compared to other odor compounds including tt24dda and 3mld less than 5 mg l 1 pac was enough to reduce their concentration to below threshold levels therefore the freundlich model was also not very suitable to assess the odor compounds treatability since the qm predicted by the langmuir model is not reliable the actual adsorption capacity of various odor compound by pac at a very low pac dosage 2 mg l 1 was calculated by eq 1 and is shown in fig 4 however there are large differences in the adsorption capacities of the different odor compounds for the 2 mib 2 4 6 tca deds dmts dmds and b2ecp relatively low adsorption capacities were attained less than 100 Œºg g 1 while for the other odor compounds much higher adsorption capacities were achieved higher than 5000 Œºg l 1 although the 2 mib 2 4 6 tca and b2ecp were expected to attain low adsorption capacities in comparison with the other compounds the pac could still reduce the concentrations to levels below the threshold concentrations under reasonable dosages especially for b2ecp therefore the treatability evaluation of an odor compound should not only take consideration of its adsorption capacity but also involve the odor threshold above all the langmuir and freundlich models which could only predict the adsorption capacity are not enough to access the odor compound treatability therefore it is necessary to establish a comprehensive method which involves both the absorbability and threshold to evaluate whether the odor compound is suitable to be treated by pac adsorption and here we proposed a new method by evaluating the odor compound treatability through comparing the residual concentration and threshold at the inflection point and it will be further introduced in next section 3 2 the treatability assessment the treatability of the odor compounds was evaluated according to the abovementioned method using the ti value shown in table 3 for these 14 odor compounds there were only three odor compounds deds dmds and dtds which could not be treated by pac their residual concentrations were far higher than their threshold values especially dmts and dmds their residual concentrations were almost 3 times that of their corresponding threshold this result was in agreement with the previous study by vega et al that suggested that the adsorption of volatile sulfur compounds including dmds and dms by raw pac was limited and that the hno3 oxidation of pac could increase the adsorption ability vega et al 2013 cui et al also suggested that virgin activated carbon was not sufficient for the removal of sulfur compounds dmds ethyl disulfide etc and an ac modified with a function group and metal ion could increase the adsorption capacity for the sulfur compounds cui et al 2009 the previous study by bagreev found that dmds generally adsorbed in pores smaller than 50 √• and there is an apparent competition between the water and dmds for bond sites in a moist environment bagreev et al 2002 therefore the adsorption of dmds is limited in water except for the thio ethers odor compounds the pac could reduce the concentration of the odor compounds to below their corresponding threshold levels among them the ti value for 4tt24oda and 3mld are 1 which means that at the inflection point their residual concentrations are below the detection limit and these two odor compounds were very easily treated by pac the order of odor compounds according to their treatability are as follows tt24dda 3mld Œ≤ cyclo t2oa 2 4 6 tca 24dcp m xylene b2ecp 2 mib tt24oda tt24hetp deds dmds dmts this assessment method has taken into consideration the various thresholds and absorbability limitations of the odor compounds by pac allowing for a more reasonable evaluation of the treatability if the concentration at the inflection point of the residual odor compound is lower than its threshold it is suitable for treatment by pac adsorption if not it is not suitable for treatment by pac adsorption therefore if an odor compound has a relatively low absorbability but high threshold it could also be treated by pac however for odor compounds with a high absorbability but very low threshold pac adsorption only may be not enough to control the odor compounds to below threshold levels using the inflection point to access the pac adsorption performance could reflect whether pac adsorption is feasible for an odor compound treatment though a residual concentration could be decreased to below the threshold after the inflection point the pac adsorption could be not the best choice since after the inflection point only a small decrease of the odor compound concentration would cost large amount of pac which is not cost effective on the contrary before the inflection point the same dosage of pac would lead to relatively greater reduction of residual concentration of the odor compound if we could reduce the odor compound concentration below the threshold before the inflection point the sharp declination period the addition of pac is much more cost effective and it means that the odor compounds is suitable to be treated by pac otherwise if the odor compound could not be controlled before the inflection point it means that pac adsorption is not an economical method in this case and other technologies should be considered this method builds a link between treatability and adsorption capacity threshold and it is more appropriate to estimate

for the correlation between ti and the other odor properties logkw mr and volume were below 0 05 it could be concluded that there were significant correlations between the value of ti and logkw mr and volume the solubility have a correlation with the ti value to a certain extent and there is no significant correlation between ti and the dipole moreover the ti value has a positive correlation with logkw mr and the volume a higher ti value means better treatability therefore the odor compounds treatability has a positive correlation with logkw mr and volume thus the odors caused by compounds with a high logkw mr and volume are more easily removed by pac the substance with a larger logkw value was more hydrophobic the results were in agreement with previous studies that indicate hydrophobic materials in water are more easily adsorbed than hydrophilic substances matsui et al 2015 li et al 2002 the volume of the odor compounds ranged from 114 to 232 √•3 which corresponds to spherical diameters of approximately 3 0 3 8 √• thus the odor compounds were generally adsorbed onto the micropores of pac in aqueous systems size exclusion is observed when the pore width is smaller than approximately 1 7 times the second largest dimension of the adsorbates li et al 2002 here the pore size as shown in fig 1 a is much larger than the odor compounds diameters and the size exclusion was weak the odor compounds with a larger volume may be adsorbed more strongly with pac due to the relatively larger van der waals force in addition it could be noted that among these three properties

18917,this study focused on evaluating the use of powdered activated carbon pac adsorption for the treatability of various odor compounds with different structures the adsorption performance of 14 odor compounds under various pac dosages were fitted with two isotherm models the langmuir and freundlich models to evaluate the adsorption ability the results indicated that the adsorption capacities estimated from isotherm model predictions were not suitable for the evaluation of treatability of the odor compound due to the neglection of odor threshold a novel assessment method through the comparison of the residual concentration at an inflection point where the downward trend of the odor compound residual concentration and pac dosage curve starts to flatten and the corresponding threshold concentration was employed this assessment method considered the different thresholds of the various odor compounds and their absorbability by pac as well as the cost the results indicated that only the sulfur odor compounds including dimethyl disulfide diethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide were not suitable for pac treatment other odor compounds could be treated by pac with varying success the correlations between the adsorption capacity and the treatability of various odor compounds and their properties including the coefficient between octanol and water logkw solubility molar refractivity mr dipole and volume were also evaluated using the pearson and spearman correlation analysis the results indicated that there were not significant correlations between the adsorption capacity and the properties of the odor compounds while there were significant correlations between the treatability and logkw mr and volume the odor causing compound with a larger logkw mr and volume was more suitable to be treated by pac graphical abstract image 1 keywords powdered activated carbon odor compounds treatability adsorption adsorbate properties 1 introduction taste and odor t o

several advanced technologies including chemical oxidation adsorption catalytic and biological methods have been employed to deal with the t o compounds barbusinski et al 2017 antonopoulou et al 2014 among them adsorption by powdered activated carbon pac is one of the most utilized treatment processes matsui et al 2014 nowack et al 2004 a great amount of research has focused on the adsorption capacity of various pacs with various properties on the treatment of odor compounds bertone et al 2018 li et al 2002 pelekani and snoeyink 1999 kennedy and summers 2015 it has been found that pac with a bimodal pore distribution a high surface area and a low bulk density generally attained a higher adsorption of the odor compounds yu et al studied five types of pac in geosmin and 2 mib removal and concluded that the pac micropores were a significant indicator in the adsorption of odor compounds yu et al 2007 newcombe et al found that mib adsorption was mainly related to the micropore volumes within the pore size range of 10 and 12 √• newcombe et al 2002 considine et al also reported that an increase in the carbon oxygen content at a constant pore volume lead to a decrease in the amount of 2 mib adsorbed considine et al 2001 in wastewater treatment sulfur compounds are the most widely studied vega et al studied the activated carbon ac adsorption performance for sulfur compounds and found that an increase in the oxygen group did not enhance the adsorption capacities for dimethyl sulfide dms and dimethyl disulfide dmds and an increase in the phenolic group in the ac surface would increase the adsorption capacity of ethyl mercaptan vega et al 2015 however previous research mainly focused on the ac properties on the adsorption ability of odor compounds especially geosmin and 2 mib in addition to geosmin 2 mib and sulfur compounds there are many other types of odor compounds however there are very few studies focused on the adsorption ability differences among various odor compounds it has been well recognized that geosmin was more easily removed than 2 mib and this finding has been mainly explained by their differences in hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity matsui et al 2015 other than geosmin and 2 mib li et al have studied the pac adsorption capacity of two fishy odor compounds trans trans 2 4 heptadienal tt24hept and e e 2 4 decadienal using several kinetics and isotherm models they found that e e 2 4 decadienal with a higher hydrophobicity achieved a higher adsorption capacity than tt24hept li et al 2015 boraphech and thiravetyan also applied the langmuir isotherm model to analyze several carbon adsorbents in trimethylamine adsorption boraphech and thiravetyan 2015 however these studies only use isotherm models to estimate the adsorption capacities of several odor compounds which is not sufficient to assess whether the odor problem could be effectively treated by pac due to the large gap among the thresholds of various odor compounds the odor problem caused by the odor compound not only depends on its adsorption ability but also relies on its threshold an odor compound with high adsorption capacity but has extremely low threshold may not be reduced below its threshold on the contrary an odor compound with low adsorption capacity and high threshold may be easily treated by pac therefore new treatability assessment methods which could consider both the adsorption ability and the different thresholds needs to be developed in addition the effects of the properties of the odor compounds on the treatability by pac still need to be further understood in this study the adsorption of 14 odor compounds including 2 earthy musty 5 fishy 3 septic and 5 chemical odor compounds with pac were systematically investigated the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied and their adsorption capacity and performance were also compared in addition their treatability was evaluated in terms of a novel method considering adsorption ability and marginal effect the correlations among the adsorption capacity treatability and odor compounds properties were statistically analyzed to further understand the difference between odor compound adsorption and real odor removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the 14 odor compounds as shown in table 1 were all purchased from o2si america and their names abbreviations and thresholds are listed in table 1 nacl was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china and was calcined at 450 c for 2 h stock solutions of the 14 odor compounds were prepared in methanol hplc grade j t baker center valley pa usa all other solutions were prepared using deionized water di water the pac used in this study was a coal based activated carbon with an iodine value of 1000 mg g 1 which is a commonly used pac in water treatment plant due to its low cost zheng et al 2018 ningxia guanghua co ltd china the bet brunauer emmett teller surface areas and pore size distributions of pac sample were characterized by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms measured at 77 k using an autosorb quantachrome usa computer controlled surface analyzer the specific properties of the pac are as follows specific area is 1630 m2 g 1 average pore size is 4 25 nm total pore volume is 0 29 ml g 1 and micropore specific area is 518 57 m2 g 1 the micropores of the carbon are concentrated in the 2 3 nm width range as shown in fig 1 a the phpzc was determined by the indirect titration method matsui et al 2015 the phpzc is 10 05 as shown in fig 1 b the pac stock solution was prepared by dispersing 1 g activated carbon in 1 l di water 2 2 adsorption experiment and odor compound measurement prior to the adsorption experiment pac was washed with di water until a constant neutral ph about 7 50 of the filtrates was observed and then the carbon was dried at 105 c for 6 h in an oven isotherm experiments were conducted with a pac dosage from 0 to 100 mg l 1 in 40 ml glass bottles high pac dosage was applied to guarantee that high initial odor compound concentration could be reduced to below threshold and reach the adsorption limit the ph of the water samples in the adsorption experiment was varied from 6 90 to 7 30 the final ph at the end of 24 h was varied from 8 15 to 8 85 the initial concentration was set to 10 50 times the corresponding threshold instead of a unified concentration this could avoid the case in which an odor compound with a high threshold could more easily be reduced to its threshold deionized water spiked with odor compound was used here to make this study more concentrated on the odor compound itself and avoid the interference of other substances the adsorption time was 24 h at the end of the adsorption experiment the suspension was withdrawn by an injection syringe and filtered through a glass fiber membrane whatman gf c uk before the odor compound measurement and 10 ml water sample with addition of 3 0 g nacl was taken out for the odor compound measurement the odor compound concentration was determined immediately by using headspace solid phase microextraction spme combined with gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms shimadzu japan yu et al 2014 the conditions for gc were as follows the initial column temperature was 40 c with 3 min hold then increased to 240 c at a rate of 8 c min 1 the mass spectrometer conditions were as follows ionization voltage 70 ev ion source temperature 230 c full scan mode with a range of 20 300 m z and scan velocity of 0 20 scans second 1 the fragment ion and retention time of the 14 odor compounds are shown in table s1 2 3 data analysis 2 3 1 adsorption capacity the experimental data were fitted using different equilibrium models langmuir and freundlich model equations and constants are listed in ref li et al 2015 the actual adsorption capacity Œºg mg 1 qe was calculated according to the change of the concentration of the odor compounds before and after pac adsorption according to the following equation 1 q e c 0 c d p a c where c0 is the initial odor compound concentration Œºg l 1 c is the residual concentration at a certain pac dosage Œºg l 1 and dpac is the pac dosage mg l 1 2 3 2 the treatability assessment generally the concentration of the residual odor compounds after adsorption dramatically decreased with the dosage of pac and then leveled off typical concentration curves for the residual odor compounds are shown in fig 2 there are inflection points in these curves at which the decreasing trend starts to flatten in mathematics the inflection point of a differentiable function of one variable is a point on the graph of the function where the function s second derivative is zero therefore the inflection point was obtained by taking the second derivative of the curve then the treatability index ti of the odor compounds is calculated by the following equation 2 ti c t c ip c t where cip is the residual odor compound concentration at the inflection point Œºg l 1 and ct is the threshold concentration of the corresponding odor compound Œºg l 1 therefore it could be inferred that the ti value is smaller than 1 and a larger ti value indicates better treatability the treatability of the odor compounds is compared using the ti value as follows if the ti value is below zero the corresponding odor compound cannot be treated by pac t and the more negative values indicate worse performance if the ti value is between 0 and 1 the corresponding odor compound can be treated by pac t and the closer the ti value is to 1 the more easily the odor compound is treated by pac 2 3 3 correlation analysis the pearson correlation and spearman rank correlation analysis were employed to assess the correlations between treatability index or adsorption capacity and odor compounds properties 3 results and discussion as shown in fig 2 the residual concentrations of the 14 odor compounds gradually decreased with an increase in the pac dosage since there are large differences between the thresholds of these odor compounds for example the threshold for 24dcp is four orders of magnitude higher than that of the 2 4 6 tca comparing their adsorption at the same initial concentration is not reasonable the pac dosage ranged from 0 to 100 mg l 1 however for the tt24dda and 3mld adsorption processes though their initial concentrations of the odor compounds were relatively high among the 14 odor compounds the pac dosages were only 0 10 mg l 1 and 0 5 mg l 1 respectively it could be inferred that these two odor compounds were more easily adsorbed by pac than the other odor compounds and that only a small quantity of pac was needed to reduce the concentrations to levels below threshold or even the detection limit unlike tt24dda and 3mld deds and dmds exhibited different adsorption behaviors though their initial concentrations were relatively low their residual concentrations were all above their respective thresholds even when the pac dosage reached 100 mg l 1 the adsorption performance of these 14 odor compounds are systematically evaluated as follows 3 1 the adsorption capacity of odor compounds to further diagnose the nature of adsorption equilibrium the shape of the isotherm curves was fitted with two adsorption models as shown in fig 3 the calculated parameters and correlation coefficients r2 for the freundlich and langmuir models are listed in table 2 for the langmuir modeling with an exception for 3mld r2 0 880 all of the adsorption isotherm curves for the odor compounds were well fitted with the langmuir models r2 0 90 the maximum adsorption capacity qm for each odor compound was also predicted by the langmuir model as shown in table 2 however the predicted qm was not consistent with the visualized data as illustrated in fig 3 for example the qms of the 2 mib and 2 4 6 tca predicted by the langmuir model were only 0 04 Œºg g 1 and 0 03 Œºg g 1 respectively which were much smaller than those of the dmts 0 57 Œºg g 1 and dmds 0 33 Œºg g 1 however it could be noted from fig 2 that the residual concentrations of dmds and dmts were still above their respective thresholds 30 and 7 5 ng l 1 even when the pac dosage reached 100 mg l 1 while for the 2 mib and 2 4 6 tca they required less than 40 mg l 1 and 20 mg l 1 respectively to decrease their concentrations to levels below their thresholds 10 and 2 ng l 1 in addition the isotherm curves of these odor compounds were not leveling off thus the predicted qm values were not reliable the langmuir model assumes a monolayer adsorption onto a surface of uniform energy and no transmigration of the adsorbate on the adsorbent surface tan et al 2009 hamdaoui and naffrechoux 2007 the freundlich isotherm assumptions which assume that the stronger binding sites are occupied first and that the binding strength decreases with increasing site occupation degree are based on the hypothesis of heterogeneous adsorbent surface energy or heterogeneous adsorbent surfaces tan et al 2008 2009 above all the langmuir model could only predict the qm of each odor compound through an empirical formula thus the langmuir model was not the best choice to assess the treatability the freundlich model was also applied to analyze the adsorption of the odor compounds it could be noted with the exception of tt24hept the adsorption isotherm curves of the other odor compounds were well fitted with the freundlich model r2 0 930 implying a good predictability by this model generally the kf value in the freundlich model is an indicator of the adsorption capacity and 1 n is an indicator of the adsorption favorability however as depicted in table 2 the dmds had a low kf and a high 1 n value which was inconsistent with the data shown in fig 2 a lower kf value usually means a smaller adsorption capacity and a higher 1 n value generally represents odor compounds that prefer to be adsorbed there is a contradiction between the judgment from kf and 1 n in addition the xylene also achieved a very high kf value compared to other odor compounds including tt24dda and 3mld less than 5 mg l 1 pac was enough to reduce their concentration to below threshold levels therefore the freundlich model was also not very suitable to assess the odor compounds treatability since the qm predicted by the langmuir model is not reliable the actual adsorption capacity of various odor compound by pac at a very low pac dosage 2 mg l 1 was calculated by eq 1 and is shown in fig 4 however there are large differences in the adsorption capacities of the different odor compounds for the 2 mib 2 4 6 tca deds dmts dmds and b2ecp relatively low adsorption capacities were attained less than 100 Œºg g 1 while for the other odor compounds much higher adsorption capacities were achieved higher than 5000 Œºg l 1 although the 2 mib 2 4 6 tca and b2ecp were expected to attain low adsorption capacities in comparison with the other compounds the pac could still reduce the concentrations to levels below the threshold concentrations under reasonable dosages especially for b2ecp therefore the treatability evaluation of an odor compound should not only take consideration of its adsorption capacity but also involve the odor threshold above all the langmuir and freundlich models which could only predict the adsorption capacity are not enough to access the odor compound treatability therefore it is necessary to establish a comprehensive method which involves both the absorbability and threshold to evaluate whether the odor compound is suitable to be treated by pac adsorption and here we proposed a new method by evaluating the odor compound treatability through comparing the residual concentration and threshold at the inflection point and it will be further introduced in next section 3 2 the treatability assessment the treatability of the odor compounds was evaluated according to the abovementioned method using the ti value shown in table 3 for these 14 odor compounds there were only three odor compounds deds dmds and dtds which could not be treated by pac their residual concentrations were far higher than their threshold values especially dmts and dmds their residual concentrations were almost 3 times that of their corresponding threshold this result was in agreement with the previous study by vega et al that suggested that the adsorption of volatile sulfur compounds including dmds and dms by raw pac was limited and that the hno3 oxidation of pac could increase the adsorption ability vega et al 2013 cui et al also suggested that virgin activated carbon was not sufficient for the removal of sulfur compounds dmds ethyl disulfide etc and an ac modified with a function group and metal ion could increase the adsorption capacity for the sulfur compounds cui et al 2009 the previous study by bagreev found that dmds generally adsorbed in pores smaller than 50 √• and there is an apparent competition between the water and dmds for bond sites in a moist environment bagreev et al 2002 therefore the adsorption of dmds is limited in water except for the thio ethers odor compounds the pac could reduce the concentration of the odor compounds to below their corresponding threshold levels among them the ti value for 4tt24oda and 3mld are 1 which means that at the inflection point their residual concentrations are below the detection limit and these two odor compounds were very easily treated by pac the order of odor compounds according to their treatability are as follows tt24dda 3mld Œ≤ cyclo t2oa 2 4 6 tca 24dcp m xylene b2ecp 2 mib tt24oda tt24hetp deds dmds dmts this assessment method has taken into consideration the various thresholds and absorbability limitations of the odor compounds by pac allowing for a more reasonable evaluation of the treatability if the concentration at the inflection point of the residual odor compound is lower than its threshold it is suitable for treatment by pac adsorption if not it is not suitable for treatment by pac adsorption therefore if an odor compound has a relatively low absorbability but high threshold it could also be treated by pac however for odor compounds with a high absorbability but very low threshold pac adsorption only may be not enough to control the odor compounds to below threshold levels using the inflection point to access the pac adsorption performance could reflect whether pac adsorption is feasible for an odor compound treatment though a residual concentration could be decreased to below the threshold after the inflection point the pac adsorption could be not the best choice since after the inflection point only a small decrease of the odor compound concentration would cost large amount of pac which is not cost effective on the contrary before the inflection point the same dosage of pac would lead to relatively greater reduction of residual concentration of the odor compound if we could reduce the odor compound concentration below the threshold before the inflection point the sharp declination period the addition of pac is much more cost effective and it means that the odor compounds is suitable to be treated by pac otherwise if the odor compound could not be controlled before the inflection point it means that pac adsorption is not an economical method in this case and other technologies should be considered this method builds a link between treatability and adsorption capacity threshold and it is more appropriate to estimate the treatability of the odor compounds by pac above all this evaluation method could effectively assist the water wastewater treatment plants to assess if pac adsorption is suitable to treat an odor compound or to consider another technology 3 3 the correlation between the properties of the odor compounds and the adsorption performance the pearson correlation and spearman correlation analyses

atoms the most well known of which are poly 3 hydroxybutyrate and its copolymer with 3 hydroxyvalerate raza et al 2018 currently the industrial production of phas is performed by fermentation with pure cultures of bacteria and synthetic substrates but the costs of this method are a major obstacle to large scale commercial exploitation urtuvia et al 2014 a promising strategy for polyhydroxalkanoates production is the use of mixed microbial cultures mmc the advantages of this technology are the possibility of using wastes wastewater and industrial by products as feedstocks ease of process control because operating conditions can easily be changed and the natural selection of microorganisms which ensures stable long term operation serafim et al 2008 with these cultures it is not necessary to maintain sterile conditions which allows semi continuous systems to be used reducing the cost of the process reis et al 2011 so far cheese whey duque et al 2014 paper mill effluent jiang et al 2012 sugar cane molasses oehmen et al 2014 olive oil mill effluent campanari et al 2014 mixed food wastes amulya et al 2015 municipal wastewater morgan sagastume et al 2010 and bio oil moita et al 2014 have been investigated as feedstocks however the carbohydrates present in most of them are not a suitable source of carbon for pha production with mixed cultures of microorganisms because most species that use carbohydrates accumulate glycogen not phas karahan et al 2006 hence a pre fermentation step needs to be introduced into the pha production system to increase the content of volatile fatty acids vfas which are the main precursors for synthesis of phas so far however acid fermentation technologies have not provided stable concentrations and types of vfas in the liquid phase of digestate at technical scale because the vfa fraction strongly influences the composition of the monomers produced and the resulting properties of the accumulated polymers it can be difficult to obtain phas with a desirable structure and useful physical mechanical properties furthermore some of the agro industrial feedstocks for pha accumulation are only seasonally available or are used to make value added products other than phas it is also a practical challenge to locate regionally available sources of raw materials to make vfa rich feedstock and transporting these materials can be costly if they are dilute valentino et al 2017 crude glycerin is a feedstock for pha production that does not suffer from the drawbacks listed above it is a major by product of biodiesel plants and does not require prior fermentation there is a surplus of crude glycerin leading to a drop in its price due to a tremendous increase in biodiesel production worldwide the disposal of biodiesel derived glycerol creates problems with waste management and water pollution and can involve the expenditure of extra money sharma et al 2016 thus the conversion of crude glycerin into polyhydroxyalkanoates is an interesting alternative with advantages from the point of view of cost effectiveness using crude glycerin to produce phas rather than other value added products is desirable because of the global demand for biodegradable polymers that can replace petroleum based plastics with environmentally friendly and sustainable alternatives moreover the biocompatible nature of phas allows them to be used in applications like tissue engineering bioimplantation and pharmaceutical drug production brigham and sinskey 2012 however there are only several studies on utilizing crude glycerin as a feedstock for pha production moita et al 2014 found that crude glycerin can be efficiently converted to p 3hb by aerobic mixed cultures resulting in a polymer content of 47 cell dry weight however the volumetric productivity of this process was low 240 mg p 3hb l d those authors concluded that further studies are needed to improve the selection of cultures enriched with bacteria that have a high capacity for pha storage more recently freches and lemos 2017 optimized pha production by controlling the cycle length of an sbr and achieved a final content of 59 w w p 3hb although this is the highest pha content obtained with cultivation on crude glycerin so far it is still less than the content of 77 w w reported by jiang et al 2012 when using fermented paper mill effluent thus there is a need for more studies to optimize the operational and nutritional conditions of pha production when using crude glycerin as feedstock in particular although the results of dobroth et al 2011 suggest that pha synthesis on crude glycerin appeared to be stimulated by a macronutrient deficiency the combined effect of the crude glycerin concentration and the carbon to nitrogen ratio on pha accumulation when using mixed microbial cultures has not been investigated thus the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the crude glycerin concentration and the carbon to nitrogen ratio in the culture medium on pha production using response surface methodology an effective statistical and mathematical tool for determining the influence of many factors on one or several specific outcomes dong et al 2007 sharma et al 2007 the interactive effects of these variables on the percentage of phas in biomass the volumetric productivity and the observed coefficients of active biomass yield and pha yield were determined polynomial mathematical equations were developed incorporating these parameters of the pha accumulation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture medium preparation crude glycerin obtained from the biodiesel production plant at the elstar oils company malbork north poland was used as the feedstock according to the company the glycerin contained the following w w glycerol 80 0 85 0 ash nacl 7 0 m o n g monoglycerides diglycerides triglycerides methyl ester other organics 2 0 methanol 0 5 water balance one gram of crude glycerin dissolved in one liter of distilled water contained the following organics as cod 1134 mg o2 l and total phosphorus 0 3 mg p l ammonia and phosphates were not detected the culture medium was prepared by weighing an appropriate amount of crude glycerin to obtain three different concentrations of organics measured as cod 5000 9000 and 12000 mg o2 l this was supplemented with a mineral salt solution that was prepared according to serafim et al 2004 except for the fact that the ammonium nitrogen concentrations in the experiments differed in order to obtain five different carbon to nitrogen ratios c n 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 mg c mg n nh4 table 1 the crude glycerin and the mineral salt solution were dissolved in 1 l of distilled water 2 2 reactor operation the experiments were performed in a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr initially inoculated with activated sludge 4 l obtained from the municipal wastewater treatment plant the sludge was aerated in the absence of substrate for ca 24 h prior to reactor inoculation in order to regenerate biomass by allowing the microorganisms to consume stored phas as an endogenous carbon source the sbr working volume of 5 l was operated under aerobic conditions in cycles of 12 h the sbr cycle consisted of 2 min of feeding 11 h 56 min of both feast and famine phases and 2 min of excess biomass withdrawal the volume of excess biomass was the same as the volume of culture medium that was added no settling phase was performed in the experiment with a crude glycerin concentration in the culture medium of 5000 mg cod l the hydraulic retention time was 5 days in the remaining experiments the higher concentrations of crude glycerin made it necessary to reduce this time to 3 33 days in this way a similar biomass concentration was maintained at the beginning of the next cycle in all experiments the biomass retention time was equal to the hydraulic retention time in this way the organic loading rates olr in the following experiments were assumed to be 1 2 2 7 and 3 6 g cod l d the ph was maintained at 7 0 by an automatic ph stat system that added naoh and hcl solutions the reactor was operated at room temperature ca 20 23 c without temperature control air was supplied by an air pump through fine bubble diffusers and the dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained above 2 5 3 0 mg l during each cycle the reactor was stirred by a mechanical impeller at 100 rpm the experiments were conducted for 65 days 2 3 analytical methods each sbr cycle was monitored by measuring the organics ammonium nitrogen and biomass concentrations at the beginning and end of the cycle and at the end of the feast phase organics were analysed by measuring the chemical oxygen demand cod using the dichromate reflux method 5220 c apha 1992 ammonium nitrogen was analysed by distillation and titration 4500 nh3 b e apha 1992 and the biomass was expressed as volatile suspended solids vss and determined gravimetrically 2540 e apha 1992 phas were extracted from the biomass hydrolyzed and esterified to 3 hydroxyacyl methyl esters using the method described by comeau et al 1988 the methyl esters were analysed with a gas chromatograph varian cp 3800 usa equipped with a varian vf 5 ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm film thickness 0 25 Œºm according to the method described by oehmen et al 2005 the contents of 3 hydroxybutyrate 3hb and 3 hydroxyvalerate 3hv were determined using 3 hydroxybutyrate and 3 hydroxybutyrate co 12 3 hydroxyvalerate standards sigma aldrich the total content of pha polymer was calculated as the sum of 3hb and 3hv content 2 4 calculations the biomass was divided into a so called active fraction containing all cellular components synthesized by microorganisms excluding phas and a pha fraction according to serafim et al 2004 eq 1 1 c x c ba c pha where c x is the concentration of biomass mg codvss l c ba is the concentration of the active fraction of biomass mg codba l and c pha is the concentration of phas mg codpha l the concentration of both fractions was expressed in cod which allowed the concentrations of the active biomass fraction and of the 3hb and 3hv in phas to be expressed in the same units the active fraction of biomass was converted into cod using a conversion factor of 1 42 mg cod mg biomass likewise the pha fraction was converted into cod using conversion factors of 1 38 mg cod mg 3hb and 1 63 mg cod mg 3hv the conversion factors were calculated based on oxidation stoichiometry using formulas of c5h7no2 for biomass burniol figols et al 2018 c4h8o3 for 3hb and c5h10o3 for 3hv mino et al 1998 the content of phas in biomass x pha vss was calculated using this equation eq 2 2 x pha c pha c x 100 the observed coefficient of the yield of the active biomass fraction y obs ba mg codba mg cod was calculated using this formula eq 3 3 y obs ba v w c e ba c 0 c e v where c 0 and c e are the concentrations of organics at the beginning and the end of the sbr cycle respectively mg cod l c e ba is the concentration of active biomass at the end of the sbr cycle mg codba l v is the working volume of the sbr l and v w is the volume of biomass withdrawn from the sbr in the cycle l the observed coefficient of polyhydroxyalkanoate yield y obs pha mg codpha mg cod was calculated using the following formula eq 4 4 y obs pha v w c e pha c 0 c e v where c e pha is the concentration of phas at the end of the sbr cycle mg codpha l the volumetric productivity pr v mg codpha l d was calculated using the following equation eq 5 5 p r v c pha max v w v t c where c pha max is the maximum pha concentration mg codpha l and t c is the length of a single sbr cycle d 2 5 statistical analysis response surface methodology rsm was employed to analyse the effects of the crude glycerin concentration as mg cod l the carbon to nitrogen ratio as mg c mg n nh4 and their interaction during pha accumulation the observed coefficient of active biomass yield the observed coefficient of pha yield the content of phas in biomass and the volumetric productivity were modelled as responses a second order polynomial regression model was fit to the experimental data using the following equation eq 6 6 y a 0 œÉ a i x i œÉ a ii x i 2 œÉ a ij x i x j where y is the predicted response x i and x j are the predictor variables that were tested and a 0 a i a ii and a ij are the regression coefficients for the intercept linear and quadratic terms and the interaction between the predictor variables respectively azman et al 2016 however in this study the independent variables were coded as x 1 and x 2 thus the empirical model generated with the two studied variables can be defined as in eq 7 7 y a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 11 x 1 2 a 22 x 2 2 a 12 x 1 x 2 analysis of variance anova was performed on each model the coefficient of determination r 2 and adjusted r 2 were calculated to indicate the goodness of fit of the model the significance of the model equation and the regression coefficients were evaluated with f tests to estimate which variable had the most influence on the responses the concentrations of crude glycerin and the values of the c n ratio in the medium were normalized with the help of the mapminmax function in matlab nn toolbox the relationship between the response variables and the values of the predictor variables are visualized with three dimensional response surface plots statistical analysis of data was performed using statistica 13 1 software statsoft inc with the criteria for statistical significance set at p 0 05 response surface plots were also obtained using statistica software version 13 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio on consumption of organics fig 1 presents the load of organics consumed and the efficiency of their consumption at different concentrations of crude glycerin and c n ratios at a tested crude glycerin concentration the load of organics that was consumed was very similar at all tested c n ratios indicating that the c n ratio in the culture medium does not affect crude glycerin consumption by mixed consortia the load of organics consumed increased at higher crude glycerin concentrations in the culture medium when the crude glycerin concentration was increased from 5159 to 12147 mg cod l on average corresponding to organic loads of 5 16 and 18 2 g cod d on average the amount of organics consumed increased from 5 03 to 17 51 g cod d on average as a result the efficiency of organic consumption in all variants was high and ranged from 97 5 2 0 to 96 1 4 6 respectively fig 1 increasing the concentration of crude glycerin caused an increase in the concentration of the active biomass in the reactor although it was small compared to the increase in the concentration of crude glycerin in the culture medium and the increase in the olr values for example at a c n ratio of approximately 12 5 when the crude glycerin concentration was increased from 5168 to 12031 mg cod l the active biomass concentration changed from 3676 320 to 5145 490 mg codba l fig 2 villano et al 2010 varied the olr from 8 5 to 40 8 g cod l d while using a mixture of acetic and propionic acid at a ratio of 85 15 as a carbon source expressed as cod with the increase in the olr the biomass concentration increased from approx 2 5 to approx 11 g vss l thus an increase in the olr by a factor of 4 8 corresponded to an increase in biomass concentration by a factor of 4 4 however dionisi et al 2006 found that increasing the concentration of a 40 40 20 mixture of acetic lactic and propionic acid 3 7 fold based on the cod corresponded to a 2 2 fold increase in the biomass concentration in the reactor which is more similar to the changes observed in the present study one of the reasons why our results differ from those obtained by the cited authors could be the olr value in our study when the values of olr are low the ratio of energy consumed by microorganisms for basic metabolism to the amount consumed for growth processes is higher than when the olr values are high in addition when the olr is low a larger number of cells undergo lysis due to insufficient substrate supply hao et al 2010 another reason for the difference in the results of this study and others could be related to the uncoupling of energy production and microorganism growth it has been demonstrated that glycerol causes osmotic stress in bacteria due to the reduction of cell wall permeability and the disturbance of the transport of ions and metabolites da silva et al 2009 as a result of these disturbances a part of the atp produced must be consumed for non growth associated processes madigan et al 2003 thus in presence of crude glycerin microorganisms consume more energy for maintenance including osmotic regulation and the preservation of the correct intracellular ionic composition and ph ray and peters 2008 this uncoupling phenomenon may well explain why in the present study biomass growth was less at higher concentrations of crude glycerin in the culture medium even though the efficiency of organics removal was similar at all tested olrs 3 2 effect of crude glycerin concentration and c n ratio on the observed coefficients of active biomass y obs ba and pha y obs pha yield multiple regression was used to analyse the experimental results by fitting a quadratic polynomial model to examine the combined effects of crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio in the culture medium on y obs ba and y obs pha the equations with the best fit coefficients are given below 8 y obs ba 1 2618 1 5775 e 5 x 1 0 0781 x 2 2 3825 e 9 x 1 2 3 1149 x 2 2 4 1232 e 6 x 1 x 2 9 y obs pha 0 3781 9 2751 e 5 x 1 0 0294 x 2 5 207 e 9 x 1 2 0 0002 x 2 2 1 9856 e 6 x 1 x 2 where y obs ba is the coefficient of the observed yield of active biomass and y obs pha is the coefficient of the observed yield of phas as predicted by the crude glycerin concentration mg cod l x 1 and the c n ratio mg c mg n nh4 x 2 in the culture medium the anova results of the normalized quadratic models are shown in table 2 on the basis of the model f values of 86 97 for y obs ba and 121 42 for y obs pha the overall model was significant at p 0 05 the determination coefficient r 2 indicates the percentage of the total variation in the response variable that is associated with the variation in the predictor variables an r 2 value close to 1 is preferable and there should be reasonable agreement between the r 2 and adjusted r 2 values which indicates that the model has not been overfit to the data in the experimental sample as can be seen in table 2 both r 2 values were high indicating that the model fit the experimental data well table 3 when assessing the statistical significance of each regression coefficient p 0 05 was considered significant hong et al 2009 the crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio and the interaction of these two variables had significant linear effects on the observed coefficient of active biomass yield and that of pha yield with regard to the quadratic model terms the crude glycerin concentration had a significant effect on y obs pha whereas the c n ratio did not have a significant effect on either response the effect of individual variables and their interactions on the response is shown by the coefficients of the normalized variables presented in table 2 positive coefficient values indicate that an individual variable or its interaction with another variable positively affects the response whereas negative coefficient values indicate that increases in the predictor variables are associated with decreases in the response in the tested range the coefficient values in table 2 reveal that the y obs ba decreased with increases both variables while the y obs pha increased with increases in the c n ratio and decreased with increases in the crude glycerin concentration fig 3 shows three dimensional plots of the response surfaces of the predicted values of y obs ba and the y obs pha at different c n ratios and crude glycerin concentrations as can be seen in the figure the c n ratio had a stronger linear effect on y obs ba and y obs pha than the crude glycerin concentration this indicates that within the ranges tested in this study the c n ratio is more important in determining how much crude glycerin is converted to the active biomass fraction or to phas however the statistically significant interaction between these two variables indicates that the effect of the c n ratio on y obs ba and y obs pha is modulated by the crude glycerin concentration the linear decrease in y obs ba at increased c n ratios is clearly visible in fig 3a as could also be inferred from the significant linear terms and non significant quadratic terms of the equation in table 2 this effect of the c n ratio is likely due to the limited availability of nitrogen at high c n ratios as nitrogen is a structural macroelement necessary for the synthesis of cellular components cooper and hausman 2015 showed that lowering the nitrogen concentration in the culture medium reduces the growth rate of microorganisms or even inhibits growth processes the response surface also shows that the values of y obs ba decrease moderately as the concentration of crude glycerin increases this explains why the increase in the active biomass concentration in the reactor was proportionally lower than the increase in the crude glycerin concentration in the culture medium as discussed earlier fig 3b shows that y obs pha increased substantially at higher c n ratios and that this increase was linear not quadratic in contrast the curvature in the response of y obs pha to the crude glycerin concentration reflects the statistically significant effect of the quadratic term for this factor table 2 finally it can be seen that the linear response of y obs pha to the crude glycerin concentration is modulated by the c n ratio as also indicated by the significant interaction between these model terms table 2 the increased pha yields at lower c n ratios are consistent with the reports of other authors who found that higher pha yields can be achieved by nitrogen limitation under feast conditions together with a marked difference in substrate concentrations under feast and famine conditions johnson et al 2010 oliveira et al 2017 silva et al 2017 the conversion of crude glycerin to phas was highest at a crude glycerin concentration of 8954 mg cod l and a c n ratio of 15 9 table 3 this conversion was substantially higher than those reported by ntaikou et al 2018 0 12 mg codpha mg cod in fed batch culture mode with 2700 mg cod l of crude glycerin 25 c 60 h 200 rpm and by moita et al 2014 0 13 mg codpha mg cod feast and famine conditions 960 mg cod l of crude glycerin 24 h sbr cycle and similar to that reported by freches and lemos 2017 0 26 mg codpha mg cod feast and famine conditions 1600 mg cod l of crude glycerin 24 h sbr cycle there was a decrease in pha yield at higher crude glycerin concentrations at all tested c n ratios whereas there was little or no decrease in pha yields at lower crude glycerin concentrations and higher c n ratios fig 3b this indicates that an excess of substrate inhibited the conversion of crude glycerin to polyhydroxyalkanoates by the microorganisms this inhibitory effect could be due to the presence of sodium in the crude glycerin 7 0 w w palmeiro s√°nchez et al 2016 demonstrated that nacl has an inhibitory effect on pha accumulation when nacl was added to the reactor in their study the accumulation of phas by mixed microbial cultures grown on volatile fatty acid mixtures dropped from 51 3 to 8 4 dry weight similarly campos et al 2014 observed that pha production by cupriavidus necator declined at concentrations of crude glycerin containing 6 5 w w na above 15 g l thus in the present study the sodium contained in the crude glycerin could have negatively affected the physiology of the bacterial cells at the higher concentrations that were tested 3 3 effect of crude glycerin concentration and c n ratio on the content of phas in biomass x pha in terms of the real values of the coefficients of the second order polynomial equation for pha content in the biomass the equation is as follows 10 x pha 128 53 0 0097 x 1 14 492 x 2 6 4831 e 7 x 1 2 0 4607 x 2 2 0 0002 x 1 x 2 where x pha is the pha content in biomass vss x 1 is the crude glycerin concentration mg cod l and x 2 is the c n ratio mg c mg n nh4 in the culture medium this equation fit the experimental data well as shown by the high r 2 value 0 97 and the fit was statistically significant as shown by the p value of less than 0 0001 table 2 the r 2 value was similar to the adjusted r 2 value 0 96 indicating that the model was not overfit to the experimental data table 2 shows that the crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio had highly significant linear and quadratic effects on the percent content of phas in the biomass p 0 004 the model coefficients for the linear effects of the c n ratio and the crude glycerin concentration were both positive and the former was about four times larger than the latter in contrast the coefficients of the quadratic terms for these two factors were both negative and similar in magnitude the interaction between the linear terms was not statistically significant p 0 05 taken together these results indicate that the c n ratio has a larger effect on the amount of phas accumulated in the biomass than the crude glycerin concentration in order to visualize the empirical effects of the variables on the content of phas in biomass the empirical values of the model coefficients were used to generate three dimensional response surfaces the response surface plot is shown in fig 4 a at lower values of the c n ratio and the crude glycerin concentration x pha was small the shape of the response surface shows that although the interaction term in the model was not statistically significant a moderate interaction between the tested variables was observed in this experiment in addition the predicted values of x pha were not reliable at lower values of the c n ratio because the responses predicted by the model were less than zero the c n ratio in the culture medium had a substantial effect on the pha percentage in the biomass as can be seen in fig 4a when the c n ratio in the culture medium was increased from 8 3 to 17 4 the percentage of phas increased up to 55 6 and 57 2 vss at crude glycerin concentrations of 8954 and 12341 mg cod l respectively thus high pha content in the biomass was associated with low nitrogen concentration in the culture medium a similar trend was reported by dobroth et al 2011 who found that the pha content in the biomass increased from 11 to 18 to 20 55 vss when the concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the culture medium decreased from 786 to 393 mg n nh4 l the percentages of pha in biomass that were obtained in the present study table 3 are in the same range as those reported from studies with pure cultures teeka et al 2012 studied pha accumulation by novosphingobium genus isolated from biodiesel contaminated wastewater using crude glycerin as the sole carbon source they achieved a pha polymer content of 45 cell dry weight after 72 h of cultivation in mineral salt media supplemented with 2 w v crude glycerin cavalheiro et al 2009 reported accumulations of p 3hb up to 50 w w cell dry weight by cupriavidus necator dsm 545 cultivated with crude glycerin from a plant producing biodiesel from refined vegetable oils campos et al 2014 achieved a pha accumulation of approximately 65 w v cell dry weight using cupriavidus necator ipt 026 at 15 g l crude glycerin and 10 g l nitrogen ribeiro et al 2015 achieved a cell accumulation of 71 1 w v with cupriavidus necator ipt 027 and crude glycerin from the processing of biodiesel from residual fats and oils several studies have reported on the use of crude glycerin and mixed microbial cultures for production of polyhydroxyalkanoates ntaikou et al 2018 obtained a pha 3 hydroxybutyrate only content of 39 4 cell dry weight by using acidified waste glycerol with a high purity of 92 2 at 2700 mg cod l and an enriched microbial consortium derived from soil in fed batch mode culture moita et al 2014 reported a final polymer content of 47 dry weight after 14 pulses of crude glycerin at a concentration of 960 mg cod l in a batch production system more recently freches and lemos 2017 achieved a final content of 59 wt phas after 3 pulses of 1600 mg cod l crude glycerin and a culture selected with 1600 mg cod day and a 24 h sbr cycle length those authors used a post pha production step but the present study obtained similar results without this step furthermore as a pha concentration in biomass of at least 50 is one of the basic requirements for the profitability of pha recovery lee and choi 1998 the results of the present study are acceptable for industrial polymer manufacturing 3 4 effect of crude glycerin concentration and c n ratio on the volumetric productivity pr v the second order polynomial equation for the real volumetric productivity pr v is as follows 11 p r v 2939 28 0 2454 x 1 331 454 x 2 1 3623 e 5 x 1 2 11 5243 x 2 2 0 0011 x 1 x 2 where pr v is the volumetric productivity mg codpha l d x 1 is the crude glycerin concentration mg cod l and x 2 is the c n ratio mg c mg n nh4 in the culture medium the results of analysis of variance anova based on the normalized values are given in table 2 the overall model was statistically significant at p 0 0001 and 94 77 of the variability in the response can be attributed to variation in the two predictor variables r 2 value of 0 9477 which is close agreement with the adjusted r 2 value of 0 9332 both the crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio had significant linear effects on pr v and the effect of the c n ratio was much larger the interaction between these variables was not significant as fig 4b indicates the model predicted negative values for volumetric productivity at low c n ratios indicating that it is not accurate at these values the significant linear effects of the c n ratio and the crude glycerin concentration are reflected by the fact that the volumetric productivity increases as both predictor variables are increased from their lowest values at higher c n ratios and crude glycerin concentrations however the linear effects of these two predictors are dominated by their quadratic effects and volumetric productivity begins to decrease the fact that pr v values are highest at intermediate c n ratios and crude glycerin concentrations could be related to the fact that pr v is determined by both pha content in biomass and active biomass yield low biomass growth may have limited the volumetric productivity as y obs ba decreased at higher concentrations of crude glycerin in the culture medium increased activated biomass yield can be obtained by supplementing ammonium nitrogen but this increases the c n ratio which usually decreases pha content in biomass as shown by this study and others serafim et al 2004 johnson et al 2010 basak et al 2011 montiel jarillo et al 2017 in the present study the highest pr v value 757 3 mg codpha l d corresponding to 550 mg pha l d was obtained at 8954 mg cod l of crude glycerin and a c n ratio of 15 9 this value of pr v is nearly 2 3 times higher than that achieved by moita et al 2014 with the same type of substrate and it resulted from the higher pha content 55 6 vs 47 w w and yield of active biomass 0 29 vs 0 13 mg codpha mg cod in the present study the differences between studies may be due to differences in the composition of the crude glycerin that was used the crude glycerin used by moita et al consisted of 71 7 glycerol and 25 7 methanol whereas that used in the present study consisted of 80 85 glycerol and 0 5 methanol also the sbr in the present study was operated at a much higher olr 2 7 vs 0 6 g cod l d and a shorter sbr cycle 12 vs 24 h moreover pha accumulation in the present study was favored by using a higher c n ratio than moita et al 15 8 vs 10 7 mg c mg n nh4 3 5 type of pha accumulated table 4 presents the proportions of 3 hydroxyacids in the polymers that were accumulated when the content of phas in biomass was at maximum at c n ratios 7 5 the microorganisms accumulated phas that consisted mainly of 3 hydroxybutyrate 3hb with a small share of 3 hydroxyvalerate 3hv independent of the crude glycerin concentration in the culture medium this indicates that crude glycerin is a suitable feedstock for synthesis of short chain length phas moita et al 2014 reported that mixed microbial cultures accumulated p 3hb when crude glycerin containing 71 7 w w of glycerol and 25 7 w w of methanol was used as the carbon source similar results were obtained by dobroth et al 2011 using the methanol fraction of unrefined crude glycerin and by ntaikou et al 2018 with purified crude glycerin with a 92 2 w w glycerol content at the four lowest crude glycerin concentrations that were tested the content of 3 hydroxyvalerate increased from 1 0 to 26 0 mol when the c n ratio decreased from 12 3 to 4 8 indicating that the higher nitrogen contents in the culture medium favored accumulation of 3hv monomers a similar tendency was observed by bengtsson et al 2008 who studied pha accumulation from fermented paper mill wastewater under excess cod n 100 13 8 and limited cod n 100 0 03 nitrogen conditions when nitrogen was present in excess the content of 3hv was higher 69 mol pha content of 31 9 dry weight than under nitrogen deficiency 59 mol pha content of 44 0 dry weight 4 conclusions this study used response surface methodology to investigate the interactive effect of the crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio on pha accumulation by mixed microbial cultures the following conclusions were reached the conversion of crude glycerin into active biomass and phas was mostly affected by the c n ratio in the culture medium the volumetric productivity can be considerably increased by using a high c n ratio and an intermediate concentration of crude glycerin in the culture medium the maximum volumetric productivity was 550 mg pha l d which corresponded to an attractive accumulation of 55 6 vss and an observed coefficient of active biomass yield of 0 29 mg codba mg cod a volumetric productivity of over 600 mg codpha l d can be achieved with a combination of a crude glycerin concentration between 8000 and 9000 mg cod l and a c n ratio above 12 mg c mg n nh4 further increases in volumetric productivity will probably be achieved by improving the biomass active yield the accumulated phas were composed of mostly 3 hydroxybutyrate declaration of interests the authors declare that

introduction the attention of industry and research centers has focused on the development and improvement of methods for polyhydroxyalkanoates phas synthesis due to the exceptional functional properties of this biopolymer group short chain and medium chain length phas are accumulated by microorganisms short chain length phas contain 3 hydroxyacids with monomers of three to five carbon atoms the most well known of which are poly 3 hydroxybutyrate and its copolymer with 3 hydroxyvalerate raza et al 2018 currently the industrial production of phas is performed by fermentation with pure cultures of bacteria and synthetic substrates but the costs of this method are a major obstacle to large scale commercial exploitation urtuvia et al 2014 a promising strategy for polyhydroxalkanoates production is the use of mixed microbial cultures mmc the advantages of this technology are the possibility of using wastes wastewater and industrial by products as feedstocks ease of process control because operating conditions can easily be changed and the natural selection of microorganisms which ensures stable long term operation serafim et al 2008 with these cultures it is not necessary to maintain sterile conditions which allows semi continuous systems to be used reducing the cost of the process reis et al 2011 so far cheese whey duque et al 2014 paper mill effluent jiang et al 2012 sugar cane molasses oehmen et al 2014 olive oil mill effluent campanari et al 2014 mixed food wastes amulya et al 2015 municipal wastewater morgan sagastume et al 2010 and bio oil moita et al 2014 have been investigated as feedstocks however the carbohydrates present in most of them are not a suitable source of carbon for pha production with mixed cultures of microorganisms because most species that use carbohydrates accumulate glycogen not phas karahan et al 2006 hence a pre fermentation step needs to be introduced into the pha production system to increase the content of volatile fatty acids vfas which are the main precursors for synthesis of phas so far however acid fermentation technologies have not provided stable concentrations and types of vfas in the liquid phase of digestate at technical scale because the vfa fraction strongly influences the composition of the monomers produced and the resulting properties of the accumulated polymers it can be difficult to obtain phas with a desirable structure and useful physical mechanical properties furthermore some of the agro industrial feedstocks for pha accumulation are only seasonally available or are used to make value added products other than phas it is also a practical challenge to locate regionally available sources of raw materials to make vfa rich feedstock and transporting these materials can be costly if they are dilute valentino et al 2017 crude glycerin is a feedstock for pha production that does not suffer from the drawbacks listed above it is a major by product of biodiesel plants and does not require prior fermentation there is a surplus of crude glycerin leading to a drop in its price due to a tremendous increase in biodiesel production worldwide the disposal of biodiesel derived glycerol creates problems with waste management and water pollution and can involve the expenditure of extra money sharma et al 2016 thus the conversion of crude glycerin into polyhydroxyalkanoates is an interesting alternative with advantages from the point of view of cost effectiveness using crude glycerin to produce phas rather than other value added products is desirable because of the global demand for biodegradable polymers that can replace petroleum based plastics with environmentally friendly and sustainable alternatives moreover the biocompatible nature of phas allows them to be used in applications like tissue engineering bioimplantation and pharmaceutical drug production brigham and sinskey 2012 however there are only several studies on utilizing crude glycerin as a feedstock for pha production moita et al 2014 found that crude glycerin can be efficiently converted to p 3hb by aerobic mixed cultures resulting in a polymer content of 47 cell dry weight however the volumetric productivity of this process was low 240 mg p 3hb l d those authors concluded that further studies are needed to improve the selection of cultures enriched with bacteria that have a high capacity for pha storage more recently freches and lemos 2017 optimized pha production by controlling the cycle length of an sbr and achieved a final content of 59 w w p 3hb although this is the highest pha content obtained with cultivation on crude glycerin so far it is still less than the content of 77 w w reported by jiang et al 2012 when using fermented paper mill effluent thus there is a need for more studies to optimize the operational and nutritional conditions of pha production when using crude glycerin as feedstock in particular although the results of dobroth et al 2011 suggest that pha synthesis on crude glycerin appeared to be stimulated by a macronutrient deficiency the combined effect of the crude glycerin concentration and the carbon to nitrogen ratio on pha accumulation when using mixed microbial cultures has not been investigated thus the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the crude glycerin concentration and the carbon to nitrogen ratio in the culture medium on pha production using response surface methodology an effective statistical and mathematical tool for determining the influence of many factors on one or several specific outcomes dong et al 2007 sharma et al 2007 the interactive effects of these variables on the percentage of phas in biomass the volumetric productivity and the observed coefficients of active biomass yield and pha yield were determined polynomial mathematical equations were developed incorporating these parameters of the pha accumulation process 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture medium preparation crude glycerin obtained from the biodiesel production plant at the elstar oils company malbork north poland was used as the feedstock according to the company the glycerin contained the following w w glycerol 80 0 85 0 ash nacl 7 0 m o n g monoglycerides diglycerides triglycerides methyl ester other organics 2 0 methanol 0 5 water balance one gram of crude glycerin dissolved in one liter of distilled water contained the following organics as cod 1134 mg o2 l and total phosphorus 0 3 mg p l ammonia and phosphates were not detected the culture medium was prepared by weighing an appropriate amount of crude glycerin to obtain three different concentrations of organics measured as cod 5000 9000 and 12000 mg o2 l this was supplemented with a mineral salt solution that was prepared according to serafim et al 2004 except for the fact that the ammonium nitrogen concentrations in the experiments differed in order to obtain five different carbon to nitrogen ratios c n 5 7 5 10 12 5 and 15 mg c mg n nh4 table 1 the crude glycerin and the mineral salt solution were dissolved in 1 l of distilled water 2 2 reactor operation the experiments were performed in a laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor sbr initially inoculated with activated sludge 4 l obtained from the municipal wastewater treatment plant the sludge was aerated in the absence of substrate for ca 24 h prior to reactor inoculation in order to regenerate biomass by allowing the microorganisms to consume stored phas as an endogenous carbon source the sbr working volume of 5 l was operated under aerobic conditions in cycles of 12 h the sbr cycle consisted of 2 min of feeding 11 h 56 min of both feast and famine phases and 2 min of excess biomass withdrawal the volume of excess biomass was the same as the volume of culture medium that was added no settling phase was performed in the experiment with a crude glycerin concentration in the culture medium of 5000 mg cod l the hydraulic retention time was 5 days in the remaining experiments the higher concentrations of crude glycerin made it necessary to reduce this time to 3 33 days in this way a similar biomass concentration was maintained at the beginning of the next cycle in all experiments the biomass retention time was equal to the hydraulic retention time in this way the organic loading rates olr in the following experiments were assumed to be 1 2 2 7 and 3 6 g cod l d the ph was maintained at 7 0 by an automatic ph stat system that added naoh and hcl solutions the reactor was operated at room temperature ca 20 23 c without temperature control air was supplied by an air pump through fine bubble diffusers and the dissolved oxygen concentration was maintained above 2 5 3 0 mg l during each cycle the reactor was stirred by a mechanical impeller at 100 rpm the experiments were conducted for 65 days 2 3 analytical methods each sbr cycle was monitored by measuring the organics ammonium nitrogen and biomass concentrations at the beginning and end of the cycle and at the end of the feast phase organics were analysed by measuring the chemical oxygen demand cod using the dichromate reflux method 5220 c apha 1992 ammonium nitrogen was analysed by distillation and titration 4500 nh3 b e apha 1992 and the biomass was expressed as volatile suspended solids vss and determined gravimetrically 2540 e apha 1992 phas were extracted from the biomass hydrolyzed and esterified to 3 hydroxyacyl methyl esters using the method described by comeau et al 1988 the methyl esters were analysed with a gas chromatograph varian cp 3800 usa equipped with a varian vf 5 ms capillary column 30 m 0 25 mm film thickness 0 25 Œºm according to the method described by oehmen et al 2005 the contents of 3 hydroxybutyrate 3hb and 3 hydroxyvalerate 3hv were determined using 3 hydroxybutyrate and 3 hydroxybutyrate co 12 3 hydroxyvalerate standards sigma aldrich the total content of pha polymer was calculated as the sum of 3hb and 3hv content 2 4 calculations the biomass was divided into a so called active fraction containing all cellular components synthesized by microorganisms excluding phas and a pha fraction according to serafim et al 2004 eq 1 1 c x c ba c pha where c x is the concentration of biomass mg codvss l c ba is the concentration of the active fraction of biomass mg codba l and c pha is the concentration of phas mg codpha l the concentration of both fractions was expressed in cod which allowed the concentrations of the active biomass fraction and of the 3hb and 3hv in phas to be expressed in the same units the active fraction of biomass was converted into cod using a conversion factor of 1 42 mg cod mg biomass likewise the pha fraction was converted into cod using conversion factors of 1 38 mg cod mg 3hb and 1 63 mg cod mg 3hv the conversion factors were calculated based on oxidation stoichiometry using formulas of c5h7no2 for biomass burniol figols et al 2018 c4h8o3 for 3hb and c5h10o3 for 3hv mino et al 1998 the content of phas in biomass x pha vss was calculated using this equation eq 2 2 x pha c pha c x 100 the observed coefficient of the yield of the active biomass fraction y obs ba mg codba mg cod was calculated using this formula eq 3 3 y obs ba v w c e ba c 0 c e v where c 0 and c e are the concentrations of organics at the beginning and the end of the sbr cycle respectively mg cod l c e ba is the concentration of active biomass at the end of the sbr cycle mg codba l v is the working volume of the sbr l and v w is the volume of biomass withdrawn from the sbr in the cycle l the observed coefficient of polyhydroxyalkanoate yield y obs pha mg codpha mg cod was calculated using the following formula eq 4 4 y obs pha v w c e pha c 0 c e v where c e pha is the concentration of phas at the end of the sbr cycle mg codpha l the volumetric productivity pr v mg codpha l d was calculated using the following equation eq 5 5 p r v c pha max v w v t c where c pha max is the maximum pha concentration mg codpha l and t c is the length of a single sbr cycle d 2 5 statistical analysis response surface methodology rsm was employed to analyse the effects of the crude glycerin concentration as mg cod l the carbon to nitrogen ratio as mg c mg n nh4 and their interaction during pha accumulation the observed coefficient of active biomass yield the observed coefficient of pha yield the content of phas in biomass and the volumetric productivity were modelled as responses a second order polynomial regression model was fit to the experimental data using the following equation eq 6 6 y a 0 œÉ a i x i œÉ a ii x i 2 œÉ a ij x i x j where y is the predicted response x i and x j are the predictor variables that were tested and a 0 a i a ii and a ij are the regression coefficients for the intercept linear and quadratic terms and the interaction between the predictor variables respectively azman et al 2016 however in this study the independent variables were coded as x 1 and x 2 thus the empirical model generated with the two studied variables can be defined as in eq 7 7 y a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a 11 x 1 2 a 22 x 2 2 a 12 x 1 x 2 analysis of variance anova was performed on each model the coefficient of determination r 2 and adjusted r 2 were calculated to indicate the goodness of fit of the model the significance of the model equation and the regression coefficients were evaluated with f tests to estimate which variable had the most influence on the responses the concentrations of crude glycerin and the values of the c n ratio in the medium were normalized with the help of the mapminmax function in matlab nn toolbox the relationship between the response variables and the values of the predictor variables are visualized with three dimensional response surface plots statistical analysis of data was performed using statistica 13 1 software statsoft inc with the criteria for statistical significance set at p 0 05 response surface plots were also obtained using statistica software version 13 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio on consumption of organics fig 1 presents the load of organics consumed and the efficiency of their consumption at different concentrations of crude glycerin and c n ratios at a tested crude glycerin concentration the load of organics that was consumed was very similar at all tested c n ratios indicating that the c n ratio in the culture medium does not affect crude glycerin consumption by mixed consortia the load of organics consumed increased at higher crude glycerin concentrations in the culture medium when the crude glycerin concentration was increased from 5159 to 12147 mg cod l on average corresponding to organic loads of 5 16 and 18 2 g cod d on average the amount of organics consumed increased from 5 03 to 17 51 g cod d on average as a result the efficiency of organic consumption in all variants was high and ranged from 97 5 2 0 to 96 1 4 6 respectively fig 1 increasing the concentration of crude glycerin caused an increase in the concentration of the active biomass in the reactor although it was small compared to the increase in the concentration of crude glycerin in the culture medium and the increase in the olr values for example at a c n ratio of approximately 12 5 when the crude glycerin concentration was increased from 5168 to 12031 mg cod l the active biomass concentration changed from 3676 320 to 5145 490 mg codba l fig 2 villano et al 2010 varied the olr from 8 5 to 40 8 g cod l d while using a mixture of acetic and propionic acid at a ratio of 85 15 as a carbon source expressed as cod with the increase in the olr the biomass concentration increased from approx 2 5 to approx 11 g vss l thus an increase in the olr by a factor of 4 8 corresponded to an increase in biomass concentration by a factor of 4 4 however dionisi et al 2006 found that increasing the concentration of a 40 40 20 mixture of acetic lactic and propionic acid 3 7 fold based on the cod corresponded to a 2 2 fold increase in the biomass concentration in the reactor which is more similar to the changes observed in the present study one of the reasons why our results differ from those obtained by the cited authors could be the olr value in our study when the values of olr are low the ratio of energy consumed by microorganisms for basic metabolism to the amount consumed for growth processes is higher than when the olr values are high in addition when the olr is low a larger number of cells undergo lysis due to insufficient substrate supply hao et al 2010 another reason for the difference in the results of this study and others could be related to the uncoupling of energy production and microorganism growth it has been demonstrated that glycerol causes osmotic stress in bacteria due to the reduction of cell wall permeability and the disturbance of the transport of ions and metabolites da silva et al 2009 as a result of these disturbances a part of the atp produced must be consumed for non growth associated processes madigan et al 2003 thus in presence of crude glycerin microorganisms consume more energy for maintenance including osmotic regulation and the preservation of the correct intracellular ionic composition and ph ray and peters 2008 this uncoupling phenomenon may well explain why in the present study biomass growth was less at higher concentrations of crude glycerin in the culture medium even though the efficiency of organics removal was similar at all tested olrs 3 2 effect of crude glycerin concentration and c n ratio on the observed coefficients of active biomass y obs ba and pha y obs pha yield multiple regression was used to analyse the experimental results by fitting a quadratic polynomial model to examine the combined effects of crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio in the culture medium on y obs ba and y obs pha the equations with the best fit coefficients are given below 8 y obs ba 1 2618 1 5775 e 5 x 1 0 0781 x 2 2 3825 e 9 x 1 2 3 1149 x 2 2 4 1232 e 6 x 1 x 2 9 y obs pha 0 3781 9 2751 e 5 x 1 0 0294 x 2 5 207 e 9 x 1 2 0 0002 x 2 2 1 9856 e 6 x 1 x 2 where y obs ba is the coefficient of the observed yield of active biomass and y obs pha is the coefficient of the observed yield of phas as predicted by the crude glycerin concentration mg cod l x 1 and the c n ratio mg c mg n nh4 x 2 in the culture medium the anova results of the normalized quadratic models are shown in table 2 on the basis of the model f values of 86 97 for y obs ba and 121 42 for y obs pha the overall model was significant at p 0 05 the determination coefficient r 2 indicates the percentage of the total variation in the response variable that is associated with the variation in the predictor variables an r 2 value close to 1 is preferable and there should be reasonable agreement between the r 2 and adjusted r 2 values which indicates that the model has not been overfit to the data in the experimental sample as can be seen in table 2 both r 2 values were high indicating that the model fit the experimental data well table 3 when assessing the statistical significance of each regression coefficient p 0 05 was considered significant hong et al 2009 the crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio and the interaction of these two variables had significant linear effects on the observed coefficient of active biomass yield and that of pha yield with regard to the quadratic model terms the crude glycerin concentration had a significant effect on y obs pha whereas the c n ratio did not have a significant effect on either response the effect of individual variables and their interactions on the response is shown by the coefficients of the normalized variables presented in table 2 positive coefficient values indicate that an individual variable or its interaction with another variable positively affects the response whereas negative coefficient values indicate that increases in the predictor variables are associated with decreases in the response in the tested range the coefficient values in table 2 reveal that the y obs ba decreased with increases both variables while the y obs pha increased with increases in the c n ratio and decreased with increases in the crude glycerin concentration fig 3 shows three dimensional plots of the response surfaces of the predicted values of y obs ba and the y obs pha at different c n ratios and crude glycerin concentrations as can be seen in the figure the c n ratio had a stronger linear effect on y obs ba and y obs pha than the crude glycerin concentration this indicates that within the ranges tested in this study the c n ratio is more important in determining how much crude glycerin is converted to the active biomass fraction or to phas however the statistically significant interaction between these two variables indicates that the effect of the c n ratio on y obs ba and y obs pha is modulated by the crude glycerin concentration the linear decrease in y obs ba at increased c n ratios is clearly visible in fig 3a as could also be inferred from the significant linear terms and non significant quadratic terms of the equation in table 2 this effect of the c n ratio is likely due to the limited availability of nitrogen at high c n ratios as nitrogen is a structural macroelement necessary for the synthesis of cellular components cooper and hausman 2015 showed that lowering the nitrogen concentration in the culture medium reduces the growth rate of microorganisms or even inhibits growth processes the response surface also shows that the values of y obs ba decrease moderately as the concentration of crude glycerin increases this explains why the increase in the active biomass concentration in the reactor was proportionally lower than the increase in the crude glycerin concentration in the culture medium as discussed earlier fig 3b shows that y obs pha increased substantially at higher c n ratios and that this increase was linear not quadratic in contrast the curvature in the response of y obs pha to the crude glycerin concentration reflects the statistically significant effect of the quadratic term for this factor table 2 finally it can be seen that the linear response of y obs pha to the crude glycerin concentration is modulated by the c n ratio as also indicated by the significant interaction between these model terms table 2 the increased pha yields at lower c n ratios are consistent with the reports of other authors who found that higher pha yields can be achieved by nitrogen limitation under feast conditions together with a marked difference in substrate concentrations under feast and famine conditions johnson et al 2010 oliveira et al 2017 silva et al 2017 the conversion of crude glycerin to phas was highest at a crude glycerin concentration of 8954 mg cod l and a c n ratio of 15 9 table 3 this conversion was substantially higher than those reported by ntaikou et al 2018 0 12 mg codpha mg cod in fed batch culture mode with 2700 mg cod l of crude glycerin 25 c 60 h 200 rpm and by moita et al 2014 0 13 mg codpha mg cod feast and famine conditions 960 mg cod l of crude glycerin 24 h sbr cycle and similar to that reported by freches and lemos 2017 0 26 mg codpha mg cod feast and famine conditions 1600 mg cod l of crude glycerin 24 h sbr cycle there was a decrease in pha yield at higher crude glycerin concentrations at all tested c n ratios whereas there was little or no decrease in pha yields at lower crude glycerin concentrations and higher c n ratios fig 3b this indicates that an excess of substrate inhibited the conversion of crude glycerin to polyhydroxyalkanoates by the microorganisms this inhibitory effect could be due to the presence of sodium in the crude glycerin 7 0 w w palmeiro s√°nchez et al 2016 demonstrated that nacl has an inhibitory effect on pha accumulation when nacl was added to the reactor in their study the accumulation of phas by mixed microbial cultures grown on volatile fatty acid mixtures dropped from 51 3 to 8 4 dry weight similarly campos et al 2014 observed that pha production by cupriavidus necator declined at concentrations of crude glycerin containing 6 5 w w na above 15 g l thus in the present study the sodium contained in the crude glycerin could have negatively affected the physiology of the bacterial cells at the higher concentrations that were tested 3 3 effect of crude glycerin concentration and c n ratio on the content of phas in biomass x pha in terms of the real values of the coefficients of the second order polynomial equation for pha content in the biomass the equation is as follows 10 x pha 128 53 0 0097 x 1 14 492 x 2 6 4831 e 7 x 1 2 0 4607 x 2 2 0 0002 x 1 x 2 where x pha is the pha content in biomass vss x 1 is the crude glycerin concentration mg cod l and x 2 is the c n ratio mg c mg n nh4 in the culture medium this equation fit the experimental data well as shown by the high r 2 value 0 97 and the fit was statistically significant as shown by the p value of less than 0 0001 table 2 the r 2 value was similar to the adjusted r 2 value 0 96 indicating that the model was not overfit to the experimental data table 2 shows that the crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio had highly significant linear and quadratic effects on the percent content of phas in the biomass p 0 004 the model coefficients for the linear effects of the c n ratio and the crude glycerin concentration were both positive and the former was about four times larger than the latter in contrast the coefficients of the quadratic terms for these two factors were both negative and similar in magnitude the interaction between the linear terms was not statistically significant p 0 05 taken together these results indicate that the c n ratio has a larger effect on the amount of phas accumulated in the biomass than the crude glycerin concentration in order to visualize the empirical effects of the variables on the content of phas in biomass the empirical values of the model coefficients were used to generate three dimensional response surfaces the response surface plot is shown in fig 4 a at lower values of the c n ratio and the crude glycerin concentration x pha was small the shape of the response surface shows that although the interaction term in the model was not statistically significant a moderate interaction between the tested variables was observed in this experiment in addition the predicted values of x pha were not reliable at lower values of the c n ratio because the responses predicted by the model were less than zero the c n ratio in the culture medium had a substantial effect on the pha percentage in the biomass as can be seen in fig 4a when the c n ratio in the culture medium was increased from 8 3 to 17 4 the percentage of phas increased up to 55 6 and 57 2 vss at crude glycerin concentrations of 8954 and 12341 mg cod l respectively thus high pha content in the biomass was associated with low nitrogen concentration in the culture medium a similar trend was reported by dobroth et al 2011 who found that the pha content in the biomass increased from 11 to 18 to 20 55 vss when the concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the culture medium decreased from 786 to 393 mg n nh4 l the percentages of pha in biomass that were obtained in the present study table 3 are in the same range as those reported from studies with pure cultures teeka et al 2012 studied pha accumulation by novosphingobium genus isolated from biodiesel contaminated wastewater using crude glycerin as the sole carbon source they achieved a pha polymer content of 45 cell dry weight after 72 h of cultivation in mineral salt media supplemented with 2 w v crude glycerin cavalheiro et al 2009 reported accumulations of p 3hb up to 50 w w cell dry weight by cupriavidus necator dsm 545 cultivated with crude glycerin from a plant producing biodiesel from refined vegetable oils campos et al 2014 achieved a pha accumulation of approximately 65 w v cell dry weight using cupriavidus necator ipt 026 at 15 g l crude glycerin and 10 g l nitrogen ribeiro et al 2015 achieved a cell accumulation of 71 1 w v with cupriavidus necator ipt 027 and crude glycerin from the processing of biodiesel from residual fats and oils several studies have reported on the use of crude glycerin and mixed microbial cultures for production of polyhydroxyalkanoates ntaikou et al 2018 obtained a pha 3 hydroxybutyrate only content of 39 4 cell dry weight by using acidified waste glycerol with a high purity of 92 2 at 2700 mg cod l and an enriched microbial consortium derived from soil in fed batch mode culture moita et al 2014 reported a final polymer content of 47 dry weight after 14 pulses of crude glycerin at a concentration of 960 mg cod l in a batch production system more recently freches and lemos 2017 achieved a final content of 59 wt phas after 3 pulses of 1600 mg cod l crude glycerin and a culture selected with 1600 mg cod day and a 24 h sbr cycle length those authors used a post pha production step but the present study obtained similar results without this step furthermore as a pha concentration in biomass of at least 50 is one of the basic requirements for the profitability of pha recovery lee and choi 1998 the results of the present study are acceptable for industrial polymer manufacturing 3 4 effect of crude glycerin concentration and c n ratio on the volumetric productivity pr v the second order polynomial equation for the real volumetric productivity pr v is as follows 11 p r v 2939 28 0 2454 x 1 331 454 x 2 1 3623 e 5 x 1 2 11 5243 x 2 2 0 0011 x 1 x 2 where pr v is the volumetric productivity mg codpha l d x 1 is the crude glycerin concentration mg cod l and x 2 is the c n ratio mg c mg n nh4 in the culture medium the results of analysis of variance anova based on the normalized values are given in table 2 the overall model was statistically significant at p 0 0001 and 94 77 of the variability in the response can be attributed to variation in the two predictor variables r 2 value of 0 9477 which is close agreement with the adjusted r 2 value of 0 9332 both the crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio had significant linear effects on pr v and the effect of the c n ratio was much larger the interaction between these variables was not significant as fig 4b indicates the model predicted negative values for volumetric productivity at low c n ratios indicating that it is not accurate at these values the significant linear effects of the c n ratio and the crude glycerin concentration are reflected by the fact that the volumetric productivity increases as both predictor variables are increased from their lowest values at higher c n ratios and crude glycerin concentrations however the linear effects of these two predictors are dominated by their quadratic effects and volumetric productivity begins to decrease the fact that pr v values are highest at intermediate c n ratios and crude glycerin concentrations could be related to the fact that pr v is determined by both pha content in biomass and active biomass yield low biomass growth may have limited the volumetric productivity as y obs ba decreased at higher concentrations of crude glycerin in the culture medium increased activated biomass yield can be obtained by supplementing ammonium nitrogen but this increases the c n ratio which usually decreases pha content in biomass as shown by this study and others serafim et al 2004 johnson et al 2010 basak et al 2011 montiel jarillo et al 2017 in the present study the highest pr v value 757 3 mg codpha l d corresponding to 550 mg pha l d was obtained at 8954 mg cod l of crude glycerin and a c n ratio of 15 9 this value of pr v is nearly 2 3 times higher than that achieved by moita et al 2014 with the same type of substrate and it resulted from the higher pha content 55 6 vs 47 w w and yield of active biomass 0 29 vs 0 13 mg codpha mg cod in the present study the differences between studies may be due to differences in the composition of the crude glycerin that was used the crude glycerin used by moita et al consisted of 71 7 glycerol and 25 7 methanol whereas that used in the present study consisted of 80 85 glycerol and 0 5 methanol also the sbr in the present study was operated at a much higher olr 2 7 vs 0 6 g cod l d and a shorter sbr cycle 12 vs 24 h moreover pha accumulation in the present study was favored by using a higher c n ratio than moita et al 15 8 vs 10 7 mg c mg n nh4 3 5 type of pha accumulated table 4 presents the proportions of 3 hydroxyacids in the polymers that were accumulated when the content of phas in biomass was at maximum at c n ratios 7 5 the microorganisms accumulated phas that consisted mainly of 3 hydroxybutyrate 3hb with a small share of 3 hydroxyvalerate 3hv independent of the crude glycerin concentration in the culture medium this indicates that crude glycerin is a suitable feedstock for synthesis of short chain length phas moita et al 2014 reported that mixed microbial cultures accumulated p 3hb when crude glycerin containing 71 7 w w of glycerol and 25 7 w w of methanol was used as the carbon source similar results were obtained by dobroth et al 2011 using the methanol fraction of unrefined crude glycerin and by ntaikou et al 2018 with purified crude glycerin with a 92 2 w w glycerol content at the four lowest crude glycerin concentrations that were tested the content of 3 hydroxyvalerate increased from 1 0 to 26 0 mol when the c n ratio decreased from 12 3 to 4 8 indicating that the higher nitrogen contents in the culture medium favored accumulation of 3hv monomers a similar tendency was observed by bengtsson et al 2008 who studied pha accumulation from fermented paper mill wastewater under excess cod n 100 13 8 and limited cod n 100 0 03 nitrogen conditions when nitrogen was present in excess the content of 3hv was higher 69 mol pha content of 31 9 dry weight than under nitrogen deficiency 59 mol pha content of 44 0 dry weight 4 conclusions this study used response surface methodology to investigate the interactive effect of the crude glycerin concentration and the c n ratio on pha accumulation by mixed microbial cultures the following conclusions were reached the conversion of crude glycerin into active biomass and phas was mostly affected by the c n ratio in the culture medium the volumetric productivity can be considerably increased by using a high c n ratio and an intermediate concentration of crude glycerin in the culture medium the maximum volumetric productivity was 550 mg pha l d which corresponded to an attractive accumulation of 55 6 vss and an observed coefficient of active biomass yield of 0 29 mg codba mg cod a volumetric productivity of over 600 mg codpha l d can be achieved with a combination of a crude glycerin concentration between 8000 and 9000 mg cod l and a c n ratio above 12 mg c mg n nh4 further increases in volumetric productivity will probably be achieved by improving the biomass active yield the accumulated phas were composed of mostly 3 hydroxybutyrate declaration of interests the authors declare that

18919,rheological properties are important in the design and operation of sludge handling process despite this the rheology of sludge in thermal hydrolysis processes th is not well described in situ

rheological parameters high shear viscosity Œ∑ i consistency index k i and yield stress œÉ c i under various treatment conditions which are useful for design of process units the equations enable convenient estimation of in situ properties based on ambient rheological measurements results suggested that the proportion of sludge solubilization and its rate were unaffected by varying sludge concentration thermally treated sludge still exhibited gel like viscoelastic characteristics similar to untreated sludge however the storage g and loss g moduli decreased with higher treatment temperatures frequency and creep responses were described by a fractional derivatives kelvin voigt fkv model which showed increasing viscous characteristics of treated sludge these equations can be utilised in cfd models results obtained from oscillatory measurements can also approximate steady shear behaviour by comparing dynamic viscosity Œ∑ œâ and steady shear viscosity Œ∑ Œ≥ whose values were very similar this enables convenient estimation of steady shear behaviour of sludge from oscillatory measurements which is found to be a non destructive technique for measuring flow behaviour of

desirable physical or chemical changes in wastewater sludge one major application is in anaerobic digestion where th is used as pre treatment to overcome the rate limiting hydrolysis step showing favourable results and successful industrial scale application barber 2016 carr√®re et al 2010 sapkaite et al 2017 zhen et al 2017 in these processes particulate organic matter is solubilized through application of heat for a defined period this disintegrates cellular material to release organic compounds which improves microorganism access to them thus enhancing anaerobic digestion performance ariunbaatar et al 2014 su√°rez iglesias et al 2017 besides that th leads to advantageous rheological enhancements for example the viscosity of thermally treated sludge is greatly reduced which improves the efficiency of pumping mixing heating digester loading and sludge dewaterability farno et al 2017 morgan sagastume et al 2011 p√©rez elvira et al 2008 p√©rez elvira and fdz polanco 2012 zhou et al 2013 rheology plays an important role in the design and operation of sludge handling systems dentel 1997 eshtiaghi et al 2013 despite extensive research on sludge th detailed studies related to its rheology are scarce barber 2016 accordingly detailed characterization of sludge flow behaviour during th and its viscoelastic properties is of interest and can lead to better implementation of th processes waste activated sludge was is the main sludge type handled in th processes its rheology at ambient conditions has been well researched eshtiaghi et al 2013 ratkovich et al 2013 was rheology is generally accepted to behave as a non newtonian shear thinning fluid commonly described by the herschel bulkley model it exhibits thixotropic properties guibaud et al 2004 and many studies identified the presence of yield stress farno et al 2015 markis et al 2014 ratkovich et al 2013 besides was exhibits viscoelasticity meaning that it initially shows solid like behaviour under stress but liquid like behaviour upon breakdown of floc structure furthermore the rheological properties of was become more significant at high solids concentrations a few studies described the flow behaviour of was after th herschel bulkley flow behaviour has been reported 170 c 60 min th for 5 4 18 7 wt was feng et al 2014a but newtonian behaviour was also reported such as feng et al 2014b 170 c 60 min th for 5 4 wt was and urrea et al 2015 160 200 c th of 2 3 wt was however these studies were mainly concerned with post thermally treated sludge measured at ambient conditions which can deviate by up to 80 compared to in situ measurements hii et al 2017 in situ characterization of was flow behaviour has been shown by farno et al 2016a who reported the apparent viscosity and herschel bulkley parameters were dependent on treatment duration and temperature however their study was limited to low temperature thermal processes 50 80 c 1 h recently hii et al 2017 characterized in situ was flow behaviour 80 145 c 1 h th but was limited to one concentration of sludge due to viscosity reduction higher concentrations of feed sludge are desirable in th allowing higher organic loading rates in anaerobic digesters morgan sagastume et al 2011 then its impact on th rheology must be considered for untreated sludge the effect of solids concentration on sludge viscosity and consistency index has been shown following an exponential function guibaud et al 2004 markis et al 2014 sanin 2002 tixier et al 2003 or power law model lotito et al 1997 markis et al 2014 whereas yield stress follows exponential guibaud et al 2004 mori et al 2006 or power law relationship forster 2002 lotito et al 1997 markis et al 2014 for thermally treated was an exponential relationship has been described for apparent viscosity and consistency index feng et al 2014a in another study yield stress has been described following exponential relationship with concentration whereas the consistency index and flow index followed a polynomial function of third and second order respectively urrea et al 2015 however it has not been shown whether the same relationship exists during th viscoelastic properties have been reported for thermally treated was generally the storage g and loss moduli g reduced as a result of th and g g farno et al 2016a feng et al 2014a zhang et al 2017 although some studies also suggest g g at low concentrations 0 8 wt feng et al 2014a 2014b however feng et al 2014a and feng et al 2014b did not examine the impact of varying treatment temperature whereas farno et al 2016b was related to low temperature 50 80 c thermal sludge processing zhang et al 2017 characterized the viscoelastic properties of was 14 2 and 18 2 wt after low 60 90 c and high temperature 120 180 c th a kay bernstein kearsley zappa kbkz model described the viscoelastic properties however their study was concerned with polyacrylamide pam conditioned sludge which alters flocculation and network structure furthermore farno et al 2018 have shown that a fractional derivatives kelvin voigt model was more representative for sludge viscoelasticity but was limited to lower thermal treatment temperatures 80 c and sludge concentrations 6 1 wt the current study expands the in situ rheological characterization of was during th for various sludge concentrations evaluating the impact of sludge concentration temperature and treatment time empirical equations are derived describing changes in the apparent viscosity yield stress and consistency index during th at various sludge concentrations furthermore the viscoelastic properties of the raw and thermally treated was are investigated the results from viscoelastic measurements are fitted to a fractional derivates kelvin voigt model which has not been attempted before for high temperature thermally treated sludge finally the adaptability of dynamic measurements to obtaining steady shear data is evaluated assessing its potential for overcoming the practical challenges related to the steady shear flow measurement of highly concentred sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge samples of was were collected at initial solids concentration 3 5 wt from mount martha wastewater treatment plant in victoria australia where dissolved air flotation without polymer dosing is used to thickened sludge the sludge was stored at 4 c for 30 days before use to ensure minimal changes due to biological activity during experiments and to help maintain the stability and consistency between samples curvers et al 2009 to achieve different concentrations sludge was first thickened via centrifugation at 9000 rpm 13 700 g then it was diluted to 7 9 12 and 13 wt by mixing the centrifuged sludge with the original sludge total solids concentration wt was determined gravimetrically by drying samples to constant mass at 105 c apha 1992 2 2 in situ flow behaviour measurement all rheological measurements were performed using a stress controlled rheometer dhr 3 ta instruments for in situ rheological measurements a pressure cell attachment was used which operates based on cup and bob geometry 26 mm bob diameter 28 mm cup diameter the pressure cell is an enclosed system allowing rheological measurements at elevated temperature and pressure mimicking th conditions steady flow curves were generated to describe the in situ flow behaviour of sludge following protocols established in hii et al 2017 samples were heated to desired constant temperature 80 100 120 130 and 140 c then flow curves were generated periodically over 60 min nitrogen gas was used to pressurize the system to 5 bar ensuring sludge remained in the liquid state raw rheometer outputs are published at hii and eshtiaghi 2017 herschel bulkley fitting parameters were obtained using a master flow curve supplementary fig s2 development and usage of this master curve are as described in hii et al 2017 with corresponding shift factors presented in supplementary tables s1 and s2 2 3 oscillatory viscoelastic measurement in situ measurements produced unreliable results when using the pressure cell in dynamic mode this was likely caused by high inertial forces produced in the bob which connects to the rheometer via magnetic coupling therefore viscoelastic analysis was carried out using parallel plate geometry 40 mm diameter 1 mm gap 25 c on untreated and post thermal treatment sludge 7 9 and 12 wt strain sweep tests were performed at 10 rad s frequency sweep tests were performed at angular frequency range 1 100 rad s at constant 0 1 strain which was within the linear viscoelastic region lve for all samples tested creep tests were performed by applying step stress and recording the strain over 180 s flow curves were also generated and stress ramps were performed to determine sample yield stresses via the tangent cross over method farno et al 2016a mezger 2006 prior to each measurement samples were pre sheared at 1000 s 1 for 5 min followed by 2 min equilibration at rest parallel plates were lined with sandpaper 400 grit to eliminate slippage and thermally treated samples were obtained using a separate 100 ml reactor parr instrument company rheometer raw data for oscillatory measurements are published in hii and eshtiaghi 2018 2 4 viscoelastic modelling a fractional derivatives kelvin voigt fkv model was fitted to viscoelastic data to allow calculation of viscoelastic parameters this model has so far been used to describe thermally treated sludge but only at low treatment temperatures below 80 c farno

2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ flow behaviour as shown in fig 1 a and b sludge flow curves varied with treatment duration and temperature this was true for all concentrations of sludge studied 7 13 wt despite elevated temperatures 80 140 c was behaviour was best described by the herschel bulkley model 5 œÉ œÉ c k Œ≥ n where œÉ is the shear stress pa œÉ c is the yield stress pa Œ≥ is the shear rate s 1 k is the consistency index pa sn and n is the flow index sludge exhibited yield stress and shear thinning behaviour for the entire 1 h th contrary to other studies feng et al 2014b urrea et al 2015 newtonian behaviour was not observed although it is noted that those studies were performed at higher treatment temperatures 160 c furthermore sludge concentrations used in the current study were also higher which tends to increase non newtonian behaviour slatter 1997 during th it is believed the elevated temperatures result in the destruction of floc structure and solubilization of sludge organic matter as seen in fig 1b there is distinct difference between the flow curves of 80 c and 130 c at the same solid concentration this solubilization destroys the structural integrity of the sludge and releases bound water neyens et al 2004 which result in the observed rheological changes then fig 1a suggests the action leading to sludge s physical changes is a time dependent process the evolution of was apparent viscosity with treatment duration is shown in fig 2 where Œ∑ i is the apparent viscosity of was at elevated th conditions measured at 600 s 1 maximum shear rate in the pressure cell at constant temperature Œ∑ i decreased rapidly initially 10 15 min then gradually plateauing towards the end of the treatment period this trend was best described as a logarithmic decrease similar to previously shown for 7 was hii et al 2017 notably the same curve trends were observed for all sludge concentrations studied this is seen clearer in fig 2 inset showing the normalized apparent viscosity Œ∑ i Œ∑ 0 for different concentrations 7 13 the same observation was also valid for the herschel bulkley parameters k and œÉ c not shown a chi square test was performed on Œ∑ i Œ∑ 0 k i k 0 and œÉ c i œÉ c 0 at constant time and temperature comparing between different sludge concentrations and it showed insignificant difference of the values between different sludge concentrations Œ± 0 05 p 0 99 this suggests the rate and extent of solubilization in the sludge was constant and independent of concentration this is consistent with imbierowicz and chacuk 2012 who showed the kinetics of sludge solubilization are independent of concentration higher sludge concentrations only lead to higher internal friction and hence greater shear stresses observed at constant treatment time sludge rheological parameters were described by linear relationship with temperature an arrhenius style relationship was considered unsuitable since it assumes constant activation energy which would not be the case in time dependent sludge thermal treatment farno et al 2014 baudez et al 2013 as shown in fig 3 inset Œ∑ i of was decreased linearly at all studied concentrations the same was also observed for k i and œÉ c i refer to supplementary fig s1 in fact the impact of temperature on the extent of Œ∑ i k i and œÉ c i reduction were comparable for all studied concentrations showing nearly constant curve slopes in fig 3 this suggests sludge concentration did not control the extent of sludge solubilization this was verified using a chi square test Œ± 0 05 to compare the decrease in Œ∑ i Œ∑ 0 k i k 0 and œÉ c i œÉ c 0 as a function of temperature between different sludge concentrations showing insignificant variation p 0 99 across all comparisons at constant temperature and treatment time the increasing trends of Œ∑ i k i and œÉ c i with sludge concentration were described by power law relationship this is shown for the normalized Œ∑ i and œÉ c i in fig 4 before and after th total solids concentration of was was measured verifying that it remained constant although fig 4 only showed rheological data measured at 60 min the same power law relationship was observed at any time during th this is consistent with the power law relationship observed at ambient conditions for untreated was between apparent viscosity yield stress and consistency index with solids concentration forster 2002 lotito et al 1997 markis et al 2014 sanin 2002 tixier et al 2003 this means the impact of increasing sludge concentration on its rheology are not diminished even at elevated th temperatures it is suspected with increasing sludge concentration the fundamental actions governing the intensification of viscous forces e g viscosity and yield stress remain the same between untreated was at ambient conditions and thermally treated was at elevated temperatures as sludge solids content increased the increasing strength of particle interactions lead to higher viscous forces markis et al 2016 the change in Œ∑ i pa s k i pa sn and œÉ c i pa at any temperature and time during 60 min th can be described as follows considering the logarithmic time dependent behaviour and linear relationship with temperature 6 Œ∑ i Œ∑ 7 0 a 1 t b 1 ln t c 1 7 k i k 7 0 a 2 t b 2 ln t c 2 8 œÉ c i œÉ c 7 0 a 3 t b 3 ln t c 3 where t is the sludge temperature c t is the treatment time min Œ∑ 7 0 is the high shear viscosity of 7 wt untreated was measured at 600 s 1 at 25 c k 7 0 is the consistency index of 7 wt untreated was at 25 c œÉ c7 0 is the yield stress of 7 wt untreated was at 25 c and a 1 3 and b 1 3 are fitting parameters and c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the Œ∑ i Œ∑ 7 0 k i k 7 0 and œÉ c i œÉ c7 0 respectively at time 0 min i e when sludge just reaches treatment temperature a 1 3 b 1 3 and c 1 3 can be related to the solids concentration of sludge using the following equation 9 f œÜ y œÜ z where f œÜ can represent any of the coefficients a 1 3 b 1 3 b 2 and c 1 3 œÜ is the solids concentration of sludge wt wt y and z are power law fitting parameters which can be taken from table 1 the coefficients a 1 3 b 1 3 b 2 and c 1 3 showed power law relation with solids concentration this is consistent with the power law relationship for the herschel bulkley parameters with sludge concentration observed in fig 4 equations 6 8 can be used to estimate in situ the apparent viscosity and herschel bulkley parameters of was 7 13 wt during th at different time of treatment based on untreated 7 was at 25 c regression statistics and correlation analysis of parameters are presented in table a1 the accuracy was higher in the range of 80 130 c with 4 12 mean percentage error mape of estimated values across this temperature range but the accuracy decreased significantly at 140 c this is because at 140 c rheological changes were seemingly less time dependent compared to the lower temperatures 80 130 c that is rheological values plateaued much earlier therefore the logarithmic coefficients in equations 6 8 would underestimated at 140 c zhang et al 2017 have shown for low temperature th 100 c treatment time was the dominant factor influencing sludge rheological behaviour while the temperature was the dominant factor for high temperature th 100 c furthermore bougrier et al 2008 suggested that a threshold temperature 150 c existed whereby increasing th temperatures beyond 150 c would cause insignificant apparent viscosity reduction of sludge as such the rheological changes have likely approached a limit the impact of raising treatment temperature to 140 c was also diminished in all cases in situ values were 50 80 lower than respective ambient counterparts depending on th temperature table a2 this means ambient rheological measurements of treated sludge may be scaled accordingly to represent in situ values notably the extent of reduction from ambient values to in situ values remained relatively constant at varying sludge concentrations for example the in situ high shear viscosity of 7 13 wt sludge at 100 c was between 0 4 and 0 5 of ambient values equations 10 and 11 correlate the in situ Œ∑ and œÉ c to ambient values this allows quick estimation of in situ rheological properties based on ambient measurements of th sludge when on line rheological measurements are not possible 10 Œ∑ i Œ∑ f 0 0055 t 1 r m s e 0 06 11 œÉ c i œÉ c f 0 0036 t 1 r m s e 0 08 where Œ∑ i is the in situ high shear viscosity pa s of was at 60 min treatment time Œ∑ f is the high shear viscosity pa s of was after thermal hydrolysis measured at 25 c œÉ c i is the in situ yield stress pa and œÉ c f is the yield stress of thermally treated was measured at 25 c equation 10 can also be used to estimate the consistency index by replacing Œ∑ i and Œ∑ f with the in situ consistency index k i and the consistency index of thermally treated was measured at 25 c k f respectively 3 2 viscoelastic behaviour strain sweep results fig 5 compare deformation behaviour before and after th as well as changes in g and g for both untreated and thermally treated samples was exhibited linear viscoelastic deformation at low strain values with g g indicating gel like behaviour then with increasing strain the rate of change in g and g became increasingly strain dependent where both moduli decreased rapidly until a crossover point was reached then g g the viscous characteristics of the sludge are then dominant and sludge exhibits irreversible deformation or flow this general behaviour was observed for all concentrations 7 12 wt of untreated and thermally treated 100 140 c was examined these results are consistent with those reported in farno et al 2016b and zhang et al 2017 for different sludge concentrations and treatment conditions interestingly the abovementioned studies reported presence of a g peak which was largely absent in the current study instead the g curves for all untreated and thermally treated sludge transitioned smoothly into the viscous region without rising above its plateau values this difference compared to farno et al 2016b is likely due to the higher sludge concentrations used in the current study as compared to theirs 3 5 6 1 wt on the other hand the sludge used by zhang et al 2017 had higher concentration 14 2 and 18 2 wt but was conditioned with pam which significantly affects its network structure wang et al 2017a shrinkage of the lve region due to th 170 c 60 min has been reported in treated sludge feng et al 2014b here a similar observation was made for the 7 wt and 9 wt treated sludge where the yielding strain range difference between the cross over strain and the critical strain values decreased by 15 35 following a linear relationship with th temperature this reflects the temperature dependent destruction of the sludge structure as indicated by decreasing g with temperature fig 6 inset causing it to flow more readily at lower strains g and g exhibited minor frequency dependence in the lve region showing slight increase with angular velocity as seen in fig 6 across the whole frequency range g g for all concentrations of sludge regardless of thermal treatment the moduli do not cross over at any point in the range of frequencies examined in fact the loss factor tanŒ¥ g g largely remained constant this behaviour is characteristic of weak gels rao and cooley 1992 and reflects the presence of biopolymers in sludge this means in the lve range sludge exhibited physical network structure mezger 2006 which remained relatively constant in the entire frequency range due to th the gel network of biopolymers is deteriorated which leads to reduction in g and g fig 6 inset but a gel network remained regardless zhang et al 2017 used kbkz to describe the viscoelastic behaviour of thermally treated sludge however farno et al 2018 showed the fkv model can be more realistic and accurate due to the fractional element in the model which describes the intermediate characteristics between purely viscous and purely elastic elements here frequency sweep results could be very well described by the fkv model equations 2 and 3 with fitting curves predicting experimental data shown as continuous lines in fig 6 the corresponding fitting parameters as well as fitting error are presented in table 2 e 1 and e 2 are model constants representing responses of the fractional and elastic elements in equation 1 respectively both e 1 and e 2 linearly decreased with treatment temperature except for 12 wt untreated sludge 25 c in the case of 12 wt untreated sludge e 1 was inconsistently low and e 2 was exceedingly high the inconsistent fitting parameters may suggest the current model is unsuitable for describing the thicker sludges indeed thickened sludge types 15 30 wt have been considered as soft solids rather than weak gels baudez et al 2016 however for all other sludge samples the linear reduction of e 1 and e 2 with treatment temperature indicate weakening of sludges structural strength after th furthermore Œ± also increased linearly with treatment temperature this means the sludge exhibited higher viscous characteristics after th since equation 1 reduces to the classical kelvin voigt model when Œ± 1 farno et al 2018 the creep data and fkv model fitting are presented by markers and continuous lines in fig 7 respectively fitting parameters of the model equation 4 are presented in table 3 similar to farno et al 2018 Œ± was obtained from fitting of the fkv model equations 2 and 3 to frequency sweep data listed in table 2 this was described as an advantage of the fkv model over classical kelvin voigt model since Œ± is not an arbitrarily derived value but derived from frequency sweep results reducing the number of unknown parameters in equation 4 to two and improving reliability of the fkv model fitting another advantage of the fkv model is that it features a single œÑ value as opposed to other models which consider a spectrum of œÑ values such as the generalized kelvin voigt model or the kbkz model zhang et al 2017 this becomes useful in process design cases for example in mixing of viscoelastic fluids where relevant equations require discrete œÑ values xu et al 2018 increasing treatment temperature e is reduced for all concentrations of sludge indicating lower strain resistance the respondence time œÑ s does not exhibit any apparent relationship with treatment temperature but for all samples were large this reveals highly viscoelastic behaviour in sludge as a long time is required to reach its final deformation at given input stress as described for the kelvin voigt model œÑ is infinite for purely viscoelastic materials by definition and zero for purely elastic materials whereas it is undefined for purely viscous materials since they do not exhibit strain tschoegl 2012 as shown in fig 7 the fkv model can adequately describe the viscoelastic characteristics of thermally treated sludge however 12 wt untreated sludge could not be reliably described likely due to its pasty characteristics as previously speculated it is recommended that further research be done to examine more appropriate models for thick pasty sludges 3 3 evaluating steady shear flow parameters from oscillatory measurements it was of interest whether viscoelastic data could approximate steady shear flow properties of sludge such correlation would be useful in applications where steady shear measurements are not readily producible for example online process rheometers which operate by dynamic measurements konigsberg et al 2013 besides that it was observed in the current study that steady shear measurements of thickened was 12 wt untreated tended to exhibit edge effects and bifurcation phenomena the challenges associated with rheological measurement of highly concentrated sludge are highlighted in many works baudez et al 2016 mouzaoui et al 2018 potentially such issues could be overcome by approximating steady shear properties from dynamic measurements since it produces low sample strains as described by cox merz analogy Œ∑ œâ Œ∑ Œ≥ œâ Œ≥ where Œ∑ is the complex viscosity pa s and œâ is the angular velocity rad s from dynamic measurements whereas Œ∑ is the steady shear apparent viscosity pa s and Œ≥ is the shear rate s 1 from rotational measurements traditionally cox merz analogy is not applicable for dispersion systems e g sludge however a modified cox merz rule was applied to correlate complex viscosity Œ∑ and dynamic viscosity Œ∑ to steady shear viscosity of semi solid foods bistany and kokini 1983 12 Œ∑ Œ∑ œâ c Œ∑ Œ≥ s according to equation 12 the plot of Œ∑ Œ≥ is effectively shifted until it superimposed with the plot of Œ∑ œâ or Œ∑ œâ this modified cox merz rule was applied to the untreated and thermally treated sludge here based on measurements employing parallel plate geometry as shown in fig 8 inset Œ∑ œâ does not readily superimpose with the unshifted Œ∑ Œ≥ curve this confirms traditional cox merz analogy is not valid even for thermally treated sludge interestingly the Œ∑ œâ plot closely resembled the Œ∑ Œ≥ plot even without shifting as shown in fig 8 the dynamic viscosity Œ∑ œâ describes the real portion of the complex viscosity i e Œ∑ Œ∑ iŒ∑ and represents the energy lost during deformation table 4 shows shift factors for equation 12 as well as error between the steady shear and oscillatory values after shifting besides that the error between the unshifted Œ∑ Œ≥ and Œ∑ œâ curves are also shown notably the s values nearly equal 1 in all cases this means the curve trends for Œ∑ œâ Œ∑ œâ and Œ∑ Œ≥ were already initially very similar then a simple vertical or horizontal shift can reliably superimpose Œ∑ Œ≥ to the Œ∑ œâ and Œ∑ œâ curves on the other hand c values showed that unshifted Œ∑ œâ values were at least 5 times greater than Œ∑ Œ≥ in all cases but Œ∑ œâ and Œ∑ Œ≥ were nearly equal the c values did not show a clear relationship with the sludge concentration or treatment temperature but generally decreased with temperature and increased with concentration this suggests that the pastier samples tend to show greater deviation between their oscillatory and steady shear viscosity values since the shift factor values corresponding to Œ∑ œâ were very close to 1 in all cases this suggests 13 Œ∑ œâ Œ∑ Œ≥ Œ≥ œâ error values for this approximation are in the range of 9 20 for thermally treated samples table 4 for untreated sludge this error increased likely due to bifurcation and edge effect phenomena possibly the higher error values are likely due to inherent flaws of the steady shear method since dynamic measurement did not exhibit abovementioned phenomena this was especially apparent in 12 wt sludge which exhibited obvious sample fractures and edge effects during repeated steady shear measurements as reflected by inconsistently high error value and shift factors from a practical stand point equation 13 allows quick simple approximation of sludge s steady shear viscosity using frequency sweep data sludge s shear thinning behaviour can also be determined from either Œ∑ œâ or Œ∑ œâ since they followed nearly identical curve trends with Œ∑ Œ≥ if a single Œ∑ Œ≥ value can be determined then the Œ∑ Œ≥ curve over a range of shear rates can be predicted alternatively shift factors in table 4 can be used to transform Œ∑ œâ or Œ∑ œâ plots from frequency sweep tests to produce Œ∑ Œ≥ plots shift factor values for intermediate conditions between those presented in table 4 may also be interpolated along with equations 6 8 the above observations allow process monitoring in th using either steady shear or dynamic measurements in real time furthermore it offers potential application in qualitative determination of flow properties of thicker sludge using non destructive oscillatory methods equation 12 imposes a vertical shift of the viscosity plots however a horizontal shift is also valid here since the s values in table 4 nearly equal to 1 then a linear relationship exists between Œ∑ œâ and Œ∑ Œ≥ and it can be written Œ∑ h œâ Œ∑ Œ≥ Œ≥ œâ where h is a horizontal shift factor applied to superimpose both curves this horizontal shift factor h has been used to derive the yield stress of concentrated non newtonian suspensions canet et al 2005 this was achieved by multiplying h with g at the critical strain in the current study a better approximation of yield stress was obtained by multiplying h with the plateau g obtained from strain sweep results as in fig 5 the yield stress values derived from g h are compared against those derived from flow curve fitting dynamic yield stress as well as direct measurement static yield stress in table a3 notably the g h values come very close to approximating the yield stress as derived from flow curve fitting and in most cases fall within the same order of magnitude this becomes very useful as it allows for a quick approximation of the yield stress when direct measurement methods may not be available however the theoretical or physical basis behind this approximation will require further investigation 4 practical implications thermal hydrolysis markedly changes was rheology compared to untreated sludge the apparent viscosity and yield stress of thermally treated sludge at 25 c was 14 72 and 9 60 of their original values respectively depending on treatment temperature within the range of 80 140 c the g and g of treated sludge were also 8 39 and 13 50 their original values respectively for the range of temperatures studied these rheological properties would even further decrease if it was measured in situ at treatment temperature as previously shown by equations 10 and 11 studies on the energy balance around th systems have shown it to be net positive energy process barber 2016 pilli et al 2015 however further optimizations in the design and operation of th systems is potentially possible by taking into consideration the changes in rheological properties which were explained above for example in pumping operations the frictional head losses are dependent upon sludge viscosity and yield stress anderson et al 2008 then the reduction of yield stress and viscosity in treated sludge reduces pumping cost farno et al 2017 the sludge yield stress is used to determine the transition pipe flow velocity from laminar to turbulent based on the reynolds 3 number slatter 2008 these rheological parameters that are of high significance for sizing pump power can be acquired using the equations presented in this study typically it is desirable to recycle heat from thermally treated sludge as it travels between the th reactor and subsequent anaerobic digester pilli et al 2015 as the treated sludge is cooled across the temperature gradient of the heat exchange surface it is reasonable to expect its viscosity and yield stress to increase gradually for example the apparent viscosity and yield stress of treated was at 140 c was only about 10 its value at 80 c since rheological parameters are related to a fluid s velocity profile and residence time in a heat exchanger tucker 2017 this variation is likely to affect the heat transfer performance then heat exchangers must be designed accordingly to accommodate these changes the relationships presented earlier fig 3 help to estimate correct values of rheological parameters with respect to temperature useful in design equations 6 8 allow quick estimation of in situ was rheology at various treatment condition this is useful in monitoring th performance and for process design considerations such as the sizing of mixing requirements which depends on the consistency index in non newtonian fluids metzner and otto 1957 also the in situ measurements suggest that sludge concentration does not impact the effectiveness of th as indicated by the extent and rate of rheological changes being nearly equal at different concentrations this suggests that a certain degree of flexibility is allowed in the choice of sludge concentrations for th since varying sludge concentration would not negatively impact its solubilization effectiveness this is useful since there is a need to vary sludge concentration in order to maximize biogas production but also maintain good heating efficiency barber 2016 the minimal rheological changes at treatment times beyond 30 min fig 2 also indicate potential for optimizing th treatment time to reduce heating cost and increase sludge throughput the impact of was concentration on rheology during th are also significant and should not be overlooked in some th processes sludge concentration varies as a result of dilution by process steam as well as by the addition water to dilute the treated sludge barber 2016 then in the case of highly concentrated was a significant drop in its yield stress and apparent viscosity should be expected as it becomes diluted sludge handling equipment must be appropriately designed to accommodate these changes in order to maintain the desired flow conditions as th processes tend towards favouring thicker feed sludges their viscoelastic properties will become increasingly important in process design considerations viscoelastic measurements showed gel like viscoelastic behaviour still existed in thermally treated was despite significant reduction in g and g this must be taken into consideration when designing mixing systems since the presence of viscoelasticity determines the mixing power reviol et al 2016 this becomes particularly important in anaerobic digestion where efficient mixing is required to ensure adequate contact between the treated sludge and microorganisms the viscoelastic parameters g g and œÑ also affect the formation of inactive zones during mixing bhattacharjee et al 2017 the frequency response reveals gel stability in the treated sludge since the slope of the g at different frequencies fig 6 was relatively small and g was greater than 100 pa at low angular velocities this means the sludge exhibits strong structural strength at rest then the sludge is unlikely to exhibit settling and phase separation mezger 2006 this would imply at least for the range of sludge concentrations studied there may not be an imperative need to pump the sludge under turbulent conditions for the purpose of mitigating blockages due to settling effects on the other hand it also validates the improved dewaterability of thermally treated sludges feng et al 2014b wang et al 2017b since g values of treated sludge are significantly reduced furthermore the comparability between dynamic viscosity and steady shear viscosity allows viscoelastic data as obtained from oscillatory measurements to be used as steady shear data this enables additional options for online rheometry of th sludges and suggests a new way of collecting sludge flow data through oscillation methods this is useful because generating reliable data for sludge at high solids concentration is difficult as sludge tends to crack at high shear rate and to slip at low shear rates during flow curve measurement furthermore it shows online rheometers which operate based on collecting viscoelastic data can be used for generating flow curve parameters in this work an alternative method of calculating yield stress from oscillatory measurement was suggested which is a critical parameter for engineering design and optimisation of pumps and mixers the frequency and creep responses of highly concentred sludge were described for the first time by the fkv model across all treatment conditions studied the fkv model can be used in cfd programs to reliably design and optimise the efficiency of pumping mixing systems and heat exchangers 5 conclusion in situ characterization of was flow behaviour at various concentrations during th was performed at all treatment conditions sludge exhibited non newtonian flow behaviour the impact of treatment temperature duration of treatment and sludge concentration on Œ∑ k and œÉ c was described by linear logarithmic and power law relationships respectively the extent and rate of rheological changes during th were not affected by increasing sludge concentrations thermally treated was exhibited gel like viscoelastic behaviour but g and g decreased with treatment temperature which indicated weakening of sludge s elastic characteristics due to th the frequency and creep responses of highly concentrated sludge were described for the first time by the fkv model results from oscillatory measurement can predict its steady shear behaviour by comparing values of dynamic viscosity with stead shear viscosity these rheological properties can be used for further optimisation of th processes declaration of interests none acknowledgement the authors would like to thank rmit university for providing a scholarship to k hii mt martha

18919,rheological properties are important in the design and operation of sludge handling process despite this the rheology of sludge in thermal hydrolysis processes th is not well described in situ measurements were performed to characterize the flow behaviour of various concentrations 7 13 wt of waste activated sludge was at th conditions equations were presented for predicting in situ rheological parameters high shear viscosity Œ∑ i consistency index k i and yield stress œÉ c i under various treatment conditions which are useful for design of process units the equations enable convenient estimation of in situ properties based on ambient rheological measurements results suggested that the proportion of sludge solubilization and its rate were unaffected by varying sludge concentration thermally treated sludge still exhibited gel like viscoelastic characteristics similar to untreated sludge however the storage g and loss g moduli decreased with higher treatment temperatures frequency and creep responses were described by a fractional derivatives kelvin voigt fkv model which showed increasing viscous characteristics of treated sludge these equations can be utilised in cfd models results obtained from oscillatory measurements can also approximate steady shear behaviour by comparing dynamic viscosity Œ∑ œâ and steady shear viscosity Œ∑ Œ≥ whose values were very similar this enables convenient estimation of steady shear behaviour of sludge from oscillatory measurements which is found to be a non destructive technique for measuring flow behaviour of

desirable physical or chemical changes in wastewater sludge one major application is in anaerobic digestion where th is used as pre treatment to overcome the rate limiting hydrolysis step showing favourable results and successful industrial scale application barber 2016 carr√®re et al 2010 sapkaite et al 2017 zhen et al 2017 in these processes particulate organic matter is solubilized through application of heat for a defined period this disintegrates cellular material to release organic compounds which improves microorganism access to them thus enhancing anaerobic digestion performance ariunbaatar et al 2014 su√°rez iglesias et al 2017 besides that th leads to advantageous rheological enhancements for example the viscosity of thermally treated sludge is greatly reduced which improves the efficiency of pumping mixing heating digester loading and sludge dewaterability farno et al 2017 morgan sagastume et al 2011 p√©rez elvira et al 2008 p√©rez elvira and fdz polanco 2012 zhou et al 2013 rheology plays an important role in the design and operation of sludge handling systems dentel 1997 eshtiaghi et al 2013 despite extensive research on sludge th detailed studies related to its rheology are scarce barber 2016 accordingly detailed characterization of sludge flow behaviour during th and its viscoelastic properties is of interest and can lead to better implementation of th processes waste activated sludge was is the main sludge type handled in th processes its rheology at ambient conditions has been well researched eshtiaghi et al 2013 ratkovich et al 2013 was rheology is generally accepted to behave as a non newtonian shear thinning fluid commonly described by the herschel bulkley model it exhibits thixotropic properties guibaud et al 2004 and many studies identified the presence of yield stress farno et al 2015 markis et al 2014 ratkovich et al 2013 besides was exhibits viscoelasticity meaning that it initially shows solid like behaviour under stress but liquid like behaviour upon breakdown of floc structure furthermore the rheological properties of was become more significant at high solids concentrations a few studies described the flow behaviour of was after th herschel bulkley flow behaviour has been reported 170 c 60 min th for 5 4 18 7 wt was feng et al 2014a but newtonian behaviour was also reported such as feng et al 2014b 170 c 60 min th for 5 4 wt was and urrea et al 2015 160 200 c th of 2 3 wt was however these studies were mainly concerned with post thermally treated sludge measured at ambient conditions which can deviate by up to 80 compared to in situ measurements hii et al 2017 in situ characterization of was flow behaviour has been shown by farno et al 2016a who reported the apparent viscosity and herschel bulkley parameters were dependent on treatment duration and temperature however their study was limited to low temperature thermal processes 50 80 c 1 h recently hii et al 2017 characterized in situ was flow behaviour 80 145 c 1 h th but was limited to one concentration of sludge due to viscosity reduction higher concentrations of feed sludge are desirable in th allowing higher organic loading rates in anaerobic digesters morgan sagastume et al 2011 then its impact on th rheology must be considered for untreated sludge the effect of solids concentration on sludge viscosity and consistency index has been shown following an exponential function guibaud et al 2004 markis et al 2014 sanin 2002 tixier et al 2003 or power law model lotito et al 1997 markis et al 2014 whereas yield stress follows exponential guibaud et al 2004 mori et al 2006 or power law relationship forster 2002 lotito et al 1997 markis et al 2014 for thermally treated was an exponential relationship has been described for apparent viscosity and consistency index feng et al 2014a in another study yield stress has been described following exponential relationship with concentration whereas the consistency index and flow index followed a polynomial function of third and second order respectively urrea et al 2015 however it has not been shown whether the same relationship exists during th viscoelastic properties have been reported for thermally treated was generally the storage g and loss moduli g reduced as a result of th and g g farno et al 2016a feng et al 2014a zhang et al 2017 although some studies also suggest g g at low concentrations 0 8 wt feng et al 2014a 2014b however feng et al 2014a and feng et al 2014b did not examine the impact of varying treatment temperature whereas farno et al 2016b was related to low temperature 50 80 c thermal sludge processing zhang et al 2017 characterized the viscoelastic properties of was 14 2 and 18 2 wt after low 60 90 c and high temperature 120 180 c th a kay bernstein kearsley zappa kbkz model described the viscoelastic properties however their study was concerned with polyacrylamide pam conditioned sludge which alters flocculation and network structure furthermore farno et al 2018 have shown that a fractional derivatives kelvin voigt model was more representative for sludge viscoelasticity but was limited to lower thermal treatment temperatures 80 c and sludge concentrations 6 1 wt the current study expands the in situ rheological characterization of was during th for various sludge concentrations evaluating the impact of sludge concentration temperature and treatment time empirical equations are derived describing changes in the apparent viscosity yield stress and consistency index during th at various sludge concentrations furthermore the viscoelastic properties of the raw and thermally treated was are investigated the results from viscoelastic measurements are fitted to a fractional derivates kelvin voigt model which has not been attempted before for high temperature thermally treated sludge finally the adaptability of dynamic measurements to obtaining steady shear data is evaluated assessing its potential for overcoming the practical challenges related to the steady shear flow measurement of highly concentred sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge samples of was were collected at initial solids concentration 3 5 wt from mount martha wastewater treatment plant in victoria australia where dissolved air flotation without polymer dosing is used to thickened sludge the sludge was stored at 4 c for 30 days before use to ensure minimal changes due to biological activity during experiments and to help maintain the stability and consistency between samples curvers et al 2009 to achieve different concentrations sludge was first thickened via centrifugation at 9000 rpm 13 700 g then it was diluted to 7 9 12 and 13 wt by mixing the centrifuged sludge with the original sludge total solids concentration wt was determined gravimetrically by drying samples to constant mass at 105 c apha 1992 2 2 in situ flow behaviour measurement all rheological measurements were performed using a stress controlled rheometer dhr 3 ta instruments for in situ rheological measurements a pressure cell attachment was used which operates based on cup and bob geometry 26 mm bob diameter 28 mm cup diameter the pressure cell is an enclosed system allowing rheological measurements at elevated temperature and pressure mimicking th conditions steady flow curves were generated to describe the in situ flow behaviour of sludge following protocols established in hii et al 2017 samples were heated to desired constant temperature 80 100 120 130 and 140 c then flow curves were generated periodically over 60 min nitrogen gas was used to pressurize the system to 5 bar ensuring sludge remained in the liquid state raw rheometer outputs are published at hii and eshtiaghi 2017 herschel bulkley fitting parameters were obtained using a master flow curve supplementary fig s2 development and usage of this master curve are as described in hii et al 2017 with corresponding shift factors presented in supplementary tables s1 and s2 2 3 oscillatory viscoelastic measurement in situ measurements produced unreliable results when using the pressure cell in dynamic mode this was likely caused by high inertial forces produced in the bob which connects to the rheometer via magnetic coupling therefore viscoelastic analysis was carried out using parallel plate geometry 40 mm diameter 1 mm gap 25 c on untreated and post thermal treatment sludge 7 9 and 12 wt strain sweep tests were performed at 10 rad s frequency sweep tests were performed at angular frequency range 1 100 rad s at constant 0 1 strain which was within the linear viscoelastic region lve for all samples tested creep tests were performed by applying step stress and recording the strain over 180 s flow curves were also generated and stress ramps were performed to determine sample yield stresses via the tangent cross over method farno et al 2016a mezger 2006 prior to each measurement samples were pre sheared at 1000 s 1 for 5 min followed by 2 min equilibration at rest parallel plates were lined with sandpaper 400 grit to eliminate slippage and thermally treated samples were obtained using a separate 100 ml reactor parr instrument company rheometer raw data for oscillatory measurements are published in hii and eshtiaghi 2018 2 4 viscoelastic modelling a fractional derivatives kelvin voigt fkv model was fitted to viscoelastic data to allow calculation of viscoelastic parameters this model has so far been used to describe thermally treated sludge but only at low treatment temperatures below 80 c farno

studied 7 13 wt despite elevated temperatures 80 140 c was behaviour was best described by the herschel bulkley model 5 œÉ œÉ c k Œ≥ n where œÉ is the shear stress pa œÉ c is the yield stress pa Œ≥ is the shear rate s 1 k is the consistency index pa sn and n is the flow index sludge exhibited yield stress and shear thinning behaviour for the entire 1 h th contrary to other studies feng et al 2014b urrea et al 2015 newtonian behaviour was not observed although it is noted that those studies were performed at higher treatment temperatures 160 c furthermore sludge concentrations used in the current study were also higher which tends to increase non newtonian behaviour slatter 1997 during th it is believed the elevated temperatures result in the destruction of floc structure and solubilization of sludge organic matter as seen in fig 1b there is distinct difference between the flow curves of 80 c and 130 c at the same solid concentration this solubilization destroys the structural integrity of the sludge and releases bound water neyens et al 2004 which result in the observed rheological changes then fig 1a suggests the action leading to sludge s physical changes is a time dependent process the evolution of was apparent viscosity with treatment duration is shown in fig 2 where Œ∑ i is the apparent viscosity of was at elevated th conditions measured at 600 s 1 maximum shear rate in the pressure cell at constant temperature Œ∑ i decreased rapidly initially 10 15 min then gradually plateauing towards the end of the treatment period this trend was best described as a logarithmic decrease similar to previously shown for 7 was hii et al 2017 notably the same curve trends were observed for all sludge concentrations studied this is seen clearer in fig 2 inset showing the normalized apparent viscosity Œ∑ i Œ∑ 0 for different concentrations 7 13 the same observation was also valid for the herschel bulkley parameters k and œÉ c not shown a chi square test was performed on Œ∑ i Œ∑ 0 k i k 0 and œÉ c i œÉ c 0 at constant time and temperature comparing between different sludge concentrations and it showed insignificant difference of the values between different sludge concentrations Œ± 0 05 p 0 99 this suggests the rate and extent of solubilization in the sludge was constant and independent of concentration this is consistent with imbierowicz and chacuk 2012 who showed the kinetics of sludge solubilization are independent of concentration higher sludge concentrations only lead to higher internal friction and hence greater shear stresses observed at constant treatment time sludge rheological parameters were described by linear relationship with temperature an arrhenius style relationship was considered unsuitable since it assumes constant activation energy which would not be the case in time dependent sludge thermal treatment farno et al 2014 baudez et al 2013 as shown in fig 3 inset Œ∑ i of was decreased linearly at all studied concentrations the same was also observed for k i and œÉ c i refer to supplementary fig s1 in fact the impact of temperature on the extent of Œ∑ i k i and œÉ c i reduction were comparable for all studied concentrations showing nearly constant curve slopes in fig 3 this suggests sludge concentration did not control the extent of sludge solubilization this was verified using a chi square test Œ± 0 05 to compare the decrease in Œ∑ i Œ∑ 0 k i k 0 and œÉ c i œÉ c 0 as a function of temperature between different sludge concentrations showing insignificant variation p 0 99 across all comparisons at constant temperature and treatment time the increasing trends of Œ∑ i k i and œÉ c i with sludge concentration were described by power law relationship this is shown for the normalized Œ∑ i and œÉ c i in fig 4 before and after th total solids concentration of was was measured verifying that it remained constant although fig 4 only showed rheological data measured at 60 min the same power law relationship was observed at any time during th this is consistent with the power law relationship observed at ambient conditions for untreated was between apparent viscosity yield stress and consistency index with solids concentration forster 2002 lotito et al 1997 markis et al 2014 sanin 2002 tixier et al 2003 this means the impact of increasing sludge concentration on its rheology are not diminished even at elevated th temperatures it is suspected with increasing sludge concentration the fundamental actions governing the intensification of viscous forces e g viscosity and yield stress remain the same between untreated was at ambient conditions and thermally treated was at elevated temperatures as sludge solids content increased the increasing strength of particle interactions lead to higher viscous forces markis et al 2016 the change in Œ∑ i pa s k i pa sn and œÉ c i pa at any temperature and time during 60 min th can be described as follows considering the logarithmic time dependent behaviour and linear relationship with temperature 6 Œ∑ i Œ∑ 7 0 a 1 t b 1 ln t c 1 7 k i k 7 0 a 2 t b 2 ln t c 2 8 œÉ c i œÉ c 7 0 a 3 t b 3 ln t c 3 where t is the sludge

the yield stress of 7 wt untreated was at 25 c and a 1 3 and b 1 3 are fitting parameters and c 1 c 2 and c 3 are the Œ∑ i Œ∑ 7 0 k i k 7 0 and œÉ c i œÉ c7 0 respectively at time 0 min i e when sludge just reaches treatment temperature a 1 3 b 1 3 and c 1 3 can be related to the solids concentration of sludge using the following equation 9 f œÜ y œÜ z where f œÜ can represent any of the coefficients a 1 3 b 1 3 b 2 and c 1 3 œÜ is the solids concentration of sludge wt wt y and z are power law fitting parameters which can be taken from table 1 the coefficients a 1 3 b 1 3 b 2 and c 1 3 showed power law relation with solids concentration this is consistent with the power law relationship for the herschel bulkley parameters with sludge concentration observed in fig 4 equations 6 8 can be used to estimate in situ the apparent viscosity and herschel bulkley parameters of was 7 13 wt during th at different time of treatment based on untreated 7 was at 25 c regression statistics and correlation analysis of parameters are presented in table a1 the accuracy was higher in the range of 80 130 c with 4 12 mean percentage error mape of estimated values across this temperature range but the accuracy decreased significantly at 140 c this is because at 140 c rheological changes were seemingly less time dependent compared to the lower temperatures 80 130 c that is rheological values plateaued much earlier therefore the logarithmic coefficients in equations 6 8 would underestimated at 140 c zhang et al 2017 have shown for low temperature th 100 c treatment time was the dominant factor influencing sludge rheological behaviour while the temperature was the dominant factor for high temperature th 100 c furthermore bougrier et al 2008 suggested that a threshold temperature 150 c existed whereby increasing th temperatures beyond 150 c would cause insignificant apparent viscosity reduction of sludge as such the rheological changes have likely approached a limit the impact of raising treatment temperature to 140 c was also diminished in all cases in situ values were 50 80 lower than respective ambient counterparts depending on th temperature table a2 this means ambient rheological measurements of treated sludge may be scaled accordingly to represent in situ values notably the extent of reduction from ambient values to in situ values remained relatively constant at varying sludge concentrations for example the in situ high shear viscosity of 7 13 wt sludge at 100 c was between 0 4 and 0 5 of ambient values equations 10 and 11 correlate the in situ Œ∑ and œÉ c to ambient values this allows quick estimation of in situ rheological properties based on ambient measurements of th sludge when on line rheological measurements are not possible 10 Œ∑ i Œ∑ f 0 0055 t 1 r m s e 0 06 11 œÉ c i œÉ c f 0 0036 t 1 r m s e 0 08 where Œ∑ i is the in situ high shear viscosity pa s of was at 60 min treatment time Œ∑ f is the high shear viscosity pa s of was after thermal hydrolysis measured at 25 c œÉ c i is the in situ yield stress pa and œÉ c f is the yield stress of thermally treated was measured at 25 c equation 10 can also be used to estimate the consistency index by replacing Œ∑ i and Œ∑ f with the in situ consistency index k i and the consistency index of thermally treated was measured at 25 c k f respectively 3 2 viscoelastic behaviour strain sweep results fig 5 compare deformation behaviour before and after th as well as changes in g and g for both untreated and thermally treated samples was exhibited linear viscoelastic deformation at low strain values with g g indicating gel like behaviour then with increasing strain the rate of change in g and g became increasingly strain dependent where both moduli decreased rapidly until a crossover point was reached then g g the viscous characteristics of the sludge are then dominant and sludge exhibits irreversible deformation or flow this general behaviour was observed for all concentrations 7 12 wt of untreated and thermally treated 100 140 c was examined these results are consistent with those reported in farno et al 2016b and zhang et al 2017 for different sludge concentrations and treatment conditions interestingly the abovementioned studies reported presence of a g peak which was largely absent in the current study instead the g curves for all untreated and thermally treated sludge transitioned smoothly into the viscous region without rising above its plateau values this difference compared to farno et al 2016b is likely due to the higher sludge concentrations used in the current study as compared to theirs 3 5 6 1 wt on the other hand the sludge used by zhang et al 2017 had higher concentration 14 2 and 18 2 wt but was conditioned with pam which significantly affects its network structure wang et al 2017a shrinkage of the lve region due to th 170 c 60 min has been reported in treated sludge feng et al 2014b here a similar observation was made for the 7 wt and 9 wt treated sludge where the yielding strain range difference between the cross over strain and the critical strain values decreased by 15 35 following a linear relationship with th temperature this reflects the temperature dependent destruction of the sludge structure as indicated by decreasing g with temperature fig 6 inset causing it to flow more readily at lower strains g and g exhibited minor frequency dependence in the lve region showing slight increase with angular velocity as seen in fig 6 across the whole frequency range g g for all concentrations of sludge regardless of thermal treatment the moduli do not cross over at any point in the range of frequencies examined in fact the loss factor tanŒ¥ g g largely remained constant this behaviour is characteristic of weak gels rao and cooley 1992 and reflects the presence of biopolymers in sludge this means in the lve range sludge exhibited physical network structure mezger 2006 which remained relatively constant in the entire frequency range due to th the gel network of biopolymers is deteriorated which leads to reduction in g and g fig 6 inset but a gel network remained regardless zhang et al 2017 used kbkz to describe the viscoelastic behaviour of thermally treated sludge however farno et al 2018 showed the fkv model can be more realistic and accurate due to the fractional element in the model which describes the intermediate characteristics between purely viscous and purely elastic elements here frequency sweep results could be very well described by the fkv model equations 2 and 3 with fitting curves predicting experimental data shown as continuous lines in fig 6 the corresponding fitting parameters as well as fitting error are presented in table 2 e 1 and e 2 are model constants representing responses of the fractional and elastic elements in equation 1 respectively both e 1 and e 2 linearly decreased with treatment temperature except for 12 wt untreated sludge 25 c in the case of 12 wt untreated sludge e 1 was inconsistently low and e 2 was exceedingly high the inconsistent fitting parameters may suggest the current model is unsuitable for describing the thicker sludges indeed thickened sludge types 15 30 wt have been considered as soft solids rather than weak gels baudez et al 2016 however for all other sludge samples the linear reduction of e 1 and e 2 with treatment temperature indicate weakening of sludges structural strength after th furthermore Œ± also increased linearly with treatment temperature this means the sludge exhibited higher viscous characteristics after th since equation 1 reduces to the classical kelvin voigt model when Œ± 1 farno et al 2018 the creep data and fkv model fitting are presented by markers and continuous lines in fig 7 respectively fitting parameters of the model equation 4 are presented in table 3 similar to farno et al 2018 Œ± was obtained from fitting of the fkv model equations 2 and 3 to frequency sweep data listed in table 2 this was described as an advantage of the fkv model over classical kelvin voigt model since Œ± is not an arbitrarily derived value but derived from frequency sweep results reducing the number of unknown parameters in equation 4 to two and improving reliability of the fkv model fitting another advantage of the fkv model is that it features a single œÑ value as opposed to other models which consider a spectrum of œÑ values such as the generalized kelvin voigt model or the kbkz model zhang et al 2017 this becomes useful in process design cases for example in mixing of viscoelastic fluids where relevant equations require discrete œÑ values xu et al 2018 increasing treatment temperature e is reduced for all concentrations of sludge indicating lower strain resistance the respondence time œÑ s does not exhibit any apparent relationship with treatment temperature but for all samples were large this reveals highly viscoelastic behaviour in sludge as a long time is required to reach its final deformation at given input stress as described for the kelvin voigt model œÑ is infinite for purely viscoelastic materials by definition and zero for purely elastic materials whereas it is undefined for purely viscous materials since they do not exhibit strain tschoegl 2012 as shown in fig 7 the fkv model can adequately describe the viscoelastic characteristics of thermally treated sludge however 12 wt untreated sludge could not be reliably described likely due to its pasty characteristics as previously speculated it is recommended that further research be done to examine more appropriate models for thick pasty sludges 3 3 evaluating steady shear flow parameters from oscillatory measurements it was of interest whether viscoelastic data could approximate steady shear flow properties of sludge such correlation would be useful in applications where steady shear measurements are not readily producible for example online process rheometers which operate by dynamic measurements konigsberg et al 2013 besides that it was observed in the current study that steady shear measurements of thickened was 12 wt untreated tended to exhibit edge effects and bifurcation phenomena the challenges associated with rheological measurement of highly concentrated sludge are highlighted in many works baudez et al 2016 mouzaoui et al 2018 potentially such issues could be overcome by approximating steady shear properties from dynamic measurements since it produces low sample strains as described by cox merz analogy Œ∑ œâ Œ∑ Œ≥ œâ Œ≥ where Œ∑ is the complex viscosity pa s and œâ is the angular velocity rad s from dynamic measurements whereas Œ∑ is the steady shear apparent viscosity pa s and Œ≥ is the shear rate s 1 from rotational measurements traditionally cox merz analogy is not applicable for dispersion systems e g sludge however a modified cox merz rule was applied to correlate complex viscosity Œ∑ and dynamic viscosity Œ∑ to steady shear viscosity of semi solid foods bistany and kokini 1983 12 Œ∑ Œ∑ œâ c Œ∑ Œ≥ s according to equation 12 the plot of Œ∑ Œ≥ is effectively shifted until it superimposed with the plot of Œ∑ œâ or Œ∑ œâ this modified cox merz rule was applied to the untreated and thermally treated sludge here based on measurements employing parallel plate geometry as shown in fig 8 inset Œ∑ œâ does not readily superimpose with the unshifted Œ∑ Œ≥ curve this confirms traditional cox merz analogy is not valid even for thermally treated sludge interestingly the Œ∑ œâ plot closely resembled the Œ∑ Œ≥ plot even without shifting as shown in fig 8 the dynamic viscosity Œ∑ œâ describes the real portion of the complex viscosity i e Œ∑ Œ∑ iŒ∑ and represents the energy lost during deformation table 4 shows shift factors for equation 12 as well as error between the steady shear and oscillatory values after shifting besides that the error between the unshifted Œ∑ Œ≥ and Œ∑ œâ curves are also shown notably the s values nearly equal 1 in all cases this means the curve trends for Œ∑ œâ Œ∑ œâ and Œ∑ Œ≥ were already initially very similar then a simple vertical or horizontal shift can reliably superimpose Œ∑ Œ≥ to the Œ∑ œâ and Œ∑ œâ curves on the other hand c values showed that unshifted Œ∑ œâ values were at least 5 times greater than Œ∑ Œ≥ in all cases but Œ∑ œâ and Œ∑ Œ≥ were nearly equal the c values did not show a clear relationship with the sludge concentration or treatment temperature but generally decreased with temperature and increased with concentration this suggests that the pastier samples tend to show greater deviation between their oscillatory and steady shear viscosity values since the shift factor values corresponding to Œ∑ œâ were very close to 1 in all cases this suggests 13 Œ∑ œâ Œ∑ Œ≥ Œ≥ œâ error values for this approximation are in the range of 9 20 for thermally treated samples table 4 for untreated sludge this error increased likely due to bifurcation and edge effect phenomena possibly the higher error values are likely due to inherent flaws of the steady shear method since dynamic measurement did not exhibit abovementioned phenomena this was especially apparent in 12 wt sludge which exhibited obvious sample fractures and edge effects during repeated steady shear measurements as reflected by inconsistently high error value and shift factors from a practical stand point equation 13 allows quick simple approximation of sludge s steady shear viscosity using frequency sweep data sludge s shear thinning behaviour can also be determined from either Œ∑ œâ or Œ∑ œâ since they followed nearly identical curve trends with Œ∑ Œ≥ if a single Œ∑ Œ≥ value can be determined then the Œ∑ Œ≥ curve over a range of shear rates can be predicted alternatively shift factors in table 4 can be used to transform Œ∑ œâ or Œ∑ œâ plots from frequency sweep tests to produce Œ∑ Œ≥ plots shift factor values for intermediate conditions between those presented in table 4 may also be interpolated along with equations 6 8 the above observations allow process monitoring in th using either steady shear or dynamic measurements in real time furthermore it offers potential application in qualitative determination of flow properties of thicker sludge using non destructive oscillatory methods equation 12 imposes a vertical shift of the viscosity plots however a horizontal shift is also valid here since the s values in table 4 nearly equal to 1 then a linear relationship exists between Œ∑ œâ and Œ∑ Œ≥ and it can be written Œ∑ h œâ Œ∑ Œ≥ Œ≥ œâ where h is a horizontal shift factor applied to superimpose both curves this horizontal shift factor h has been used to derive the yield stress of concentrated non newtonian suspensions canet et al 2005 this was achieved by multiplying h with g at the critical strain in the current study a better approximation of yield stress was obtained by multiplying h with the plateau g obtained from strain sweep results as in fig 5 the yield stress values derived from g h are compared against those derived from flow curve fitting dynamic yield stress as well as direct measurement static yield stress in table a3 notably the g h values come very close to approximating the yield stress as derived from flow curve fitting and in most cases fall within the same order of magnitude this becomes very useful as it allows for a quick approximation of the yield stress when direct measurement methods may not be available however the theoretical or physical basis behind this approximation will require further investigation 4 practical implications thermal hydrolysis markedly changes was rheology compared to untreated sludge the apparent viscosity and yield stress of thermally treated sludge at 25 c was 14 72 and 9 60 of their original values respectively depending on treatment temperature within the range of 80 140 c the g and g of treated sludge were also 8 39 and 13 50 their original values respectively for the range of temperatures studied these rheological properties would even further decrease if it was measured in situ at treatment temperature as previously shown by equations 10 and 11 studies on the energy balance around th systems have shown it to be net positive energy process barber 2016 pilli et al 2015 however further optimizations in the design and operation of th systems is potentially possible by taking into consideration the changes in rheological properties which were explained above for example in pumping operations the frictional head losses are dependent upon sludge viscosity and yield stress anderson et al 2008 then the reduction of yield stress and viscosity in treated sludge reduces pumping cost farno et al 2017 the sludge yield stress is used to determine the transition pipe flow velocity from laminar to turbulent based on the reynolds 3 number slatter 2008 these rheological parameters that are of high significance for sizing pump power can be acquired using the equations presented in this study typically it is desirable to recycle heat from thermally treated sludge as it travels between the th reactor and subsequent anaerobic digester pilli et al 2015 as the treated sludge is cooled across the temperature gradient of the heat exchange surface it is reasonable to expect its viscosity and yield stress to increase gradually for example the apparent viscosity and yield stress of treated was at 140 c was only about 10 its value at 80 c since rheological parameters are related to a fluid s velocity profile and residence time in a heat exchanger tucker 2017 this variation is likely to affect the heat transfer performance then heat exchangers must be designed accordingly to accommodate these changes the relationships presented earlier fig 3 help to estimate correct values of rheological parameters with respect to temperature useful in design equations 6 8 allow quick estimation of in situ was rheology at various treatment condition this is useful in monitoring th performance and for process design considerations such as the sizing of mixing requirements which depends on the consistency index in non newtonian fluids metzner and otto 1957 also the in situ measurements suggest that sludge concentration does not impact the effectiveness of th as indicated by the extent and rate of rheological changes being nearly equal at different concentrations this suggests that a certain degree of flexibility is allowed in the choice of sludge concentrations for th since varying sludge concentration would not negatively impact its solubilization effectiveness this is useful since there is a need to vary sludge concentration in order to maximize biogas production but also maintain good heating efficiency barber 2016 the minimal rheological changes at treatment times beyond 30 min fig 2 also indicate potential for optimizing th treatment time to reduce heating cost and increase sludge throughput the impact of was concentration on rheology during th are also significant and should not be overlooked in some th processes sludge concentration varies as a result of dilution by process steam as well as by the addition water to dilute the treated sludge barber 2016 then in the case of highly concentrated was a significant drop in its yield stress and apparent viscosity should be expected as it becomes diluted sludge handling equipment must be appropriately designed to accommodate these changes in order to maintain the desired flow conditions as th processes tend towards favouring thicker feed sludges their viscoelastic properties will become increasingly important in process design considerations viscoelastic measurements showed gel like viscoelastic behaviour still existed in thermally treated was despite significant reduction in g and g this must be taken into consideration when designing mixing systems since the presence of viscoelasticity determines the mixing power reviol et al 2016 this becomes particularly important in anaerobic digestion where efficient mixing is required to ensure adequate contact between the treated sludge and microorganisms the viscoelastic parameters g g and œÑ also affect the formation of inactive zones during mixing bhattacharjee et al 2017 the frequency response reveals gel stability in the treated sludge since the slope of the g at different frequencies fig 6 was relatively small and g was greater than 100 pa at low angular velocities this means the sludge exhibits strong structural strength at rest then the sludge is unlikely to exhibit settling and phase separation mezger 2006 this would imply at least for the range of sludge concentrations studied there may not be an imperative need to pump the sludge under turbulent conditions for the purpose of mitigating blockages due to settling effects on the other hand it also validates the improved dewaterability of thermally treated sludges feng et al 2014b wang et al 2017b since g values of treated sludge are significantly reduced furthermore the comparability between dynamic viscosity and steady shear viscosity allows viscoelastic data as obtained from oscillatory measurements to be used as steady shear data this enables additional options for online rheometry of th sludges and suggests a new way of collecting sludge flow data through oscillation methods this is useful because generating reliable data for sludge at high solids concentration is difficult as sludge tends to crack at high shear rate and to slip at low shear rates during flow curve measurement furthermore it shows online rheometers which operate based on collecting viscoelastic data can be used for generating flow curve parameters in this work an alternative method of calculating yield stress from oscillatory measurement was suggested which is a critical parameter for engineering design and optimisation of pumps and mixers the frequency and creep responses of highly concentred sludge were described for the first time by the fkv model across all treatment conditions studied the fkv model can be used in cfd programs to reliably design and optimise the efficiency of pumping mixing systems and heat exchangers 5 conclusion in situ characterization of was flow behaviour at various concentrations during th was performed at all treatment conditions sludge exhibited non newtonian flow behaviour the impact of treatment temperature duration of treatment and sludge concentration on Œ∑ k and œÉ c was described by linear logarithmic and power law relationships respectively the extent and rate of rheological changes during th were not affected by increasing sludge concentrations thermally treated was exhibited gel like viscoelastic behaviour but g and g decreased with treatment temperature which indicated weakening of sludge s elastic characteristics due to th the frequency and creep responses of highly concentrated sludge were described for the first time by the fkv model results from oscillatory measurement can predict its steady shear behaviour by comparing values of dynamic viscosity with stead shear viscosity these rheological properties can be used for further optimisation of th processes declaration of interests none acknowledgement the authors would like to thank rmit university for providing a scholarship to k hii mt martha
