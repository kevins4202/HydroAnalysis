17090,understanding the climatic drivers of eutrophication is critical for lake management under the prism of the global change yet the complex interplay between climatic variables and lake processes makes prediction of phytoplankton biomass a rather difficult task quantifying the relative influence of climate related variables on the regulation of phytoplankton biomass requires modelling approaches that use extensive field measurements paired with accurate meteorological observations in this study we used climate and lake related variables obtained from the era5 land reanalysis dataset combined with a large dataset of in situ measurements of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass from 50 water bodies to develop models of phytoplankton related responses as functions of the climate reanalysis data we used chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass as response metrics of phytoplankton growth and we employed two different modelling techniques boosted regression trees brt and generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss according to our results the fitted models had a relatively high explanatory power and predictive performance boosted regression trees had a high pseudo r2 with the type of the lake the total layer temperature and the mix layer depth being the three predictors with the higher relative influence the best gamlss model retained mix layer depth mix layer temperature total layer temperature total runoff and 10 m wind speed as significant predictors p 0 001 regarding the phytoplankton biomass both modelling approaches had less explanatory power than those for chlorophyll a concerning the predictive performance of the models both the brt and gamlss models for chlorophyll a outperformed those for phytoplankton biomass overall we consider these findings promising for future limnological studies as they bring forth new perspectives in modelling ecosystem responses to a wide range of climate and lake variables as a concluding

trees generalized additive models climate reanalysis 1 introduction lake eutrophication is a major environmental problem that persists in many areas of the world and is related with multiple implications for ecosystem functioning and provision of services to human societies ho et al 2019 jeppesen et al 2015 schindler 2006 smith et al 1999 excessive nutrient loading is considered the main driver of eutrophication which is often characterized by the abrupt algal biomass growth and the appearance of algal blooms heisler et al 2008 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 naturally limnologists and environmental scientists have placed emphasis on the relative role of phosphorus and nitrogen on shaping phytoplankton community dynamics and boosting algal biomass nevertheless there is evidence that climate related variables play an important role on determining phytoplankton biomass proliferation hao et al 2018 lürling et al 2017 taranu et al 2012 studies focusing on the impacts of climate change on lake ecosystems have revealed that climate warming changes in rainfall patterns and changes in wind speed may affect phytoplankton assemblages in various ways woolway et al 2020 increased water temperature in temperate lakes can promote phytoplankton growth by strengthening the stratification of the water column reducing the thickness and the duration of the ice cap and prolonging the open water season woolway and merchant 2019 changes in rainfall patterns may have various effects on phytoplankton growth in regions where precipitation will increase the surface runoff will boost the nutrient loads that end in the lakes leading to higher phytoplankton biomass jeppesen et al 2009 moss 2011 sinha et al 2017 furthermore recent evidence show that a projected decline of the annual mean wind speed adrian et al 2018 deng et al 2018 mcvicar et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 could enhance eutrophication processes and promote the occurrence of algal blooms on the other hand more frequent and severe storms may enhance flushing and cause destratification of the water column suppressing algal growth and averting algal blooms stockwell et al 2020 to date several studies have assessed the relative importance of climate variables versus nutrients for the phytoplankton growth in lakes some of them have highlighted the overarching effect of phosphorus over climatic factors while others suggest that water temperature and changes in mixing processes may be of higher importance for phytoplankton assemblages bartosiewicz et al 2019 deng et al 2019 kärcher et al 2020 it becomes obvious that although understanding the drivers of phytoplankton growth is critical for lake management and mitigation of eutrophication the complex interplay between climatic variables and lake processes makes prediction of phytoplankton biomass a rather difficult task undoubtedly quantifying the relative influence of climate related variables on the regulation of phytoplankton biomass is a challenging feat that requires the development of sophisticated models based on extensive field measurements and meteorological observations to this end climate reanalysis offers the unique capability of using high quality estimates of climatic parameters for conducting interdisciplinary research that combines variations of atmosphere ocean and land christakos et al 2020a 2020b frauenfeld et al 2005 mentzafou et al 2019 varlas et al 2017 a climate reanalysis gives a numerical description of the recent climate status produced by combining models with observations and applying advanced numerical algorithms it contains estimates of atmospheric parameters such as temperature relative humidity precipitation radiation and wind components as well as ocean parameters such as wave height and sea surface temperature the estimates are produced for the entire earth and they span a long time period that can extend back several decades although climate reanalysis is becoming a popular source of climate data to date there are very few studies that employ the use of these data in the science of limnology free et al 2020 particularly the era5 land dataset muñoz sabater 2019 is one of the most modern and finest reanalysis datasets produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf within the copernicus climate change service c3s the era5 land dataset is a replay of the land component of the era5 climate reanalysis data hersbach et al 2020 masked on land at the native horizontal resolution of 9 km it provides reliable information useful for spatial and climatic analyses as well as applications on various cross disciplinary studies e g pelosi et al 2020 the era5 land data can be downloaded by the c3s at hourly or monthly temporal scale covering a period from 1981 to present the fine temporal and spatial resolutions of era5 land make this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface applications such as flood or drought study water cycle modelling air land interaction analysis etc furthermore the ecmwf includes the lake parameterization with the integration of the fresh water lake model flake into its integrated forecasting system ifs to accurately represent fresh water lakes choulga et al 2019 thus a series of lake related parameters are produced and also included in era5 land dataset they can be used to describe key limnological processes such as the total layer temperature the mix layer temperature the mix layer depth and the bottom water temperature in this study we used climate and lake related variables included in the era5 land dataset combined with in situ measurements of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass from 50 water bodies to develop models of phytoplankton related responses as functions of climate reanalysis data in particular we employed boosted regression trees brt and generalized additive models for locations scale and shape gamlss brts are a powerful analysis tool that has increased predictive power against other models such as generalized linear models classification and regression trees leclere et al 2011 and generalized additive models leathwick et al 2006 because it uses both decision tree algorithms and gradient boosting methods to improve the accuracy of the model in addition brt offers the advantage of fitting complex nonlinear relationships while being robust to missing values and outliers elith et al 2008 gamlss are semi parametric regression type models where all the parameters of the response variable distribution can be modelled as additive functions of the explanatory variables and random factors thus gamlss are efficient in modelling response variables that show heterogeneity or do not follow an exponential family distribution stasinopoulos et al 2017 furthermore gamlss models account for the variance of random factors and data autocorrelation both modelling approaches are widely used in ecology because are capable of fitting complex non linear responses karaouzas et al 2019 stefanidis et al 2019 our aim was twofold as we first investigated the explanatory power of the models by assessing the relative contribution of climate related variables to the chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton biomass in lakes and second we tested their potential predictability to ascertain whether climate reanalysis data can be used in predictive models thereby models were fitted to explore the structure of our data and to test hypotheses regarding the effect of climate related variables on phytoplankton growth we hypothesized that the lake temperature would be the dominant climate related variable explaining the phytoplankton growth and that other climatic variables would have a smaller contribution furthermore by employing two discrete modelling approaches we compared their predictive performance and we assessed the usefulness of climate reanalysis data in predicting two common metrics of lake eutrophication ideally reanalyzed data could be used in monitoring and forecasting of phytoplankton proliferation including algal blooms according to lake management schemes that aim to prevent further deterioration of water quality and avert environmental hazard we consider the use of era5 land climate reanalysis data in lake modelling as a strong and innovative approach for delineating the relative contribution of climate related parameters in the lake eutrophication processes at the same time the current study links with the help of machine learning based brts and gamlss large scale climate and lake related variables produced by the emcwf with actual field observations of chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton biomass our work demonstrates that the era5 land lake related parameters can be used effectively in building meaningful ecological and limnological models that interpret the effect of climate on phytoplankton biomass and have strong predictive capability we think that this is highly significant for water researchers because it brings forth new perspectives to the lake sciences particularly when investigating the responses of the lakes to climate variability and future climate change 2 methods 2 1 description and compilation of data we compiled a dataset of 640 measurements of chlorophyll a concentration and 452 measurements of phytoplankton biomass from 50 water bodies of greece the measurements were collected from 2013 to 2016 under the national lake monitoring programme according to the implementation of the water framework directive the data are freely accessible in the following site http biodiversity info gr index php el lakes data the water bodies include both natural lakes and reservoirs and are distributed across the whole national territory fig 1 the surface area mean depth and the trophic status of each lake are listed in table s1 in supplementary material the surface area ranges between 0 5 to 274 km2 and the mean depth from 0 9 m to 47 8 m the total phosphorus concentration exhibits a wide variation ranging from 7 4 to 550 μg l 1 thus the studied water bodies represent lakes and reservoirs of various sizes e g very small and shallow large and deep and trophic status oligotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic concerning the temporal coverage of the data all the field measurements were taken between march and october from 2013 to 2016 usually on a monthly or bimonthly basis thus we assumed that the lake related variables can only capture the effect of short climate deviations and are not affected by large changes in the hydrology or geomorphology e g water depth that usually occur in larger periods e g more than 10 years choulga et al 2019 to confirm our hypothesis we checked for significant differences for all parameters among years and only 10 m wind speed and precipitation were statistically different anova test p 0 05 however these differences were attributed to random climate variability e g very high annual precipitation in a certain year descriptive statistics of the chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass measurements are listed in the supplementary table s2 additional details on the lake features and water chemistry can be found in the article of mavromati et al 2018 we accessed time series of era5 land climate and lake related variables on average monthly basis from january of 2013 to september of 2019 muñoz sabater 2019 the time series extraction was conducted for the nearest grid cell to the centroid of the lake applying the nearest neighbor interpolation algorithm kyriakidis et al 2001 specifically we extracted the following variables zonal component of the 10 m wind meridional component of the 10 m wind total surface and subsurface runoff precipitation 2 m air temperature lake bottom temperature lake mix layer temperature lake mix layer depth lake total layer temperature and lake shape factor for precipitation and total runoff we edited the native average monthly data to calculate the accumulated monthly values for each month average monthly 10 m wind speed was calculated through the zonal and meridional components of the 10 m wind to be used in further analysis furthermore to account for the variability of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass between natural lakes and artificial impoundments we used the type of the water body natural vs reservoir as a factor variable the type of the water body can explain variations in phytoplankton due to differences in nutrient levels and lake morphometry since reservoirs are usually deep and oligotrophic opposed to shallower and more eutrophic natural lakes table s1 then we matched the available chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass measurements with monthly values of the climate reanalysis data based on the date of the sampling for the spatial match of measurements with the gridded climate data the nearest neighbor interpolation algorithm was also applied thus we generated two datasets one containing 640 cases of chlorophyll a paired with monthly values of the climate related variables and another containing 452 cases of phytoplankton biomass also paired with climate related variables prior to the model development we tested the predictors for collinearity by calculating the variance inflation factor vif thereby air temperature and lake bottom temperature were stepwise excluded with the function vifstep of usdm package naimi et al 2014 until vif 5 was achieved for each variable leaving a total of seven climate related predictors table 1 because we were interested in developing both explanatory and predictive models for each modelling process we randomly split the data into a ratio 80 20 one named hereby as the training dataset that comprised 80 of the cases and was used for model development and the other named hereby as the validation dataset that comprised the remainder 20 of the cases and was used for the evaluation of the predictive ability of the models the 80 20 splitting ratio is commonly used in modelling studies for splitting the data into a training and validation dataset ahmed et al 2019 su et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 2 2 development of models boosted regression trees and generalized additive models for location scale and shape to examine the relative contribution of the climate related variables to the variance of chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton biomass we used two discrete modelling approaches i boosted regression trees brts and ii generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss here brt models were fitted for the training dataset in r version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 using the gbm step function of the dismo package v1 1 4 hijmans et al 2017 chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass were log transformed and set as response variables the era5 land parameters and the type of the water body natural reservoir were the model predictors learning rate bag fraction and tree complexity were adjusted to develop the best fitted model achieving at least 1000 trees following the rule of thumb suggested by elith et al 2008 then the validation dataset was used to investigate the model s predictive power using predict gbm function of the gbm package v2 1 5 greenwell et al 2020 we also applied generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss rigby et al 2005 as a complementary modelling approach the gamlss were fitted using the gamlss package v 5 1 6 with a cubic spline smoothing function stasinopoulos et al 2020 in r version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 log transformed chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass were set as response variables climate related variables and type natural reservoir as fixed factors and lake 50 different water bodies as random factor to identify the distribution that best fitted the response variable we used the fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 package thus the log normal distribution was identified as most suitable for chlorophyll a and the gamma distribution for phytoplankton biomass firstly the full model for each response variable was fitted using the training dataset to optimize the predictive performance the best fit model was selected using a generalized akaike information criterion gaic following a forward stepwise selection and backward elimination strategy of the variables for each of the distribution parameters finally the function predict gamlss was used for the validation dataset to test each model s predictive power 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal patterns of climate related parameters the climate parameters show a large spatial variability reflecting the unique character of the greek landscape which is shaped by a very large coastline and the prevalence of mountainous areas the climate is typical mediterranean but there is a clear discrimination mostly between southern eastern lowlands and northern western mountainous areas fig 2 where the latter are characterized by cold and wet winters with heavy snowfalls giannakopoulos et al 2011 naturally this climatic variability influences not only the hydrology of the lakes but also significant lake processes such as the thermal stratification the mixing regime and the productivity boxplots in figure 3 show the temporal variation of the climate related parameters that were used as phytoplankton growth predictors a seasonal pattern for temperature related variables lake total layer and mix layer temperature is apparent where the highest values occur in july and august and the lowest in january in particular average total layer temperature ranged from 4 5 c in january to 17 2 c in august similarly mix layer temperature ranged from 4 4 c in january to 23 6 c in august the boxplots also show that the range of the total layer temperatures is larger than the mix layer temperature particularly for the summer months consequently the mix layer depth follows a reverse pattern with lower values observed during summer and the largest values in winter december january and february concerning the 10 m wind speed it appears that it fluctuates through the year in an irregular manner without an obvious seasonal pattern the highest average wind speeds were observed in august and december 1 1 and 1 m s 1 respectively and the lowest in april 0 5 m s 1 precipitation and total runoff follow a clear seasonal variation as expected with high values in winter months that decline until the summer and then increase again until the winter peak specifically average monthly values of total runoff and precipitation ranged from 41 to 125 mm in january to 5 and 22 mm in august respectively in addition by comparing the monthly precipitation and total runoff it is apparent that the medians of precipitation are higher than the runoff with the latter exhibiting larger variability overall the climate related variables range within the expected limits for the region and display a normal temporal behavior with large seasonal differences for temperature and precipitation between summer and winter months interestingly enough the lake mixing depth and the mix layer temperature also showed a clear seasonal pattern indicating the direct influence of the seasonality on the lake mixing process 3 2 model derivation the brt model for chlorophyll a concentration had a mcfadden s pseudo r2 value of 0 735 indicating a very good fit the type of the lake the total layer temperature and the mix layer depth were the predictors with the higher relative influence 24 6 16 5 and 15 8 fig 4 respectively total runoff and precipitation followed with lower relative influence proportion 12 and 9 2 respectively while 10 m wind speed had the lowest relative influence proportion with a value of 9 1 concerning the model for the phytoplankton biomass it had also a high mcfadden s pseudo r2 value of 0 698 the type of the lake and the total layer temperature were the top two predictors with the highest relative influence 23 2 and 18 6 respectively fig 4 precipitation total runoff and mix layer depth followed with similar values of relative influence 12 2 12 1 and 11 6 respectively 10 m wind speed had the lowest relative influence proportion with a value of 6 7 to understand the complex relationships between the predictors and the response we produced partial dependence plots pdp in practice these plots illustrate graphically how each predictor affects the modelled response and they can be extremely useful for the interpretation of the outcome of black box models such as machine learning for a better interpretation of these plots rugs are displayed along the x axis that represent the deciles of the distribution of the training data thereby when examining the response to a predictor conclusion should be drawn for the area that corresponds to the range of the training data figures 5 and 6 show the pdp for chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass respectively for both models we can distinguish the clear effect of the water body type and total layer temperature on the fitted response where chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass are higher for natural lakes and are positively dependent on the total layer temperature precipitation and total runoff had a contrasting effect on both chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton biomass both response variables increased with precipitation but decreased with total runoff mix layer temperature and mix layer depth had a less profound effect on phytoplankton growth finally 10 m wind speed appears to have an unclear effect on both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass the full gamlss model for chlorophyll a had a cox snell s pseudo r squared value of 0 83 total layer temperature mix layer temperature and depth total runoff and type of the lake and precipitation were significant predictors p 0 001 and p 0 006 for precipitation table 2 in particular total layer temperature and precipitation had a positive effect on chlorophyll a whereas mix layer depth mix layer temperature and total runoff had a negative effect fig 7 the full model for phytoplankton biomass had a lower pseudo r squared value cox snell s r2 0 74 and only two significant predictors total runoff and type of water body yet both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass showed similar partial responses to all predictors fig 7 and fig 8 concerning the best fit models that were selected after a forward stepwise selection and backward elimination strategy of the variables both models had higher pseudo r squared values than their full model counterparts the best gamlss for chlorophyll a retained mix layer depth mix layer temperature total layer temperature 10 m wind speed and total runoff as predictors table 2 with all being significant p 0 001 the model had a high pseudo r squared value cox snell s r2 0 89 indicating a good fit mix layer temperature and total runoff had a negative effect on chlorophyll a while total layer temperature and mix layer depth had a positive effect 10 m wind speed appeared to have a small negative effect on chlorophyll a concentration fig s1 in supplementary material in regard to the best gamlss for phytoplankton biomass the best model had also a high pseudo r squared value cox snell s r2 0 86 compared to the chlorophyll a model the lake shape factor and the type of the water body were additionally retained as significant predictors p 0 001 mix layer depth total layer temperature lake shape factor 10 m wind speed and the total runoff had a negative effect while mix layer temperature had a positive effect finally the lake type natural vs reservoir had a clear effect as phytoplankton biomass was significantly lower in reservoirs than natural lakes fig s2 in supplementary material 3 3 cross validation of models to evaluate the performance of the models we used the validation dataset and then we checked the accuracy of the predictability using three metrics we estimated the r2 for the predicted versus the observed values and we calculated the mean absolute error mae and the root mean squared error rmse for the brts and the best fit gamlss models the mae and rmse were normalized with the range maximum minus minimum value of the observed data to facilitate comparison between the various models table 3 both the brt and gamlss models for chlorophyll a outperformed those for phytoplankton biomass the brt model for chlorophyll a yielded a cross validation cv r2 of 0 42 while for phytoplankton biomass cv r2 was 0 27 in addition both the normalized rmse and mae were lower 0 19 and 0 14 versus 0 24 and 0 19 in regard to the gamlss models the one for chlorophyll a had a cv r2 of 0 81 while the model for phytoplankton biomass a cv r2 of 0 71 when comparing the performance of the brt models against the gamlss all the evaluation metrics indicate a better predictability for the generalized additive models table 3 the gamlss model for chlorophyll a in particular showed an even larger cv r2 when considering the lake reservoirs separately from the natural lakes 0 89 for reservoirs vs 0 63 for natural lakes and 0 81 for both water bodies fig 9 based on these results we deduce that regardless of the modelling approach the derived models yield better prediction results for the chlorophyll a than the phytoplankton biomass it also seems that the predictions made from the gamlss had a smaller error than those of brts the gamlss models showed a far greater predictability than the brt models probably because they account for the random variability among the lakes overall all the models with the exception of the brt model for phytoplankton biomass yielded rather moderate to high r2 values suggesting a considerably good predictive ability fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 era5 land climate variables as predictors of algal growth in lakes with this study we examined the relative contribution of different era5 land climate variables to the variation of phytoplankton growth in a set of lakes and reservoirs of the mediterranean region most importantly we evaluated the usefulness of climate reanalysis data as proxy metrics for climate variables in limnological studies besides climatic factors the type of the lake was highlighted as a key explanatory parameter this finding underlines the importance of other factors that can explain the variability of the algal biomass in lakes for one thing the nutrients are widely considered the most important driver of algal growth especially in natural lakes which are susceptible to human induced eutrophication in addition natural lakes usually have larger water residence time than reservoirs that in many cases is associated with increased phytoplankton biomass concerning the modelled response of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass to the climate related predictors our results were rather equivocal particularly when comparing the best fit gamlss models with the brts first for chlorophyll a brts revealed the type of the lake and the total layer temperature as top predictors followed by mix layer depth and total runoff whereas gamlss showed mix layer depth mix layer temperature total layer temperature as the significant predictors p 0 001 with the largest influence however if we examine the results of the full model then there are not any substantial differences with the brts the type of the water body total layer temperature mix layer depth precipitation and total runoff are all significant predictors and show similar type of effect on chlorophyll a when it comes to phytoplankton biomass both modelling approaches had less explanatory power and highlighted different climate variables as most important descriptors concerning the results of the best gamlss models chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass showed a contrasting response to certain climate predictors e g mixing depth and mix layer temperature yet the partial responses of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass for the full models are very similar these discrepancies between the best fit and the full models suggest that the latter have better explanatory capacity as they are more consistent in showing the same effects another interesting finding concerns the higher explanatory and predictive power for the chlorophyll a models compared to the phytoplankton for one this could imply that chlorophyll a might be considered as a better indicator in terms of consistency of results between different modelling approaches furthermore the observed differences between chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass models could be because these two metrics although are commonly used as indicators of algal growth can often present large discrepancies there is evidence from the literature showing that the chlorophyll a content in phytoplankton varies considerably with the season and particularly depends strongly on the light availability and the solar radiation desortová 1981 pridmore and hewitt 1984 vörös and padisák 1991 this in practice means that the relationship between chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass can be highly variable and that changes in chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass may not occur simultaneously in the following sections we discuss thoroughly specific findings with emphasis placed on the response of phytoplankton to era5 land climate variables within the context of climate change 4 2 water temperature and mixing regime this study highlights the key importance of water temperature and mixing regime for phytoplankton growth in lakes other climate related variables e g precipitation and 10 m wind speed had a lesser contribution there are numerous studies that have shown the significance of temperature in promoting phytoplankton proliferation beaulieu et al 2013 hayes et al 2020 kärcher et al 2020 with many of these studies pinpointing the implications for eutrophication enhancement due to climate warming furthermore the relative importance of water temperature over other key factors of phytoplankton growth has been highlighted in several studies for example liu et al 2019 showed that temperature was the most important predictor of phytoplankton variation at a daily scale surpassing the role of nutrients as a key driver of phytoplankton biomass this is important because abrupt changes e g changes that occur in a few days are more likely to occur for temperature than nutrients and therefore to affect metabolic rates of phytoplankton temperature also affects phytoplankton indirectly mostly because it regulates the vertical mixing processes higher mix layer temperature and smaller mixing depth indicate stronger stratification which means that vertical mixing between epilimnion and hypolimnion is more difficult to occur boehrer and schultze 2008 thereby as climate gets warmer the temperature difference between epilimnion and hypolimnion will increase this means that lake stratification will last longer and mixing will be more difficult to occur woolway and merchant 2019 such a change in the patterns of vertical mixing is expected to cause important changes in lake processes and particularly in the oxygenation of the hypolimnion and the nutrient circulation from hypolimnion to epilimnion posch et al 2012 yankova et al 2017 recent evidence has already pointed out that the mixing regime of lakes has altered as a consequence of climate warming for instance dimictic lakes are more likely to mix once a year as freezing during winter becomes less frequent woolway et al 2020 woolway and merchant 2019 here we used two climate reanalysis variables that reflect lake mixing processes the mix layer temperature and mix layer depth smaller mixing layer depths indicate higher resistance of water column to vertical mixing due to stratification thus a seasonal variation of mixing depth was expected for most of the lakes with a thicker layer observed during the colder months and a thinner layer observed in summer a reverse pattern was expected for mix layer temperature with higher values during the summer and lower during the cold months this pattern was confirmed for the era5 land data we used in this analysis fig 3 which means that they can capture the variation in lake mixing our results also showed that both phytoplankton metrics were negatively associated with mix layer depth this finding suggests that higher phytoplankton growth occurs in shallow lakes where the whole water column can mix and in deeper lakes during thermal stratification when the mix layer is limited to the epilimnion the surface layer of the lake shallow polymictic lakes are known to exhibit increased phytoplankton productivity borics et al 2013 kosten et al 2012 particularly under conditions of nutrient enrichment in deeper lakes stratification is likely to promote algal growth in lakes that receive external nutrient inputs because it prevents phytoplankton to sink to the aphotic zone kraemer et al 2017 with this regard experimental evidence from previous studies have showed a clear negative effect of mixing depth on phytoplankton productivity berger et al 2007 which corroborates our finding yet we have to mention that the lake mixing variables that are included in the era5 land database carry a certain degree of uncertainty since they are produced by the fresh water lake model flake kirillin et al 2011 mironov et al 2010 which is implemented into the revised land surface hydrology htessel scheme balsamo et al 2011 2009 of the ifs integrated forecasting system model of ecmwf even so we consider that our analysis yielded quite robust results as the produced models managed to capture a significant portion of data variability and overall showed a moderate predictive capability 4 3 the role of wind speed and precipitation future changes in near surface wind speed are expected to play a crucial role in affecting the dynamics of algal growth and eutrophication in lakes wind is known to affect the benthic algae resuspension the stratification mechanisms and the nutrient availability jiang and xia 2017 here we found that 10 m wind speed had a small effect as it was ranked low by the brts and it had a relatively low influence on both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass according to the generalized additive models other studies have reported complex responses of chlorophyll a to wind speed variation for instance zhang et al 2017 reported that medians of chlorophyll a initially decreased and then increased with an increase of wind speed more recently rusak et al 2018 examined the role of wind speed in explaining algal biomass variability in lakes and they found that wind speed indeed plays a key role in explaining within lake algal biomass variability but when considering among lakes variability the trophic status had a larger effect similarly deng et al 2019 noted that wind played a vital role in shaping phytoplankton communities in a large lake in china during spring and winter while for summer and autumn nutrients prevailed overall there is evidence that the wind effect on phytoplankton dynamics is complex and seems to depend on the temporal resolution of the measurements and seasonal variations in limnological processes the exact effect of wind speeds on lake dynamics becomes more complex when considering the role of the lake s shape and morphology thus wind induced mixing effects are more likely to occur in shallow and large lakes where the wind fetch is larger and the lake volume is more susceptible to mixing stockwell et al 2020 in our case many of the studied lakes are rather deep and have a relatively small surface area and fetch which indicates that they are more resistant to wind mixing effects we consider more likely to identify a clearer influence of wind speed on lake phytoplankton growth in shallow lakes when using model generated wind data at higher temporal resolution e g on daily basis in other words when aggregating wind speeds to monthly intervals a significant portion of information concerning the dynamics of wind is lost in practice it means that we cannot capture the impact of wind changes usually associated with alternations between mild and severe weather conditions on the dynamics of phytoplankton concerning the precipitation and total runoff there are examples in the literature that have explored their influence on phytoplankton growth and lake productivity in general high precipitation is often considered as a driver of nutrient enrichment of lakes particularly of those that are located within an agricultural setting total runoff volume is a more accurate depiction of the amount of water that ends in the lake in other words it shows the inflows in the lake which can affect phytoplankton growth with several ways higher inflows may have a dilution effect averting the excessive growth of phytoplankton this will occur especially when the dilution water is low nutrient and washes out algae according to our results the precipitation had a rather low relative influence in brts and it was a significant predictor only for the full gamlss model of chlorophyll a however all the partial effects of precipitation on both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass were consistent showing a positive effect this relationship has been evidenced by numerous limnological analyses bosch et al 2014 jeppesen et al 2009 sinha et al 2017 and shows that high precipitation is linked with higher inputs of nutrients in water bodies that enhance algal growth concerning the total runoff we found a negative effect on both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass total runoff here represents the total water accumulated due to surface runoff and groundwater discharge most of the water bodies included in our analysis receive lateral and sub surface flows particularly for the reservoirs their hydrology is mostly influenced by the riverine inflow which in most cases is driven by groundwater flow thus total runoff is not a very good estimate of the nutrients that end in the water body in addition what is important to consider is that for water bodies such as reservoirs a high total runoff likely means a high water renewal rate or short residence time this practically means that there is not enough time for phytoplankton to grow excessively in other words the predictors of precipitation and total runoff show different aspects of the hydrology as the first is related with the surface runoff while the latter is related with the total amount of water that is stored in the water body and the water renewal rate 4 4 predictability of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass and related uncertainty the main objective of this study was to explore the potential use of era5 land climate and lake related variables in limnological modelling we developed models to test causal relationships between climate related variables and phytoplankton metrics and at the same time we evaluated their predictive capability overall the models had a relatively high explanatory power and presented a good predictive performance these findings are promising for future limnological studies as they bring forth new perspectives in modelling ecosystem responses to a wide range of climate and limnological variables e g lake mix layer depth such studies could investigate the climate change impact on lakes by either exploring historical trends e g using long term time series of climate related variables combined with actual ecological measurements or by using predictive modelling and scenarios of climate projections for predicting the future ecological response stefanidis et al 2018 the drawback in these studies concerns the inherent uncertainty that accompanies both the estimation of climate reanalysis variables and the predictive performance of the derived ecological models particularly the lake variables are computed globally at a horizontal resolution 0 1 x 0 1 at each grid box the lake depth is specified with either a known in situ value e g obtained from the global lake database or with a default 25 m value if the lake depth is unknown thus for certain cases the estimated mixing depth might be inaccurate with this regard in the future more lake depths will be updated with actual measurements and the default value will change from 25 to 10 m this is expected to improve significantly the accuracy of the estimated lake variables choulga et al 2019 toptunova et al 2019 furthermore models that are optimized for prediction e g machine learning approaches may not be suitable for identifying causal relationships between climatic factors and biological responses shmueli 2010 this distinction between predictive and theoretical modelling could partly explain some unexpected results concerning the effects of certain predictors on the phytoplankton responses 5 conclusions our study showed that climate reanalysis and era5 land in particular offers a wide array of various climatic parameters at a fine spatial resolution and a relatively high temporal resolution for modelling the chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass variability in response to the climate among the climatic predictors total layer water temperature and mixing depth had a substantial contribution in explaining the total variance of chlorophyll a followed by total runoff precipitation and 10 m wind speed yet the type of the lake e g natural vs reservoir which partly reflects the different degree of anthropogenic influences e g nutrient enhancement and the temporal scale of the climatic variables aggregated on monthly basis should be taken into consideration when thoroughly discussing our findings for instance it is very likely that models that are based on measurements at higher temporal resolution e g on daily basis can reveal stronger responses of algal biomass to the dynamics of certain climate variables such as the wind speed furthermore the inherent uncertainty that accompanies the estimation of climate reanalysis can provide an explanation for the relatively moderate predictive performance of the models and the contrasting findings concerning the partial effects of certain predictors as a concluding remark climate reanalysis can be an asset in lake modelling which creates new opportunities for limnological studies aquatic ecologists and environmental scientists can take advantage of the era5 land database to conduct studies that explore historical trends of climate and significant ecological changes or predict ecological responses to scenarios of climate projections thereby we consider climate reanalysis as a powerful tool for limnological studies particularly when conducting research that explores the

17090,understanding the climatic drivers of eutrophication is critical for lake management under the prism of the global change yet the complex interplay between climatic variables and lake processes makes prediction of phytoplankton biomass a rather difficult task quantifying the relative influence of climate related variables on the regulation of phytoplankton biomass requires modelling approaches that use extensive field measurements paired with accurate meteorological observations in this study we used climate and lake related variables obtained from the era5 land reanalysis dataset combined with a large dataset of in situ measurements of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass from 50 water bodies to develop models of phytoplankton related responses as functions of the climate reanalysis data we used chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass as response metrics of phytoplankton growth and we employed two different modelling techniques boosted regression trees brt and generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss according to our results the fitted models had a relatively high explanatory power and predictive performance boosted regression trees had a high pseudo r2 with the type of the lake the total layer temperature and the mix layer depth being the three predictors with the higher relative influence the best gamlss model retained mix layer depth mix layer temperature total layer temperature total runoff and 10 m wind speed as significant predictors p 0 001 regarding the phytoplankton biomass both modelling approaches had less explanatory power than those for chlorophyll a concerning the predictive performance of the models both the brt and gamlss models for chlorophyll a outperformed those for phytoplankton biomass overall we consider these findings promising for future limnological studies as they bring forth new perspectives in modelling ecosystem responses to a wide range of climate and lake variables as a concluding

trees generalized additive models climate reanalysis 1 introduction lake eutrophication is a major environmental problem that persists in many areas of the world and is related with multiple implications for ecosystem functioning and provision of services to human societies ho et al 2019 jeppesen et al 2015 schindler 2006 smith et al 1999 excessive nutrient loading is considered the main driver of eutrophication which is often characterized by the abrupt algal biomass growth and the appearance of algal blooms heisler et al 2008 wurtsbaugh et al 2019 naturally limnologists and environmental scientists have placed emphasis on the relative role of phosphorus and nitrogen on shaping phytoplankton community dynamics and boosting algal biomass nevertheless there is evidence that climate related variables play an important role on determining phytoplankton biomass proliferation hao et al 2018 lürling et al 2017 taranu et al 2012 studies focusing on the impacts of climate change on lake ecosystems have revealed that climate warming changes in rainfall patterns and changes in wind speed may affect phytoplankton assemblages in various ways woolway et al 2020 increased water temperature in temperate lakes can promote phytoplankton growth by strengthening the stratification of the water column reducing the thickness and the duration of the ice cap and prolonging the open water season woolway and merchant 2019 changes in rainfall patterns may have various effects on phytoplankton growth in regions where precipitation will increase the surface runoff will boost the nutrient loads that end in the lakes leading to higher phytoplankton biomass jeppesen et al 2009 moss 2011 sinha et al 2017 furthermore recent evidence show that a projected decline of the annual mean wind speed adrian et al 2018 deng et al 2018 mcvicar et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 could enhance eutrophication processes and promote the occurrence of algal blooms on the other hand more frequent and severe storms may enhance flushing and cause destratification of the water column suppressing algal growth and averting algal blooms stockwell et al 2020 to date several studies have assessed the relative importance of climate variables versus nutrients for the phytoplankton growth in lakes some of them have highlighted the overarching effect of phosphorus over climatic factors while others suggest that water temperature and changes in mixing processes may be of higher importance for phytoplankton assemblages bartosiewicz et al 2019 deng et al 2019 kärcher et al 2020 it becomes obvious that although understanding the drivers of phytoplankton growth is critical for lake management and mitigation of eutrophication the complex interplay between climatic variables and lake processes makes prediction of phytoplankton biomass a rather difficult task undoubtedly quantifying the relative influence of climate related variables on the regulation of phytoplankton biomass is a challenging feat that requires the development of sophisticated models based on extensive field measurements and meteorological observations to this end climate reanalysis offers the unique capability of using high quality estimates of climatic parameters for conducting interdisciplinary research that combines variations of atmosphere ocean and land christakos et al 2020a 2020b frauenfeld et al 2005 mentzafou et al 2019 varlas et al 2017 a climate reanalysis gives a numerical description of the recent climate status produced by combining models with observations and applying advanced numerical algorithms it contains estimates of atmospheric parameters such as temperature relative humidity precipitation radiation and wind components as well as ocean parameters such as wave height and sea surface temperature the estimates are produced for the entire earth and they span a long time period that can extend back several decades although climate reanalysis is becoming a popular source of climate data to date there are very few studies that employ the use of these data in the science of limnology free et al 2020 particularly the era5 land dataset muñoz sabater 2019 is one of the most modern and finest reanalysis datasets produced by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf within the copernicus climate change service c3s the era5 land dataset is a replay of the land component of the era5 climate reanalysis data hersbach et al 2020 masked on land at the native horizontal resolution of 9 km it provides reliable information useful for spatial and climatic analyses as well as applications on various cross disciplinary studies e g pelosi et al 2020 the era5 land data can be downloaded by the c3s at hourly or monthly temporal scale covering a period from 1981 to present the fine temporal and spatial resolutions of era5 land make this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface applications such as flood or drought study water cycle modelling air land interaction analysis etc furthermore the ecmwf includes the lake parameterization with the integration of the fresh water lake model flake into its integrated forecasting system ifs to accurately represent fresh water lakes choulga et al 2019 thus a series of lake related parameters are produced and also included in era5 land dataset they can be used to describe key limnological processes such as the total layer temperature the mix layer temperature the mix layer depth and the bottom water temperature in this study we used climate and lake related variables included in the era5 land dataset combined with in situ measurements of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass from 50 water bodies to develop models of phytoplankton related responses as functions of climate reanalysis data in particular we employed boosted regression trees brt and generalized additive models for locations scale and shape gamlss brts are a powerful analysis tool that has increased predictive power against other models such as generalized linear models classification and regression trees leclere et al 2011 and generalized additive models leathwick et al 2006 because it uses both decision tree algorithms and gradient boosting methods to improve the accuracy of the model in addition brt offers the advantage of fitting complex nonlinear relationships while being robust to missing values and outliers elith et al 2008 gamlss are semi parametric regression type models where all the parameters of the response variable distribution can be modelled as additive functions of the explanatory variables and random factors thus gamlss are efficient in modelling response variables that show heterogeneity or do not follow an exponential family distribution stasinopoulos et al 2017 furthermore gamlss models account for the variance of random factors and data autocorrelation both modelling approaches are widely used in ecology because are capable of fitting complex non linear responses karaouzas et al 2019 stefanidis et al 2019 our aim was twofold as we first investigated the explanatory power of the models by assessing the relative contribution of climate related variables to the chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton biomass in lakes and second we tested their potential predictability to ascertain whether climate reanalysis data can be used in predictive models thereby models were fitted to explore the structure of our data and to test hypotheses regarding the effect of climate related variables on phytoplankton growth we hypothesized that the lake temperature would be the dominant climate related variable explaining the phytoplankton growth and that other climatic variables would have a smaller contribution furthermore by employing two discrete modelling approaches we compared their predictive performance and we assessed the usefulness of climate reanalysis data in predicting two common metrics of lake eutrophication ideally reanalyzed data could be used in monitoring and forecasting of phytoplankton proliferation including algal blooms according to lake management schemes that aim to prevent further deterioration of water quality and avert environmental hazard we consider the use of era5 land climate reanalysis data in lake modelling as a strong and innovative approach for delineating the relative contribution of climate related parameters in the lake eutrophication processes at the same time the current study links with the help of machine learning based brts and gamlss large scale climate and lake related variables produced by the emcwf with actual field observations of chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton biomass our work demonstrates that the era5 land lake related parameters can be used effectively in building meaningful ecological and limnological models that interpret the effect of climate on phytoplankton biomass and have strong predictive capability we think that this is highly significant for water researchers because it brings forth new perspectives to the lake sciences particularly when investigating the responses of the lakes to climate variability and future climate change 2 methods 2 1 description and compilation of data we compiled a dataset of 640 measurements of chlorophyll a concentration and 452 measurements of phytoplankton biomass from 50 water bodies of greece the measurements were collected from 2013 to 2016 under the national lake monitoring programme according to the implementation of the water framework directive the data are freely accessible in the following site http biodiversity info gr index php el lakes data the water bodies include both natural lakes and reservoirs and are distributed across the whole national territory fig 1 the surface area mean depth and the trophic status of each lake are listed in table s1 in supplementary material the surface area ranges between 0 5 to 274 km2 and the mean depth from 0 9 m to 47 8 m the total phosphorus concentration exhibits a wide variation ranging from 7 4 to 550 μg l 1 thus the studied water bodies represent lakes and reservoirs of various sizes e g very small and shallow large and deep and trophic status oligotrophic eutrophic and hypereutrophic concerning the temporal coverage of the data all the field measurements were taken between march and october from 2013 to 2016 usually on a monthly or bimonthly basis thus we assumed that the lake related variables can only capture the effect of short climate deviations and are not affected by large changes in the hydrology or geomorphology e g water depth that usually occur in larger periods e g more than 10 years choulga et al 2019 to confirm our hypothesis we checked for significant differences for all parameters among years and only 10 m wind speed and precipitation were statistically different anova test p 0 05 however these differences were attributed to random climate variability e g very high annual precipitation in a certain year descriptive statistics of the chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass measurements are listed in the supplementary table s2 additional details on the lake features and water chemistry can be found in the article of mavromati et al 2018 we accessed time series of era5 land climate and lake related variables on average monthly basis from january of 2013 to september of 2019 muñoz sabater 2019 the time series extraction was conducted for the nearest grid cell to the centroid of the lake applying the nearest neighbor interpolation algorithm kyriakidis et al 2001 specifically we extracted the following variables zonal component of the 10 m wind meridional component of the 10 m wind total surface and subsurface runoff precipitation 2 m air temperature lake bottom temperature lake mix layer temperature lake mix layer depth lake total layer temperature and lake shape factor for precipitation and total runoff we edited the native average monthly data to calculate the accumulated monthly values for each month average monthly 10 m wind speed was calculated through the zonal and meridional components of the 10 m wind to be used in further analysis furthermore to account for the variability of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass between natural lakes and artificial impoundments we used the type of the water body natural vs reservoir as a factor variable the type of the water body can explain variations in phytoplankton due to differences in nutrient levels and lake morphometry since reservoirs are usually deep and oligotrophic opposed to shallower and more eutrophic natural lakes table s1 then we matched the available chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass measurements with monthly values of the climate reanalysis data based on the date of the sampling for the spatial match of measurements with the gridded climate data the nearest neighbor interpolation algorithm was also applied thus we generated two datasets one containing 640 cases of chlorophyll a paired with monthly values of the climate related variables and another containing 452 cases of phytoplankton biomass also paired with climate related variables prior to the model development we tested the predictors for collinearity by calculating the variance inflation factor vif thereby air temperature and lake bottom temperature were stepwise excluded with the function vifstep of usdm package naimi et al 2014 until vif 5 was achieved for each variable leaving a total of seven climate related predictors table 1 because we were interested in developing both explanatory and predictive models for each modelling process we randomly split the data into a ratio 80 20 one named hereby as the training dataset that comprised 80 of the cases and was used for model development and the other named hereby as the validation dataset that comprised the remainder 20 of the cases and was used for the evaluation of the predictive ability of the models the 80 20 splitting ratio is commonly used in modelling studies for splitting the data into a training and validation dataset ahmed et al 2019 su et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 2 2 development of models boosted regression trees and generalized additive models for location scale and shape to examine the relative contribution of the climate related variables to the variance of chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton biomass we used two discrete modelling approaches i boosted regression trees brts and ii generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss here brt models were fitted for the training dataset in r version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 using the gbm step function of the dismo package v1 1 4 hijmans et al 2017 chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass were log transformed and set as response variables the era5 land parameters and the type of the water body natural reservoir were the model predictors learning rate bag fraction and tree complexity were adjusted to develop the best fitted model achieving at least 1000 trees following the rule of thumb suggested by elith et al 2008 then the validation dataset was used to investigate the model s predictive power using predict gbm function of the gbm package v2 1 5 greenwell et al 2020 we also applied generalized additive models for location scale and shape gamlss rigby et al 2005 as a complementary modelling approach the gamlss were fitted using the gamlss package v 5 1 6 with a cubic spline smoothing function stasinopoulos et al 2020 in r version 3 6 3 r core team 2020 log transformed chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass were set as response variables climate related variables and type natural reservoir as fixed factors and lake 50 different water bodies as random factor to identify the distribution that best fitted the response variable we used the fitdistrplus delignette muller and dutang 2015 package thus the log normal distribution was identified as most suitable for chlorophyll a and the gamma distribution for phytoplankton biomass firstly the full model for each response variable was fitted using the training dataset to optimize the predictive performance the best fit model was selected using a generalized akaike information criterion gaic following a forward stepwise selection and backward elimination strategy of the variables for each of the distribution parameters finally the function predict gamlss was used for the validation dataset to test each model s predictive power 3 results 3 1 spatial and temporal patterns of climate related parameters the climate parameters show a large spatial variability reflecting the unique character of the greek landscape which is shaped by a very large coastline and the prevalence of mountainous areas the climate is typical mediterranean but there is a clear discrimination mostly between southern eastern lowlands and northern western mountainous areas fig 2 where the latter are characterized by cold and wet winters with heavy snowfalls giannakopoulos et al 2011 naturally this climatic variability influences not only the hydrology of the lakes but also significant lake processes such as the thermal stratification the mixing regime and the productivity boxplots in figure 3 show the temporal variation of the climate related parameters that were used as phytoplankton growth predictors a seasonal pattern for temperature related variables lake total layer and mix layer temperature is apparent where the highest values occur in july and august and the lowest in january in particular average total layer temperature ranged from 4 5 c in january to 17 2 c in august similarly mix layer temperature ranged from 4 4 c in january to 23 6 c in august the boxplots also show that the range of the total layer temperatures is larger than the mix layer temperature particularly for the summer months consequently the mix layer depth follows a reverse pattern with lower values observed during summer and the largest values in winter december january and february concerning the 10 m wind speed it appears that it fluctuates through the year in an irregular manner without an obvious seasonal pattern the highest average wind speeds were observed in august and december 1 1 and 1 m s 1 respectively and the lowest in april 0 5 m s 1 precipitation and total runoff follow a clear seasonal variation as expected with high values in winter months that decline until the summer and then increase again until the winter peak specifically average monthly values of total runoff and precipitation ranged from 41 to 125 mm in january to 5 and 22 mm in august respectively in addition by comparing the monthly precipitation and total runoff it is apparent that the medians of precipitation are higher than the runoff with the latter exhibiting larger variability overall the climate related variables range within the expected limits for the region and display a normal temporal behavior with large seasonal differences for temperature and precipitation between summer and winter months interestingly enough the lake mixing depth and the mix layer temperature also showed a clear seasonal pattern indicating the direct influence of the seasonality on the lake mixing process 3 2 model derivation the brt model for chlorophyll a concentration had a mcfadden s pseudo r2 value of 0 735 indicating a very good fit the type of the lake the total layer temperature and the mix layer depth were the predictors with the higher relative influence 24 6 16 5 and 15 8 fig 4 respectively total runoff and precipitation followed with lower relative influence proportion 12 and 9 2 respectively while 10 m wind speed had the lowest relative influence proportion with a value of 9 1 concerning the model for the phytoplankton biomass it had also a high mcfadden s pseudo r2 value of 0 698 the type of the lake and the total layer temperature were the top two predictors with the highest relative influence 23 2 and 18 6 respectively fig 4 precipitation total runoff and mix layer depth followed with similar values of relative influence 12 2 12 1 and 11 6 respectively 10 m wind speed had the lowest relative influence proportion with a value of 6 7 to understand the complex relationships between the predictors and the response we produced partial dependence plots pdp in practice these plots illustrate graphically how each predictor affects the modelled response and they can be extremely useful for the interpretation of the outcome of black box models such as machine learning for a better interpretation of these plots rugs are displayed along the x axis that represent the deciles of the distribution of the training data thereby when examining the response to a predictor conclusion should be drawn for the area that corresponds to the range of the training data figures 5 and 6 show the pdp for chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass respectively for both models we can distinguish the clear effect of the water body type and total layer temperature on the fitted response where chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass are higher for natural lakes and are positively dependent on the total layer temperature precipitation and total runoff had a contrasting effect on both chlorophyll a concentration and phytoplankton biomass both response variables increased with precipitation but decreased with total runoff mix layer temperature and mix layer depth had a less profound effect on phytoplankton growth finally 10 m wind speed appears to have an unclear effect on both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass the full gamlss model for chlorophyll a had a cox snell s pseudo r squared value of 0 83 total layer temperature mix layer temperature and depth total runoff and type of the lake and precipitation were significant predictors p 0 001 and p 0 006 for precipitation table 2 in particular total layer temperature and precipitation had a positive effect on chlorophyll a whereas mix layer depth mix layer temperature and total runoff had a negative effect fig 7 the full model for phytoplankton biomass had a lower pseudo r squared value cox snell s r2 0 74 and only two significant predictors total runoff and type of water body yet both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass showed similar partial responses to all predictors fig 7 and fig 8 concerning the best fit models that were selected after a forward stepwise selection and backward elimination strategy of the variables both models had higher pseudo r squared values than their full model counterparts the best gamlss for chlorophyll a retained mix layer depth mix layer temperature total layer temperature 10 m wind speed and total runoff as predictors table 2 with all being significant p 0 001 the model had a high pseudo r squared value cox snell s r2 0 89 indicating a good fit mix layer temperature and total runoff had a negative effect on chlorophyll a while total layer temperature and mix layer depth had a positive effect 10 m wind speed appeared to have a small negative effect on chlorophyll a concentration fig s1 in supplementary material in regard to the best gamlss for phytoplankton biomass the best model had also a high pseudo r squared value cox snell s r2 0 86 compared to the chlorophyll a model the lake shape factor and the type of the water body were additionally retained as significant predictors p 0 001 mix layer depth total layer temperature lake shape factor 10 m wind speed and the total runoff had a negative effect while mix layer temperature had a positive effect finally the lake type natural vs reservoir had a clear effect as phytoplankton biomass was significantly lower in reservoirs than natural lakes fig s2 in supplementary material 3 3 cross validation of models to evaluate the performance of the models we used the validation dataset and then we checked the accuracy of the predictability using three metrics we estimated the r2 for the predicted versus the observed values and we calculated the mean absolute error mae and the root mean squared error rmse for the brts and the best fit gamlss models the mae and rmse were normalized with the range maximum minus minimum value of the observed data to facilitate comparison between the various models table 3 both the brt and gamlss models for chlorophyll a outperformed those for phytoplankton biomass the brt model for chlorophyll a yielded a cross validation cv r2 of 0 42 while for phytoplankton biomass cv r2 was 0 27 in addition both the normalized rmse and mae were lower 0 19 and 0 14 versus 0 24 and 0 19 in regard to the gamlss models the one for chlorophyll a had a cv r2 of 0 81 while the model for phytoplankton biomass a cv r2 of 0 71 when comparing the performance of the brt models against the gamlss all the evaluation metrics indicate a better predictability for the generalized additive models table 3 the gamlss model for chlorophyll a in particular showed an even larger cv r2 when considering the lake reservoirs separately from the natural lakes 0 89 for reservoirs vs 0 63 for natural lakes and 0 81 for both water bodies fig 9 based on these results we deduce that regardless of the modelling approach the derived models yield better prediction results for the chlorophyll a than the phytoplankton biomass it also seems that the predictions made from the gamlss had a smaller error than those of brts the gamlss models showed a far greater predictability than the brt models probably because they account for the random variability among the lakes overall all the models with the exception of the brt model for phytoplankton biomass yielded rather moderate to high r2 values suggesting a considerably good predictive ability fig 9 4 discussion 4 1 era5 land climate variables as predictors of algal growth in lakes with this study we examined the relative contribution of different era5 land climate variables to the variation of phytoplankton growth in a set of lakes and reservoirs of the mediterranean region most importantly we evaluated the usefulness of climate reanalysis data as proxy metrics for climate variables in limnological studies besides climatic factors the type of the lake was highlighted as a key explanatory parameter this finding underlines the importance of other factors that can explain the variability of the algal biomass in lakes for one thing the nutrients are widely considered the most important driver of algal growth especially in natural lakes which are susceptible to human induced eutrophication in addition natural lakes usually have larger water residence time than reservoirs that in many cases is associated with increased phytoplankton biomass concerning the modelled response of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass to the climate related predictors our results were rather equivocal particularly when comparing the best fit gamlss models with the brts first for chlorophyll a brts revealed the type of the lake and the total layer temperature as top predictors followed by mix layer depth and total runoff whereas gamlss showed mix layer depth mix layer temperature total layer temperature as the significant predictors p 0 001 with the largest influence however if we examine the results of the full model then there are not any substantial differences with the brts the type of the water body total layer temperature mix layer depth precipitation and total runoff are all significant predictors and show similar type of effect on chlorophyll a when it comes to phytoplankton biomass both modelling approaches had less explanatory power and highlighted different climate variables as most important descriptors concerning the results of the best gamlss models chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass showed a contrasting response to certain climate predictors e g mixing depth and mix layer temperature yet the partial responses of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass for the full models are very similar these discrepancies between the best fit and the full models suggest that the latter have better explanatory capacity as they are more consistent in showing the same effects another interesting finding concerns the higher explanatory and predictive power for the chlorophyll a models compared to the phytoplankton for one this could imply that chlorophyll a might be considered as a better indicator in terms of consistency of results between different modelling approaches furthermore the observed differences between chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass models could be because these two metrics although are commonly used as indicators of algal growth can often present large discrepancies there is evidence from the literature showing that the chlorophyll a content in phytoplankton varies considerably with the season and particularly depends strongly on the light availability and the solar radiation desortová 1981 pridmore and hewitt 1984 vörös and padisák 1991 this in practice means that the relationship between chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass can be highly variable and that changes in chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass may not occur simultaneously in the following sections we discuss thoroughly specific findings with emphasis placed on the response of phytoplankton to era5 land climate variables within the context of climate change 4 2 water temperature and mixing regime this study highlights the key importance of water temperature and mixing regime for phytoplankton growth in lakes other climate related variables e g precipitation and 10 m wind speed had a lesser contribution there are numerous studies that have shown the significance of temperature in promoting phytoplankton proliferation beaulieu et al 2013 hayes et al 2020 kärcher et al 2020 with many of these studies pinpointing the implications for eutrophication enhancement due to climate warming furthermore the relative importance of water temperature over other key factors of phytoplankton growth has been highlighted in several studies for example liu et al 2019 showed that temperature was the most important predictor of phytoplankton variation at a daily scale surpassing the role of nutrients as a key driver of phytoplankton biomass this is important because abrupt changes e g changes that occur in a few days are more likely to occur for temperature than nutrients and therefore to affect metabolic rates of phytoplankton temperature also affects phytoplankton indirectly mostly because it regulates the vertical mixing processes higher mix layer temperature and smaller mixing depth indicate stronger stratification which means that vertical mixing between epilimnion and hypolimnion is more difficult to occur boehrer and schultze 2008 thereby as climate gets warmer the temperature difference between epilimnion and hypolimnion will increase this means that lake stratification will last longer and mixing will be more difficult to occur woolway and merchant 2019 such a change in the patterns of vertical mixing is expected to cause important changes in lake processes and particularly in the oxygenation of the hypolimnion and the nutrient circulation from hypolimnion to epilimnion posch et al 2012 yankova et al 2017 recent evidence has already pointed out that the mixing regime of lakes has altered as a consequence of climate warming for instance dimictic lakes are more likely to mix once a year as freezing during winter becomes less frequent woolway et al 2020 woolway and merchant 2019 here we used two climate reanalysis variables that reflect lake mixing processes the mix layer temperature and mix layer depth smaller mixing layer depths indicate higher resistance of water column to vertical mixing due to stratification thus a seasonal variation of mixing depth was expected for most of the lakes with a thicker layer observed during the colder months and a thinner layer observed in summer a reverse pattern was expected for mix layer temperature with higher values during the summer and lower during the cold months this pattern was confirmed for the era5 land data we used in this analysis fig 3 which means that they can capture the variation in lake mixing our results also showed that both phytoplankton metrics were negatively associated with mix layer depth this finding suggests that higher phytoplankton growth occurs in shallow lakes where the whole water column can mix and in deeper lakes during thermal stratification when the mix layer is limited to the epilimnion the surface layer of the lake shallow polymictic lakes are known to exhibit increased phytoplankton productivity borics et al 2013 kosten et al 2012 particularly under conditions of nutrient enrichment in deeper lakes stratification is likely to promote algal growth in lakes that receive external nutrient inputs because it prevents phytoplankton to sink to the aphotic zone kraemer et al 2017 with this regard experimental evidence from previous studies have showed a clear negative effect of mixing depth on phytoplankton productivity berger et al 2007 which corroborates our finding yet we have to mention that the lake mixing variables that are included in the era5 land database carry a certain degree of uncertainty since they are produced by the fresh water lake model flake kirillin et al 2011 mironov et al 2010 which is implemented into the revised land surface hydrology htessel scheme balsamo et al 2011 2009 of the ifs integrated forecasting system model of ecmwf even so we consider that our analysis yielded quite robust results as the produced models managed to capture a significant portion of data variability and overall showed a moderate predictive capability 4 3 the role of wind speed and precipitation future changes in near surface wind speed are expected to play a crucial role in affecting the dynamics of algal growth and eutrophication in lakes wind is known to affect the benthic algae resuspension the stratification mechanisms and the nutrient availability jiang and xia 2017 here we found that 10 m wind speed had a small effect as it was ranked low by the brts and it had a relatively low influence on both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass according to the generalized additive models other studies have reported complex responses of chlorophyll a to wind speed variation for instance zhang et al 2017 reported that medians of chlorophyll a initially decreased and then increased with an increase of wind speed more recently rusak et al 2018 examined the role of wind speed in explaining algal biomass variability in lakes and they found that wind speed indeed plays a key role in explaining within lake algal biomass variability but when considering among lakes variability the trophic status had a larger effect similarly deng et al 2019 noted that wind played a vital role in shaping phytoplankton communities in a large lake in china during spring and winter while for summer and autumn nutrients prevailed overall there is evidence that the wind effect on phytoplankton dynamics is complex and seems to depend on the temporal resolution of the measurements and seasonal variations in limnological processes the exact effect of wind speeds on lake dynamics becomes more complex when considering the role of the lake s shape and morphology thus wind induced mixing effects are more likely to occur in shallow and large lakes where the wind fetch is larger and the lake volume is more susceptible to mixing stockwell et al 2020 in our case many of the studied lakes are rather deep and have a relatively small surface area and fetch which indicates that they are more resistant to wind mixing effects we consider more likely to identify a clearer influence of wind speed on lake phytoplankton growth in shallow lakes when using model generated wind data at higher temporal resolution e g on daily basis in other words when aggregating wind speeds to monthly intervals a significant portion of information concerning the dynamics of wind is lost in practice it means that we cannot capture the impact of wind changes usually associated with alternations between mild and severe weather conditions on the dynamics of phytoplankton concerning the precipitation and total runoff there are examples in the literature that have explored their influence on phytoplankton growth and lake productivity in general high precipitation is often considered as a driver of nutrient enrichment of lakes particularly of those that are located within an agricultural setting total runoff volume is a more accurate depiction of the amount of water that ends in the lake in other words it shows the inflows in the lake which can affect phytoplankton growth with several ways higher inflows may have a dilution effect averting the excessive growth of phytoplankton this will occur especially when the dilution water is low nutrient and washes out algae according to our results the precipitation had a rather low relative influence in brts and it was a significant predictor only for the full gamlss model of chlorophyll a however all the partial effects of precipitation on both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass were consistent showing a positive effect this relationship has been evidenced by numerous limnological analyses bosch et al 2014 jeppesen et al 2009 sinha et al 2017 and shows that high precipitation is linked with higher inputs of nutrients in water bodies that enhance algal growth concerning the total runoff we found a negative effect on both chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass total runoff here represents the total water accumulated due to surface runoff and groundwater discharge most of the water bodies included in our analysis receive lateral and sub surface flows particularly for the reservoirs their hydrology is mostly influenced by the riverine inflow which in most cases is driven by groundwater flow thus total runoff is not a very good estimate of the nutrients that end in the water body in addition what is important to consider is that for water bodies such as reservoirs a high total runoff likely means a high water renewal rate or short residence time this practically means that there is not enough time for phytoplankton to grow excessively in other words the predictors of precipitation and total runoff show different aspects of the hydrology as the first is related with the surface runoff while the latter is related with the total amount of water that is stored in the water body and the water renewal rate 4 4 predictability of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass and related uncertainty the main objective of this study was to explore the potential use of era5 land climate and lake related variables in limnological modelling we developed models to test causal relationships between climate related variables and phytoplankton metrics and at the same time we evaluated their predictive capability overall the models had a relatively high explanatory power and presented a good predictive performance these findings are promising for future limnological studies as they bring forth new perspectives in modelling ecosystem responses to a wide range of climate and limnological variables e g lake mix layer depth such studies could investigate the climate change impact on lakes by either exploring historical trends e g using long term time series of climate related variables combined with actual ecological measurements or by using predictive modelling and scenarios of climate projections for predicting the future ecological response stefanidis et al 2018 the drawback in these studies concerns the inherent uncertainty that accompanies both the estimation of climate reanalysis variables and the predictive performance of the derived ecological models particularly the lake variables are computed globally at a horizontal resolution 0 1 x 0 1 at each grid box the lake depth is specified with either a known in situ value e g obtained from the global lake database or with a default 25 m value if the lake depth is unknown thus for certain cases the estimated mixing depth might be inaccurate with this regard in the future more lake depths will be updated with actual measurements and the default value will change from 25 to 10 m this is expected to improve significantly the accuracy of the estimated lake variables choulga et al 2019 toptunova et al 2019 furthermore models that are optimized for prediction e g machine learning approaches may not be suitable for identifying causal relationships between climatic factors and biological responses shmueli 2010 this distinction between predictive and theoretical modelling could partly explain some unexpected results concerning the effects of certain predictors on the phytoplankton responses 5 conclusions our study showed that climate reanalysis and era5 land in particular offers a wide array of various climatic parameters at a fine spatial resolution and a relatively high temporal resolution for modelling the chlorophyll a and phytoplankton biomass variability in response to the climate among the climatic predictors total layer water temperature and mixing depth had a substantial contribution in explaining the total variance of chlorophyll a followed by total runoff precipitation and 10 m wind speed yet the type of the lake e g natural vs reservoir which partly reflects the different degree of anthropogenic influences e g nutrient enhancement and the temporal scale of the climatic variables aggregated on monthly basis should be taken into consideration when thoroughly discussing our findings for instance it is very likely that models that are based on measurements at higher temporal resolution e g on daily basis can reveal stronger responses of algal biomass to the dynamics of certain climate variables such as the wind speed furthermore the inherent uncertainty that accompanies the estimation of climate reanalysis can provide an explanation for the relatively moderate predictive performance of the models and the contrasting findings concerning the partial effects of certain predictors as a concluding remark climate reanalysis can be an asset in lake modelling which creates new opportunities for limnological studies aquatic ecologists and environmental scientists can take advantage of the era5 land database to conduct studies that explore historical trends of climate and significant ecological changes or predict ecological responses to scenarios of climate projections thereby we consider climate reanalysis as a powerful tool for limnological studies particularly when conducting research that explores the

nitrogen residual in wwtps effluent after biological treatment which might result in eutrophication if directly discharged without any advanced treatment xin et al 2010 unfortunately as a typical wastewater with low c n ratio little available organic carbon can be offered by wwtps effluent for biological denitrification process therefore the effective technologies for advanced nitrogen removal of wwtps effluent are urgently needed cao et al 2016 owing to the efficient treatment performance and convenient management solid phase denitrification has received extensive attention and acted as a promising approach for advanced nitrogen removal from groundwater aquaculture wastewater and wwtps effluent chu and wang 2016 liu et al 2018 yang et al 2020b in solid phase denitrification systems natural plant like materials and synthetic biodegradable polymers are the most commonly used solid carbon sources wang and chu 2016 the natural plant like materials such as woodchips corncob rice straw and rice hulls are cheap and easily available but the excessive release of dissolved organic carbons in the initial stage and deficiency of organics carbon supply in the latter operation limit their application feng et al 2017 wang and chu 2016 zhao et al 2018 a series of synthetic biodegradable polymers such as phbv poly butylene succinate pbs polycaprolactone pcl and polylactic acid pla have been used as biofilm carrier and carbon source of denitrifiers chu and wang 2013 wu et al 2013 zou et al 2017 but the higher denitrification costs than traditional processes limited their widespread application thus the eco friendly solid carbon sources with good bioavailability satisfying performance and low denitrification costs are needed to be developed blending biodegradable polymers with natural plant like materials or cheap biodegradable polymers can not only reduce the denitrification costs but also improve the biodegradability of carbon sources tokiwa et al 2009 recently several types of blended carbon sources including phbv pla starch pcl phbv starch and phbv bamboo powder have been prepared to balance denitrification costs and performance chu and wang 2016 shen et al 2013 wu et al 2012 however most of these blended carbon sources were used in laboratory scale solid phase denitrification systems feeding by synthetic wastewater limited information is available about nitrogen removal performance microbial community diversity and mechanisms of blended carbon sources for advanced nitrogen removal of real wwtps effluent in pilot scale solid phase denitrification system analyses of structure and function of microbial community in solid phase denitrification systems contribute to acquire deep insights into the mechanisms and involved nitrogen removal processes but conventional molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge generally fail to present enough information yang et al 2020a with the help of metagenomic sequencing the metabolic pathway and microbial mechanism in solid phase denitrification systems could be deeply explored which would provide scientific guidance for practical application in turn aalto et al 2020 ruan et al 2016 what s more the adenosine triphosphate atp and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh act as energy source and electron donor in microbial nitrogen removal are produced by microbial glycolysis mechanism su et al 2015 compared with synthetic polymers the blended carbon sources contain complex lignocellulosic components which might make a difference to microbial glycolysis and nitrogen removal performance however there is a lack of studies reported the metabolic pathways of nitrogen and glycolysis in solid phase denitrification systems supported by biomass blended carbon sources in this study the synthetic polymer phbv and biomass blended carbon source phbv sawdust were used for advanced nitrogen removal of wwtp effluent in pilot scale solid phase denitrification systems the biofilms attached to the surface of phbv and phbv sawdust were extracted to investigate the effect of solid carbon sources on microbial community structure and metabolic pathway by metagenomic sequencing therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the involved processes of nitrogen transformation and provide microbial evidence for nitrogen removal performance 2 to elucidate the effect of solid caron sources on the metabolism pathway of nitrogen and glycolysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale solid phase denitrification systems setup in this study two pilot scale solid phase denitrification systems made of cylindrical polyvinyl chloride with diameter of 20 cm and height of 140 cm were constructed in ningbo south district wastewater treatment plant ningbo china for advanced treatment of wwtp effluent the synthetic polymer phbv and its biomass blended carbon source phbv sawdust prepared according to yang et al 2020b were utilized as biofilm carriers and carbon sources phbv and phbv sawdust were evenly mixed with ceramsite 8 10 mm at 3 7 ratio v v respectively the mixed substrate was packed upon the supporting porous disk with 100 cm in height 2 2 experimental procedures the continuous experiments of pilot scale solid phase denitrification systems carried out with up flow mode for 150 days during start up period the mixture of wwtp effluent and activated sludge obtained from secondary sedimentation tank was fed into solid phase denitrification systems with volume ratio of 1 1 for biofilm culturing after that water quality of solid phase denitrification systems was analyzed every day it took 5 days that the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were below 1 0 and 2 0 mg l 1 respectively which means that the start up phase was complete and the solid phase denitrification systems started during the stage of 1 76 d the solid phase denitrification systems operated with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 h which was decreased to 1 5 h from 77 to 150 d in order to assess the durability of denitrification performance no phbv or phbv sawdust was added after the first addition during the operation the dissolved oxygen do and ph of wwtp effluent were 4 1 8 0 mg l 1 and 5 68 6 95 respectively the water samples of influent and effluent were collected every two days after filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane the nh4 n no3 n and no2 n of water samples were analyzed according to standard methods apha 2005 doc dissolved organic carbon was determined by a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan 2 3 biofilm sampling and dna extraction to reveal the microbial community structure and metabolic pathways biofilm samples of solid carbon sources were collected from five sampling points along the flow direction of systems at 150 day when systems operated stably with hrt of 1 5 h every 2 g of phbv or phbv sawdust was obtained from five samples of corresponding system and evenly mixed to one sample named as p and ps respectively each sample had three replicates the dna of sample was extracted using genomic dna extraction kit k201 bocai shanghai and stored at 80 c for subsequent sequencing analysis 2 4 metagenomic sequencing and annotation the metagenomic sequence library was constructed by majorbio inc shanghai china the extracted dna samples were fragmented to construct paired end sequencing library and performed sequencing analysis according to illumina s standard procedures the quality control of original sequencing data was performed using fastp software https github com opengene fastp and the short fragment sequence obtained after quality control was subjected to multiple hybrid splicing assembly using multiple megahit multiple hybrid splicing method subsequently metagene http metagene cb k u tokyo ac jp was used to predict the contigs in the splicing result by open reading frame orf noguchi et al 2006 the genes with the nucleic acid length greater than or equal to 100 bp were translated into amino acid sequences to obtain gene prediction results which were clustered using cd hit software

statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 19 0 spss chicago usa differences in parameters were confirmed by one way analysis of variance anova and p 0 05 indicated statistically significant difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 the optimal denitrification performance in different systems the performances of nitrogen removal and doc release under different hrt were shown in table 1 as the major component of influent nitrogen the average concentrations of no3 n were 9 53 1 43 mg l 1 and 9 94 1 17 mg l 1 under different hrt of 3 h and 1 5 h respectively while only a small amount of nh4 n was detected in influent what s more the organic matters remained in influent after biological treatment of wwtps was too little to furnish the advanced nitrogen removal with the supplement of electron donors derived from solid carbon sources both systems achieved highly efficient removal of no3 n 92 36 and 96 64 respectively for phbv and phbv sawdust systems with the hrt of 3 h the higher nitrate removal efficiency in phbv sawdust system could contribute to the improvement of bioavailability by blending phbv with sawdust which was beneficial to attachment of microorganisms and biodegradation of solid organic carbons chu and wang 2016 shen et al 2013 higher doc and nh4 n concentrations were revealed in phbv system than phbv sawdust system the average doc concentration of phbv sawdust system was 15 49 12 09 mg l 1 which declined to 9 00 4 16 mg l 1 after hrt was adjusted to 1 5 h the average doc concentration of phbv sawdust was lower than phbv starch 25 90 8 50 mg l 1 but higher than phbv bp 8 90 5 00 mg l 1 the increased doc derived from the hydrolysis of solid carbon sources and soluble microbial products chu and wang 2013 2016 when the rates of doc release exceeded the rates of microbial utilization redundant doc would be discharged with effluent and deteriorate water quality in solid phase denitrification a part of soluble organic substrates was used in the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra which competes with denitrification and converts no3 n to nh4 n rather than n2 moreover high c n ratios in bioreactor are considered to facilitate the growth and reproduction of dnra organisms and result in more nh4 n generation rijn et al 2006 after the hrt was adjusted to1 5 h phbv and phbv sawdust systems still maintained the effective no3 n removal performance of 95 57 and 96 58 respectively which indicated the stable operation of solid phase denitrification systems the concentrations of nh4 n accumulated in effluent of phbv sawdust system declined to 0 37 0 32 mg l 1 which was much lower than that in phbv system 1 14 0 37 mg l 1 3 2 the effect of different solid carbon sources on the structure of microbial community a total of 2 62 108 raw reads with 3 96 1010 raw bases were obtained from the samples of p 1 p 2 and p 3 and the raw reads of ps 1 ps 2 and ps 3 were 2 49 108 raw reads with 3 75 1010 raw bases by metagenome sequencing table s1 after quality control more than 98 85 and 98 08 of raw reads and bases were reserved respectively therefore the sequence after quality control could truly and effectively reflect the genetic information of the sample s genomic dna and ensure the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analysis results based on the results of nr species annotations bacteria accounting for 97 53 99 06 of the total species dominated in each sample table s2 the proportions of bacteria and virus in phbv sawdust system were significantly lower than that in phbv system p 0 05 while the proportions of archaea and eukaryote obtained obviously quantitative advantage in phbv sawdust system p 0 05 the main phyla with relative abundance greater than 1 00 in phbv system and phbv sawdust system are shown in fig 1 a significant differences of microbial composition at phylum level were shown between phbv system and phbv sawdust proteobacteria dominated in phbv system and phbv sawdust system with the proportions of 78 96 and 50 05 respectively in phbv system bacteroidetes was the second dominant phylum 3 63 followed by firmicutes 3 27 chloroflexi 2 87 actinobacteria 1 37 acidobacteria 1 24 and spirochaetae 1 19 while actinobacteria was the second dominant phylum 10 61 in phbv sawdust system followed by chloroflexi 7 36 bacteroidetes 5 33 planctomycetes 2 73 acidobacteria 2 65 firmicutes 2 34 ignavibacteriae 2 04 gemmatimonadetes 2 07 cyanobacteria 1 33 nitrospirae 1 40 and euryarchaeota 1 36 proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and chloroflexi are widely present in municipal sewage treatment systems and play an important role in biodegradation tian et al 2015 most of denitrification bacteria was affiliated to proteobacteria which conduct a predominant role in denitrification karanasios et al 2010 some enzymes synthesized by actinobacteria could facilitate the decomposition process of polysaccharides or phenolic compounds contained in plant biomass chater et al 2010 chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are considered to have the ability to break down macromolecules which were generally observed in fermentation system bjornsson et al 2002 nakasaki et al 2009 the higher abundance of chloroflexi actinobacteria and bacteroidetes observed in phbv sawdust system might owing to the refractory biomass it is worth mentioning that euryarchaeota was detected in phbv sawdust system with the relative abundance of 1 36 euryarchaeota bacteroidete and firmicutes are the main bacterial groups in the medium temperature fermentation system packed with corn stover and chicken manure moreover euryarchaeota contains rich and diverse classes of methanogenic bacteria which produce methane in anaerobic fermentation systems li et al 2013 therefore a small fraction of organic matters might be converted into methane through anaerobic fermentation rather than denitrification in phbv sawdust system the compositions of microbial community in phbv system and phbv sawdust system at genus level are depicted in fig 1b dechloromonas achieved the highest proportion of 36 91 in phbv system followed by desulfovibrio 3 82 magnetospirillum 2 90 azoarcus 1 56 geobacter 1 20 thaurea 1 19 azonexus 1 16 and candidatus accumulibacter 1 08 in phbv sawdust system dechloromonas also was the most abundant genus with the highest proportion of 3 00 followed by sulfuritalea 2 64 bradyrhizobium 1 96 ignavibacterium 1 81 gemmatimonas 1 51 candidatus accumulibacter 1 46 conexibacter 1 31 and nitrospira 1 23 dechloromonas thauera ignavibacterium and nitrospira could metabolize nitrogen and aromatic compounds which are commonly detected in sewage treatment systems tian et al 2015 dechloromonas was considered to be solid phase denitrifier which could use lignocellulose as carbon sources feng et al 2017 desulfovibrio was generally observed in anaerobic system which was able to participate in dnra feng et al 2017 and consist with higher nh4 n in effluent of phbv system the difference analysis of microbial composition in phbv and phbv sawdust systems is shown in fig 2 among the top 15 phyla only proteobacteria and spirochaetae obtained significantly higher relative abundance in phbv system p 0 05 while most of other phyla mainly distributed in phbv sawdust system among the top15 genera dechloromonas desulfovibrio magnetospirillum azoarcus geobacter and pseudomonos were apparently enriched in phbv system p 0 05 the significant differences between phbv system and phbv sawdust system provided evidence for the nitrogen removal performance and function of microbial community in our previous study the possible coexistence of denitrification and anammox in phbv sawdust system was speculated according to obvious enrichment of nirs and amx 16s rrna genes which contributed to better control of nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon yang et al 2020b unfortunately no identified anammox bacteria was detected subject to the read length of 16s rrna sequencing in this study the results of nr species annotations indicated the presence of anammox bacteria including candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia candidatus scalindua and candidatus jettenia in phbv and phbv sawdust systems ali and okabe 2015 fig 3 candidatus brocadia was the most abundant anammox bacteria with highest relative abundance of 0 09 in phbv sawdust system while other anammox bacteria achieved lower relative abundance approximately 0 03 moreover all the detected anammox bacteria acquired obviously higher relative abundance in phbv sawdust system than phbv system p 0 05 which confirmed the coexistence of denitrification and anammox and more active anammox in phbv sawdust system availing the reduction of nh4 n accumulated in system effluent 3 3 the impact of different solid carbon sources on the pathways of nitrogen metabolism and glycolysis the relative abundances of coding genes for related enzymes in nitrogen metabolism are shown in fig 4 to better understand nitrogen metabolism and glycolysis the kegg pathways and relative abundances of coding genes for key enzymes were plotted fig s1 in denitrification pathway the genes coding for nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 had significantly higher relative abundance in phbv sawdust system p 0 05 which indicated the better nitrate removal performance and were consistent with lower no3 n in effluent the apparently higher relative abundance of coding genes for nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 in phbv sawdust system might contribute to less emission of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o for the metabolic pathway of dnra the relative abundance of coding genes for nitrite reductase enzyme ec 1 7 1 15 was obviously higher in phbv system 8 17 while the coding genes for nitrite reductase enzyme ec 1 7 2 2 had notably lower relative abundance in phbv system 0 80 than phbv sawdust system 2 09 p 0 05 in addition the gene coding for dinitrogenase ec 1 18 6 1 in phbv system 8 48 was prominently higher than that in phbv sawdust system 4 00 p 0 05 which indicated more active process of nh4 n generation in phbv system the hydroxylamine reductase enzyme ec 1 7 99 1 with observably higher relative abundance of 12 28 in phbv system is also capable of producing nh4 n overall the significantly higher relative abundance of genes coding for nh4 n generation in phbv system resulted in accumulation of nh4 n in effluent not only that the relative abundances of coding genes for hydrazine synthase ec 1 7 2 7 and hydrazine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 8 in phbv sawdust system responsible for regulating anammox were prominently higher than phbv system p 0 05 zhang et al 2020 thus the activity of anammox in phbv sawdust system was more active than phbv system which eliminated more nh4 n generated from dnra and mitigated the nh4 n accumulation in system effluent in a word the relative decrease in abundance of coding genes regulating the nh4 n production and the relative increase in abundance of coding genes regulating anammox in phbv sawdust system eventually resulted in less nh4 n accumulation in effluent denitrifying microbes acquire electrons through degrading carbon sources to guarantee the complete reduction of no3 n to n2 in the process of glycolysis glucokinase gk ec 2 7 1 2 and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh ec 1 2 1 59 are two important enzymes catalyzing the production of electron donors for denitrification su et al 2015 in the metabolic pathway of glycolysis the gene coding for gk ec 2 7 1 2 has significantly higher relative abundance in phbv system 2 73 than phbv sawdust system 2 47 p 0 05 gk is responsible for catalyzing the transformation of glucose to glucose 6 phosphate which is the first step of carbon source metabolism fu et al 2012 this might accelerate the hydrolysis of carbon source and lead to higher doc in phbv system effluent when the hydrolysis rate of solid carbon source is too rapid table 1 the relative abundance of coding gene for gapdh ec 1 2 1 59 in phbv sawdust system 0 18 is significantly higher than phbv system 0 04 p 0 05 gapdh can catalyze the vital conversion of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate in glycolysis and generate nadh which could act as electron donor for microbial denitrification li et al 2016 thus more electron donors might be generated and provided for nitrate removal in phbv sawdust system which was consist with the better nitrate removal performance in phbv sawdust system however the relative abundance of coding gene for phosphoglycerate kinase ec 2 7 2 3 and pyruvate kinase ec 2 7 1 40 in phbv system 3 49 and 3 63 respectively is distinctly higher than phbv sawdust system 2 64 and 3 39 respectively p 0 05 as the critical enzymes catalyzing the generation of atp yang et al 2020a the distinctly higher relative abundance of their coding genes might provide more available atp for microbial nitrification in phbv system while the relatively low do in solid phase denitrification system inhibited the microbial nitrification kartal et al 2013 microbial denitrification needs enough electrons to accomplish the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrogen the utilization of phbv sawdust guaranteed the supply of nadh which provided enough electrons for microbial denitrification compared with the stable carbon release of phbv sawdust more readily degradable carbon sources were released from the hydrolysis of phbv which contributed to higher doc concentrations in effluent of phbv system promoted the growth of dnra organisms but inhibited the reproduction of anammox bacteria and resulted in higher nh4 n accumulation in effluent 3 4 the annotated lignocellulases in different systems the relative abundance and difference analysis of the lignocellulases annotated in phbv system and phbv sawdust system are shown in fig 5 ten kinds of lignocellulases were annotated in two systems including five kinds of cellulases beta glucosidase cellulase alpha glucosidase cellobiose phosphorylase and cellulose 1 4 beta cellobiosidase four kinds of hemicellulase beta galactosidase alpha galactosidase alpha l arabinofuranosidase and beta glucuronidase and one kind of ligninase galactose oxidase most of these lignocellulases were dramatically enriched in phbv sawdust system p 0 05 except for cellobiose phosphorylase and galactose oxidase the selective enrichment of multiple lignocellulase in phbv sawdust system indicated more active lignocellulosic degradation which not only improved the resource utilization but also prevented the blockage of solid phase denitrification system and ensured the stable carbon supply for heterotrophic denitrification 4 conclusion the pilot scale solid phase denitrification system supporting with biomass blended carbon source phbv sawdust successfully achieved the advanced nitrogen removal of wwtps effluent with less adverse impact than phbv system metagenomic analyses indicated the relative decrease in abundance of coding genes regulating nh4 n production and the relative increase in abundance of coding genes regulating anammox in phbv sawdust system which eventually resulted in less nh4 n accumulation in system effluent compared with phbv the significantly higher relative abundance of gapdh ec 1 2 1 59 coding gene in phbv sawdust system facilitated the microbial denitrification the conspicuous enrichment of lignocellulases encoding genes in phbv sawdust system indicated more active lignocellulosic degradation which ensured the durable carbon source supply and stable operation of solid phase denitrification system as the first

have been used as biofilm carrier and carbon source of denitrifiers chu and wang 2013 wu et al 2013 zou et al 2017 but the higher denitrification costs than traditional processes limited their widespread application thus the eco friendly solid carbon sources with good bioavailability satisfying performance and low denitrification costs are needed to be developed blending biodegradable polymers with natural plant like materials or cheap biodegradable polymers can not only reduce the denitrification costs but also improve the biodegradability of carbon sources tokiwa et al 2009 recently several types of blended carbon sources including phbv pla starch pcl phbv starch and phbv bamboo powder have been prepared to balance denitrification costs and performance chu and wang 2016 shen et al 2013 wu et al 2012 however most of these blended carbon sources were used in laboratory scale solid phase denitrification systems feeding by synthetic wastewater limited information is available about nitrogen removal performance microbial community diversity and mechanisms of blended carbon sources for advanced nitrogen removal of real wwtps effluent in pilot scale solid phase denitrification system analyses of structure and function of microbial community in solid phase denitrification systems contribute to acquire deep insights into the mechanisms and involved nitrogen removal processes but conventional molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction pcr and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis dgge generally fail to present enough information yang et al 2020a with the help of metagenomic sequencing the metabolic pathway and microbial mechanism in solid phase denitrification systems could be deeply explored which would provide scientific guidance for practical application in turn aalto et al 2020 ruan et al 2016 what s more the adenosine triphosphate atp and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nadh act as energy source and electron donor in microbial nitrogen removal are produced by microbial glycolysis mechanism su et al 2015 compared with synthetic polymers the blended carbon sources contain complex lignocellulosic components which might make a difference to microbial glycolysis and nitrogen removal performance however there is a lack of studies reported the metabolic pathways of nitrogen and glycolysis in solid phase denitrification systems supported by biomass blended carbon sources in this study the synthetic polymer phbv and biomass blended carbon source phbv sawdust were used for advanced nitrogen removal of wwtp effluent in pilot scale solid phase denitrification systems the biofilms attached to the surface of phbv and phbv sawdust were extracted to investigate the effect of solid carbon sources on microbial community structure and metabolic pathway by metagenomic sequencing therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to explore the involved processes of nitrogen transformation and provide microbial evidence for nitrogen removal performance 2 to elucidate the effect of solid caron sources on the metabolism pathway of nitrogen and glycolysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale solid phase denitrification systems setup in this study two pilot scale solid phase denitrification systems made of cylindrical polyvinyl chloride with diameter of 20 cm and height of 140 cm were constructed in ningbo south district wastewater treatment plant ningbo china for advanced treatment of wwtp effluent the synthetic polymer phbv and its biomass blended carbon source phbv sawdust prepared according to yang et al 2020b were utilized as biofilm carriers and carbon sources phbv and phbv sawdust were evenly mixed with ceramsite 8 10 mm at 3 7 ratio v v respectively the mixed substrate was packed upon the supporting porous disk with 100 cm in height 2 2 experimental procedures the continuous experiments of pilot scale solid phase denitrification systems carried out with up flow mode for 150 days during start up period the mixture of wwtp effluent and activated sludge obtained from secondary sedimentation tank was fed into solid phase denitrification systems with volume ratio of 1 1 for biofilm culturing after that water quality of solid phase denitrification systems was analyzed every day it took 5 days that the effluent concentrations of nh4 n and no3 n were below 1 0 and 2 0 mg l 1 respectively which means that the start up phase was complete and the solid phase denitrification systems started during the stage of 1 76 d the solid phase denitrification systems operated with the hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 h which was decreased to 1 5 h from 77 to 150 d in order to assess the durability of denitrification performance no phbv or phbv sawdust was added after the first addition during the operation the dissolved oxygen do and ph of wwtp effluent were 4 1 8 0 mg l 1 and 5 68 6 95 respectively the water samples of influent and effluent were collected every two days after filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate membrane the nh4 n no3 n and no2 n of water samples were analyzed according to standard methods apha 2005 doc dissolved organic carbon was determined by a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan 2 3 biofilm sampling and dna extraction to reveal the microbial community structure and metabolic pathways biofilm samples of solid carbon sources were collected from five sampling points along the flow direction of systems at 150 day when systems operated stably with hrt of 1 5 h every 2 g of phbv or phbv sawdust was obtained from five samples of corresponding system and evenly mixed to one sample named as p and ps respectively each sample had three replicates the dna of sample was extracted using genomic dna extraction kit k201 bocai shanghai and stored at 80 c for subsequent sequencing analysis 2 4 metagenomic sequencing and annotation the metagenomic sequence library was constructed by majorbio inc shanghai china the extracted dna samples were fragmented to construct paired end sequencing library and performed sequencing analysis according to illumina s standard procedures the quality control of original sequencing data was performed using fastp software https github com opengene fastp and the short fragment sequence obtained after quality control was subjected to multiple hybrid splicing assembly using multiple megahit multiple hybrid splicing method subsequently metagene http metagene cb k u tokyo ac jp was used to predict the contigs in the splicing result by open reading frame orf noguchi et al 2006 the genes with the nucleic acid length greater than or equal to 100 bp were translated into amino acid sequences to obtain gene prediction results which were clustered using cd hit software http www bioinformatics org cd hit with the identity of 95 and the coverage of 90 the longest genes in each cluster were selected as representative sequences to construct non redundant gene sets fu et al 2012 the nr species annotation was performed using blastp software blast version 2 2 28 http blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi altschul et al 1997 and the kegg function annotation was carried out using blastp software blast version 2 2 28 http blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi kanehisa and goto 2000 the kobas 2 0 software was used to annotate the above comparison results xie et al 2011 2 5 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were conducted using spss 19 0 spss chicago usa differences in parameters were confirmed by one way analysis of variance anova and p 0 05 indicated statistically significant difference 3 results and discussion 3 1 the optimal denitrification performance in different systems the performances of nitrogen removal and doc release under different hrt were shown in table 1 as the major component of influent nitrogen the average concentrations of no3 n were 9 53 1 43 mg l 1 and 9 94 1 17 mg l 1 under different hrt of 3 h and 1 5 h respectively while only a small amount of nh4 n was detected in influent what s more the organic matters remained in influent after biological treatment of wwtps was too little to furnish the advanced nitrogen removal with the supplement of electron donors derived from solid carbon sources both systems achieved highly efficient removal of no3 n 92 36 and 96 64 respectively for phbv and phbv sawdust systems with the hrt of 3 h the higher nitrate removal efficiency in phbv sawdust system could contribute to the improvement of bioavailability by blending phbv with sawdust which was beneficial to attachment of microorganisms and biodegradation of solid organic carbons chu and wang 2016 shen et al 2013 higher doc and nh4 n concentrations were revealed in phbv system than phbv sawdust system the average doc concentration of phbv sawdust system was 15 49 12 09 mg l 1 which declined to 9 00 4 16 mg l 1 after hrt was adjusted to 1 5 h the average doc concentration of phbv sawdust was lower than phbv starch 25 90 8 50 mg l 1 but higher than phbv bp 8 90 5 00 mg l 1 the increased doc derived from the hydrolysis of solid carbon sources and soluble microbial products chu and wang 2013 2016 when the rates of doc release exceeded the rates of microbial utilization redundant doc would be discharged with effluent and deteriorate water quality in solid phase denitrification a part of soluble organic substrates was used in the process of dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra which competes with denitrification and converts no3 n to nh4 n rather than n2 moreover high c n ratios in bioreactor are considered to facilitate the growth and reproduction of dnra organisms and result in more nh4 n generation rijn et al 2006 after the hrt was adjusted to1 5 h phbv and phbv sawdust systems still maintained the effective no3 n removal performance of 95 57 and 96 58 respectively which indicated the stable operation of solid phase denitrification systems the concentrations of nh4 n accumulated in effluent of phbv sawdust system declined to 0 37 0 32 mg l 1 which was much lower than that in phbv system 1 14 0 37 mg l 1 3 2 the effect of different solid carbon sources on the structure of microbial community a total of 2 62 108 raw reads with 3 96 1010 raw bases were obtained from the samples of p 1 p 2 and p 3 and the raw reads of ps 1 ps 2 and ps 3 were 2 49 108 raw reads with 3 75 1010 raw bases by metagenome sequencing table s1 after quality control more than 98 85 and 98 08 of raw reads and bases were reserved respectively therefore the sequence after quality control could truly and effectively reflect the genetic information of the sample s genomic dna and ensure the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analysis results based on the results of nr species annotations bacteria accounting for 97 53 99 06 of the total species dominated in each sample table s2 the proportions of bacteria and virus in phbv sawdust system were significantly lower than that in phbv system p 0 05 while the proportions of archaea and eukaryote obtained obviously quantitative advantage in phbv sawdust system p 0 05 the main phyla with relative abundance greater than 1 00 in phbv system and phbv sawdust system are shown in fig 1 a significant differences of microbial composition at phylum level were shown between phbv system and phbv sawdust proteobacteria dominated in phbv system and phbv sawdust system with the proportions of 78 96 and 50 05 respectively in phbv system bacteroidetes was the second dominant phylum 3 63 followed by firmicutes 3 27 chloroflexi 2 87 actinobacteria 1 37 acidobacteria 1 24 and spirochaetae 1 19 while actinobacteria was the second dominant phylum 10 61 in phbv sawdust system followed by chloroflexi 7 36 bacteroidetes 5 33 planctomycetes 2 73 acidobacteria 2 65 firmicutes 2 34 ignavibacteriae 2 04 gemmatimonadetes 2 07 cyanobacteria 1 33 nitrospirae 1 40 and euryarchaeota 1 36 proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and chloroflexi are widely present in municipal sewage treatment systems and play an important role in biodegradation tian et al 2015 most of denitrification bacteria was affiliated to proteobacteria which conduct a predominant role in denitrification karanasios et al 2010 some enzymes synthesized by actinobacteria could facilitate the decomposition process of polysaccharides or phenolic compounds contained in plant biomass chater et al 2010 chloroflexi and bacteroidetes are considered to have the ability to break down macromolecules which were generally observed in fermentation system bjornsson et al 2002 nakasaki et al 2009 the higher abundance of chloroflexi actinobacteria and bacteroidetes observed in phbv sawdust system might owing to the refractory biomass it is worth mentioning that euryarchaeota was detected in phbv sawdust system with the relative abundance of 1 36 euryarchaeota bacteroidete and firmicutes are the main bacterial groups in the medium temperature fermentation system packed with corn stover and chicken manure moreover euryarchaeota contains rich and diverse classes of methanogenic bacteria which produce methane in anaerobic fermentation systems li et al 2013 therefore a small fraction of organic matters might be converted into methane through anaerobic fermentation rather than denitrification in phbv sawdust system the compositions of microbial community in phbv system and phbv sawdust system at genus level are depicted in fig 1b dechloromonas achieved the highest proportion of 36 91 in phbv system followed by desulfovibrio 3 82 magnetospirillum 2 90 azoarcus 1 56 geobacter 1 20 thaurea 1 19 azonexus 1 16 and candidatus accumulibacter 1 08 in phbv sawdust system dechloromonas also was the most abundant genus with the highest proportion of 3 00 followed by sulfuritalea 2 64 bradyrhizobium 1 96 ignavibacterium 1 81 gemmatimonas 1 51 candidatus accumulibacter 1 46 conexibacter 1 31 and nitrospira 1 23 dechloromonas thauera ignavibacterium and nitrospira could metabolize nitrogen and aromatic compounds which are commonly detected in sewage treatment systems tian et al 2015 dechloromonas was considered to be solid phase denitrifier which could use lignocellulose as carbon sources feng et al 2017 desulfovibrio was generally observed in anaerobic system which was able to participate in dnra feng et al 2017 and consist with higher nh4 n in effluent of phbv system the difference analysis of microbial composition in phbv and phbv sawdust systems is shown in fig 2 among the top 15 phyla only proteobacteria and spirochaetae obtained significantly higher relative abundance in phbv system p 0 05 while most of other phyla mainly distributed in phbv sawdust system among the top15 genera dechloromonas desulfovibrio magnetospirillum azoarcus geobacter and pseudomonos were apparently enriched in phbv system p 0 05 the significant differences between phbv system and phbv sawdust system provided evidence for the nitrogen removal performance and function of microbial community in our previous study the possible coexistence of denitrification and anammox in phbv sawdust system was speculated according to obvious enrichment of nirs and amx 16s rrna genes which contributed to better control of nitrogen and dissolved organic carbon yang et al 2020b unfortunately no identified anammox bacteria was detected subject to the read length of 16s rrna sequencing in this study the results of nr species annotations indicated the presence of anammox bacteria including candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia candidatus scalindua and candidatus jettenia in phbv and phbv sawdust systems ali and okabe 2015 fig 3 candidatus brocadia was the most abundant anammox bacteria with highest relative abundance of 0 09 in phbv sawdust system while other anammox bacteria achieved lower relative abundance approximately 0 03 moreover all the detected anammox bacteria acquired obviously higher relative abundance in phbv sawdust system than phbv system p 0 05 which confirmed the coexistence of denitrification and anammox and more active anammox in phbv sawdust system availing the reduction of nh4 n accumulated in system effluent 3 3 the impact of different solid carbon sources on the pathways of nitrogen metabolism and glycolysis the relative abundances of coding genes for related enzymes in nitrogen metabolism are shown in fig 4 to better understand nitrogen metabolism and glycolysis the kegg pathways and relative abundances of coding genes for key enzymes were plotted fig s1 in denitrification pathway the genes coding for nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 and nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 had significantly higher relative abundance in phbv sawdust system p 0 05 which indicated the better nitrate removal performance and were consistent with lower no3 n in effluent the apparently higher relative abundance of coding genes for nitrous oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 4 in phbv sawdust system might contribute to less emission of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o for the metabolic pathway of dnra the relative abundance of coding genes for nitrite reductase enzyme ec 1 7 1 15 was obviously higher in phbv system 8 17 while the coding genes for nitrite reductase enzyme ec 1 7 2 2 had notably lower relative abundance in phbv system 0 80 than phbv sawdust system 2 09 p 0 05 in addition the gene coding for dinitrogenase ec 1 18 6 1 in phbv system 8 48 was prominently higher than that in phbv sawdust system 4 00 p 0 05 which indicated more active process of nh4 n generation in phbv system the hydroxylamine reductase enzyme ec 1 7 99 1 with observably higher relative abundance of 12 28 in phbv system is also capable of producing nh4 n overall the significantly higher relative abundance of genes coding for nh4 n generation in phbv system resulted in accumulation of nh4 n in effluent not only that the relative abundances of coding genes for hydrazine synthase ec 1 7 2 7 and hydrazine dehydrogenase ec 1 7 2 8 in phbv sawdust system responsible for regulating anammox were prominently higher than phbv system p 0 05 zhang et al 2020 thus the activity of anammox in phbv sawdust system was more active than phbv system which eliminated more nh4 n generated from dnra and mitigated the nh4 n accumulation in system effluent in a word the relative decrease in abundance of coding genes regulating the nh4 n production and the relative increase in abundance of coding genes regulating anammox in phbv sawdust system eventually resulted in less nh4 n accumulation in effluent denitrifying microbes acquire electrons through degrading carbon sources to guarantee the complete reduction of no3 n to n2 in the process of glycolysis glucokinase gk ec 2 7 1 2 and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh ec 1 2 1 59 are two important enzymes catalyzing the production of electron donors for denitrification su et al 2015 in the metabolic pathway of glycolysis the gene coding for gk ec 2 7 1 2 has significantly higher relative abundance in phbv system 2 73 than phbv sawdust system 2 47 p 0 05 gk is responsible for catalyzing the transformation of glucose to glucose 6 phosphate which is the first step of carbon source metabolism fu et al 2012 this might accelerate the hydrolysis of carbon source and lead to higher doc in phbv system effluent when the hydrolysis rate of solid carbon source is too rapid table 1 the relative abundance of coding gene for gapdh ec 1 2 1 59 in phbv sawdust system 0 18 is significantly higher than phbv system 0 04 p 0 05 gapdh can catalyze the vital conversion of glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate to 3 phosphogylcerate in glycolysis and generate nadh which could act as electron donor for microbial denitrification li et al 2016 thus more electron donors might be generated and provided for nitrate removal in phbv sawdust system which was consist with the better nitrate removal performance in phbv sawdust system however the relative abundance of coding gene for phosphoglycerate kinase ec 2 7 2 3 and pyruvate kinase ec 2 7 1 40 in phbv system 3 49 and 3 63 respectively is distinctly higher than phbv sawdust system 2 64 and 3 39 respectively p 0 05 as the critical enzymes catalyzing the generation of atp yang et al 2020a the distinctly higher relative abundance of their coding genes might provide more available atp for microbial nitrification in phbv system while the relatively low do in solid phase denitrification system inhibited the microbial nitrification kartal et al 2013 microbial denitrification needs enough electrons to accomplish the dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nitrogen the utilization of phbv sawdust guaranteed the supply of nadh which provided enough electrons for microbial denitrification compared with the stable carbon release of phbv sawdust more readily degradable carbon sources were released from the hydrolysis of phbv which contributed to higher doc concentrations in effluent of phbv system promoted the growth of dnra organisms but inhibited the reproduction of anammox bacteria and resulted in higher nh4 n accumulation in effluent 3 4 the annotated lignocellulases in different systems the relative abundance and difference analysis of the lignocellulases annotated in phbv system and phbv sawdust system are shown in fig 5 ten kinds of lignocellulases were annotated in two systems including five kinds of cellulases beta glucosidase cellulase alpha glucosidase cellobiose phosphorylase and cellulose 1 4 beta cellobiosidase four kinds of hemicellulase beta galactosidase alpha galactosidase alpha l arabinofuranosidase and beta glucuronidase and one kind of ligninase galactose oxidase most of these lignocellulases were dramatically enriched in phbv sawdust system p 0 05 except for cellobiose phosphorylase and galactose oxidase the selective enrichment of multiple lignocellulase in phbv sawdust system indicated more active lignocellulosic degradation which not only improved the resource utilization but also prevented the blockage of solid phase denitrification system and ensured the stable carbon supply for heterotrophic denitrification 4 conclusion the pilot scale solid phase denitrification system supporting with biomass blended carbon source phbv sawdust successfully achieved the advanced nitrogen removal of wwtps effluent with less adverse impact than phbv system metagenomic analyses indicated the relative decrease in abundance of coding genes regulating nh4 n production and the relative increase in abundance of coding genes regulating anammox in phbv sawdust system which eventually resulted in less nh4 n accumulation in system effluent compared with phbv the significantly higher relative abundance of gapdh ec 1 2 1 59 coding gene in phbv sawdust system facilitated the microbial denitrification the conspicuous enrichment of lignocellulases encoding genes in phbv sawdust system indicated more active lignocellulosic degradation which ensured the durable carbon source supply and stable operation of solid phase denitrification system as the first study about the microbial metabolic mechanism in pilot scale solid phase denitrification system using biomass blended carbon source for advanced nitrogen removal of wwtps effluent this study provides

17092,heavy metal contamination has received increasing attention as a growing worldwide environmental problem traditional remediation methods are mainly based on adsorption precipitation and oxidation reduction which reduce the availability or toxicity of heavy metal ions microbe photocatalyst hybrids mph which behave as a semi artificial photosynthetic system integrate microbial cells with artificial photocatalysts for solar to chemical conversion a few very recent studies indicate that mph can be applied to treat organic contamination in water here we propose a novel idea that mph may also have great potential for solving heavy metal pollution heavy metals in wastewater could possibly be utilized to synthesize photocatalysts for mph by microbial mineralization photo induced electrons generated by photocatalysts in mph can be transferred into microbial cells to promote intracellular enzymatic reductions which allows heavy metal ions such as cr6 and se4 to be reduced and detoxified moreover heavy metal ions like as3 and sb3 can be used as sacrificial electron donors to maintain the continuous operation of the mph whereby these metal ions are simultaneously oxidized and detoxified the excellent potential of mph in the treatment of heavy metal polluted wastewater is explained and a solution based on mph is put forward as well as verified experimentally in this work this solution can realize electron transfer between different metal ions to simultaneously remediate multiple heavy metal ions in wastewater this finding may bring new hope for treating multiple heavy metal polluted wastewater in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbe photocatalyst hybrids heavy metal wastewater treatment photocatalysis biocatalysis 1 introduction heavy metal contamination is increasingly recognized as a serious worldwide environmental problem due to its high toxicity non biodegradability and bioaccumulation which seriously threatens human health and the stability of ecosystems yin et al 2019a in the last few decades a number of studies have developed a series of technologies for the remediation of heavy metal pollution such as chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane adsorption and oxidation reduction which remove the heavy metal ions from the environment or reduce their bioavailability by converting toxic heavy metal species into inactive states azimi et al 2017 however these technologies usually have drawbacks such as producing toxic chemical sludge causing secondary pollution high costs and so on therefore the emerging microbial remediation technologies have attracted great attention from scientists offering great advantages such as low cost and environmental friendliness yin et al 2019a microbes mainly remediate heavy metal pollution by adsorbing heavy metal ions via functional groups including carboxyl hydroxyl sulfhydryl amine and phosphonate yue et al 2015 or changing the redox state of heavy metal ions bahar et al 2016 gu et al 2015 the former reduces the concentration of bio available heavy metal ions by chelation or mineralization chaparro acuña et al 2018 and the latter selectively converts heavy metal ions with a toxic valence into ones with low toxicity by enzymatic reactions such as cr6 to cr3 gu et al 2015 and as3 to as5 bahar et al 2016 microbe photocatalyst hybrids mph were developed as semi artificial photosynthetic systems for solar to chemical conversion a typical mph system is mainly composed of microbial cells and photocatalytic materials deposited on their surface sakimoto et al 2016a guo et al 2018 under illumination the photocatalyst captures photons to generate electron hole pairs these electrons can enter the microbial cells through the electron transport system on the cell membrane such as the hydrogenase mediated pathway and cytochrome mediated pathway and are used by the microorganisms to synthesize target products through specific enzyme catalyzed reactions ye et al 2019 meanwhile the photogenerated holes are eliminated by reacting with an extracellular sacrificial electron donor sed which enables the photocatalyst to continue the photocatalytic reaction and ensures the continuous operation of the hybrid system sakimoto et al 2016b such a hybrid system avoids the limitations of biological systems such as low light conversion efficiency and high cost of carbon and electron sources for cell growth and maintenance as well as those of inorganic photocatalysis such as low selectivity and photo induced corrosion of photocatalytic materials during operation sakimoto et al 2016a what is more these hybrid systems have many other advantages including innate specific multi enzyme cascade biocatalysis self repair and adaptation to the environment wide light absorption spectrum and high efficiency in light usage fang et al 2020 to date many strategies have been developed to improve the efficiency of mph including 1 fabricating appropriate photocatalysts with wider spectral range and higher light capturing efficiency jiang et al 2018 2 modifying the metabolic pathways of microorganisms so that more carbon and electrons can be used for the synthesis of target products guo et al 2018 3 introducing an sed regeneration cycle to maintain the consistent productivity of mph sakimoto et al 2016b 4 improving the combination of photocatalytic materials and microorganisms to increase the transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons into microbial cells wei et al 2018 5 synthesizing photocatalytic materials in cells directly so that photocatalytic reactions can occur in cells to reduce the loss of electrons in the process of electron transfer zhang et al 2018 and 6 modularizing the photocatalysts and microorganisms then combining them in the desired order to construct an mph system that can produce multiple products flexibility ding et al 2019 based on these strategies mph has developed rapidly and has been widely used in energy development wei et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 and chemical manufacturing ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 as shown in table 1 in the field of environmental remediation a few recent studies utilized mph to remove organic dyes from wastewater and achieved remarkable results xiao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 however we did not find any studies employing mph for the treatment of heavy metal contaminated wastewater the aim of this paper is to 1 unveil the promising potential of mph for treating heavy metal polluted wastewater 2 present and preliminarily verify a feasible mph based approach which can directionally transfer electrons between different heavy metal ions and thus efficiently remediate multiple heavy metal pollutants in wastewater with the aid of solar energy and biocatalysis finally we discuss the challenges that this emerging technology may encounter in the future 2 heavy metal ions in wastewater could possibly be used for synthesizing the photocatalyst in mph with the rapid development of photocatalyst synthesis technology many kinds of metals have been used to fabricate or modify photocatalytic materials gupta and van huis 2019 cruz pacheco et al 2019 and some of them are heavy metals such as arsenic as zhu et al 2019 cadmium cd zhang et al 2020a chromium cr wardhana et al 2020 and lead pb kamakura et al 2019 in fact microbial sedimentation has long been a common remediation strategy for heavy metal pollution yin et al 2019a and many studies unintentionally deposited nanomaterials with photocatalytic activity on the surface of microorganisms in the process of treating heavy metal polluted wastewater for example bacillus lysine was reported to be able to mineralize pb2 into pbco3 and pb3 po4 2 crystals in acidic wastewater zhang et al 2020b while sulfate reducing bacteria can precipitate many potentially toxic metals such as zinc copper cadmium and cobalt from acidic mine waters into metal sulfide particles hedrich and johnson 2014 the inorganic nano photocatalytic materials produced by microorganisms usually have the advantages of controlled size uniform distribution and tight microbial bonding dahoumane et al 2017 and many of these studies were much earlier than the proposal of mph surprisingly apart from metal recycling few researchers contemplated the use of photocatalysts biosynthesized from wastewater and so far no one has used such a ready made mph system for further research even as mph has become a new research hotspot there are still few studies linking these two aspects interestingly the most commonly used photocatalyst for mph systems happens to be cadmium sulfide cds sakimoto et al 2016a ye et al 2019 wei et al 2018 while cadmium is known as one of the most problematic heavy metals for example sakimoto et al sakimoto et al 2016a 2016b built a classic mph system by precipitating cds nanoparticles on the surface of moorella thermoacetica a non photosynthetic bacterium and used it for oxygenic photosynthesis of acetic acid from co2 furthermore escherichia coli wei et al 2018 rhodopseudomonas palustris wang et al 2019 methanosarcina barkeri ye et al 2019 thiobacillus denitrificans chen et al 2019 and geobacter sulfurreducens huang et al 2019 were also decorated with cds nanoparticles to construct mph systems in addition to cadmium the emerging metallic contaminant indium which is mostly derived from electronics brun et al 2019 was also used for photocatalyst synthesis in mph systems however all these studies synthesized the photocatalyst by adding additional heavy metal ions instead of using heavy metal contaminated wastewater to provide metal ions the utilization of polluted water may contribute to reducing the costs and the treatment of heavy metal contaminated wastewater at the same time in summary we proposed to use heavy metal ions from polluted wastewater to synthesize photocatalysts for mph while achieving the mineralization of some metal pollutants the mph system can also further catalyze the oxidation reduction of other heavy metal pollutants with the aid of solar energy and biocatalysis and these aspects will be described in detail below 3 heavy metal ions that are toxic in high valence states can be reduced by mph many heavy metal ions such as cr6 and se4 show strong toxicity in high valence states and become significantly less toxic when these ions are reduced xia et al 2018 therefore reduction has become an effective remediation method for such heavy metal ions yin et al 2019a the core mechanism of mph is that the electrons generated by the photocatalyst on the cell surface enter the cell to promote intracellular enzymatic reduction reactions for the synthesis of target organic compounds sakimoto et al 2016a however in addition to organic metabolism many bacteria can also reduce inorganic heavy metal ions through enzymatic reactions to detoxify heavy metal pollutants yin et al 2019a for example pseudomonas putida sp1 can reduce reactive hg2 to hg0 using a reductase enzyme and thereby remediate mercury pollution in marine environments zhang et al 2012 in analogy to the synthesis of organic matter enzymatic reduction of metal ions also requires significant amounts of reducing power which is usually provided by nadh or nadph accordingly using solar energy to power the reduction of metal pollutants through mph is a concept with great potential what is more since contaminated sites usually contain multiple heavy metals many microorganisms have evolved the ability to tolerate and detoxify multiple heavy metals simultaneously rahman 2020 for example achromobacter sp ty3 4 can concurrently remove cr6 by bioreduction and mn2 by biooxidation and biosorption yin et al 2019b alishewanella sp wh16 1 a sulfate reducing bacterium can precipitate cd2 and pb2 into cds and pbs by reducing so4 2 to s2 xia et al 2016 at the same time it can also use a previously unknown reductase to simultaneously reduce cr6 into cr3 and se4 into se0 xia et al 2018 microorganisms such as achromobacter sp ty3 4 and alishewanella sp wh16 1 which can simultaneously mineralize metal ions outside the cell by forming mineral particles with photocatalytic potential as well as reduce other metal ions by intracellular enzymatic reactions are practically tailor made for mph systems therefore these microorganisms might work well in mph systems without any genetic engineering which further improves the safety and practicality of mph in the field of sewage treatment 4 heavy metal ions that are toxic in low valence states can be used as the sacrificial electron donors sed for mph sacrificial electron donors sed are indispensable for the long term functioning of mph system sakimoto et al 2016b during the operation of mph the photocatalysts generate electrons and transfer them into the cells while the concomitantly photo generated holes were accumulated in the photocatalyst if these holes cannot be neutralized they will hinder the subsequent generation of electrons and recombine with the newly generated electrons which will cause the photocatalysts to fail and reduce the operating efficiency of mph the addition of sed can solve this problem when the electrons enter the cell the holes are transferred to the sed and eliminated by the oxidation of the sed so that the photocatalysts can continue to provide electronics for microorganisms to ensure the continuous efficient operation of mph however the sed is continuously consumed during the operation of mph and will be exhausted at the late stage of fermentation which severely restricts the efficiency and durability of the mph system therefore screening superior sed and realizing their recycling is critical for improving the mph system sakimoto et al sakimoto et al 2016b loaded tio2 with the co catalyst mn ii phthalocyanine mnpc to couple water oxidation to cysteine reduction using this approach they realized the regeneration of cysteine which was added as an sed in the moorella thermoacetica cds hybrid system the introduction of this sed recycling system increased the yield of the target product acetic acid 3 fold heavy metal ions like as3 and sb3 may be suitable seds because they can be relatively easily oxidized he et al 2019 li et al 2016 moreover many studies have used photocatalytic reactions of inorganic semiconductor materials to realize the oxidation of as3 and sb3 pham et al 2020 kong et al 2016 contrary to cr6 and se4 some heavy metal ions such as as3 and sb3 show high toxicity in their low valence state accordingly if they are oxidized into a higher valence state as3 to as5 sb3 to sb5 their toxicity will decrease or they may even become probiotic elements bagade et al 2020 li et al 2017 in this way heavy metal ions like as3 and sb3 can be effective as seds in the mph system and become detoxified when they provide electrons for mph 5 a feasible concept to simultaneously remediate multiple heavy metal pollutants in wastewater using mph we propose a new concept of using mph as a promising way forward to simultaneously remediate multiple heavy metal pollutants in wastewater fig 1 a and b 1 selectively remove specific heavy metal ions such as cd2 pb2 cu2 zn2 or in3 from the wastewater by microbial mineralization and thereby synthesize metallic mineral particles with photocatalytic properties on the surface of the microorganisms to construct the mph system 2 use the synthesized photocatalytic nanomaterials to generate electrons under illumination and transfer these electrons into the microbial cells to promote the enzymatic reduction of metals that are toxic as high valence ions such as cr6 se4 in the wastewater 3 use metals that are toxic as low valence ions such as as3 and sb3 as seds for mph to maintain the continuous operation of the system while achieving the oxidative detoxification of these metals in order to verify the feasibility of the mph based heavy metal remediation concept we conducted exploratory proof of concept experiments bacillus thuringiensis hm 311 fig 1c was isolated from radiation and heavy metal polluted soil in our previous work this stain had good tolerance of multiple heavy metals zuo et al 2020 thus this extremophilic strain was selected to build an mph system with the potential to mineralize cd2 into cds in the presence of cysteine and reduce cr6 into cr3 via cysteine desulfurase crookes goodson et al 2008 and azoreductase he et al 2010 to synthesize the mph system the cultured b thuringiensis hm 311 cells were added into the simulated cd2 100 mg l contaminated wastewater 0 1 wt cysteine was supplied as sulfur source for the synthesis of cds photocatalyst 0 5 wt glucose 0 05 wt tryptone and 0 05 wt yeast extract were supplied as carbon and nitrogen sources sakimoto et al 2016a after 48 h of incubation b thuringiensis cds hybrids were successfully synthesized and confirmed by the results of energy dispersive x ray edx spectrum and x ray diffraction xrd spectrum fig 1d e ye et al 2019 wang et al 2019 we found 97 97 of cd2 was removed fig 1f importantly the addition of cysteine did not significantly change the concentration of cd2 in the absence of b thuringiensis while the cd2 concentration was decreased slightly in the presence of b thuringiensis without cysteine which was mainly attributed to cell adsorption and mineralization fig 1f then the b thuringiensis cds hybrids were added into a simulated cr6 100 mg l and as3 100 mg l co contaminated wastewater as described above essential carbon and nitrogen sources were supplemented as well and incubated under visible light the resulting b thuringiensis cds hybrids showed excellent heavy metal ion reduction oxidation capacity fig 1g and h after 24 h of incubation 92 25 of cr6 was reduced by the b thuringiensis cds hybrids under illumination with visible light which was more efficient than the reduction observed in the dark or with b thuringiensis only as expected as3 was simultaneously oxidized into as5 by the b thuringiensis cds hybrids and up to 62 74 mg l of as5 was detected by contrast only a small amount of as3 was oxidized in the control reactions notably when the cells of the b thuringiensis cds hybrid were inactivated a small amount of cr6 or as3 was also reduced or oxidized this may be attributed to the photocatalytic reactions initiated by cds particles under visible light cai et al 2020 these preliminary experimental results supported our hypothesis with the help of solar energy and microbial enzymatic reactions electrons can be transferred from heavy metal pollutants that need to be oxidized to detoxify them and donated to heavy metal pollutants that need to be reduced to become less toxic using such a mechanism multiple metal ions in wastewater can be remediated simultaneously furthermore if researchers can combine heavy metal remediating strains and organic pollutant degrading strains to form a synthetic microbial community and use it in the mph system then this system will also have the potential to treat heavy metal pollutants and organic pollutants in wastewater simultaneously this is of practical significance since many contaminated wastewaters usually contain multiple heavy metals as well as organic pollutants accordingly how to deal with these pollutants has long been the focus of wastewater treatment research rahman 2020 it is also worth noting that the mph can potentially cause secondary pollution and arrangements should be made to remove them by centrifugation or sedimentation the resulting contaminated biomass can be valorized as a source of metals by leaching or smelting 6 possible challenges we think the following two problems may be the most important roadblocks in the application of mph for the treatment of heavy metal contaminated wastewater 1 the significant toxicity of multiple heavy metals coexisting in sewage to microorganisms and the impact of the complexity of pollutants on the formation of photocatalytic particles needs to be considered other factors such as insufficient nutrients and unsuitable ph may hinder the synthesis and operation of mph systems therefore accurate analysis and pretreatment may be required to identify the composition and concentration of pollutants and then reduce the concentration of metal ions in the wastewater to a range that can be tolerated by the microorganisms before receiving the mph treatment encouragingly after years of research on microbial remediation of heavy metal pollution researchers have collected a considerable number of microbial strains that show excellent tolerance to multiple heavy metals moreover many of the available strains also have multiple heavy metal remediation capabilities such as deposition oxidation reduction etc yin et al 2019a rahman 2020 these strains will work well in the mph system providing the most important basis for the mph system to be used in the purification of heavy metal contaminated wastewater 2 when mph is active the oxidation and reduction of different metal ions may interfere with each other for example the reduced metal ions may be re oxidized by the photo generated holes when they are transported out of the cells which will severely limit the efficiency of mph a possible solution for this problem is to rapidly remove the reduced metals from the solution for example cr3 can be easily deposited as cr oh 3 wan et al 2019 and se4 can be directly reduced to insoluble selenium nanoparticles by contrast it can be ruled out that oxidized ions may be reduced again in mph system because the reduction of metal ions relies on enzymatic catalysis which is specific conclusions the metal particles produced by microbial mineralization in heavy metal polluted wastewater are underutilized we propose to use these metal particles to synthesize mph systems in situ as such the metal ions are recycled and reused while the heavy metal polluted wastewater is remediated the excellent potential of mph in the treatment of heavy metal polluted wastewater was explained and experimentally verified the mph based solution we demonstrated combines photocatalysis with biocatalysis to realize the directional transfer of electrons between different metal ions by which multiple heavy metal ions in wastewater were simultaneously and rapidly remediated mph systems composed of microbes decorated with heavy metals in wastewater in situ and driven by solar energy offer an eco friendly novel approach

17092,heavy metal contamination has received increasing attention as a growing worldwide environmental problem traditional remediation methods are mainly based on adsorption precipitation and oxidation reduction which reduce the availability or toxicity of heavy metal ions microbe photocatalyst hybrids mph which behave as a semi artificial photosynthetic system integrate microbial cells with artificial photocatalysts for solar to chemical conversion a few very recent studies indicate that mph can be applied to treat organic contamination in water here we propose a novel idea that mph may also have great potential for solving heavy metal pollution heavy metals in wastewater could possibly be utilized to synthesize photocatalysts for mph by microbial mineralization photo induced electrons generated by photocatalysts in mph can be transferred into microbial cells to promote intracellular enzymatic reductions which allows heavy metal ions such as cr6 and se4 to be reduced and detoxified moreover heavy metal ions like as3 and sb3 can be used as sacrificial electron donors to maintain the continuous operation of the mph whereby these metal ions are simultaneously oxidized and detoxified the excellent potential of mph in the treatment of heavy metal polluted wastewater is explained and a solution based on mph is put forward as well as verified experimentally in this work this solution can realize electron transfer between different metal ions to simultaneously remediate multiple heavy metal ions in wastewater this finding may bring new hope for treating multiple heavy metal polluted wastewater in the future graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbe photocatalyst hybrids heavy metal wastewater treatment photocatalysis biocatalysis 1 introduction heavy metal contamination is increasingly recognized as a serious worldwide environmental problem due to its high toxicity non biodegradability and bioaccumulation which seriously threatens human health and the stability of ecosystems yin et al 2019a in the last few decades a number of studies have developed a series of technologies for the remediation of heavy metal pollution such as chemical precipitation ion exchange membrane adsorption and oxidation reduction which remove the heavy metal ions from the environment or reduce their bioavailability by converting toxic heavy metal species into inactive states azimi et al 2017 however these technologies usually have drawbacks such as producing toxic chemical sludge causing secondary pollution high costs and so on therefore the emerging microbial remediation technologies have attracted great attention from scientists offering great advantages such as low cost and environmental friendliness yin et al 2019a microbes mainly remediate heavy metal pollution by adsorbing heavy metal ions via functional groups including carboxyl hydroxyl sulfhydryl amine and phosphonate yue et al 2015 or changing the redox state of heavy metal ions bahar et al 2016 gu et al 2015 the former reduces the concentration of bio available heavy metal ions by chelation or mineralization chaparro acuña et al 2018 and the latter selectively converts heavy metal ions with a toxic valence into ones with low toxicity by enzymatic reactions such as cr6 to cr3 gu et al 2015 and as3 to as5 bahar et al 2016 microbe photocatalyst hybrids mph were developed as semi artificial photosynthetic systems for solar to chemical conversion a typical mph system is mainly composed of microbial cells and photocatalytic materials deposited on their surface sakimoto et al 2016a guo et al 2018 under illumination the photocatalyst captures photons to generate electron hole pairs these electrons can enter the microbial cells through the electron transport system on the cell membrane such as the hydrogenase mediated pathway and cytochrome mediated pathway and are used by the microorganisms to synthesize target products through specific enzyme catalyzed reactions ye et al 2019 meanwhile the photogenerated holes are eliminated by reacting with an extracellular sacrificial electron donor sed which enables the photocatalyst to continue the photocatalytic reaction and ensures the continuous operation of the hybrid system sakimoto et al 2016b such a hybrid system avoids the limitations of biological systems such as low light conversion efficiency and high cost of carbon and electron sources for cell growth and maintenance as well as those of inorganic photocatalysis such as low selectivity and photo induced corrosion of photocatalytic materials during operation sakimoto et al 2016a what is more these hybrid systems have many other advantages including innate specific multi enzyme cascade biocatalysis self repair and adaptation to the environment wide light absorption spectrum and high efficiency in light usage fang et al 2020 to date many strategies have been developed to improve the efficiency of mph including 1 fabricating appropriate photocatalysts with wider spectral range and higher light capturing efficiency jiang et al 2018 2 modifying the metabolic pathways of microorganisms so that more carbon and electrons can be used for the synthesis of target products guo et al 2018 3 introducing an sed regeneration cycle to maintain the consistent productivity of mph sakimoto et al 2016b 4 improving the combination of photocatalytic materials and microorganisms to increase the transfer efficiency of photogenerated electrons into microbial cells wei et al 2018 5 synthesizing photocatalytic materials in cells directly so that photocatalytic reactions can occur in cells to reduce the loss of electrons in the process of electron transfer zhang et al 2018 and 6 modularizing the photocatalysts and microorganisms then combining them in the desired order to construct an mph system that can produce multiple products flexibility ding et al 2019 based on these strategies mph has developed rapidly and has been widely used in energy development wei et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 and chemical manufacturing ye et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 as shown in table 1 in the field of environmental remediation a few recent studies utilized mph to remove organic dyes from wastewater and achieved remarkable results xiao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 however we did not find any studies employing mph for the treatment of heavy metal contaminated wastewater the aim of this paper is to 1 unveil the promising potential of mph for treating heavy metal polluted wastewater 2 present and preliminarily verify a feasible mph based approach which can directionally transfer electrons between different heavy metal ions and thus efficiently remediate multiple heavy metal pollutants in wastewater with the aid of solar energy and biocatalysis finally we discuss the challenges that this emerging technology may encounter in the future 2 heavy metal ions in wastewater could possibly be used for synthesizing the photocatalyst in mph with the rapid development of photocatalyst synthesis technology many kinds of metals have been used to fabricate or modify photocatalytic materials gupta and van huis 2019 cruz pacheco et al 2019 and some of them are heavy metals such as arsenic as zhu et al 2019 cadmium cd zhang et al 2020a chromium cr wardhana et al 2020 and lead pb kamakura et al 2019 in fact microbial sedimentation has long been a common remediation strategy for heavy metal pollution yin et al 2019a and many studies unintentionally deposited nanomaterials with photocatalytic activity on the surface of microorganisms in the process of treating heavy metal polluted wastewater for example bacillus lysine was reported to be able to mineralize pb2 into pbco3 and pb3 po4 2 crystals in acidic wastewater zhang et al 2020b while sulfate reducing bacteria can precipitate many potentially toxic metals such as zinc copper cadmium and cobalt from acidic mine waters into metal sulfide particles hedrich and johnson 2014 the inorganic nano photocatalytic materials produced by microorganisms usually have the advantages of controlled size uniform distribution and tight microbial bonding dahoumane et al 2017 and many of these studies were much earlier than the proposal of mph surprisingly apart from metal recycling few researchers contemplated the use of photocatalysts biosynthesized from wastewater and so far no one has used such a ready made mph system for further research even as mph has become a new research hotspot there are still few studies linking these two aspects interestingly the most commonly used photocatalyst for mph systems happens to be cadmium sulfide cds sakimoto et al 2016a ye et al 2019 wei et al 2018 while cadmium is known as one of the most problematic heavy metals for example sakimoto et al sakimoto et al 2016a 2016b built a classic mph system by precipitating cds nanoparticles on the surface of moorella thermoacetica a non photosynthetic bacterium and used it for oxygenic photosynthesis of acetic acid from co2 furthermore escherichia coli wei et al 2018 rhodopseudomonas palustris wang et al 2019 methanosarcina barkeri ye et al 2019 thiobacillus denitrificans chen et al 2019 and geobacter sulfurreducens huang et al 2019 were also decorated with cds nanoparticles to construct mph systems in addition to cadmium the emerging metallic contaminant indium which is mostly derived from electronics brun et al 2019 was also used for photocatalyst synthesis in mph systems however all these studies synthesized the photocatalyst by adding additional heavy metal ions instead of using heavy metal contaminated wastewater to provide metal ions the utilization of polluted water may contribute to reducing the costs and the treatment of heavy metal contaminated wastewater at the same time in summary we proposed to use heavy metal ions from polluted wastewater to synthesize photocatalysts for mph while achieving the mineralization of some metal pollutants the mph system can also further catalyze the oxidation reduction of other heavy metal pollutants with the aid of solar energy and biocatalysis and these aspects will be described in detail below 3 heavy metal ions that are toxic in high valence states can be reduced by mph many heavy metal ions such as cr6 and se4 show strong toxicity in high valence states and become significantly less toxic when these ions are reduced xia et al 2018 therefore reduction has become an effective remediation method for such heavy metal ions yin et al 2019a the core mechanism of mph is that the electrons generated by the photocatalyst on the cell surface enter the cell to promote intracellular enzymatic reduction reactions for the synthesis of target organic compounds sakimoto et al 2016a however in addition to organic metabolism many bacteria can also reduce inorganic heavy metal ions through enzymatic reactions to detoxify heavy metal pollutants yin et al 2019a for example pseudomonas putida sp1 can reduce reactive hg2 to hg0 using a reductase enzyme and thereby remediate mercury pollution in marine environments zhang et al 2012 in analogy to the synthesis of organic matter enzymatic reduction of metal ions also requires significant amounts of reducing power which is usually provided by nadh or nadph accordingly using solar energy to power the reduction of metal pollutants through mph is a concept with great potential what is more since contaminated sites usually contain multiple heavy metals many microorganisms have evolved the ability to tolerate and detoxify multiple heavy metals simultaneously rahman 2020 for example achromobacter sp ty3 4 can concurrently remove cr6 by bioreduction and mn2 by biooxidation and biosorption yin et al 2019b alishewanella sp wh16 1 a sulfate reducing bacterium can precipitate cd2 and pb2 into cds and pbs by reducing so4 2 to s2 xia et al 2016 at the same time it can also use a previously unknown reductase to simultaneously reduce cr6 into cr3 and se4 into se0 xia et al 2018 microorganisms such as achromobacter sp ty3 4 and alishewanella sp wh16 1 which can simultaneously mineralize metal ions outside the cell by forming mineral particles with photocatalytic potential as well as reduce other metal ions by intracellular enzymatic reactions are practically tailor made for mph systems therefore these microorganisms might work well in mph systems without any genetic engineering which further improves the safety and practicality of mph in the field of sewage treatment 4 heavy metal ions that are toxic in low valence states can be used as the sacrificial electron donors sed for mph sacrificial electron donors sed are indispensable for the long term functioning of mph system sakimoto et al 2016b during the operation of mph the photocatalysts generate electrons and transfer them into the cells while the concomitantly photo generated holes were accumulated in the photocatalyst if these holes cannot be neutralized they will hinder the subsequent generation of electrons and recombine with the newly generated electrons which will cause the photocatalysts to fail and reduce the operating efficiency of mph the addition of sed can solve this problem when the electrons enter the cell the holes are transferred to the sed and eliminated by the oxidation of the sed so that the photocatalysts can continue to provide electronics for microorganisms to ensure the continuous efficient operation of mph however the sed is continuously consumed during the operation of mph and will be exhausted at the late stage of fermentation which severely restricts the efficiency and durability of the mph system therefore screening superior sed and realizing their recycling is critical for improving the mph system sakimoto et al sakimoto et al 2016b loaded tio2 with the co catalyst mn ii phthalocyanine mnpc to couple water oxidation to cysteine reduction using this approach they realized the regeneration of cysteine which was added as an sed in the moorella thermoacetica cds hybrid system the introduction of this sed recycling system increased the yield of the target product acetic acid 3 fold heavy metal ions like as3 and sb3 may be suitable seds because they can be relatively easily oxidized he et al 2019 li et al 2016 moreover many studies have used photocatalytic reactions of inorganic semiconductor materials to realize the oxidation of as3 and sb3 pham et al 2020 kong et al 2016 contrary to cr6 and se4 some heavy metal ions such as as3 and sb3 show high toxicity in their low valence state accordingly if they are oxidized into a higher valence state as3 to as5 sb3 to sb5 their toxicity will decrease or they may even become probiotic elements bagade et al 2020 li et al 2017 in this way heavy metal ions like as3 and sb3 can be effective as seds in the mph system and become detoxified when they provide electrons for mph 5 a feasible concept to simultaneously remediate multiple heavy metal pollutants in wastewater using mph we propose a new concept of using mph as a promising way forward to simultaneously remediate multiple heavy metal pollutants in wastewater fig 1 a and b 1 selectively remove specific heavy metal ions such as cd2 pb2 cu2 zn2 or in3 from the wastewater by microbial mineralization and thereby synthesize metallic mineral particles with photocatalytic properties on the surface of the microorganisms to construct the mph system 2 use the synthesized photocatalytic nanomaterials to generate electrons under

are toxic as low valence ions such as as3 and sb3 as seds for mph to maintain the continuous operation of the system while achieving the oxidative detoxification of these metals in order to verify the

separation can be divided into three categories electrically driven membrane separation electrodialysis pan et al 2018 yang et al 2020 thermally driven membrane separation pervaporation and membrane distillation christie et al 2020 liu et al 2016a liu et al 2020d and pressure driven membrane separation sauchelli toran et al 2020 pressure driven membranes can be divided into ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf according to the difference in separation performance liu et al 2019a shao et al 2020 wang and lin 2020 zhang et al 2019a the mf and uf membranes can only intercept microorganisms suspended solids and other large components in wastewater because of their large pore size and they are often used in the pretreatment of industrial and municipal wastewater slipko et al 2019 compared with the ro membrane the nf membrane usually has similar chemical constitution but the polymer network structure is relatively loose and it has a certain retention effect on organic molecules and polyvalent ions such as magnesium iron and sulfate ions wang et al 2018c the ro membrane has a high retention effect on most components except for water molecules in industrial wastewater which can achieve the efficient separation and reuse of wastewater dasgupta et al 2015 tong et al 2020 hence it has a broad application potential in the industrial wastewater deep treatment the improvement of the properties of ro membrane materials is important for the progress and economic operation of industrial wastewater treatment technology the ideal ro membrane must have the desired properties such as high water flux mechanical strength acceptable service life resistance to biodegradation and chemical thermal stability and low scaling tendency ghaemi and khodakarami 2019 liu et al 2020b the mainstream research direction focuses on designing novel ro membranes and membrane preparation methods asempour et al 2018 foglia et al 2017 wang et al 2017 high salt rejection and water flux and improved anti fouling and chlorine resistance are the main goals liu et al 2019b at present the feasibility of sulfonated polyether ester poly furfuryl alcohol cellulose acetate ca chitosan aromatic polyamide and other polymers as membrane materials has been studied anis et al 2019 ghaemi and khodakarami 2019 kim et al 2018 the ro membrane currently used are mainly cellulose acetate and aromatic polyamides the ca membrane is widely used in the desalination and industrial wastewater treatment the preparation of cellulose polymers for ro membranes began in the 1960s ahmad et al 2016 the ca membranes used for desalination are initially made from cellulose triacetate cta cellulose diacetate or their cellulose derivatives asempour et al 2018 wang et al 2016 recently some studies have been carried out to improve the salt rejection and water flux of ca related membranes most of the studies use phase transformation to generate asymmetric structures and explore their preparation arguments including solidification temperature polymer concentration solvent type and additives for example the addition of a modicum of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the membrane forming solution and changes in the solidification bath temperature from 0 c to 25 c promote the formation of macropores which in turn increase the water flux fei et al 2018 the ca membrane formed by adding chitosan to the prepared solution has enhanced retention performance but low flux reduces membrane s cost performance compared with the pa composite membrane despite recent improvements in cellulose derived membrane inherent characteristics such as narrow application temperature or ph and biological attack tendency remain a thin membrane composite is a composite membrane of two polymers cast onto a fabric support layer the membrane is based on ip technology developed by cadotte et al in which polymerization takes place at the interface of two immiscible solutions khorshidi et al 2016 polycondensation arises at the water solvent channel interface producing a cross linked membrane active or separated layer that determines the salt retention and permeation flux efficiency the ro membranes are uniquely attractive because they allow optimization of each layer zhao et al 2017 notably the separation layer can be modified and customized to acquire the optimal combination of salt retention and water flux song et al 2017 on the contrary the support layer can be optimized to augment its tensile strength compressive strength and impermeable fluidity park et al 2018 compared with the ca membrane the pa ro membrane demonstrates high inhibition and retention of inorganic salts and silica and can be operated over a wide temperature range up to 45 c and ph values 2 12 in addition the pa ro membrane is sensitive to oxidants and free chlorine hashiba et al 2019 for example the free chlorine tolerance of dow sw30hr 380 membrane element used in industrial wastewater treatment is less than 0 1 ppm the ro membranes are first prepared using 2 4 diisocyanate tdi and polyethylene imide pei through ip technology by cadotte although the preparative membrane exhibits high salt rejection the resistance to active chlorine is low qasim et al 2019 whereafter riley et al synthesized and commercialized ro membranes using polythiophene pea lee et al 2011 when trying to improve the ro membrane performance more researchers have found that the pa composite membrane with high salt rejection and water flux i e three or more carbonyl halide groups can be prepared via avoiding thermal curing and utilizing monomer aromatic amines and functional aromatic acyl chloride without acid receptors or surfactants chen et al 2008 lau et al 2012 li et al 2008 wang et al 2010 table 1 summarizes the monomers commonly used in the manufacture of ro membranes in recent literature the pa ro membrane with optimum performance is acquired by using 1 3 5 trimesoyl chloride tmc and m phenylenediamine mpd fig 1 the pa ro membranes prepared through ip technology of tmc and mdp have been successful in commercial applications and represent a turning point in the commercialization of aromatic pa ro membrane membrane separation mechanism the separation of ro membranes is affected by pore size polarity electric potential gradient and chemical potential after years of research on the separation mechanism of the ro membrane a series of model theories has been developed including the dissolution diffusion model hydrogen bond theory preferential sorption capillary flow mode dissolution diffusion model the dissolution diffusion model was proposed by lonsdale and podall et al to explain ro lonsdale h 1972 the dissolution diffusion model assumes that the surface separation layer of the ro membrane is dense and non porous and that both the solute and the solvent can be dissolved in the separation layer on the membrane surface and then under the influence of the difference in chemical potential caused by the concentration or pressure the solvent takes the lead to pass through in the form of molecular diffusion the diffusivity coefficient and solubility of solvent and solute in the surface separation layer of ro membranes directly affect the permeability rate the specific process can be considered as follows the first step is the dissolution and adsorption of solvent and solute on the surface of the ro membrane separation layer in the second step solvent and solute pass through the separation layer of the ro membrane in the form of molecular diffusion under the driving force of chemical potential or applied pressure without interaction the third step is the desorption of solvent and solute in the osmotic layer when the solvent and solute pass through the ro membrane the first and third steps are generally considered to be faster and the transmission rate depends on the second step that is solvent and solute passing through the membrane in the form of molecular diffusion under the action of chemical potential difference or the impetus of applied pressure given the difference in membrane selectivity the liquid mixture components can be separated the diffusion of solvent and solute in the ro membrane is subject to the fick law dissolution diffusion considers that both solvent and solute may dissolve in the separation layer on the membranes surface therefore the permeability of the component depends not only on the diffusion coefficient but also on its solubility on the membrane surface the solubility diffusion coefficient of water molecules is higher than that of solute therefore the number of water molecules passing through the membrane is more advantageous than the number of solute passing through the membrane hydrogen bond theory the hydrogen bond theory also known as the hole and ordered diffusion theory was proposed by reid et al kwon and leckie 2006 reid and breton 1959 given the van der waals force and hydrogen bond the crystalline phase region and amorphous phase region in the ro membrane are identified when water molecules enter the non crystalline region of the ro membrane the oxygen atoms of the amide or carbonyl groups will form hydrogen bonds to form bound water under the effect of applied pressure the ro membrane activation point where water molecules form hydrogen bonds in the solution and initial water molecules of the hydrogen bond dissociate and then move after forming a new hydrogen bond through a series of hydrogen bond formation and disconnection consequently water molecules can pass through the membrane surface active layer and into the porous support layer of the membrane the porous support layer comprises a mass of capillary water which enables the water molecules to flow out of the membranes smoothly considering that the solid bonded water fills up the holes in the separation layer ions and molecules that are bonded to the membrane in the form of hydrogen bonds can pass through the water layer in an orderly manner whereas solutes that cannot form hydrogen bonds cannot diffuse through preferential sorption capillary flow mode sourirajan et al presented the preferential sorption capillary flow theory of the ro membrane based on gibbs equation ismail and matsuura 2018 according to the theoretical model the surface tension of the solution will change when different solutes are dissolved in the liquid for example some inorganic salts that are dissolved in water can slightly increase its surface tension whereas those dissolved in alcohol aldehyde fat acid and other organic substances can decrease its surface tension this finding is due to the inhomogeneous diffusion of solute that is the concentration of solute in the interior and surface layers of aqueous solution is different which is the surface adsorption phenomenon of solution when the aqueous solution comes into contact with the solid surface of the membrane if the chemical properties of the active separation layer make the membrane adsorb positively to water and negatively to solute then a layer of pure water with a certain thickness will be adsorbed on the interface between the solution and membrane under external pressure the water passes through the capillary pores of the membrane surface and then obtains pure water at present the separation mechanism of the ro membrane is primarily influenced by the synergistic effect of the hydrogen bond mechanism dissolution mechanism and adsorption mechanism membrane fouling and anti fouling mechanism membrane fouling refers to the temporary or permanent loss of membrane water flux and separation characteristics caused by the deposition and adsorption of substances with different physical and chemical properties such as colloid inorganic salt organic matter and microorganisms and the mechanical physical or chemical interactions with the membrane surface during filtration membrane fouling will not only reduce the separation efficiency but also increase the filtration energy consumption frequent cleaning will shorten the service life of the membrane and finally lead to the increase of operating cost therefore in depth study of the mechanism of the ro membrane fouling and the establishment of corresponding anti fouling mechanism is the research focus in this field ro membrane fouling colloidal fouling colloids are tiny suspended particles ranging in size from a few nanometers to micrometers colloids can be referred to as inorganic and organic colloids according to their properties jiang et al 2017 lu and huang 2019 typical inorganic colloids in raw water include silt sulfur aluminum silicate minerals colloidal silicon dioxide pre deposited iron and corrosion products on the contrary organic colloids include oils proteins biocolloid surfactants carbohydrates and fats cohen et al 2017 during membrane separation the colloid in the material liquid is driven to the membrane surface because of the infiltration flow forming a filter cake layer tang et al 2011 the filter cake layer obstructs the reverse diffusion of salt thereby increasing the concentration of inorganic salt near the surface of the membrane the colloidal properties such as charge shape size and material liquefaction ph ionic strength and ionic interaction can influence the contamination of the membrane surface by colloids kang and cao 2012 in general small molecular colloids are contaminated because large colloids can be easily removed through repeated cleaning colloidal fouling also maintains the surface characteristics of the membrane the membrane surfaces with low charge hydrophilic and smooth surfaces are less sensitive to colloidal contaminants during the incipient scaling stage cruz silva et al 2019 liu et al 2020c park et al 2019 inorganic scaling inorganic scaling arises from inorganic matter such as calcium carbonate barium sulfate silica calcium phosphate calcium sulfate present in water siddique et al 2018 sunil et al 2018 this phenomenon involves transport and crystallization mechanisms when the ionic activity surpasses the saturation limit crystallization occurs resulting in the formation of supersaturated feed solution scaling caused by crystallization can appear in two ways surface heterogeneous crystallization and ontology homogeneous crystallization surface crystallization is a process in which crystals grow laterally on the membranes surface lee 2000 ontology crystallization forms crystal particles in the ontology phase via homogeneous crystallization and then deposits crystals on the membranes surface given the random collisions among ions the supersaturated solution leads to the accumulation of scaling ions which cluster to form crystals and precipitate once they grow above the critical size inorganic dirt is influenced by many chemical and physical arguments such as hydrophilicity roughness particle size membrane surface shear or resistance surface temperature transmembrane pressure feed solution chemistry and concentration bi et al 2018 guo et al 2019 sauchelli toran et al 2020 organic fouling organic fouling is the result of organic compounds in the feed solution in general organic contaminants can be classified as follows a natural organic substances composed of humus derived from plant or animal residues humic acid folic acid and humacin b algae or algal organic matter and c wastewater organics polysaccharides nucleic acids proteins antibiotics and enzymes freitas de oliveira and schneider 2019 jia et al 2017 organic fouling is a challenge for ro membrane wastewater treatment and desalination because traditional pretreatment cannot ensure the complete removal of organic matter in the material solution yan et al 2018 organic fouling is influenced by the membrane properties fouling fouling interactions membrane fouling interactions hydrodynamic operating conditions feed water chemistry and organic properties such as molecular hydrophilicity and size biofouling biological fouling accounts for more than 45 of all membrane fouling komlenic 2010 bioflocculation fouling is caused by the deposition attachment metabolism and proliferation of microorganisms algae fungi bacteria and protozoa and the production of biomembranes on the surface flemming 2020 fujiwara and matsuyama 2008 zhang et al 2020a fig 2 shows the dynamic process of microorganisms attaching on the membrane surface and then proliferating ansari et al 2020 bogler et al 2017 afterwards microorganisms multiply and grow by taking water nutrients during this stage metabolic activity releases extracellular polymers that furnish the anchor effects on the structure of the biomembrane through full growth they disperse from the membrane surface to a new location and reinitialize to form a biomembrane many factors control the adhesion of microorganisms to the membranes surface common influencing factors contain liquid material characteristics membrane surface characteristics microbial characteristics microbial surface interactions and separation conditions such as water flux and cross flow rate anti fouling mechanism of membrane the preparation of the anti fouling membrane is the fundamental way to address membrane fouling after long term research and exploration different anti fouling mechanisms of ro membranes are established according to different kinds of fouling the current anti fouling mechanism can be roughly divided into inert anti fouling mechanism and active anti fouling mechanism passive anti fouling mechanism is divided into fouling removal mechanism and fouling resistant mechanism whereas active anti fouling mechanism includes release anti fouling mechanism and contact anti fouling mechanism fouling removal mechanism the core strategy of fouling removal mechanism is to weaken the direct interaction between the membrane surface and contaminants so that the contaminants adsorbed on the membrane surface can be driven out under low shear force organic silicon and organic fluorine materials are typical anti fouling materials because of their low surface energy abdulazeez et al 2019 sommer et al 2010 the side chain of organosilicon polymers is a saturated alkyl group and the silicon oxygen skeleton of the main chain can rotate freely therefore it has a large degree of freedom of movement which decreases the interaction between the membrane surface and contaminants in addition an organosilicon material has a low elastic modulus which is conducive to the removal of contaminants with a small force the fluorine atoms arranged closely around the carbon chain in organic fluorine materials are the key to their fouling removal mechanism organic fluorine materials have high chain rigidity and stability which have difficulty interacting with contaminants yarbrough et al 2006 fouling resistant mechanism fouling resistant mechanism is developed on the basis of the anti fouling principles proposed by whitesides et al electroneutrality hydrophilicity hydrogen bond receptor and non hydrogen bond donor ostuni et al 2001 its core is to construct the surface of the hydrophilic membrane to inhibit the deposition of contaminants on the membrane surface and its mechanism can be divided into steric hindrance effect and hydration layer effect fig 3 steric hindrance effect contaminants adsorbed on the membrane surface will compress the polymer network extending on the membrane surface and reduce the degree of freedom of the polymer chain this process places the system in a state of thermodynamic entropy reduction thereby inhibiting the adsorption of contaminants shao et al 2020 hydration layer effect hydrophilic polymers can be combined with water molecules through hydrogen bond or ionic solvent conversion thereby forming a stable and continuous hydration layer on the membranes surface the adsorption of contaminants must remove the hydration layer which will also place the system in a thermodynamic state of entropy reduction zhang et al 2019b in general the anti fouling mechanism can resist the adsorption non migration diffusion and proliferation of most contaminants which has become the widely used anti fouling mechanism however considering that the inert anti fouling mechanism cannot inhibit the proliferation of bacteria addressing proliferative fouling is still limited therefore the active anti fouling mechanism has been developed and accepted that is the introduction of bacteriostatic materials on the membrane surface to resist and kill the proliferation of microorganisms thereby inhibiting the proliferation of fouling based on the different action mechanisms of antibacterial materials the active anti fouling mechanism can be divided into contact anti fouling mechanism and release anti fouling mechanism contact type anti fouling mechanism in this mechanism the antibacterial materials inhibit their cell proliferation by contacting with microorganisms cationic quaternary ammonium salt etc compounds are typical contact antibacterial materials liu et al 2020a the bacteriostatic process includes two steps first the cell wall of microorganisms is destroyed by cation replacement and macromolecular interaction then through electrostatic interaction with phospholipid bilayer and membrane protein the membrane structure is destroyed resulting in cytoplasmic leakage and cell death in addition to cationic polymers some carbon based nano materials have good contact antibacterial properties for example graphene oxide go and carbon nanotubes cnts are typical carbon based nano materials cheng et al 2020 choi et al 2013 kim et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 this kind of material has an antibacterial effect through two mechanisms a physical effect that is the interaction between sharp nano materials and cell membrane the cell membrane can be automatically perforated and permeated with the phospholipid bilayer to block its metabolism b chemical action that is cell death is caused by the peroxidation of phospholipids in the cell membranes by chemical oxidation potentials generated by nano materials the physical and chemical properties such as size existing state and oxidation degree of carbon based nano materials have a significant influence on their antibacterial activity release type anti fouling mechanism the contact type active anti fouling mechanism can only inhibit the proliferation of microorganisms in contact with the membrane surface but it has no effect on the free microorganisms therefore some materials that can release antibacterial substances in water are introduced into the surface of the ro membrane and metal based nano materials such as silver and copper are commonly used to prepare anti biomembrane antibacterial materials ali et al 2016 yin et al 2013 the pathways of the releasable active anti fouling mechanism can be divided into two ways fig 5 first the nano antibacterial materials of metal based nano materials silver and copper dissociate in water to form metal ions ag and cu2 with antibacterial efficacy silver ion interacts with the sulfhydryl groups in microbial channel proteins and reactivity enzymes thereby resulting in the loss of phosphate and phospholipid in cells blocking cell dna replication and inhibiting microbial proliferation this reaction can also occur in cell s mitochondria where h concentrations are high another way is to generate reactive oxygen species ros such as h2o2 o2 oh and ooh through photocatalysis by metal based nano bacteriostatic materials and metal oxide tio2 etc nano materials thereby causing oxidative damage to microbial cells to the extent of killing jiang et al 2018 perreault et al 2015a zarshenas et al 2020 the release anti fouling mechanism can effectively inhibit proliferative pollution but some problems still exist in the process of practical application the release of the type of antibacterial materials to produce ros class materials needs light catalytic conditions uv or visible light but in the actual process of separation the ro membrane has sealed components which cannot satisfy the corresponding conditions meanwhile the dissociation release of bacteriostatic materials will cause the gradual consumption of the bacteriostatic groups shorten the service life and increase the operating cost chlorination degradation and chlorine resistant mechanism in actual filtration and separation chlorination of membranes is inevitable chemical or solvent resistance in membrane technology indicates that the membranes can be exposed to the relevant medium or solvent for a considerable period of time while retaining its initial function notably membranes that performed worse or better after chlorination are considered non chlorine resistant therefore an in depth study on the chlorination degradation mechanism of the polyamide pa ro membrane and establishment of corresponding chlorine resistant mechanism is another hot spot in this field destruction and degradation mechanism of polyamide by active chlorine destruction and degradation mechanism of pa by active chlorine nchlorination in general the poor chlorine resistance of pa ro membrane is due to the sensitivity of pas verbeke et al 2017 kang and orton et al studied the mechanism of chlorine ion attack and proposed that oxide hocl attacked the pa through a reversible n chlorination reaction because the amide n shared its lone pair of electrons with the electron cloud of partially positively charged cl fig 6 kang et al 2007 first the terminal amine group is chlorinated followed by the internal amide bond the reaction of ncl has a primary dependence on free chlorine and promotes the reaction in acidic medium considering that the resulting ncl compounds are considered to be unstable irreversible orton rearrangements may occur to produce cyclochlorinated products under acidic conditions the ncl reaction followed by orton rearrangement is the leading chlorination mechanism hashiba et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the formation of mixtures of cyclochlorinated and n chlorinated products is possible and cyclochlorination and ncl are quantitatively equivalent under neutral conditions cyclic chlorination is unlikely to occur under alkaline conditions by eliminating the intramolecular rearrangement of ncl atoms molecular chlorine cl2 is produced which attacks the aromatic ring of the adjacent amide by electrophilic substitution reaction under pressurized conditions the rearrangement of n chlorinated products into cyclochlorinated products likely occurs and causes the greatest damage to the membrane however although the orton rearrangement and cyclochlorination do not occur n chlorination will have adverse effects on the membrane properties huang et al 2019 kwon et al 2012 shin et al 2011 chlorination promotes pa hydrolysis furthermore a competitive mechanism based on amide hydrolysis is proposed the attack of chlorine ions on the amide n polarizes the amide c thereby facilitating the hydrolysis of the cn bond through the nucleophile likely oh pa degradation will lead to an increase in the number of carboxyl groups which will further promote the absorption of chlorine and may lead to quinone formation powell et al 2014 the results show that the ratio of the amide bond rupture to chlorine atom bonding increases with the increase of ph of chlorinated solution this ratio can be used to forecast the mechanism and kinetics of amide bond fracture therefore dechlorination and n chlorination are considered to be major processes under alkaline conditions lin et al 2016 yao et al 2019 active chlorine invasion efficiency the absorption rate of chlorine is originally fast and slows down after a long exposure in addition with the increase of electronegativity of the substituted groups on new halogenated aromatic rings the diffusion rate of cl to aromatic rings is slower thus the chemical structure of the pa surface layer changes rapidly and then tends to stabilize after several hours of exposure the same process has been demonstrated over a longer time horizon most chlorination is completed within 1 day of exposure and chloride contents are only 30 higher after 13 days of exposure than those obtained on the first day the kinetic model of the chlorine polymer reciprocity also shows the correlation between the decrease of the absorption rate and the increase of hypochlorite concentration kearney and howarter 2014 tightening up effect another effect namely tightening up has also been discovered in brief this effect includes the formation of diplomatic links in the pa chain yu et al 2009 in the ip process the amount of amine substances added is generally high which may lead to the presence of free aromatic amine groups at the distal end of the pa chain resulting in the presence of unreacted amine monomers in the generated polymer these unreacted monomers are more vulnerable to chlorine than amide bonds thereby producing azo like compounds the crosslinking of the product and pa chain produces a tension effect and changes the mechanical performances of the membrane in mechanics thereby indirectly changing the properties of the membrane all these effects change the properties of the membrane in different ways hence the corresponding chlorine resistant mechanism can be established in combination with their respective mechanisms chlorine resistance mechanism of pa ro membrane aiming at the chlorination degradation of pa three kinds of chlorine resistant mechanisms have been developed protective coating mechanism steric hindrance mechanism and chemical grafting mechanism protective coating mechanisms have two main types zhu et al 2020 one is the sacrificial protective group that is the group coated on the surface of the membrane whose reactivity is higher than the nh bond likely reacts with the active chlorine to protect the nh bond of pa from being chlorinated the other is the direct protective group that is the electron absorbing group which can reduce the activity of pa benzene ring and prevent ortho substitution thereby preventing the chlorination and orton rearrangement of nh bond jaramillo et al 2021 the steric hindrance mechanism introduces the groups at all adjacent positions of the aromatic ring increases steric hindrance and reduces the attack of active chlorine on pa liu et al 2019d the results show that the pa membrane prepared by o phenylenediamine has the best chlorine resistance compared with mpd and p phenylenediamine in addition introducing ch3 into the o position of amino in the aromatic ring can improve the chlorine resistance of pa and prolong the service life of the membrane chemical grafting mechanism contains the amide functional groups on the ro membrane surface primarily amide linkage unreacted amino or acyl chloride produced by the hydrolysis of carboxyl in this mechanism some chemical bonding effects occur and chlorination on the surface of the membrane decreases moreover chlorine resistance increases because of the chemical grafting between the two groups and the protective layer of valid time will be extended zhang et al 2021 preparation and modification of pa ro membrane through the in depth analysis of the separation mechanism anti fouling mechanism and anti chlorine mechanism of the pa ro membrane the separation performance anti fouling performance and anti chlorine performance are closely related to the multistage structure of the membranes particularly the surface given the relatively complex mechanism of ro membrane separation anti fouling mechanism and chlorine resistant mechanism considering the different characteristics of the membrane surface interface and channel is necessary to propose stringent requirements for the design preparation and structural regulation of membrane materials this section summarizes the modification methods of the pa ro membrane and the strategies of multistage structural regulation in addition the research direction of the modification of the aromatic polyamide ro membrane is discussed post membrane forming regulation post membrane forming regulation refers to the regulation of the membrane structure by introducing functional modifiers into the membrane surface active layer after the preparation of pa ro membranes through ip and subsequent treatment at present the commonly used modifiers include functional molecules inorganic nanoparticles and metal organic framework mof lee et al 2019a liu et al 2019b park et al 2017a surface coating adsorption method surface coating adsorption is a method to control the surface structure by using hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction between the modifier and membrane surface to make it attached adsorbed on the membranes surface shin et al 2020 in general the ro membrane is coated to change the surface performances of the active layer wang et al used poly 3allyl 5 5 dimethylhydantoin co vinylamine p admh co vam coating to decrease surface roughness or surface charge and improve hydrophilicity wang et al 2018a changes in the chemical composition of the separation layer alter the interaction with active chlorine chlorine can also attach to p admh co vam coatings but to a lesser degree than pure pa thus it can act as a physical barrier against chlorine attacks however p admh co vam coatings are usually uneven and do not protect the underlying pa layer it can even fall off under strict chlorination conditions khaled et al adsorbed the hydrophilic copolymers n1 3 trimethoxysilylpropyl diethylenetriamine on the pa ro membrane surface and then carried out cross linking and the results showed that their bactericidal efficiency exceeds 80 because the coating is preferred to react with chlorine than merely to act as a physical barrier abdulazeez et al 2019 nevertheless the permeability of the membrane significant improve 50 when the quaternization coating is applied yan et al achieved high salt retention efficiency by combining co solvent optimized ip cso ip and protective coating controlled chlorination pcc chlorination even after prolonged exposure to high concentrations of active chlorine yan et al 2019 ta fe 0 2 pei 0 2 cl has excellent environmental antioxidant properties but unfortunately this comes at the cost of membrane stability and water flux under acidic conditions table 2 summarizes the studies on surface coating or adsorption modification of pa ro membranes in surface coating adsorption the interaction between the modifier and membrane surface is weak and non covalent which is not conducive to the long term stable operation of the modified membrane under the complex environment surface grafting surface grafting refers to the method where a modifier is grafted onto the surface of the ro membrane by covalent bond connection based on the difference of the graft mode it can be divided into graft to and graft from graft to indicates that the active group in the modifier is grafted onto the surface of the pa membrane through covalent reaction to regulate the surface structure of the membrane hydroxaldehyde condensation reaction amination reaction and amidation reaction are the common surface grafting reactions abu seman et al 2010 wei et al 2010 wu et al 2010 hu et al grafted the pva onto the surface of the pa ro membrane through the hydroxyl aldehyde condensation reaction and regulated the surface charge and hydrophilicity of the ro membrane fig 7a an et al 2011 hu et al 2016 the modified ro membrane prepared by an et al could resist pollution by sds bsa and dtab graft to grafting is simple and has wide selection of modifiers however considering that modifiers are nanoparticles or macromolecules they are restricted by steric hindrance and the graft efficiency is low graft from indicates that the modifier monomer can initiate free radical polymerization on the pa ro membrane surface to control the surface structure of the separated membrane among them thermal initiation reaction high energy ray grafting reaction and chemical initiator reaction such as sodium persulfate are common surface free radical grafting reactions amini et al 2011 el arnaouty et al 2018 li et al 2020b meng et al 2014 recently liu et al grafted diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dadmac onto the surface of the ro membrane by gamma ray initiation and regulated the surface structure of the membrane by adjusting the polymerization graft parameters radiation dose monomer concentration etc fig 7b liu et al 2019c the modified pa ro membrane has high hydrophilicity and its flux and anti fouling property are superior to the blank membrane moreover graft from has good controllability and high graft density however the reaction process is relatively complex to introduce the active free groups on the pa ro membrane surface and the selection of the modifier has some limitations bionic bonding method bionic adhesion is a modification method of adhesion co deposition and chemical reaction on the surface of the ro membrane based on the adhesion characteristics and reactivity of polydopamine pda and other substances which can effectively regulate the structure of the ro membrane blok et al 2014 wu et al 2019 for example wu et al introduced covalent organic framework cof into pda and deposited this cof on the membrane surface through biomimetic bonding which remarkably enhanced the anti fouling performance of the membrane wu et al 2019 in general the regulation method is used to improve the permeability and anti fouling performance of the membrane by modifying the surface structure of the ro membrane such as hydrophilicity the regulation of the ro membrane body and channel structure is seldom performed which slightly improve the inorganic salt ion retention performance in situ regulation method in situ regulation refers to the regulation of the multistage membrane structure by changing the process parameters or introducing modifiers in the preparation of the ro membrane among the methods this method simply changes the synthetic process parameters this section introduces the in situ regulation method of introducing modifiers the in situ regulation method of introducing modifiers includes two approaches the design of membrane forming materials and co mixing of modifiers in the membrane forming process the design of membrane forming materials includes designing and synthesizing new membrane forming materials or introducing compounds with functional groups into traditional membrane forming materials to achieve in situ regulation of the multistage structure of the ro membrane by modifying the physical structure chemical composition and chemical structure of the membrane forming material the surface structure of the ro membrane main channel structure and interfacial structure of the composite and supporting layers can be effectively regulated for example ma et al designed and synthesized amphoteric ionized polyethylenimine and carried out ip as an aqueous phase monomer to adjust the hydrophilicity and charge of the membrane surface and finally prepared an electroneutral separation membrane resistant to pollution ma et al 2016a xu et al prepared high strength ultra thin go separation membranes by self assembly which were stacked with one another to form two dimensional channels of nanometer size and optimized the structure of two dimensional channels of the membranes to achieve synchronous enhancement of membrane inorganic salt retention and water flux xu et al 2017 yan et al activated the carboxyl acyl chloride group on the surface of the supporting layer by tannic acid ta which was chemically reacted with the aqueous phase monomer polymerized at the interface thereby introducing covalent bond action at the interface of the composite layer and improving the stability of the separation membrane yan et al 2021 the co modifier in the membrane forming process can conveniently integrate the properties of the modifier and membrane raw material by adjusting the physical structure and chemical composition of the modifier the in situ regulation of the surface channel interface and other multilevel structures of the ro membrane can be achieved commonly mixed modifiers include high molecular polymer such as peg pei and pva an et al 2011 bera et al 2015 liu et al 2017b zhao et al 2020b organic molecules such as amino acids cyclodextrin and taurine jin et al 2014 and organic inorganic nanometer materials such as metal oxide nanoparticles mos2 graphene cnts and mofs kim et al 2014 li et al 2019 rajakumaran et al 2019 zhao et al 2020a the surface structure of a pa ro membrane can be effectively regulated by mixing functional polymers or organic small molecules in the membrane forming process for example zhang et al used capsaicin as an aqueous phase additive and introduced the ro membrane separation layer through ip zhang et al 2016a after modification the surface hydrophilicity and permeability of the pa ro membrane and the anti fouling and bacterial performances were significantly improved the membrane forming process of the mixed functional nanomaterials metal oxide cnts go cqds etc controls not only the structure of ro membrane surface but also the ro membrane channel introduced in the body including the interface channel and additives ontology of membrane materials and channels such as the multi level structure ali et al 2019 gai et al 2021 lee et al 2019b for example zarshenas et al functionalized the surface of tio2 nanoparticles and designed and synthesized functional tio2 nanoparticles that could increase the simplex dispersion in the pa layer and reduce the aggregation of nanoparticles in aqueous solution zarshenas et al 2020 the preparation of the modified ro membrane can not only maintain high efficiency of inorganic ion retention but also nearly double the flux of permeable water compared with that of undoped nanoparticles the properties of various novel in situ modified pa ro membranes are summarized in table 3 the comparison in table 3 shows that nanomaterials based on go exhibit high efficiency and superior performance which becomes the focus of the development of pa ro membranes with specific functions however synchronously maintaining the original advantages of both nanocomposites and pa membranes remains a key issue hence exploring the high performance ro membrane by using such nanocomposite materials is particularly important outlook and future works although the appearance of the pa composite membrane opens a new journey for the ro membrane it also faces limitations and challenges in the aspects of membrane surface hydrophilicity anti fouling chlorine resistance stability and cost particularly in the commercialization of sewage treatment and desalination shenvi et al 2015 many novel ro membranes with remarkable filtration properties have been prepared in laboratory however the actual performance test of these membranes in water treatment is rarely reported similarly most novel membranes are estimated only in the short term using highly idealized feed solutions most studies have focused either on multiple mechanisms separately or on a single type of membrane property hence future study efforts in pretreatment modification or membrane development must lead directly toward the associative impacts of multi level mechanisms using feed solutions containing intricate components these efforts will potentially close the gap between engineering practice and basic knowledge in addition ro membranes are often contaminated which can increase energy consumption reduce separation property shorten membrane life and increase operating costs li et al 2020d yu et al 2020 therefore anti fouling modification of the ro membrane is a research hotspot in this field optimizing the modification scheme in chemical grafting and physical coating is necessary to minimize the untoward effects of the modifier on the membrane the correlation between the risk of nanomaterials to humans and their poisonousness and exposure remains difficult to quantify which must not be ignored in future studies furthermore large scale ro membranes which arrange nanotubes vertically on a pa layer the shortest water channel have not yet been acquired with the in depth understanding of various fouling mechanisms without clear magnitude relation between functional units and anti fouling performance the precise operation of anti fouling performance remains a challenge achieving the goal of generally applicable anti fouling membranes is necessary but still a tough challenge a single anti fouling strategy of homogeneous membrane surfaces can only weaken typical interaction patterns and can only deal with a limited range of contaminants some scholars have proposed the novel multifunctional anti fouling strategy based on various anti fouling mechanisms when applied to the purification of seawater and industrial wastewater containing more complex contaminants this strategy is superior to a single anti fouling strategy most of the research focuses on the multi defense mechanism of single passive or active anti fouling strategy the synergies of different anti fouling mechanisms remain unclear and difficult to precisely manipulate although pa ro membranes have significant advantages over other water treatment processes their low tolerance to chlorine and other oxides and their resistance to contamination remain a major challenge however the modification of pa remains a difficult problem with regard to salt retention and permeation flux which requires no change or at least no reduction in membrane properties the resistance of these modified membranes to free chlorine is only increased and the resistance to inert or active pollution is only temporary therefore the future ro membrane development technology must converge on novel polymer chemistry which can extend the chlorine resistant and anti fouling properties to a greater extent finally the economic interests of using new modified materials in the ro membrane must exceed the development and production costs of the manufacturer and customer engineering innovation is also important to reduce costs a novel and ideal ro membrane requires not only improved water flux but also good resistance to chlorine and contaminants studying the long term property of the neoteric developed ro membrane during large scale operations is important to determine their stability and find the optimal conditions to maximize their separation property and service life the development and research of membrane technology have evident multi disciplinary nature spanning basic science and applied engineering hence collaborative contributions from researchers with backgrounds in environmental engineering chemical engineering materials science and biology are necessary conclusions the separation technology based on the ro membrane will continue to lead the field of desalination and municipal industrial wastewater treatment in the future this review is related to the issue of separation fouling and chlorination degradation in the ro membrane and the recent findings of the modification methods of the membrane have been completely reviewed despite the recent advances we have emphasized the future studies aimed at improving membrane suitability safety and cost reduction as the next generation ro membrane in this review on the basis of the complexity of the mechanism of the ro membranes no single mitigation strategy will be the ultimate solution to address the issues associated with this phenomenon the boundedness of subsistent materials and methods for ro membrane design will be the driving force for innovation in the continuous search for simple and common strategies enhancing the modified technology is necessary to conquer the trade off among permeability anti fouling property and chlorine resistant performances meanwhile membrane modification is bound to continue to be an important part in ro research after the fundamental mechanisms and mitigation strategies are clarified in the next few years the efforts in developing novel membrane materials continue to blossom as the time goes which likely generates insightful and mind blowing ideas that are

17093,membrane technology has been widely used in the wastewater treatment and seawater desalination in recent years the reverse osmosis ro membrane represented by polyamide pa has made great progress because of its excellent properties however the conventional pa ro membranes still have some scientific problems such as membrane fouling easy degradation after chlorination and unclear mechanisms of salt retention and water flux which seriously impede the widespread use of ro membrane technology this paper reviews the progress in the research and development of the ro membrane with key focus on

industry and the continuous growth of population the shortage of water resources has become a common issue that restricts the development of the global economy zhu et al 2018 zuo et al 2020 at present only a fraction 2 5 of the available water resources are suited to human direct use and production eliasson 2015 elmekawy et al 2014 furthermore the latest statistical projections suggest that about a quarter of the population will face water shortages by 2030 luo et al 2018 vorosmarty et al 2010 exponential population growth continued industrialization increased agricultural activity water pollution mismanagement of water resources and climate change have further exacerbated the water shortage problem deshmukh et al 2018 sapkota et al 2020 zhang et al 2019c therefore the in depth treatment of municipal industrial wastewater and sea water desalination and reuse are the only way for the sustainable development of modern industry and the solution of water crisis saleem and zaidi 2020 shannon et al 2008 yin et al 2019 membrane industry is a sunrise industry with great development potential which plays an important role in the pharmaceutical energy food metallurgy biological engineering and other industries cohen tanugi et al 2014 kirstie et al 2020 over the past few decades with the development of membrane technology given its excellent performance simple operation small area coverage low overall cost and automatic process the membrane material is now considered a practical value of water treatment technology and a reliable and effective method eases the global water shortage crisis elimelech and phillip 2011 hosseinzadeh et al 2020 li et al 2020a of the various membrane based wastewater treatment and desalination processes developed to date the ro membrane processes have played a leading role in the wastewater treatment and desalination industry because of their advantages of low integrated capital cost and efficient separation yin et al 2020 however the conventional pa ro membrane materials are still easy to pollute and chlorination is easy to degrade kibler et al 2020 park et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 in addition salt rejection and water flux are mutually restricted and the separation mechanism is not clear which limits the wide application of ro membrane technology li et al 2016 zhang et al 2019b since the development of aromatic pa chemical and interfacial polymerization ip by cadotte and others qasim et al 2019 the ro membranes have been considerably developed to improve performance and selectivity chlorine resistance fouling biofouling resistance chemical and biological stability choudhury et al 2018 park et al 2017a wang et al 2018b a number of subsequent important reviews have been published with different focuses on this particular subject almost all of the reviews involve specific areas of the ro membrane such as nanomembranes novel membranes desalination membrane fouling chlorinated degradation surface modification and new material developments goh et al 2019 gohil and suresh 2017 lin 2020 wang et al 2020a the above mentioned reviews only address specific areas of the separation membrane and almost no reviews are found to summarize and report the research hotspots of mechanisms and mitigation strategies of pa ro membrane at present therefore making a state of the art critical review of pa ro membrane is necessary to understand the role of the ro membranes in water treatment furthermore the several issues are interrelated because membrane fouling problems often aggravate the problem of membrane degradation and water flux changes resulting from chlorination attacks fane et al 2015 therefore combining the mechanisms and strategies of separation anti fouling and chlorine resistance of the pa ro membrane to acquire excellent functions is necessary thus this article systematically investigates the latest discoveries in exploring the mechanisms and applications for the ro membrane with emphasis on the influences of various internal and external factors on separation anti fouling and chlorine resistant properties next the strategies to acquire the multifunctional pa ro membranes via modification are classified and illustrated finally the existing modification strategies and their limitations and practical application prospects are discussed in detail with exciting discoveries and new innovations made over the past 5 years foglia et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 this paper aims to provide timely information on the mechanisms and strategies of pa ro membranes that industries and academics can use to solve practical problems related to ro the references in this paper are not presented in detail but may act as a starting point to more detailed research moreover considering that the issues mentioned in this review work are common in other materials the summary of the modification technology of pa ro membrane with high salt retention anti fouling and chlorine resistant performances have remarkable reference significance for most membrane materials reverse osmosis membrane and mechanism membrane separation and ro membrane compared with other physical separation methods membrane separation has advantages such as easy amplification relatively low energy consumption environmental friendliness simple operation high separation efficiency and small floor space and has been widely used in multiple separation fields including sewage treatment and desalination foureaux et al 2019 park et al 2008 wang et al 2016 according to the different driving forces membrane separation can be divided into three categories electrically driven membrane separation electrodialysis pan et al 2018 yang et al 2020 thermally driven membrane separation pervaporation and membrane distillation christie et al 2020 liu et al 2016a liu et al 2020d and pressure driven membrane separation sauchelli toran et al 2020 pressure driven membranes can be divided into ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf according to the difference in separation performance liu et al 2019a shao et al 2020 wang and lin 2020 zhang et al 2019a the mf and uf membranes can only intercept microorganisms suspended solids and other large components in wastewater because of their large pore size and they are often used in the pretreatment of industrial and municipal wastewater slipko et al 2019 compared with the ro membrane the nf membrane usually has similar chemical constitution but the polymer network structure is relatively loose and it has a certain retention effect on organic molecules and polyvalent ions such as magnesium iron and sulfate ions wang et al 2018c the ro membrane has a high retention effect on most components except for water molecules in industrial wastewater which can achieve the efficient separation and reuse of wastewater dasgupta et al 2015 tong et al 2020 hence it has a broad application potential in the industrial wastewater deep treatment the improvement of the properties of ro membrane materials is important for the progress and economic operation of industrial wastewater treatment technology the ideal ro membrane must have the desired properties such as high water flux mechanical strength acceptable service life resistance to biodegradation and chemical thermal stability and low scaling tendency ghaemi and khodakarami 2019 liu et al 2020b the mainstream research direction focuses on designing novel ro membranes and membrane preparation methods asempour et al 2018 foglia et al 2017 wang et al 2017 high salt rejection and water flux and improved anti fouling and chlorine resistance are the main goals liu et al 2019b at present the feasibility of sulfonated polyether ester poly furfuryl alcohol cellulose acetate ca chitosan aromatic polyamide and other polymers as membrane materials has been studied anis et al 2019 ghaemi and khodakarami 2019 kim et al 2018 the ro membrane currently used are mainly cellulose acetate and aromatic polyamides the ca membrane is widely used in the desalination and industrial wastewater treatment the preparation of cellulose polymers for ro membranes began in the 1960s ahmad et al 2016 the ca membranes used for desalination are initially made from cellulose triacetate cta cellulose diacetate or their cellulose derivatives asempour et al 2018 wang et al 2016 recently some studies have been carried out to improve the salt rejection and water flux of ca related membranes most of the studies use phase transformation to generate asymmetric structures and explore their preparation arguments including solidification temperature polymer concentration solvent type and additives for example the addition of a modicum of polyvinylpyrrolidone in the membrane forming solution and changes in the solidification bath temperature from 0 c to 25 c promote the formation of macropores which in turn increase the water flux fei et al 2018 the ca membrane formed by adding chitosan to the prepared solution has enhanced retention performance but low flux reduces membrane s cost performance compared with the pa composite membrane despite recent improvements in cellulose derived membrane inherent characteristics such as narrow application temperature or ph and biological attack tendency remain a thin membrane composite is a composite membrane of two polymers cast onto a fabric support layer the membrane is based on ip technology developed by cadotte et al in which polymerization takes place at the interface of two immiscible solutions khorshidi et al 2016 polycondensation arises at the water solvent channel interface producing a cross linked membrane active or separated layer that determines the salt retention and permeation flux efficiency the ro membranes are uniquely attractive because they allow optimization of each layer zhao et al 2017 notably the separation layer can be modified and customized to acquire the optimal combination of salt retention and water flux song et al 2017 on the contrary the support layer can be optimized to augment its tensile strength compressive strength and impermeable fluidity park et al 2018 compared with the ca membrane the pa ro membrane demonstrates high inhibition and retention of inorganic salts and silica and can be operated over a wide temperature range up to 45 c and ph values 2 12 in addition the pa ro membrane is sensitive to oxidants and free chlorine hashiba et al 2019 for example the free chlorine tolerance of dow sw30hr 380 membrane element used in industrial wastewater treatment is less than 0 1 ppm the ro membranes are first prepared using 2 4 diisocyanate tdi and polyethylene imide pei through ip technology by cadotte although the preparative membrane exhibits high salt rejection the resistance to active chlorine is low qasim et al 2019 whereafter riley et al synthesized and commercialized ro membranes using polythiophene pea lee et al 2011 when trying to improve the ro membrane performance more researchers have found that the pa composite membrane with high salt rejection and water flux i e three or more carbonyl halide groups can be prepared via avoiding thermal curing and utilizing monomer aromatic amines and functional aromatic acyl chloride without acid receptors or surfactants chen et al 2008 lau et al 2012 li et al 2008 wang et al 2010 table 1 summarizes the monomers commonly used in the manufacture of ro membranes in recent literature the pa ro membrane with optimum performance is acquired by using 1 3 5 trimesoyl chloride tmc and m phenylenediamine mpd fig 1 the pa ro membranes prepared through ip technology of tmc and mdp have been successful in commercial applications and represent a turning point in the commercialization of aromatic pa ro membrane membrane separation mechanism the separation of ro membranes is affected by pore size polarity electric potential gradient and chemical potential after years of research on the separation mechanism of the ro membrane a series of model theories has been developed including the dissolution diffusion model hydrogen bond theory preferential sorption capillary flow mode dissolution diffusion model the dissolution diffusion model was proposed by lonsdale and podall et al to explain ro lonsdale h 1972 the dissolution diffusion model assumes that the surface separation layer of the ro membrane is dense and non porous and that both the solute and the solvent can be dissolved in the separation layer on the membrane surface and then under the influence of the difference in chemical potential caused by the concentration or pressure the solvent takes the lead to pass through in the form of molecular diffusion the diffusivity coefficient and solubility of solvent and solute in the surface separation layer of ro membranes directly affect the permeability rate the specific process can be considered as follows the first step is the dissolution and adsorption of solvent and solute on the surface of the ro membrane separation layer in the second step solvent and solute pass through the separation layer of the ro membrane in the form of molecular diffusion under the driving force of chemical potential or applied pressure without interaction the third step is the desorption of solvent and solute in the osmotic layer when the solvent and solute pass through the ro membrane the first and third steps are generally considered to be faster and the transmission rate depends on the second step that is solvent and solute passing through the membrane in the form of molecular diffusion under the action of chemical potential difference or the impetus of applied pressure given the difference in membrane selectivity the liquid mixture components can be separated the diffusion of solvent and solute in the ro membrane is subject to the fick law dissolution diffusion considers that both solvent and solute may dissolve in the separation layer on the membranes surface therefore the permeability of the component depends not only on the diffusion coefficient but also on its solubility on the membrane surface the solubility diffusion coefficient of water molecules is higher than that of solute therefore the number of water molecules passing through the membrane is more advantageous than the number of solute passing through the membrane hydrogen bond theory the hydrogen bond theory also known as the hole and ordered diffusion theory was proposed by reid et al kwon and leckie 2006 reid and breton 1959 given the van der waals force and hydrogen bond the crystalline phase region and amorphous phase region in the ro membrane are identified when water molecules enter the non crystalline region of the ro membrane the oxygen atoms of the amide or carbonyl groups will form hydrogen bonds to form bound water under the effect of applied pressure the ro membrane activation point where water molecules form hydrogen bonds in the solution and initial water molecules of the hydrogen bond dissociate and then move after forming a new hydrogen bond through a series of hydrogen bond formation and disconnection consequently water molecules can pass through the membrane surface active layer and into the porous support layer of the membrane the porous support layer comprises a mass of capillary water which enables the water molecules to flow out of the membranes smoothly considering that the solid bonded water fills up the holes in the separation layer ions and molecules that are bonded to the membrane in the form of hydrogen bonds can pass through the water layer in an orderly manner whereas solutes that cannot form hydrogen bonds cannot diffuse through preferential sorption capillary flow mode sourirajan et al presented the preferential sorption capillary flow theory of the ro membrane based on gibbs equation ismail and matsuura 2018 according to the theoretical model the surface tension of the solution will change when different solutes are dissolved in the liquid for example some inorganic salts that are dissolved in water can slightly increase its surface tension whereas those dissolved in alcohol aldehyde fat acid and other organic substances can decrease its surface tension this finding is due to the inhomogeneous diffusion of solute that is the concentration of solute in the interior and surface layers of aqueous solution is different which is the surface adsorption phenomenon of solution when the aqueous solution comes into contact with the solid surface of the membrane if the chemical properties of the active separation layer make the membrane adsorb positively to water and negatively to solute then a layer of pure water with a certain thickness will be adsorbed on the interface between the solution and membrane under external pressure the water passes through the capillary pores of the membrane surface and then obtains pure water at present the separation mechanism of the ro membrane is primarily influenced by the synergistic effect of the hydrogen bond mechanism dissolution mechanism and adsorption mechanism membrane fouling and anti fouling mechanism membrane fouling refers to the temporary or permanent loss of membrane water flux and separation characteristics caused by the deposition and adsorption of substances with different physical and chemical properties such as colloid inorganic salt organic matter and microorganisms and the mechanical physical or chemical interactions with the membrane surface during filtration membrane fouling will not only reduce the separation efficiency but also increase the filtration energy consumption frequent cleaning will shorten the service life of the membrane and finally lead to the increase of operating cost therefore in depth study of the mechanism of the ro membrane fouling and the establishment of corresponding anti fouling mechanism is the research focus in this field ro membrane fouling colloidal fouling colloids are tiny suspended particles ranging in size from a few nanometers to micrometers colloids can be referred to as inorganic and organic colloids according to their properties jiang et al 2017 lu and huang 2019 typical inorganic colloids in raw water include silt sulfur aluminum silicate minerals colloidal silicon dioxide pre deposited iron and corrosion products on the contrary organic colloids include oils proteins biocolloid surfactants carbohydrates and fats cohen et al 2017 during membrane separation the colloid in the material liquid is driven to the membrane surface because of the infiltration flow forming a filter cake layer tang et al 2011 the filter cake layer obstructs the reverse diffusion of salt thereby increasing the concentration of inorganic salt near the surface of the membrane the colloidal properties such as charge shape size and material liquefaction ph ionic strength and ionic interaction can influence the contamination of the membrane surface by colloids kang and cao 2012 in general small molecular colloids are contaminated because large colloids can be easily removed through repeated cleaning colloidal fouling also maintains the surface characteristics of the membrane the membrane surfaces with low charge hydrophilic and smooth surfaces are less sensitive to colloidal contaminants during the incipient scaling stage cruz silva et al 2019 liu et al 2020c park et al 2019 inorganic scaling inorganic scaling arises from inorganic matter such as calcium carbonate barium sulfate silica calcium phosphate calcium sulfate present in water siddique et al 2018 sunil et al 2018 this phenomenon involves transport and crystallization mechanisms when the ionic activity surpasses the saturation limit crystallization occurs resulting in the formation of supersaturated feed solution scaling caused by crystallization can appear in two ways surface heterogeneous crystallization and ontology homogeneous crystallization surface crystallization is a process in which crystals grow laterally on the membranes surface lee 2000 ontology crystallization forms crystal particles in the ontology phase via homogeneous crystallization and then deposits crystals on the membranes surface given the random collisions among ions the supersaturated solution leads to the accumulation of scaling ions which cluster to form crystals and precipitate once they grow above the critical size inorganic dirt is influenced by many chemical and physical arguments such as hydrophilicity roughness particle size membrane surface shear or resistance surface temperature transmembrane pressure feed solution chemistry and concentration bi et al 2018 guo et al 2019 sauchelli toran et al 2020 organic fouling organic fouling is the result of organic compounds in the feed solution in general organic contaminants can be classified as follows a natural organic substances composed of humus derived from plant or animal residues humic acid folic acid and humacin b algae or algal organic matter and c wastewater organics polysaccharides nucleic acids proteins antibiotics and enzymes freitas de oliveira and schneider 2019 jia et al 2017 organic fouling is a challenge for ro membrane wastewater treatment and desalination because traditional pretreatment cannot ensure the complete removal of organic matter in the material solution yan et al 2018 organic fouling is influenced by the membrane properties fouling fouling interactions membrane fouling interactions hydrodynamic operating conditions feed water chemistry and organic properties such as molecular hydrophilicity and size biofouling biological fouling accounts for more than 45 of all membrane fouling komlenic 2010 bioflocculation fouling is caused by the deposition attachment metabolism and proliferation of microorganisms algae fungi bacteria and protozoa and the production of biomembranes on the surface flemming 2020 fujiwara and matsuyama 2008 zhang et al 2020a fig 2 shows the dynamic process of microorganisms attaching on the membrane surface and then proliferating ansari et al 2020 bogler et al 2017 afterwards microorganisms multiply and grow by taking water nutrients during this stage metabolic activity releases extracellular polymers that furnish the anchor effects on the structure of the biomembrane through full growth they disperse from the membrane surface to a new location and reinitialize to form a biomembrane many factors control the adhesion of microorganisms to the membranes surface common influencing factors contain liquid material characteristics membrane surface characteristics microbial characteristics microbial surface interactions and separation conditions such as water flux and cross flow rate anti fouling mechanism of membrane the preparation of the anti fouling membrane is the fundamental way to address membrane fouling after long term research and exploration different anti fouling mechanisms of ro membranes are established according to different kinds of fouling the current anti fouling mechanism can be roughly divided into inert anti fouling mechanism and active anti fouling mechanism passive anti fouling mechanism is divided into fouling removal mechanism and fouling resistant mechanism whereas active anti fouling mechanism includes release anti fouling mechanism and contact anti fouling mechanism fouling removal mechanism the core strategy of fouling removal mechanism is to weaken the direct interaction between the membrane surface and contaminants so that the contaminants adsorbed on the membrane surface can be driven out under low shear force organic silicon and organic fluorine materials are typical anti fouling materials because of their low surface energy abdulazeez et al 2019 sommer et al 2010 the side chain of organosilicon polymers is a saturated alkyl group and the silicon oxygen skeleton of the main chain can rotate freely therefore it has a large degree of freedom of movement which decreases the interaction between the membrane surface and contaminants in addition an organosilicon material has a low elastic modulus which is conducive to the removal of contaminants with a small force the fluorine atoms arranged closely around the carbon chain in organic fluorine materials are the key to their fouling removal mechanism organic fluorine materials have high chain rigidity and stability which have difficulty interacting with contaminants yarbrough et al 2006 fouling resistant mechanism fouling resistant mechanism is developed on the basis of the anti fouling principles proposed by whitesides et al electroneutrality hydrophilicity hydrogen bond receptor and non hydrogen bond donor ostuni et al 2001 its core is to construct the surface of the hydrophilic membrane to inhibit the deposition of contaminants on the membrane surface and its mechanism can be divided into steric hindrance effect and hydration layer effect fig 3 steric hindrance effect contaminants adsorbed on the membrane surface will compress the polymer network extending on the membrane surface and reduce the degree of freedom of the polymer chain this process places the system in a state of thermodynamic entropy reduction thereby inhibiting the adsorption of contaminants shao et al 2020 hydration layer effect hydrophilic polymers can be combined with water molecules through hydrogen bond or ionic solvent conversion thereby forming a stable and continuous hydration layer on the membranes surface the adsorption of contaminants must remove the hydration layer which will also place the system in a thermodynamic state of entropy reduction zhang et al 2019b in general the anti fouling mechanism can resist the adsorption non migration diffusion and proliferation of most contaminants which has become the widely used anti fouling mechanism however considering that the inert anti fouling mechanism cannot inhibit the proliferation of bacteria addressing proliferative fouling is still limited therefore the active anti fouling mechanism has been developed and accepted that is the introduction of bacteriostatic materials on the membrane surface to resist and kill the proliferation of microorganisms thereby inhibiting the proliferation of fouling based on the different action mechanisms of antibacterial materials the active anti fouling mechanism can be divided into contact anti fouling mechanism and release anti fouling mechanism contact type anti fouling mechanism in this mechanism the antibacterial materials inhibit their cell proliferation by contacting with microorganisms cationic quaternary ammonium salt etc compounds are typical contact antibacterial materials liu et al 2020a the bacteriostatic process includes two steps first the cell wall of microorganisms is destroyed by cation replacement and macromolecular interaction then through electrostatic interaction with phospholipid bilayer and membrane protein the membrane structure is destroyed resulting in cytoplasmic leakage and cell death in addition to cationic polymers some carbon based nano materials have good contact antibacterial properties for example graphene oxide go and carbon nanotubes cnts are typical carbon based nano materials cheng et al 2020 choi et al 2013 kim et al 2014 zhu et al 2017 as shown in fig 4 this kind of material has an antibacterial effect through two mechanisms a physical effect that is the interaction between sharp nano materials and cell membrane the cell membrane can be automatically perforated and permeated with the phospholipid bilayer to block its metabolism b chemical action that is cell death is caused by the peroxidation of phospholipids in the cell membranes by chemical oxidation potentials generated by nano materials the physical and chemical properties such as size existing state and oxidation degree of carbon based nano materials have a significant influence on their antibacterial activity release type anti fouling mechanism the contact type active anti fouling mechanism can only inhibit the proliferation of microorganisms in contact with the membrane surface but it has no effect on the free microorganisms therefore some materials that can release antibacterial substances in water are introduced into the surface of the ro membrane and metal based nano materials such as silver and copper are commonly used to prepare anti biomembrane antibacterial materials ali et al 2016 yin et al 2013 the pathways of the releasable active anti fouling mechanism can be divided into two ways fig 5 first the nano antibacterial materials of metal based nano materials silver and copper dissociate in water to form metal ions ag and cu2 with antibacterial efficacy silver ion interacts with the sulfhydryl groups in microbial channel proteins and reactivity enzymes thereby resulting in the loss of phosphate and phospholipid in cells blocking cell dna replication and inhibiting microbial proliferation this reaction can also occur in cell s mitochondria where h concentrations are high another way is to generate reactive oxygen species ros such as h2o2 o2 oh and ooh through photocatalysis by metal based nano bacteriostatic materials and metal oxide tio2 etc nano materials thereby causing oxidative damage to microbial cells to the extent of killing jiang et al 2018 perreault et al 2015a zarshenas et al 2020 the release anti fouling mechanism can effectively inhibit proliferative pollution but some problems still exist in the process of practical application the release of the type of antibacterial materials to produce ros class materials needs light catalytic conditions uv or visible light but in the actual process of separation the ro membrane has sealed components which cannot satisfy the corresponding conditions meanwhile the dissociation release of bacteriostatic materials will cause the gradual consumption of the bacteriostatic groups shorten the service life and increase the operating cost chlorination degradation and chlorine resistant mechanism in actual filtration and separation chlorination of membranes is inevitable chemical or solvent resistance in membrane technology indicates that the membranes can be exposed to the relevant medium or solvent for a considerable period of time while retaining its initial function notably membranes that performed worse or better after chlorination are considered non chlorine resistant therefore an in depth study on the chlorination degradation mechanism of the polyamide pa ro membrane and establishment of corresponding chlorine resistant mechanism is another hot spot in this field destruction and degradation mechanism of polyamide by active chlorine destruction and degradation mechanism of pa by active chlorine nchlorination in general the poor chlorine resistance of pa ro membrane is due to the sensitivity of pas verbeke et al 2017 kang and orton et al studied the mechanism of chlorine ion attack and proposed that oxide hocl attacked the pa through a reversible n chlorination reaction because the amide n shared its lone pair of electrons with the electron cloud of partially positively charged cl fig 6 kang et al 2007 first the terminal amine group is chlorinated followed by the internal amide bond the reaction of ncl has a primary dependence on free chlorine and promotes the reaction in acidic medium considering that the resulting ncl compounds are considered to be unstable irreversible orton rearrangements may occur to produce cyclochlorinated products under acidic conditions the ncl reaction followed by orton rearrangement is the leading chlorination mechanism hashiba et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b the formation of mixtures of cyclochlorinated and n chlorinated products is possible and cyclochlorination and ncl are quantitatively equivalent under neutral conditions cyclic chlorination is unlikely to occur under alkaline conditions by eliminating the intramolecular rearrangement of ncl atoms molecular chlorine cl2 is produced which attacks the aromatic ring of the adjacent amide by electrophilic substitution reaction under pressurized conditions the rearrangement of n chlorinated products into cyclochlorinated products likely occurs and causes the greatest damage to the membrane however although the orton rearrangement and cyclochlorination do not occur n chlorination will have adverse effects on the membrane properties huang et al 2019 kwon et al 2012 shin et al 2011 chlorination promotes pa hydrolysis furthermore a competitive mechanism based on amide hydrolysis is proposed the attack of chlorine ions on the amide n polarizes the amide c thereby facilitating the hydrolysis of the cn bond through the nucleophile likely oh pa degradation will lead to an increase in the number of carboxyl groups which will further promote the absorption of chlorine and may lead to quinone formation powell et al 2014 the results show that the ratio of the amide bond rupture to chlorine atom bonding increases with the increase of ph of chlorinated solution this ratio can be used to forecast the mechanism and kinetics of amide bond fracture therefore dechlorination and n chlorination are considered to be major processes under alkaline conditions lin et al 2016 yao et al 2019 active chlorine invasion efficiency the absorption rate of chlorine is originally fast and slows down after a long exposure in addition with the increase of electronegativity of the substituted groups on new halogenated aromatic rings the diffusion rate of cl to aromatic rings is slower thus the chemical structure of the pa surface layer changes rapidly and then tends to stabilize after several hours of exposure the same process has been demonstrated over a longer time horizon most chlorination is completed within 1 day of exposure and chloride contents are only 30 higher after 13 days of exposure than those obtained on the first day the kinetic model of the chlorine polymer reciprocity also shows the correlation between the decrease of the absorption rate and the increase of hypochlorite concentration kearney and howarter 2014 tightening up effect another effect namely tightening up has also been discovered in brief this effect includes the formation of diplomatic links in the pa chain yu et al 2009 in the ip process the amount of amine substances added is generally high which may lead to the presence of free aromatic amine groups at the distal end of the pa chain resulting in the presence of unreacted amine monomers in the generated polymer these unreacted monomers are more vulnerable to chlorine than amide bonds thereby producing azo like compounds the crosslinking of the product and pa chain produces a tension effect and changes the mechanical performances of the membrane in mechanics thereby indirectly changing the properties of the membrane all these effects change the properties of the membrane in different ways hence the corresponding chlorine resistant mechanism can be established in combination with their respective mechanisms chlorine resistance mechanism of pa ro membrane aiming at the chlorination degradation of pa three kinds of chlorine resistant mechanisms have been developed protective coating mechanism steric hindrance mechanism and chemical grafting mechanism protective coating mechanisms have two main types zhu et al 2020 one is the sacrificial protective group that is the group coated on the surface of the membrane whose reactivity is higher than the nh bond likely reacts with the active chlorine to protect the nh bond of pa from being chlorinated the other is the direct protective group that is the electron absorbing group which can reduce the activity of pa benzene ring and prevent ortho substitution thereby preventing the chlorination and orton rearrangement of nh bond jaramillo et al 2021 the steric hindrance mechanism introduces the groups at all adjacent positions of the aromatic ring increases steric hindrance and reduces the attack of active chlorine on pa liu et al 2019d the results show that the pa membrane prepared by o phenylenediamine has the best chlorine resistance compared with mpd and p phenylenediamine in addition introducing ch3 into the o position of amino in the aromatic ring can improve the chlorine resistance of pa and prolong the service life of the membrane chemical grafting mechanism contains the amide functional groups on the ro membrane surface primarily amide linkage unreacted amino or acyl chloride produced by the hydrolysis of carboxyl in this mechanism some chemical bonding effects occur and chlorination on the surface of the membrane decreases moreover chlorine resistance increases because of the chemical grafting between the two groups and the protective layer of valid time will be extended zhang et al 2021 preparation and modification of pa ro membrane through the in depth analysis of the separation mechanism anti fouling mechanism and anti chlorine mechanism of the pa ro membrane the separation performance anti fouling performance and anti chlorine performance are closely related to the multistage structure of the membranes particularly the surface given the relatively complex mechanism of ro membrane separation anti fouling mechanism and chlorine resistant mechanism considering the different characteristics of the membrane surface interface and channel is necessary to propose stringent requirements for the design preparation and structural regulation of membrane materials this section summarizes the modification methods of the pa ro membrane and the strategies of multistage structural regulation in addition the research direction of the modification of the aromatic polyamide ro membrane is discussed post membrane forming regulation post membrane forming regulation refers to the regulation of the membrane structure by introducing functional modifiers into the membrane surface active layer after the preparation of pa ro membranes through ip and subsequent treatment at present the commonly used modifiers include functional molecules inorganic nanoparticles and metal organic framework mof lee et al 2019a liu et al 2019b park et al 2017a surface coating adsorption method surface coating adsorption is a method to control the surface structure by using hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction between the modifier and membrane surface to make it attached adsorbed on the membranes surface shin et al 2020 in general the ro membrane is coated to change the surface performances of the active layer wang et al used poly 3allyl 5 5 dimethylhydantoin co vinylamine p admh co vam coating to decrease surface roughness or surface charge and improve hydrophilicity wang et al 2018a changes in the chemical composition of the separation layer alter the interaction with active chlorine chlorine can also attach to p admh co vam coatings but to a lesser degree than pure pa thus it can act as a physical barrier against chlorine attacks however p admh co vam coatings are usually uneven and do not protect the underlying pa layer it can even fall off under strict chlorination conditions khaled et al adsorbed the hydrophilic copolymers n1 3 trimethoxysilylpropyl diethylenetriamine on the pa ro membrane surface and then carried out cross linking and the results showed that their bactericidal efficiency exceeds 80 because the coating is preferred to react with chlorine than merely to act as a physical barrier abdulazeez et al 2019 nevertheless the permeability of the membrane significant improve 50 when the quaternization coating is applied yan et al achieved high salt retention efficiency by combining co solvent optimized ip cso ip and protective coating controlled chlorination pcc chlorination even after prolonged exposure to high concentrations of active chlorine yan et al 2019 ta fe 0 2 pei 0 2 cl has excellent environmental antioxidant properties but unfortunately this comes at the cost of membrane stability and water flux under acidic conditions table 2 summarizes the studies on surface coating or adsorption modification of pa ro membranes in surface coating adsorption the interaction between the modifier and membrane surface is weak and non covalent which is not conducive to the long term stable operation of the modified membrane under the complex environment surface grafting surface grafting refers to the method where a modifier is grafted onto the surface of the ro membrane by covalent bond connection based on the difference of the graft mode it can be divided into graft to and graft from graft to indicates that the active group in the modifier is grafted onto the surface of the pa membrane through covalent reaction to regulate the surface structure of the membrane hydroxaldehyde condensation reaction amination reaction and amidation reaction are the common surface grafting reactions abu seman et al 2010 wei et al 2010 wu et al 2010 hu et al grafted the pva onto the surface of the pa ro membrane through the hydroxyl aldehyde condensation reaction and regulated the surface charge and hydrophilicity of the ro membrane fig 7a an et al 2011 hu et al 2016 the modified ro membrane prepared by an et al could resist pollution by sds bsa and dtab graft to grafting is simple and has wide selection of modifiers however considering that modifiers are nanoparticles or macromolecules they are restricted by steric hindrance and the graft efficiency is low graft from indicates that the modifier monomer can initiate free radical polymerization on the pa ro membrane surface to control the surface structure of the separated membrane among them thermal initiation reaction high energy ray grafting reaction and chemical initiator reaction such as sodium persulfate are common surface free radical grafting reactions amini et al 2011 el arnaouty et al 2018 li et al 2020b meng et al 2014 recently liu et al grafted diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride dadmac onto the surface of the ro membrane by gamma ray initiation and regulated the surface structure of the membrane by adjusting the polymerization graft parameters radiation dose monomer concentration etc fig 7b liu et al 2019c the modified pa ro membrane has high hydrophilicity and its flux and anti fouling property are superior to the blank membrane moreover graft from has good controllability and high graft density however the reaction process is relatively complex to introduce the active free groups on the pa ro membrane surface and the selection of the modifier has some limitations bionic bonding method bionic adhesion is a modification method of adhesion co deposition and chemical reaction on the surface of the ro membrane based on the adhesion characteristics and reactivity of polydopamine pda and other substances which can effectively regulate the structure of the ro membrane blok et al 2014 wu et al 2019 for example wu et al introduced covalent organic framework cof into pda and deposited this cof on the membrane surface through biomimetic bonding which remarkably enhanced the anti fouling performance of the membrane wu et al 2019 in general the regulation method is used to improve the permeability and anti fouling performance of the membrane by modifying the surface structure of the ro membrane such as hydrophilicity the regulation of the ro membrane body and channel structure is seldom performed which slightly improve the inorganic salt ion retention performance in situ regulation method in situ regulation refers to the regulation of the multistage membrane structure by changing the process parameters or introducing modifiers in the preparation of the ro membrane among the methods this method simply changes the synthetic process parameters this section introduces the in situ regulation method of introducing modifiers the in situ regulation method of introducing modifiers includes two approaches the design of membrane forming materials and co mixing of modifiers in the membrane forming process the design of membrane forming materials includes designing and synthesizing new membrane forming materials or introducing compounds with functional groups into traditional membrane forming materials to achieve in situ regulation of the multistage structure of the ro membrane by modifying the physical structure chemical composition and chemical structure of the membrane forming material the surface structure of the ro membrane main channel structure and interfacial structure of the composite and supporting layers can be effectively regulated for example ma et al designed and synthesized amphoteric ionized polyethylenimine and carried out ip as an aqueous phase monomer to adjust the hydrophilicity and charge of the membrane surface and finally prepared an electroneutral separation membrane resistant to pollution ma et al 2016a xu et al prepared high strength ultra thin go separation membranes by self assembly which were stacked with one another to form two dimensional channels of nanometer size and optimized the structure of two dimensional channels of the membranes to achieve synchronous enhancement of membrane inorganic salt retention and water flux xu et al 2017 yan et al activated the carboxyl acyl chloride group on the surface of the supporting layer by tannic acid ta which was chemically reacted with the aqueous phase monomer polymerized at the interface thereby introducing covalent bond action at the interface of the composite layer and improving the stability of the separation membrane yan et al 2021 the co modifier in the membrane forming process can conveniently integrate the properties of the modifier and membrane raw material by adjusting the physical structure and chemical composition of the modifier the in situ regulation of the surface channel interface and other multilevel structures of the ro membrane can be achieved commonly mixed modifiers include high molecular polymer such as peg pei and pva an et al 2011 bera et al 2015 liu et al 2017b zhao et al 2020b organic molecules such as amino acids cyclodextrin and taurine jin et al 2014 and organic inorganic nanometer materials such as metal oxide nanoparticles mos2 graphene cnts and mofs kim et al 2014 li et al 2019 rajakumaran et al 2019 zhao et al 2020a the surface structure of a pa ro membrane can be effectively regulated by mixing functional polymers or organic small molecules in the membrane forming process for example zhang et al used capsaicin as an aqueous phase additive and introduced the ro membrane separation layer through ip zhang et al 2016a after modification the surface hydrophilicity and permeability of the pa ro membrane and the anti fouling and bacterial performances were significantly improved the membrane forming process of the mixed functional nanomaterials metal oxide cnts go cqds etc controls not only the structure of ro membrane surface but also the ro membrane channel introduced in the body including the interface channel and additives ontology of membrane materials and channels such as the multi level structure ali et al 2019 gai et al 2021 lee et al 2019b for example zarshenas et al functionalized the surface of tio2 nanoparticles and designed and synthesized functional tio2 nanoparticles that could increase the simplex dispersion in the pa layer and reduce the aggregation of nanoparticles in aqueous solution zarshenas et al 2020 the preparation of the modified ro membrane can not only maintain high efficiency of inorganic ion retention but also nearly double the flux of permeable water compared with that of undoped nanoparticles the properties of various novel in situ modified pa ro membranes are summarized in table 3 the comparison in table 3 shows that nanomaterials based on go exhibit high efficiency and superior performance which becomes the focus of the development of pa ro membranes with specific functions however synchronously maintaining the original advantages of both nanocomposites and pa membranes remains a key issue hence exploring the high performance ro membrane by using such nanocomposite materials is particularly important outlook and future works although the appearance of the pa composite membrane opens a new journey for the ro membrane it also faces limitations and challenges in the aspects of membrane surface hydrophilicity anti fouling chlorine resistance stability and cost particularly in the commercialization of sewage treatment and desalination shenvi et al 2015 many novel ro membranes with remarkable filtration properties have been prepared in laboratory however the actual performance test of these membranes in water treatment is rarely reported similarly most novel membranes are estimated only in the short term using highly idealized feed solutions most studies have focused either on multiple mechanisms separately or on a single type of membrane property hence future study efforts in pretreatment modification or membrane development must lead directly toward the associative impacts of multi level mechanisms using feed solutions containing intricate components these efforts will potentially close the gap between engineering practice and basic knowledge in addition ro membranes are often contaminated which can increase energy consumption reduce separation property shorten membrane life and increase operating costs li et al 2020d yu et al 2020 therefore anti fouling modification of the ro membrane is a research hotspot in this field optimizing the modification scheme in chemical grafting and physical coating is necessary to minimize the untoward effects of the modifier on the membrane the correlation between the risk of nanomaterials to humans and their poisonousness and exposure remains difficult to quantify which must not be ignored in future studies furthermore large scale ro membranes which arrange nanotubes vertically on a pa layer the shortest water channel have not yet been acquired with the in depth understanding of various fouling mechanisms without clear magnitude relation between functional units and anti fouling performance the precise operation of anti fouling performance remains a challenge achieving the goal of generally applicable anti fouling membranes is necessary but still a tough challenge a single anti fouling strategy of homogeneous membrane surfaces can only weaken typical interaction patterns and can only deal with a limited range of contaminants some scholars have proposed the novel multifunctional anti fouling strategy based on various anti fouling mechanisms when applied to the purification of seawater and industrial wastewater containing more complex contaminants this strategy is superior to a single anti fouling strategy most of the research focuses on the multi defense mechanism of single passive or active anti fouling strategy the synergies of different anti fouling mechanisms remain unclear and difficult to precisely manipulate although pa ro membranes have significant advantages over other water treatment processes their low tolerance to chlorine and other oxides and their resistance to contamination remain a major challenge however the modification of pa remains a difficult problem with regard to salt retention and permeation flux which requires no change or at least no reduction in membrane properties the resistance of these modified membranes to free chlorine is only increased and the resistance to inert or active pollution is only temporary therefore the future ro membrane development technology must converge on novel polymer chemistry which can extend the chlorine resistant and anti fouling properties to a greater extent finally the economic interests of using new modified materials in the ro membrane must exceed the development and production costs of the manufacturer and customer engineering innovation is also important to reduce costs a novel and ideal ro membrane requires not only improved water flux but also good resistance to chlorine and contaminants studying the long term property of the neoteric developed ro membrane during large scale operations is important to determine their stability and find the optimal conditions to maximize their separation property and service life the development and research of membrane technology have evident multi disciplinary nature spanning basic science and applied engineering hence collaborative contributions from researchers with backgrounds in environmental engineering chemical engineering materials science and biology are necessary conclusions the separation technology based on the ro membrane will continue to lead the field of desalination and municipal industrial wastewater treatment in the future this review is related to the issue of separation fouling and chlorination degradation in the ro membrane and the recent findings of the modification methods of the membrane have been completely reviewed despite the recent advances we have emphasized the future studies aimed at improving membrane suitability safety and cost reduction as the next generation ro membrane in this review on the basis of the complexity of the mechanism of the ro membranes no single mitigation strategy will be the ultimate solution to address the issues associated with this phenomenon the boundedness of subsistent materials and methods for ro membrane design will be the driving force for innovation in the continuous search for simple and common strategies enhancing the modified technology is necessary to conquer the trade off among permeability anti fouling property and chlorine resistant performances meanwhile membrane modification is bound to continue to be an important part in ro research after the fundamental mechanisms and mitigation strategies are clarified in the next few years the efforts in developing novel membrane materials continue to blossom as the time goes which likely generates insightful and mind blowing ideas that are

17094,the properties of biofilm eps are determined by the multiple interactions between its constituents and the surrounding environment because of the high complexity of biofilm eps its constituents characterisation is still far from thorough and identification of these interactions cannot be done yet therefore we use gels of bacterial alginate like exopolysaccharides ales as a model component for biofilm eps in this work these gels have been examined for their cohesive properties as a function of cacl2 and kcl concentration hereto ale gel layers were formed on membranes by dead end filtration of ale solutions accumulation of the cations ca2 and k in the gels could be well predicted from a donnan equilibrium model based on the fixed negative charges in the ale this suggests that there is no specific binding of ca2 to the ale and that on the time scale of the experiments the ca2 ions can distribute freely over the gel and the surrounding solution the concentration of fixed negative charges in the ale was estimated around 1 mmol g vss volatile suspended solids organic mass from the donnan equilibrium moreover an accumulation of h was predicted gels with more cacl2 in the supernatant were more compact and bore a higher osmotic pressure than those with less cacl2 revealing the role of ca2 ions in the network crosslinking it is hypothesised that this mechanism later transitions into a rearrangement of the ale molecules which eventually leads to a fibrous network structure with large voids graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular polymeric substances calcium binding hydrogel donnan potential biofilm 1 introduction the integrity of biofilms also when exposed to harsh cleaning attempts has been assigned to their polymeric matrix seviour et al 2019 the matrix is often also referred to as extracellular polymeric substances eps it has been found to consist of a complex mixture of biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins complemented by lipids humic substances and edna the eps matrix has been described as a physically crosslinked hydrogel seviour et al 2009 in reference to its ability to incorporate up to 99 water while providing a lasting polymeric network structure in contrast to chemically crosslinked networks the crosslinks in physically linked networks are provided by non covalent interactions these are particularly electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interactions h bonding and van der waals forces and entanglements they are reversible essential parameters of hydrogels are their degree of crosslinking determined for example by the number of charges on the polymers their interaction with counter ions and their hydrophilicity ganji et al 2010 the interplay of forces following from these parameters determines the state of swelling of the hydrogel under steady state conditions bajpai 2001 and their potential for water storage the swelling state has been identified as a crucial parameter with regards to adhesion mechanical strength permeability and degradation behaviour of hydrogels davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 these properties also have been used to characterise biofilms adhesion and mechanical strength have been correlated with fouling potential li and elimelech 2004 and success of cleaning strategies safari et al 2015 the increase of hydraulic resistance resulting from biofouling on membranes has been labelled as a huge impediment for membrane filtration systems flemming 2020 it strikes therefore that the number of studies about swelling of biofilms and eps is minor so far changes in swelling behaviour of eps have been described as a function of ph for eps extracted from activated sludge as well as for eps extracted from different bacterial cultures radchenkova et al 2018 to understand the molecular interactions and allocate functions to molecules or functional groups simplification of the eps matrix is necessary a promising model are alginate like exopolymers ale which are identified as crucial structural eps components lin et al 2010 like the well characterised and often used alginate extracted from brown algae gel formation with ca2 ions has been observed felz et al 2020a a full chemical analysis of ale is still pending seviour et al 2019 still it was used in this work as a simple approximation for the complexity of biofilm eps ca2 availability has been identified as an essential factor for biofilm stability körstgens et al 2001 and has been shown to induce crosslinking of ale therefore the effect of variations in its concentration was investigated in this study as well based on the impact of monovalent ions wang and spencer 1998 and ionic strength van den brink et al 2009 on the structurally similar ca alginate gels kcl was chosen as a second ionic component ca ale gel layers were produced on membranes in dead end filtration mode although usually membrane filtration operates in cross flow mode dead end filtration was chosen since this method was found to produce sufficiently thick films to investigate using oct and to focus on the cohesive forces of the bulk ale gel from the swelling behaviour of the obtained thick ale layers conclusions were drawn on the binding behaviour of ale in the network formation of eps with a particular focus on the interaction with ca2 the final composition density ions and cake layer resistances of the gel layers were correlated with the availability of ca2 and k and the solutions ionic strength furthermore the gel layers ripening was observed for 12 days the results were analysed based on the donnan equilibrium 2 materials and methods ale gel layers cross linked with ca2 were produced by pressure driven dead end filtration in the presence of cacl2 and kcl their swelling behaviour was observed for up to two weeks eventually their composition was determined and interpreted 2 1 ale extraction and characterisation the alginate like exopolymers used in this study were extracted from nereda sludge collected from the wastewater treatment plant in garmerwolde the netherlands described by pronk et al 2015 a combination of added na2co3 sonication and high temperature was used for extraction following procedures defined by felz et al 2016 granules were collected by decanting about 150 g of wet granules 20 g dry weight were mixed with 1 l demineralised water and 10 g na2co3 vwr the netherlands resulting in a 1 m v carbonate solution the mixture was homogenised with a branson sonifier 250 for 5 min at 70 of 200 w in pulsed mode overheating of the solution was prevented using an ice bath the mixture was then heated to 80 c and vigorously stirred for 30 min after centrifugation allegra x 12r centrifuge beckman coulter 20 min 3750 rpm the supernatant was acidified with 1 m hydrochloric acid merck millipore germany to a final ph 2 2 5 the solution was centrifuged again 20 min 3750 rpm and the pellet was stored at 80 c until further use it is hereafter referred to as ale after extraction the ale was tested for its gel forming ability with cacl2 felz et al 2016 the acidic pellet was dissolved and neutralised with 1 m naoh merck millipore germany drops of the neutral ale were dripped into a 2 5 m v cacl2 solution gelling was considered successful if gel beads could be observed in the solution the dry and organic masses of the ale extract were determined in triplicate samples were weighed into dry porcelain crucibles m sample and heated to 105 c for 24h afterwards the dry sample weight total suspended solids tss was determined after subsequent heating to 550 c for 2 hours the ash s mass was measured m ash the organic mass vss was defined as the difference between tss and m ash 2 2 experiments experiments were performed with two different ale concentrations gel layers with 60 mg l and 45 mm ionic strength were observed for structural changes with oct over five days duplets of layers with 1 mm cacl2 42 mm kcl 3 mm cacl2 36 mm kcl and 15 mm cacl2 were used due to their structural inhomogeneity the latter gels were not further analysed gel layers with 120 mg l ale stayed structurally uniform over the whole observation period and were used to calculate ion distributions an overview of their ionic combinations is given in table 1 for each ion combination three feed solutions were produced each split over two membranes while two of the gel layers were directly analysed for their composition quadruplets of each combination were observed for two weeks concerning their swelling behaviour storage at 4 c to retard microbial growth a further test on the influence of the supernatant composition on the swelling state was done with the underlined combinations in table 1 three gel layers were prepared with 3 mm cacl2 and 6 mm kcl one sample f was directly transferred to a storage solution with 12 mm cacl2 and 6 mm kcl the other two a blank and the test gel layer l were observed for two days in the corresponding storage solution after two days sample l was also transferred to a storage solution with 12 mm cacl2 and 6 mm kcl and the thicknesses of all gel layers were recorded for another five days especially in case of the divalent ca2 ion a significant difference between the nominal concentration ci and the effective activity ai was expected applying an extended debye hückel equation that considers ion sizes kielland 1937 the activity coefficients γ i were determined as a function of the ionic strength i the valence z i and the hydrated radius r i of the ions 1 log γ i b z i 2 i 1 r i c i in water at 25 c the values for b and c are b 0 51 m 0 5 and c 3 3 m 0 5nm 1 hamer and wu 1972 the hydrated radii for the relevant ions were taken as 0 3 nm for k and cl 0 6 nm for ca2 and 0 9 nm for h kielland 1937 the activity coefficients calculated for the solutions of table 1 can be found in the supporting information si tables f 2 3 model gel layer production ale cake layers were prepared by pressure driven dead end filtration of feed solutions through ultrafiltration membranes up150 polyethersulfone pes 150 kda cut off microdyn nadir wiesbaden germany the compositions of the various feed solutions applied are specified in section 2 2 for a total volume of 2 l feed solution the frozen ale was neutralised with 0 1 m naoh merck millipore germany and dissolved in 1 l demineralised water by stirring and heating to 40 c for 1 hour cacl2 2h2o vwr the netherlands and kcl vwr belgium were dissolved in 500 ml demineralised water both solutions were combined slowly and under stirring and the mixture was filled up to 2 l with demineralised water the ionic composition was checked with ion chromatography ic metrohm compact ic 761 500 ml of storage solutions were prepared for each experiment with the corresponding composition of cacl2 and kcl the membranes were cut into circles with a diameter of 7 5 cm and immersed in demineralised water for 1 hour they were mounted at the bottom of 450 ml stainless steel dead end filtration cells for the filtration two cells were connected in parallel to a 10 l pressure vessel that contained the feed solution 2 3 1 filtration and cake layer resistance during filtrations the feed pressure was set to 1 0 1 bar the actual pressure p a was recorded alongside the mass of the filtered solution m f to allow uniform gel layer formation no stirring was applied in the cells all filtrations were performed at room temperature 23 9 0 7 c initially the clean water flux was determined for all membranes by filtration of 750 ml of demineralised water at 1 bar then 2 l of the ale feed solution were added to the pressure vessel and filtered through the two membranes until 600 ml were filtered through each cell filtration took between 18 and 20 hours the membranes with the model gel layers were removed and stored at 4 c in petri dishes submerged in the corresponding storage solutions between experiments the cells and tubing were cleaned with 1 naocl and rinsed with demineralised water the density of water was approximated as ρ h2o 1 g ml for the course of the experiments in order to translate the logged data of filtered mass of water m f at time t to the filtered volume of water v f the transmembrane pressure tmp was approximated with the logged applied pressure p a the total resistance of the filtration r f was calculated from p a and the flux j using the dynamic viscosity of water at 25 c 0 89 mpa s nagashima 1977 for η h2o 2 r f t p a η h 2 o j t subtraction of the membrane resistance calculated from clean water flux from the total resistance provided the cake layer resistance r cl to characterise the gel layers the average cake layer resistance over the last hour prior to termination of the filtration was considered in combination with the organic mass vss per active membrane area a m 38 5 cm2 the specific cake resistance α m was calculated 2 4 observation and analysis of the model gel layers a ganymede sd oct thorlabs dachau germany was used in combination with the thorimage software to obtain information on each sample s structure and thickness h because the gel layers consisted for more than 90 of water the refractive index of water at 25 c of 1 33 was used gel layer thicknesses were observed over up to two weeks the gel layers were also visually inspected for accumulation of bacteria using an olympus bx40 with a 40x magnification objective after the observation period excess water was removed from the gel layers by gently tapping it off the perpendicular membrane onto a paper towel the membrane was put on the paper for 10 s next the ale gel layers were scratched from the membranes their tss and vss were determined according to the procedure described in section 2 1 considering these amounts stable over the observation period this data was used to calculate the specific cake resistance α m as well as the organic mass density ρ vss the latter with the observed thickness as changing variable the ash remaining after tss determination was dissolved in 69 hno3 vwr france heating up in a microwave oven ethos easy advanced microwave digestion system milestone sorisole italy with 1500 mw to 200 c within 15 min and 200 c for another 15 min the amounts of ca2 and k in the gel layers m ion were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkin elmer type optima 5300 dv the molar concentration was calculated for the different ions in reference to the original ale gel layer volume 2 5 electro chemical interpretation for the interpretation of the results the system is considered as two compartments the gel layer compartment 1 and the supernatant compartment 2 fig 1 the gel is fully penetrable for water and all ions contained in the system ca2 k cl h oh in addition the gel layer is considered to contain fixed negative charges including carboxylic acids and sulfated glycosaminoglycans like polymers felz et al 2020b 2 5 1 electroneutrality electroneutrality demands that within each compartment the charges are balanced 3 i z i c i 2 0 4 i z i c i 1 z 0 i are the ions specified above z is the concentration of fixed negative charges in the gel in the experiments the ionic composition in the supernatant was considered controlled and constant due to its substantial volumetric excess compared to the gel layers the concentrations assumed are therefore those shown in table 1 completed with a negligible concentration of 10 4 mm for both h and oh ph 7 2 5 2 donnan equilibrium the donnan potential describes the electrical potential difference between two compartments due to the uneven distribution of ions as a result of the existence of fixed charges in one of them here in the ale following from the nernst equation it can be calculated as follows 5 e donnan ψ 1 ψ 2 rt z i f ln a i 2 a i 1 as before compartment 1 represents the gel phase and 2 stands for the solution ψ1 and ψ2 are the respective electrical potentials ai 1 and ai 2 the activities of ion i in the two compartments zi is the valency of the ion r the gas constant t the absolute temperature and f the faraday constant assuming that there are no specific interactions the donnan potential applies to all ions in the system equating eq 5 for different ions i j and i k gives 6 a j 2 a j 1 1 z j a k 2 a k 1 1 z k eq 6 enables calculating the distribution of a non quantified ion like h from the determined distribution of another ion like ca2 2 5 3 osmotic pressure as a consequence of fixed negative charges as found in the ale an uneven ion distribution between gel and supernatant can be established as described above this causes an osmotic pressure difference between the gel layers and the supernatant the osmotic pressure π in each of the compartments can be calculated from the ionic concentrations using the van t hoff equation 7 π r t i c i in equilibrium the gel network withstands the osmotic pressure difference between the gel layer and the supernatant therefore this difference can indicate the strength of the network 3 results 3 1 cake layer resistance the development of cake layer resistance during filtration is shown in fig 2 for a representative experiment 6 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl for all experiments executed with cacl2 similar graphs were obtained such shape of the resistance development is common for fouling experiments listiarini et al 2009 the slight concave curvature suggests that the cake layers in this work were compressed during formation roorda and van der graaf 2001 the specific cake layer resistance α m was calculated using the vss determined directly after filtration the results are shown in the bubble chart of fig 3 differences between the tested ionic compositions were small only with increasing cacl2 content a slight increase in the specific cake layer resistance was observed a systematic effect of kcl was not found 3 2 composition 3 2 1 swelling behaviour after preparation comparing gel layers analysed directly after production with those examined after 12 days showed no significant differences in vss content no microbial growth was observed on the 12 days old gel layers the amount of ale was considered constant during the observation period it was expected that after the filtration the gel layers would adjust to the removal of the applied pressure by swelling and eventually reach an equilibrium thickness this hydrogel like behaviour has been observed for alginate gel layers under similar conditions davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 the equilibration took a long time though see fig 4 in a prolonged observation period pores appeared in some gels as revealed by oct which will be discussed in section 3 4 for all gel layers an initially fast increase in thickness was observed followed by a period of slower increase the thickness was converted into vss density ρ vss the development of ρ vss as a function of time is shown in fig 4 for the different ionic compositions the density of gel layers with constant cacl2 and varying kcl concentrations in the supernatant as the only variable showed fairly identical behaviour fig 4c in contrast an increase in cacl2 concentration resulted in higher vss densities fig 4a 4b and 4d an exception from this observation was found at cacl2 concentrations above 8 mm cacl2 the density and swelling behaviour did not depend on cacl2 concentration anymore fig 4a or only slightly fig 3b suggesting saturation slightly smaller differences in vss density were observed between the samples with 3 mm 6 mm and 8 mm cacl2 shown in fig 4d with varying kcl concentrations compared to fig 4a without kcl and 4b with stable kcl concentration the influence of cacl2 concentration appeared to be much more significant though 3 2 2 ion distribution ca2 and k both accumulated in the gel layers the concentrations are summarised in the si in tables a and b while for ca2 the concentration found inside the gels initially was up to 25 times that in the supernatant with a maximum of 4 times the supernatant concentration the accumulation of k inside the gels was much more moderate as for the vss densities a decrease over time was observed all types of small ions provided that they were not irreversibly bound to the gel on the timescale of the experiments would distribute over the two compartments according to the donnan potential cf section 2 5 1 whether the ions indeed distributed according to a donnan equilibrium was checked by comparing the donnan potential values calculated from both the distributions of k ions and ca2 ions si tables h and j all values were found between 10 mv and 40 mv in the range where passively established potentials in biological systems were expected sperelakis 2012 the reasonable agreement between the values calculated from the distributions of ca2 and k suggests that both types of ions could freely move between the two compartments on the timescale of the experiments with eq 6 the h activities inside the gel layers were estimated from the ca2 activities considering the supernatant h activity was constant at a h 10 4 mm ph 7 the calculations predict a slight decrease of ph inside the gel layers to ph 6 6 6 8 based on the donnan equilibrium and electro neutrality requirement the concentration of fixed charges z in the ale was estimated using eq 4 for the calculations it was assumed that the contribution of cations other than ca2 and k to the neutralisation of z was negligible and that cl si tables g was the dominant anion in the system an average value of 1 05 0 20 mmol g vss was obtained data in si tables k 3 2 3 osmotic pressure network strength because of their very low molar concentrations the ale molecules as well as h and oh hardly contributed to the osmotic pressure difference and only ca2 k and cl were considered the resulting values for π calculated with eq 7 are shown in table 2 and table 3 after preparation of the gel layers water flew inside the gel layers to minimise the osmotic pressure difference and caused swelling at some point further swelling was prevented by the opposing elastic force of the ale network in equilibrium the osmotic pressure difference is therefore an indicator for the network strength the results show that with increasing cacl2 concentration in the supernatant the network strength slightly increased this indicates that ca2 was involved in crosslinking of the gel layers 3 3 reversibility of swelling by increasing the ca2 concentration to differentiate between the influence of cacl2 available during filtration and cacl2 available during the swelling an experiment with a change in cacl2 concentration during storage was performed gel layers were produced with a low calcium concentration 3 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl and then transferred to storage solutions with a high calcium concentration 12 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl directly sample f and after two days sample l the development of their vss density in time is shown in fig 5 compared to a low blank prepared and stored with 3 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl also shown is a high blank produced and stored at 12 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl already after 3 minutes sample f had a higher density than those stored in the low cacl2 solution fig 5b the high blank was at this moment still much denser after 30 min the density of sample f equalled that of the high blank in the longer term it even seemed to reach a slightly higher density than this after transferring sample l to a high calcium concentration solution compaction of the ale gel layer was observed within a few minutes fig 5c this process continued for about 6 h then an apparent steady state was reached that lasted for the rest of the observation period fig 5a the density achieved by this compaction stayed below those of the high blank and sample f the swelling was therefore described as partly reversible similarly the ca2 content per vss in the transferred gel layers did not completely reach that of the high blank data not shown in accordance with the density data the osmotic pressure data for the reversibility experiment table 3 showed a clear hierarchy in network strength increasing from the low blank via the one transferred to 12 mm cacl2 after 2 days to the one directly stored in 12 mm cacl2 also in this case what happened during the two days of storage in the low concentration solution was partly irreversible 3 4 additional ripening the experiments described in section 3 2 were limited to 12 days because that was found to be the period over which all gel layers kept their macroscopic integrity which was a requirement to calculate and compare the densities when stored for a more extended period or with less optimised concentrations of ale and ions initially voids were observed in the gel layers eventually a fibrous network developed this development is illustrated by the optical coherence tomography oct pictures in fig 6 for gel layers produced with 60 mg l ale and 45 mm ionic strength 30 min after production after 3 days and after 5 days the used oct system had a resolution in the range of 10 µm meaning that pores could only be detected as soon as they reached this size in both dimensions it seems likely that these pores developed on a micro scale before structural changes could be observed with the oct structural rearrangements in the ale network were considered the major cause for the observed slow swelling of the gel layers described in sections 3 1 3 3 increasing the resolution for example by taking sem pictures on stabilised samples may reveal such changes on the microstructure level 4 discussion the gel layers composition and appearance result from the balances between electrostatic interactions in the gel osmotic pressure differences between the gel and the outside solution and the ability of the gel network to withstand swelling by water intake these mechanisms are discussed below 4 1 ion distribution while the high specificity and chelating nature of the ca2 crosslinks in alginate are well known the present results indicate no specific irreversible binding of ca2 to ale therefore it is expected that ca2 can be easily removed for example by dilution or replaced by other ions based on this study s results other divalent cations are probably also able to induce the crosslinking formation of stable gels with comparable elastic properties has indeed been confirmed with a whole range of divalent cations felz et al 2020a to identify the non specificity of those interactions composition analysis like done in this study can be used the difference with alginate in binding may be explained by the finding that a significant amount of the charged groups in ale is sulfate rather than carboxylate felz et al 2020b based on electro neutrality and the donnan potential the number of negative charges in the ale was calculated as 1 05 0 20 mmol g vss one ca2 cation could neutralise two negative charges in theory so this value is well in line with the measured ca2 concentrations in the ale gel layers of 200 700 μmol per g vss si fig a it should be noted however that following the donnan potential also cl distributed over gel layer and supernatant as a consequence not every ca2 ion inside the gel layers contributed to the crosslinking the pk a values of the carboxylate groups of mannuronic and guluronic acid were found at 3 38 and 3 65 draget et al 1994 these groups are all negatively charged at ph 7 and thus contributed to z in the ale gel layers sulfates are strong acids so negatively charged independently of ph therefore the current experiments and calculations did not identify what groups of ale were involved in crosslinking on the basis of further chemical characterisation of ale experiments in which the ph is varied can be useful for deeper insight 4 1 1 correlation between ca2 content density and strength of the ale gel layers with increasing cacl2 concentration in the supernatant the ale gel layers as prepared in this work were found denser until a plateau was reached around 8 mm ca2 fig 4 such correlation has been studied intensively for alginate gels davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 and has been explained with a higher number of crosslinks with increasing ca2 concentration also for bacterial eps ca2 availability has been directly linked to denser films goode and allen 2011 körstgens et al 2001 this work shows in addition a correlation between ca2 content and density and the network strength cf section 3 2 3 the supernatant s ionic composition defined the ion concentration inside the gels given the fixed amount of charges of the ale per g vss and thus the osmotic pressure difference section 2 5 at the same time the network strength determined the maximum amount of water that could be taken up to reduce the osmotic pressure difference apparently over time this maximum amount increased associated with a slow but irreversible weakening of the network structure as shown in table 3 further discussion of the reversibility in section 4 3 the mechanisms behind this effect are probably related to the slow structural rearrangement resulting in void formation fig 6 and require further investigation 4 2 hydraulic resistance of ale gel layers a positive correlation between eps density and hydraulic resistance of biofilms has been postulated before desmond et al 2018 jafari et al 2018 also the ca2 concentration in ale films has been correlated to flux decline in membrane filtration herzberg et al 2009 this goes along with the finding that the specific cake layer resistance of the ale gel layers in this work slightly increased with supernatant cacl2 concentration fig 3 in this context it attracted attention that while the vss density reached a maximum around 110 mg cm3 the specific resistance still slightly increased e g between 8 mm cacl2 and 14 mm cacl2 fig 3 the differences in relation to the standard deviations cf si table e were so small however that no further conclusions could be drawn from these data 4 3 compressibility relaxation and ripening compressibility as observed for the ale gel layers in this work is a feature of biofilms that has been investigated for several years jafari et al 2018 and that has also been used as an indication for the viscoelastic behaviour of biofilms safari et al 2015 the relaxation of biofilms after compression has been described with the help of maxwell springs jones et al 2011 safari et al 2015 as an approximately exponential process in our experiments relaxation was expected as soon as the filtration pressure was released due to experimental restrictions the changes in the thickness of the ale gel layers in this study were only recorded from ca 3 minutes after pressure release therefore a quantitative analysis of the collected data appeared unreliable for accurate collection and analysis of relaxation data to extract characteristic viscoelastic data systems with controllable compression and instantaneous observation of the stress and strain are needed such experiments will also be of interest to distinguish between cross linked gel layers and non cross linked cake layers also the influence of different gel production procedures could be interesting in this regard interesting observations in this study were the long continuation of the swelling fig 4 and the eventual development of a fibre like ale network fig 6 fibrous structures have been observed in biofilm matrices romero et al 2010 and are usually attributed to amyloids the present study suggests that ale also forms such fibres in accordance with previous work lin et al 2018 the observation that the swelling process was only partly reversible section 3 3 indicates that a slow molecular rearrangement started with the initial formation of microscopic voids in the structure cf jafari et al 2018 right when the pressure was released because the network had started to be weakened by the voids cf table 3 section 4 1 1 neither the density nor the osmotic pressure difference of gel layers directly stored in the higher cacl2 concentration could be reached by later transferred samples fibrous structures and a decrease in density over longer time scales between 7 and 12 days were especially found in the gel layers that were prepared with and stored at the lower cacl2 concentrations 1 and 3 mm apparently fibre formation was prevented or delayed by ca2 crosslinks in the network according to desmond et al desmond et al 2018b compression caused by filtration pressure is reversible for structurally homogeneous biofilms and irreversible for films with a heterogeneous structure this work supports this finding showing that networks with voids were weaker than more homogenous networks without voids 4 4 outlook this work provides valuable insight into the interaction between ale and ca2 in the presence of k and cl as a next step the influence of ca2 content of ale gels on their mechanical properties such as modulus strength and adhesion will be investigated while a closer look on the swelling behaviour can be a start e g by observation in the filtration cell during filtration possibly also under application of different pressures determining the gels viscoelastic properties by rheological measurements will provide quantitative data this will make it possible to link the composition to mechanical properties of the gel layers and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper the system of ale and specific ions still represents a simplified model for the eps matrix of biofilms the model can be extended by adding other kinds of molecules such as peptides humic acids and edna to eventually get close to real biofilms complexity evaluating the interactions within the ale network also beyond electrostatic ones with added compounds and based on a better chemical characterisation of ale and eps can lead the path towards understanding the cohesive forces of biofilms this is an important step towards tailored cleaning strategies 5 conclusions the density and network strength of ale gel layers depend on crosslinking with a multivalent cation like ca2 ca ale gel layers produced on a membrane by dead end filtration swell after pressure release for up to 12 days this process is accompanied by a weakening of the structure and is partially irreversible one of the mechanisms behind it is a slow molecular rearrangement of ale culminating in the development of a fibrous structure the accumulation of cations including ca2 over a ca ale gel and its supernatant can be described as a result of a donnan potential induced by the fixed charges on the extracellular polymers this

17094,the properties of biofilm eps are determined by the multiple interactions between its constituents and the surrounding environment because of the high complexity of biofilm eps its constituents characterisation is still far from thorough and identification of these interactions cannot be done yet therefore we use gels of bacterial alginate like exopolysaccharides ales as a model component for biofilm eps in this work these gels have been examined for their cohesive properties as a function of cacl2 and kcl concentration hereto ale gel layers were formed on membranes by dead end filtration of ale solutions accumulation of the cations ca2 and k in the gels could be well predicted from a donnan equilibrium model based on the fixed negative charges in the ale this suggests that there is no specific binding of ca2 to the ale and that on the time scale of the experiments the ca2 ions can distribute freely over the gel and the surrounding solution the concentration of fixed negative charges in the ale was estimated around 1 mmol g vss volatile suspended solids organic mass from the donnan equilibrium moreover an accumulation of h was predicted gels with more cacl2 in the supernatant were more compact and bore a higher osmotic pressure than those with less cacl2 revealing the role of ca2 ions in the network crosslinking it is hypothesised that this mechanism later transitions into a rearrangement of the ale molecules which eventually leads to a fibrous network structure with large voids graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular polymeric substances calcium binding hydrogel donnan potential biofilm 1 introduction the integrity of biofilms also when exposed to harsh cleaning attempts has been assigned to their polymeric matrix seviour et al 2019 the matrix is often also referred to as extracellular polymeric substances eps it has been found to consist of a complex mixture of biopolymers such as polysaccharides and proteins complemented by lipids humic substances and edna the eps matrix has been described as a physically crosslinked hydrogel seviour et al 2009 in reference to its ability to incorporate up to 99 water while providing a lasting polymeric network structure in contrast to chemically crosslinked networks the crosslinks in physically linked networks are provided by non covalent interactions these are particularly electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interactions h bonding and van der waals forces and entanglements they are reversible essential parameters of hydrogels are their degree of crosslinking determined for example by the number of charges on the polymers their interaction with counter ions and their hydrophilicity ganji et al 2010 the interplay of forces following from these parameters determines the state of swelling of the hydrogel under steady state conditions bajpai 2001 and their potential for water storage the swelling state has been identified as a crucial parameter with regards to adhesion mechanical strength permeability and degradation behaviour of hydrogels davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 these properties also have been used to characterise biofilms adhesion and mechanical strength have been correlated with fouling potential li and elimelech 2004 and success of cleaning strategies safari et al 2015 the increase of hydraulic resistance resulting from biofouling on membranes has been labelled as a huge impediment for membrane filtration systems flemming 2020 it strikes therefore that the number of studies about swelling of biofilms and eps is minor so far changes in swelling behaviour of eps have been described as a function of ph for eps extracted from activated sludge as well as for eps extracted from different bacterial cultures radchenkova et al 2018 to understand the molecular interactions and allocate functions to molecules or functional groups simplification of the eps matrix is necessary a promising model are alginate like exopolymers ale which are identified as crucial structural eps components lin et al 2010 like the well characterised and often used alginate extracted from brown algae gel formation with ca2 ions has been observed felz et al 2020a a full chemical analysis of ale is still pending seviour et al 2019 still it was used in this work as a simple approximation for the complexity of biofilm eps ca2 availability has been identified as an essential factor for biofilm stability körstgens et al 2001 and has been shown to induce crosslinking of ale therefore the effect of variations in its concentration was investigated in this study as well based on the impact of monovalent ions wang and spencer 1998 and ionic strength van den brink et al 2009 on the structurally similar ca alginate gels kcl was chosen as a second ionic component ca ale gel layers were produced on membranes in dead end filtration mode although usually membrane filtration operates in cross flow mode dead end filtration was chosen since this method was found to produce sufficiently thick films to investigate using oct and to focus on the cohesive forces of the bulk ale gel from the swelling behaviour of the obtained thick ale layers conclusions were drawn on the binding behaviour of ale in the network formation of eps with a particular focus on the interaction with ca2 the final composition density ions and cake layer resistances of the gel layers were correlated with the availability of ca2 and k and the solutions ionic strength furthermore the gel layers ripening was observed for 12 days the results were analysed based on the donnan equilibrium 2 materials and methods ale gel layers cross linked with ca2 were produced by pressure driven dead end filtration in the presence of cacl2 and kcl their swelling behaviour was observed for up to two weeks eventually their composition was determined and interpreted 2 1 ale extraction and characterisation the alginate like exopolymers used in this study were extracted from nereda sludge collected from the wastewater treatment plant in garmerwolde the netherlands described by pronk et al 2015 a combination of added na2co3 sonication and high temperature was used for extraction following procedures defined by felz et al 2016 granules were collected by decanting about 150 g of wet granules 20 g dry weight were mixed with 1 l demineralised water and 10 g na2co3 vwr the netherlands resulting in a 1 m v carbonate solution the mixture was homogenised with a branson sonifier 250 for 5 min at 70 of 200 w in pulsed mode overheating of the solution was prevented using an ice bath the mixture was then heated to 80 c and vigorously stirred for 30 min after centrifugation allegra x 12r centrifuge beckman coulter 20 min 3750 rpm the supernatant was acidified with 1 m hydrochloric acid merck millipore germany to a final ph 2 2 5 the solution was centrifuged again 20 min 3750 rpm and the pellet was stored at 80 c until further use it is hereafter referred to as ale after extraction the ale was tested for its gel forming ability with cacl2 felz et al 2016 the acidic pellet was dissolved and neutralised with 1 m naoh merck millipore germany drops of the neutral ale were dripped into a 2 5 m v cacl2 solution gelling was considered successful if gel beads could be observed in the solution the dry and organic masses of the ale extract were determined in triplicate samples were weighed into dry porcelain crucibles m sample and heated to 105 c for 24h afterwards the dry sample weight total suspended solids tss was determined after subsequent heating to 550 c for 2 hours the ash s mass was measured m ash the organic mass vss was defined as the difference between tss and m ash 2 2 experiments experiments were performed with two different ale concentrations gel layers with 60 mg l and 45 mm ionic strength were observed for structural changes with oct over five days duplets of layers with 1 mm cacl2 42 mm kcl 3 mm cacl2 36 mm kcl and 15 mm cacl2 were used due to their structural inhomogeneity the latter gels were not further analysed gel layers with 120 mg l ale stayed structurally uniform over the whole observation period and were used to calculate ion distributions an overview of their ionic combinations is given in table 1 for each ion combination three feed solutions were produced each split over two membranes while two of the gel layers were directly analysed for their composition quadruplets of each combination were observed for two weeks concerning their swelling behaviour storage at 4 c to retard microbial growth a further test on the influence of the supernatant composition on the swelling state was done with the underlined combinations in table 1 three gel layers were prepared with 3 mm cacl2 and 6 mm kcl one sample f was directly transferred to a storage solution with 12 mm cacl2 and 6 mm kcl the other two a blank and the test gel layer l were observed for two days in the corresponding storage solution after two days sample l was also transferred to a storage solution with 12 mm cacl2 and 6 mm kcl and the thicknesses of all gel layers were recorded for another five days especially in case of the divalent ca2 ion a significant difference between the nominal concentration ci and the effective activity ai was expected applying an extended debye hückel equation that considers ion sizes kielland 1937 the activity coefficients γ i were determined as a function of the ionic strength i the valence z i and the hydrated radius r i of the ions 1 log γ i b z i 2 i 1 r i

various feed solutions applied are specified in section 2 2 for a total volume of 2 l feed solution the frozen ale was neutralised with 0 1 m naoh merck millipore germany and dissolved in 1 l demineralised water by stirring and heating to 40 c for 1 hour cacl2 2h2o vwr the netherlands and kcl vwr belgium were dissolved in 500 ml demineralised water both solutions were combined slowly and under stirring and the mixture was filled up to 2 l with demineralised water the ionic composition was checked with ion chromatography ic metrohm compact ic 761 500 ml of storage solutions were prepared for each experiment with the corresponding composition of cacl2 and kcl the membranes were cut into circles with a diameter of 7 5 cm and immersed in demineralised water for 1 hour they were mounted at the bottom of 450 ml stainless steel dead end filtration cells for the filtration two cells were connected in parallel to a 10 l pressure vessel that contained the feed solution 2 3 1 filtration and cake layer resistance during filtrations the feed pressure was set to 1 0 1 bar the actual pressure p a was recorded alongside the mass of the filtered solution m f to allow uniform gel layer formation no stirring was applied in the cells all filtrations were performed at room temperature 23 9 0 7 c initially the clean water flux was determined for all membranes by filtration of 750 ml of demineralised water at 1 bar then 2 l of the ale feed solution were added to the pressure vessel and filtered through the two membranes until 600 ml were filtered through each cell filtration took between 18 and 20 hours the membranes with the model gel layers were removed and stored at 4 c in petri dishes submerged in the corresponding storage solutions between experiments the cells and tubing were cleaned with 1 naocl and rinsed with demineralised water the density of water was approximated as ρ h2o 1 g ml for the course of the experiments in order to translate the logged data of filtered mass of water m f at time t to the filtered volume of water v f the transmembrane pressure tmp was approximated with the logged applied pressure p a the total resistance of the filtration r f

clean water flux from the total resistance provided the cake layer resistance r cl to characterise the gel layers the average cake layer resistance over the last hour prior to termination of the filtration was considered in combination with the organic mass vss per active membrane area a m 38 5 cm2 the specific cake resistance α m was calculated 2 4 observation and analysis of the model gel layers a ganymede sd oct thorlabs dachau germany was used in combination with the thorimage software to obtain information on each sample s structure and thickness h because the gel layers consisted for more than 90 of water the refractive index of water at 25 c of 1 33 was used gel layer thicknesses were observed over up to two weeks the gel layers were also visually inspected for accumulation of bacteria using an olympus bx40 with a 40x magnification objective after the observation period excess water was removed from the gel layers by gently tapping it off the perpendicular membrane onto a paper towel the membrane was put on the paper for 10 s next the ale gel layers were scratched from the membranes their tss and vss were determined according to the procedure described in section 2 1 considering these amounts stable over the observation period this data was used to calculate the specific cake resistance α m as well as the organic mass density ρ vss the latter with the observed thickness as changing variable the ash remaining after tss determination was dissolved in 69 hno3 vwr france heating up in a microwave oven ethos easy advanced microwave digestion system milestone sorisole italy with 1500 mw to 200 c within 15 min and 200 c for another 15 min the amounts of ca2 and k in the gel layers m ion were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes perkin elmer type optima 5300 dv the molar concentration was calculated for the different ions in reference to the original ale gel layer volume 2 5 electro chemical interpretation for the interpretation of the results the system is considered as two compartments the gel layer compartment 1 and the supernatant compartment 2 fig 1 the gel is fully penetrable for water and all ions contained in the system ca2 k cl h oh in addition the gel layer is considered to contain fixed negative charges including carboxylic acids and sulfated glycosaminoglycans like polymers felz et al 2020b 2 5 1 electroneutrality electroneutrality demands that within each compartment the charges are balanced 3 i z i c i 2 0 4 i z i c i 1 z 0 i are the ions specified above z is the concentration of fixed negative charges in the gel in the experiments the ionic composition in the supernatant was considered controlled and constant due to its substantial volumetric excess compared to the gel layers the concentrations assumed are therefore those shown in table 1 completed with a negligible concentration of 10 4 mm for both h and oh ph 7 2 5 2 donnan equilibrium the donnan potential describes the electrical potential difference between two compartments due to the uneven distribution of ions as a result of the existence of fixed charges in one of them here in the ale following from the nernst equation it can be calculated as follows 5 e donnan ψ 1 ψ 2 rt z i f ln a i 2 a i 1 as before compartment 1 represents the gel phase and 2 stands for the solution ψ1 and ψ2 are the respective electrical potentials ai 1 and ai 2 the activities of ion i in the two compartments zi is the valency of the ion r the gas constant t the absolute temperature and f the faraday constant assuming that there are no specific interactions the donnan potential applies to all ions in the system equating eq 5 for different ions i j and i k gives 6 a j 2 a j 1 1 z j a k 2 a k 1 1 z k eq 6 enables calculating the distribution of a non quantified ion like h from the determined distribution of another ion like ca2 2 5 3 osmotic pressure as a consequence of fixed negative charges as found in the ale an uneven ion distribution between gel and supernatant can be established as described above this causes an osmotic pressure difference between the gel layers and the supernatant the osmotic pressure π in each of the compartments can be calculated from the ionic concentrations using the van t hoff equation 7 π r t i c i in equilibrium the gel network withstands the osmotic pressure difference between the gel layer and the supernatant therefore this difference can indicate the strength of the network 3 results 3 1 cake layer resistance the development of cake layer resistance during filtration is shown in fig 2 for a representative experiment 6 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl for all experiments executed with cacl2 similar graphs were obtained such shape of the resistance development is common for fouling experiments listiarini et al 2009 the slight concave curvature suggests that the cake layers in this work were compressed during formation roorda and van der graaf 2001 the specific cake layer resistance α m was calculated using the vss determined directly after filtration the results are shown in the bubble chart of fig 3 differences between the tested ionic compositions were small only with increasing cacl2 content a slight increase in the specific cake layer resistance was observed a systematic effect of kcl was not found 3 2 composition 3 2 1 swelling behaviour after preparation comparing gel layers analysed directly after production with those examined after 12 days showed no significant differences in vss content no microbial growth was observed on the 12 days old gel layers the amount of ale was considered constant during the observation period it was expected that after the filtration the gel layers would adjust to the removal of the applied pressure by swelling and eventually reach an equilibrium thickness this hydrogel like behaviour has been observed for alginate gel layers under similar conditions davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 the equilibration took a long time though see fig 4 in a prolonged observation period pores appeared in some gels as revealed by oct which will be discussed in section 3 4 for all gel layers an initially fast increase in thickness was observed followed by a period of slower increase the thickness was converted into vss density ρ vss the development of ρ vss as a function of time is shown in fig 4 for the different ionic compositions the density of gel layers with constant cacl2 and varying kcl concentrations in the supernatant as the only variable showed fairly identical behaviour fig 4c in contrast an increase in cacl2 concentration resulted in higher vss densities fig 4a 4b and 4d an exception from this observation was found at cacl2 concentrations above 8 mm cacl2 the density and swelling behaviour did not depend on cacl2 concentration anymore fig 4a or only slightly fig 3b suggesting saturation slightly smaller differences in vss density were observed between the samples with 3 mm 6 mm and 8 mm cacl2 shown in fig 4d with varying kcl concentrations compared to fig 4a without kcl and 4b with stable kcl concentration the influence of cacl2 concentration appeared to be much more significant though 3 2 2 ion distribution ca2 and k both accumulated in the gel layers the concentrations are summarised in the si in tables a and b while for ca2 the concentration found inside the gels initially was up to 25 times that in the supernatant with a maximum of 4 times the supernatant concentration the accumulation of k inside the gels was much more moderate as for the vss densities a decrease over time was observed all types of small ions provided that they were not irreversibly bound to the gel on the timescale of the experiments would distribute over the two compartments according to the donnan potential cf section 2 5 1 whether the ions indeed distributed according to a donnan equilibrium was checked by comparing the donnan potential values calculated from both the distributions of k ions and ca2 ions si tables h and j all values were found between 10 mv and 40 mv in the range where passively established potentials in biological systems were expected sperelakis 2012 the reasonable agreement between the values calculated from the distributions of ca2 and k suggests that both types of ions could freely move between the two compartments on the timescale of the experiments with eq 6 the h activities inside the gel layers were estimated from the ca2 activities considering the supernatant h activity was constant at a h 10 4 mm ph 7 the calculations predict a slight decrease of ph inside the gel layers to ph 6 6 6 8 based on the donnan equilibrium and electro neutrality requirement the concentration of fixed charges z in the ale was estimated using eq 4 for the calculations it was assumed that the contribution of cations other than ca2 and k to the neutralisation of z was negligible and that cl si tables g was the dominant anion in the system an average value of 1 05 0 20 mmol g vss was obtained data in si tables k 3 2 3 osmotic pressure network strength because of their very low molar concentrations the ale molecules as well as h and oh hardly contributed to the osmotic pressure difference and only ca2 k and cl were considered the resulting values for π calculated with eq 7 are shown in table 2 and table 3 after preparation of the gel layers water flew inside the gel layers to minimise the osmotic pressure difference and caused swelling at some point further swelling was prevented by the opposing elastic force of the ale network in equilibrium the osmotic pressure difference is therefore an indicator for the network strength the results show that with increasing cacl2 concentration in the supernatant the network strength slightly increased this indicates that ca2 was involved in crosslinking of the gel layers 3 3 reversibility of swelling by increasing the ca2 concentration to differentiate between the influence of cacl2 available during filtration and cacl2 available during the swelling an experiment with a change in cacl2 concentration during storage was performed gel layers were produced with a low calcium concentration 3 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl and then transferred to storage solutions with a high calcium concentration 12 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl directly sample f and after two days sample l the development of their vss density in time is shown in fig 5 compared to a low blank prepared and stored with 3 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl also shown is a high blank produced and stored at 12 mm cacl2 6 mm kcl already after 3 minutes sample f had a higher density than those stored in the low cacl2 solution fig 5b the high blank was at this moment still much denser after 30 min the density of sample f equalled that of the high blank in the longer term it even seemed to reach a slightly higher density than this after transferring sample l to a high calcium concentration solution compaction of the ale gel layer was observed within a few minutes fig 5c this process continued for about 6 h then an apparent steady state was reached that lasted for the rest of the observation period fig 5a the density achieved by this compaction stayed below those of the high blank and sample f the swelling was therefore described as partly reversible similarly the ca2 content per vss in the transferred gel layers did not completely reach that of the high blank data not shown in accordance with the density data the osmotic pressure data for the reversibility experiment table 3 showed a clear hierarchy in network strength increasing from the low blank via the one transferred to 12 mm cacl2 after 2 days to the one directly stored in 12 mm cacl2 also in this case what happened during the two days of storage in the low concentration solution was partly irreversible 3 4 additional ripening the experiments described in section 3 2 were limited to 12 days because that was found to be the period over which all gel layers kept their macroscopic integrity which was a requirement to calculate and compare the densities when stored for a more extended period or with less optimised concentrations of ale and ions initially voids were observed in the gel layers eventually a fibrous network developed this development is illustrated by the optical coherence tomography oct pictures in fig 6 for gel layers produced with 60 mg l ale and 45 mm ionic strength 30 min after production after 3 days and after 5 days the used oct system had a resolution in the range of 10 µm meaning that pores could only be detected as soon as they reached this size in both dimensions it seems likely that these pores developed on a micro scale before structural changes could be observed with the oct structural rearrangements in the ale network were considered the major cause for the observed slow swelling of the gel layers described in sections 3 1 3 3 increasing the resolution for example by taking sem pictures on stabilised samples may reveal such changes on the microstructure level 4 discussion the gel layers composition and appearance result from the balances between electrostatic interactions in the gel osmotic pressure differences between the gel and the outside solution and the ability of the gel network to withstand swelling by water intake these mechanisms are discussed below 4 1 ion distribution while the high specificity and chelating nature of the ca2 crosslinks in alginate are well known the present results indicate no specific irreversible binding of ca2 to ale therefore it is expected that ca2 can be easily removed for example by dilution or replaced by other ions based on this study s results other divalent cations are probably also able to induce the crosslinking formation of stable gels with comparable elastic properties has indeed been confirmed with a whole range of divalent cations felz et al 2020a to identify the non specificity of those interactions composition analysis like done in this study can be used the difference with alginate in binding may be explained by the finding that a significant amount of the charged groups in ale is sulfate rather than carboxylate felz et al 2020b based on electro neutrality and the donnan potential the number of negative charges in the ale was calculated as 1 05 0 20 mmol g vss one ca2 cation could neutralise two negative charges in theory so this value is well in line with the measured ca2 concentrations in the ale gel layers of 200 700 μmol per g vss si fig a it should be noted however that following the donnan potential also cl distributed over gel layer and supernatant as a consequence not every ca2 ion inside the gel layers contributed to the crosslinking the pk a values of the carboxylate groups of mannuronic and guluronic acid were found at 3 38 and 3 65 draget et al 1994 these groups are all negatively charged at ph 7 and thus contributed to z in the ale gel layers sulfates are strong acids so negatively charged independently of ph therefore the current experiments and calculations did not identify what groups of ale were involved in crosslinking on the basis of further chemical characterisation of ale experiments in which the ph is varied can be useful for deeper insight 4 1 1 correlation between ca2 content density and strength of the ale gel layers with increasing cacl2 concentration in the supernatant the ale gel layers as prepared in this work were found denser until a plateau was reached around 8 mm ca2 fig 4 such correlation has been studied intensively for alginate gels davidovich pinhas and bianco peled 2010 and has been explained with a higher number of crosslinks with increasing ca2 concentration also for bacterial eps ca2 availability has been directly linked to denser films goode and allen 2011 körstgens et al 2001 this work shows in addition a correlation between ca2 content and density and the network strength cf section 3 2 3 the supernatant s ionic composition defined the ion concentration inside the gels given the fixed amount of charges of the ale per g vss and thus the osmotic pressure difference section 2 5 at the same time the network strength determined the maximum amount of water that could be taken up to reduce the osmotic pressure difference apparently over time this maximum amount increased associated with a slow but irreversible weakening of the network structure as shown in table 3 further discussion of the reversibility in section 4 3 the mechanisms behind this effect are probably related to the slow structural rearrangement resulting in void formation fig 6 and require further investigation 4 2 hydraulic resistance of ale gel layers a positive correlation between eps density and hydraulic resistance of biofilms has been postulated before desmond et al 2018 jafari et al 2018 also the ca2 concentration in ale films has been correlated to flux decline in membrane filtration herzberg et al 2009 this goes along with the finding that the specific cake layer resistance of the ale gel layers in this work slightly increased with supernatant cacl2 concentration fig 3 in this context it attracted attention that while the vss density reached a maximum around 110 mg cm3 the specific resistance still slightly increased e g between 8 mm cacl2 and 14 mm cacl2 fig 3 the differences in relation to the standard deviations cf si table e were so small however that no further conclusions could be drawn from these data 4 3 compressibility relaxation and ripening compressibility as observed for the ale gel layers in this work is a feature of biofilms that has been investigated for several years jafari et al 2018 and that has also been used as an indication for the viscoelastic behaviour of biofilms safari et al 2015 the relaxation of biofilms after compression has been described with the help of maxwell springs jones et al 2011 safari et al 2015 as an approximately exponential process in our experiments relaxation was expected as soon as the filtration pressure was released due to experimental restrictions the changes in the thickness of the ale gel layers in this study were only recorded from ca 3 minutes after pressure release therefore a quantitative analysis of the collected data appeared unreliable for accurate collection and analysis of relaxation data to extract characteristic viscoelastic data systems with controllable compression and instantaneous observation of the stress and strain are needed such experiments will also be of interest to distinguish between cross linked gel layers and non cross linked cake layers also the influence of different gel production procedures could be interesting in this regard interesting observations in this study were the long continuation of the swelling fig 4 and the eventual development of a fibre like ale network fig 6 fibrous structures have been observed in biofilm matrices romero et al 2010 and are usually attributed to amyloids the present study suggests that ale also forms such fibres in accordance with previous work lin et al 2018 the observation that the swelling process was only partly reversible section 3 3 indicates that a slow molecular rearrangement started with the initial formation of microscopic voids in the structure cf jafari et al 2018 right when the pressure was released because the network had started to be weakened by the voids cf table 3 section 4 1 1 neither the density nor the osmotic pressure difference of gel layers directly stored in the higher cacl2 concentration could be reached by later transferred samples fibrous structures and a decrease in density over longer time scales between 7 and 12 days were especially found in the gel layers that were prepared with and stored at the lower cacl2 concentrations 1 and 3 mm apparently fibre formation was prevented or delayed by ca2 crosslinks in the network according to desmond et al desmond et al 2018b compression caused by filtration pressure is reversible for structurally homogeneous biofilms and irreversible for films with a heterogeneous structure this work supports this finding showing that networks with voids were weaker than more homogenous networks without voids 4 4 outlook this work provides valuable insight into the interaction between ale and ca2 in the presence of k and cl as a next step the influence of ca2 content of ale gels on their mechanical properties such as modulus strength and adhesion will be investigated while a closer look on the swelling behaviour can be a start e g by observation in the filtration cell during filtration possibly also under application of different pressures determining the gels viscoelastic properties by rheological measurements will provide quantitative data this will make it possible to link the composition to mechanical properties of the gel layers and will be the subject of a forthcoming paper the system of ale and specific ions still represents a simplified model for the eps matrix of biofilms the model can be extended by adding other kinds of molecules such as peptides humic acids and edna to eventually get close to real biofilms complexity evaluating the interactions within the ale network also beyond electrostatic ones with added compounds and based on a better chemical characterisation of ale and eps can lead the path towards understanding the cohesive forces of biofilms this is an important step towards tailored cleaning strategies 5 conclusions the density and network strength of ale gel layers depend on crosslinking with a multivalent cation like ca2 ca ale gel layers produced on a membrane by dead end filtration swell after pressure release for up to 12 days this process is accompanied by a weakening of the structure and is partially irreversible one of the mechanisms behind it is a slow molecular rearrangement of ale culminating in the development of a fibrous structure the accumulation of cations including ca2 over a ca ale gel and its supernatant can be described as a result of a donnan potential induced by the fixed charges on the extracellular polymers this
