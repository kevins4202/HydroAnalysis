1175,identification and monitoring of hydro ecologically complex seasonal floodplain wetlands poses a great challenge but is essential for sustainable management of wetland and wetland resources the present paper concentrates on wetland delineation and monitoring in the atreyee river floodplain with reference to the flow regulation imposed by a dam built in 2012 we applied a water presence frequency approach to wetland delineation representing the continuum of wetland appearance based on a frequency gradient and we found that the areal extents of low moderate and high frequency water presence wetland areas are approx 607 367 and 176km2 respectively the construction of a dam on the atreyee river has curtailed the average and maximum discharge by approx 67 and 80 during monsoon time this has had the impact of reducing the wetland area from approx 1280km2 to 629km2 in the post monsoon season and shrinking the stable part of the wetland by 78 in the post dam period isolation of the

variation has also reduced from 23 70 to 9 64 in the pre monsoon period from 76 33 to 32 53 in the monsoon period and from 77 to 23 41 in the post monsoon period 3 materials and methods 3 1 data acquisition and processing for the objective of delineating the wetlands current post dam since 2012 and historical before 2012 extent a total of 23 cloud free landsat tm and oli see table 1 datasets were obtained from the us geological survey usgs for different seasons ranging from 1987 to 2016 landsat image bands 3 5 are usually used for wetland identification as these bands have the ability to discriminate land water interfaces deka et al 2011 toposheets from the survey of india soi and google earth images 2016 were to prepare the atreyee river basin map and identify the wetland visually 3 2 mapping of normalized differences water index of the various possible image base indices we selected the normalized differences water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 because it 1 maximizes the reflectance of a water body in the green band and 2 minimizes the same in the near infrared band and therefore land water discrimination is identified ndwi is calculated using eq 1 1 n d w i g r e e n b a n d n e a r i n f r a r e d b a n d g r e e n b a n d n e a r infra r e d b a n d where a water body is considered to be detected when the value is positive 0 1 based on the fact that water has the strongest absorption while vegetation has the strongest reflectivity in the near infra red ndwi has proven to work well in differentiating between water body and vegetation but it also possesses some limitations when it comes to soil and built up areas xu and guo 2014 3 3 mapping of wetland inundation frequency multi date images 1987 2016 of respective seasons were integrated separately using the water presence frequency approach wpf for representing the average state of the seasonally dynamic wetlands borro et al 2014 each generated map of inundation frequency composite map is classified into three categories low 33 moderate 33 66 and high inundation frequency 66 and their covering area calculated eq 2 is used for compositing the images 2 w p f j i 1 n i j n 100 where wpf j water presence frequency of jth pixels in a time period i j jth pixel having water in the selected ndwi images n number of images this value ranges from 0 to 100 a value near 100 indicates a high frequency water body with a greater regularity of appearance whereas a value near 0 indicates a low frequency water body with highly irregular appearance 3 4 validation of wetland inundation frequency map the kappa coefficient k with a value between 0 and 1 is a good measure frequently used for validating classified satellite imageries congalton and green 2009 monserud and leemans 1992 suggested that values lower than 0 4 represent poor or very poor agreement values from 0 4 to 0 55 represent fair agreement values from 0 55 to 0 7 represent good agreement values from 0 7 to 0 85 represent very good agreement and values higher than 0 85 represent an excellent agreement between images k is calculated following eq 3 3 k n i 1 r x i i i 1 r x i x i n 2 i 1 r x i x i where n total number of pixels r number of rows in the matrix x ii number of observations in row i and column i x i and x i are the marginal totals for row i and column i respectively in order to use this coefficient to identify wetlands of a specific category high moderate and low water presence frequency 183 and 227 reference sites from the pre and post dam phases respectively were selected on the relatively better resolution google earth images a stratified random sampling technique based on areal extent under different classes was used for distributing reference site frequency over different stability classes this was done based on the google images for the latest year of the pre dam phase 2011 and for the post dam phase 2016 moreover for the year wise justification of wetland maps the image of 2012 was considered as the basis for the post dam phase this means 227 reference sites were randomly inserted over the google earth image of 2012 mainly in the wetland area and thereafter the same sites were repetitively overlaid on the successively advancing years the percentage of reference agreement between the reference sites over the wetland part of the base year 2011 for the pre dam phase and 2016 for the post dam phase and the number of sites showing wetland in the successive years was calculated for each year for the pre dam phase the considered time span is 2004 2011 as per the availability of google earth images and for the post dam phase it is 2012 2016 apart from these seventy one sites out of the google sites were physically surveyed specifically in those areas where wetland was present before the dam but which have been transformed into other land uses at present 3 5 wetland fragmentation fragmentation refers to the notion that wetlands might be divided into parts or fragments that are separated from each other while still clearly belong to the same system huising 2002 for interpreting the landscape structure of pre and post dam periods we used the fragstat software package to calculate different fragmentation indices such as number of patch np patch density pd largest patch index lpi landscape shape index lsi landscape division index ldi aggregation index ai and normalized landscape shape index nlsi the fragstat software supports separte spatial pattern analysis for categorical maps such as different types of land use land cover definitions of the selected matrices used in this work are presented in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 seasonal inventory of wetland in pre and post discharge regulation periods permanent and seasonal wetland areas in pre and post dam periods calculated using the wpf approach are presented in fig 3a and b in the pre dam period perennial and seasonal wetlands covered 94 5 and 1204 77km2 respectively whereas in the post dam period these areas were reduced to 74 01km2 and 567 7km2 respectively we therefore found that the perennial and semi perennial wetland areas declined by 21 68 and 47 12 following the dam s construction we also considered whether the seasonality effect has been enhanced in the post dam period and found that there was no significant difference in the seasonal pattern of rainfall and temperature in the post dam period but a large part of the shallow and erratic wetlands physically vulnerable in terms of their existence have been reclaimed after construction of the dam in most cases the semi perennial wetlands have been converted into non wetlands and perennial wetlands into either semi perennial wetlands or non wetlands 4 2 season wise trends in wetland area in pre and post dam phases table 3 presents the general trends in the seasonal wetlands area from 1987 to 2016 indicating pre and post dam phases no definite trend is evident in the pre monsoon season of the pre dam phase as indicated by the very poor coefficient of determination r 2 0 098 but the same is enhanced in the post dam period as indicated by the stronger coefficient r 2 0 82 fig 4 a and b consecutively presents the year specific seasonal wetland area in the pre and post dam phases the average area in both phases was also calculated and is presented in the figures the average wetland area of the pre monsoon period decreased from 176 12km2 to 101 42km2 between the pre and post dam phases fig 4a on the other hand no significant change in wetland area was detected in the post monsoon season of the pre dam phase r 2 0 087 but after dam construction the wetlands area decreased by almost 50 from 1287 35km2 to 639 13km2 and the rate of wetland change accelerated r 2 0 8 fig 4b these findings further indicate that construction of the dam has significantly hastened the rate of wetland loss instability in the fluctuation of wetland area both during pre and post monsoon seasons has declined table 3 it is very usual that the reduction of water availability and the regulated channel state have reduced the high level fluctuation of wetland area graf 2006 pal 2016b in post dam conditions as the water supply to the wetland is very scanty there is very little chance of high level fluctuation of wetland area fig 5a and b presents the total water presence area for the pre monsoon season in pre and post dam states whereas fig 6a and b depicts the same for the post monsoon season water presence frequency wpf maps for the pre monsoon period show that the wetland area has declined from 93 05km2 to 76km2 between pre and post dam periods fig 5a and b on the other hand the total water presence area in the post monsoon season has declined from 1280 4 to 628 87km2 fig 6a and b in pre monsoon season of the pre dam phase the low moderate and high frequency water presence wetland categories cover 57 59 26 33 and 9 13km2 respectively while in the post dam phase these areas have declined to 54 2 19 75 and 2 05km2 in the respective frequency zones an almost identical pattern of wetland change is also seen in post monsoon conditions table 4 low moderate and high frequency wetland area decreased by 48 41 52 97 and 54 96 respectively in post dam circumstances figs 2 and 4 show that the volume of discharge is positively related to the extension of wetland area in the post monsoon period average discharge was high 171 67m3 in the pre dam state and in response the average wetland area was also high 1287 35km2 in the post dam state both discharge 56 82m3 and wetland area 639 13km2 declined this trend is also uniform in other seasons 4 3 validation of wetland maps the degree of agreement found between reference sites and identified wetland sites in the considered years is excellent for all the wpf categories table 5 this suggests that the wetland maps prepared based on the wpf approach are valid and provide a high degree of confidence table 6 shows that the degree of agreement is 100 in the base year and declines over progressive years this should not be taken to mean that the wetland maps of those years are incorrect however as the reference sites are inserted with respect to the base year of the respective phase and considered the same for progressive years such a situation is triggered by growing wetland loss if the reference sites were altered in every year the degree of agreement would be more satisfactory however this was done on purpose so as to focus on the trend of wetland loss the physical survey indicated that out of a total of 71 sites 63 sites have been transformed into agricultural land 7 into mango orchards and 1 converted to fallow land 4 4 character of wetlands transformation fig 7 depicts the intra class wetland transformation between pre and post dam phases for the two seasons table 7 presents the proportion of area under transformation from one inundation frequency class to another and the proportion of area kept as is the estimations indicate that in the pre monsoon season about 7 85km2 15 08 of total wetland area remains unchanged 20 19km2 of wetland area is lost and 23 27km2 of area is transformed the transformation trend is from high to medium to low inundation frequency classes on the other hand during the post monsoon season 1 43km2 76 18km2 and 81 97km2 of area remained unchanged in low moderate and high inundation frequency categories respectively relatively low lying positions acore part of the wetland wetland at the very proximate areas of the main river and wetlands with active tie channel s are partially out of the transformation trend but these are not out of danger either as transformation is rapidly intruding toward the core part of the wetland too therefore if such a water regulation condition continues these unaffected areas will also come under transformation in the near future about 92 72km2 of wetlands with low inundation frequency have been lost a rate that is significantly higher than the loss of wetland from other categories the less inundated fringing wetlands are exposed to direct human intervention 4 5 indices of wetland landscape in pre and post dam periods to assess the changes in the wetland landscape after the construction of the dam fig 8 a b and 9 a b present some indices of fragmentation such as the patch edge perforated and small core and large core indices for the pre and post dam phases in different seasons smaller size wetland patches and patch density have increased the numbers of large core 202 34ha and medium core 101 72 202 34ha wetlands have declined and low core wetland patches have noticeably increased wetland edge demarcation is quite difficult in the pre monsoon season table 8 because beyond the limit of water presence an extended outskirt area with high soil moisture and tall grasses is found also carried imprints of wetland the mean contiguity value total core area aggregation index etc were all found to have significantly attenuated in the post dam period statistics generated from figs 8a b and 9a b and table 8 support the above claims 5 discussion overall our study found significant reductions in wetland area and greater wetland fragmentation after a dam was built on the atreyee river in 2012 as compared to the preceding decades phenomena which are certainly not without impact on the local environment fauna and inhabitants of the area to better understand these findings in context we should first trace back the longer term history of the transformation of the wetlands in question before 1787 the major flow of what is today the teesta river passed through the atreyee atrai river excessive rains in 1787 abruptly brought down a vast inundation of sand and choked the atrai channel and major neo tectonic activities in the eighteenth century then shifted the teesta river toward a southeasterly direction debnath 2007 such historical incidents stopped the water supply to the atreyee atrai from the ice fed teesta system das and pal 2017 at present the atreyee river carries only rainwater so this means that a certain historical lineage exists in terms of dwindling spilling frequency and flow magnitude for inundating wetlands the ongoing wetland loss in the post dam period as evidenced by our results can be explained by highlighting the change in seasonal flow character flood frequency and magnitude of the rivers concerned in the post dam period as we have noted above the average monsoon discharge volume in the atreyee river has become attenuated by up to 66 86 flood frequency above the danger level is reduced by 100 peak discharge in the monsoon period is lowered by 72 21 in consequence of these alterations the spilling over of the river and its maximum limits of lateral extension have been squeezed significantly in the pre dam phase 30 of years registered water levels above the extreme danger level and 40 of years recorded water levels above danger level in the modified post dam hydrological paradigm by contrast the riverine flood plain wetlands have largely become modified for example due to the scarce supply of water from the river a large part of the wetland receives water from only rainfall and water in such cases concentrates only in the deeper part of the wetland depression the remainder of the wetland remains dry except for a few days of torrential rains so the relatively elevated fringe of the wetland either remains saturated in parts of the year or keeps dry as a result of this a greater part of the wetland has been converted into a low frequency water presence area the same situation becomes graver during non monsoon seasons when the dam diverts water for irrigation large numbers of government enterprises and privately owned river water lifting projects are running all along the river in the indian parts alone from samjia to chak bhatshal there are 55 large river lift irrigation rli projects however such reduction of the wetland area has constrained the wetland habitat and attenuating flood incidents have severely hampered the flood plain wetland habitat the erection of embankments across flood routes also prevents water from spilling into the floodplain pal 2015 astride the atreyee river a more than 16km long embankment has been constructed only in the indian part and this embankment has artificially increased the height of the flood spilling mark by 2 3m gradual anthropogenic capturing of the tie channels which are used to connect the wetland and the river no longer exist therefore the wetland does not receive water from the river except during the spilling period when one tie channel has not carried water for a few consecutive years people start capturing the course mainly for agriculture similar findings are reported by pal and akoma 2009 pal 2015 for the hijole wetland and the surrounding wetlands of the murshidabad district of india very fast rate groundwater level lowering in the flood plain region due to strong harvesting of ground water from underground aquifer delinks the vertical connectivity of the surface and subsurface water we found that about 325 02km2 of high and moderate water presence frequency wetland area in the atreyee river floodplain has converted to the low frequency wetland with a shallower depth and irregular water presence these areas are also entirely or partially exposed to the atmosphere during pre monsoon time this condition encourages peasants to intrude into these parts of the wetlands for cultivation causing further squeezing of wetland area growing perforation and fragmentation the emergence of a few patches of agricultural land within integrated wetland areas brings fragmentation increasing the number of patches and patch density similarly the construction of roads and built up land not only reduce the wetland area but also fragments the continuity of the wetland mondal and pal 2017 fragmentation brings further vulnerability as smaller size wetlands are known to be more vulnerable than larger ones tockner et al 2010 and linear shaped wetlands are more vulnerable than the same sized circular or nearly circular wetlands all these are strongly responsible for seasonal water scarcity narrowing hydro duration curtailing nutrient supply in the wetland habitats tockner et al 2010 and fragmentation of wetland integrity mondal and pal 2017 disrupting the life cycle of the habitat and lowering productivity of the ecosystems richter et al 2003 moreover all these hydro ecological alterations bring the danger of hardship to the basin dwellers who are dependent directly or indirectly on the river and riparian wetland for their lives and livelihood 6 conclusion the present study attempted to delineate and monitor the hydro ecologically dynamic seasonal floodplain wetlands of the atreyee river basin using a landsat satellite image based water presence frequency approach by so doing we aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for wetland inventorying and as such we recommend it for future studies of wetland delineation we also reported evidence on how flow modification through the dam has contributed to wetland loss wetland conversion and fragmentation our results show that in the post dam period the wetland area has been reduced by 20 during the pre monsoon season and by 50 during the post monsoon season mainly triggered by the reduction of flow availability in the atreyee river in its downstream segment at present the wetland area in this basin during the post monsoon season is 628 87km2 out of which 13 94 is relatively stable and 55 07 is susceptible to wetland loss fragmentation matrices calculated for the wetland landscape exhibit that fragmentation continues at a very fast rate due to the invasion of agricultural land the perforation of roads built up areas etc in consequence of this large core wetlands have converted into medium or low core wetlands the numbers of wetland patches have increased and the emerging fragmented linear shape has increased the feasibility of wetland vulnerability all these are usually caused by the loss of ecological connectivity among the fragmented patches the reduction of the wetland area and the ongoing fragmentation has squeezed the valuable habitat for rare and endangered species and may be causing declining species diversity discharge regulation as in the case examined here in has emerged as one of the major reasons behind wetland transformation and loss in india and indeed all over the world this study has contributed to our understanding of discharge regulation on wetlands and the methods used to study that impact we conclude that strategic efforts to evaluate and sustain eco flow the minimum flow required for sustaining the ecosystem are essential for ecological sustainability for instance much efforts for the ganga river are being made by the central pollution control board indian ministry of environment and forests other regional rivers should also be undertaken in the same way and strictly monitored conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to

a r i n f r a r e d b a n d g r e e n b a n d n e a r infra r e d b a n d where a water body is considered to be detected when the value is positive 0 1 based on the fact that water has the strongest absorption while vegetation has the strongest reflectivity in the near infra red ndwi has proven to work well in differentiating between water body and vegetation but it also possesses some limitations when it comes to soil and built up areas xu and guo 2014 3 3 mapping of wetland inundation frequency multi date images 1987 2016 of respective seasons were integrated separately using the water presence frequency approach wpf for representing the average state of the seasonally dynamic wetlands borro et al 2014 each generated map of inundation frequency composite map is classified into three categories low 33 moderate 33 66 and high inundation frequency 66 and their covering area calculated eq 2 is used for compositing the images 2 w p f j i 1 n i j n 100 where wpf j water presence frequency of jth pixels in a time period i j jth pixel having water in the selected ndwi images n number of images this value ranges from 0 to 100 a value near 100 indicates a high frequency water body with a greater regularity of appearance whereas a value near 0 indicates a low frequency water body with highly irregular appearance 3 4 validation of wetland inundation frequency map the kappa coefficient k with a value between 0 and 1 is a good measure frequently used for validating classified satellite imageries congalton and green 2009 monserud and leemans 1992 suggested that values lower than 0 4 represent poor or very poor agreement values from 0 4 to 0 55 represent fair agreement values from 0 55 to 0 7 represent good agreement values from 0 7 to 0 85 represent very good agreement and values higher than 0 85 represent an excellent agreement between images k is calculated following eq 3 3 k n i 1 r x i i i 1 r x i x i n 2 i 1 r x i x i where n total number of pixels r number of rows in the matrix x ii number of observations in row i and column i x i and x i are the marginal totals for row i and column i respectively in order to use this coefficient to identify wetlands of a specific category high moderate and low water presence frequency 183 and 227 reference sites from the pre and post dam phases respectively were selected on the relatively better resolution google earth images a stratified random sampling technique based on areal extent under different classes was used for distributing reference site frequency over different stability classes this was done based on the google images for the latest year of the pre dam phase 2011 and for the post dam phase 2016 moreover for the year wise justification of wetland maps the image of 2012 was considered as the basis for the post dam phase this means 227 reference sites were randomly inserted over the google earth image of 2012 mainly in the wetland area and thereafter the same sites were repetitively overlaid on the successively advancing years the percentage of reference agreement between the reference sites over the wetland part of the base year 2011 for the pre dam phase and 2016 for the post dam phase and the number of sites showing wetland in the successive years was calculated for each year for the pre dam phase the considered time span is 2004 2011 as per the availability of google earth images and for the post dam phase it is 2012 2016 apart from these seventy one sites out of the google sites were physically surveyed specifically in those areas where wetland was present before the dam but which have been transformed into other land uses at present 3 5 wetland fragmentation fragmentation refers to the notion that wetlands might be divided into parts or fragments that are separated from each other while still clearly belong to the same system huising 2002 for interpreting the landscape structure of pre and post dam periods we used the fragstat software package to calculate different fragmentation indices such as number of patch np patch density pd largest patch index lpi landscape shape index lsi landscape division index ldi aggregation index ai and normalized landscape shape index nlsi the fragstat software supports separte spatial pattern analysis for categorical maps such as different types of land use land cover definitions of the selected matrices used in this work are presented in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 seasonal inventory of wetland in pre and post discharge regulation periods permanent and seasonal wetland areas in pre and post dam periods calculated using the wpf approach are presented in fig 3a and b in the pre dam period perennial and seasonal wetlands covered 94 5 and 1204 77km2 respectively whereas in the post dam period these areas were reduced to 74 01km2 and 567 7km2 respectively we therefore found that the perennial and semi perennial wetland areas declined by 21 68 and 47 12 following the dam s construction we also considered whether the seasonality effect has been enhanced in the post dam period and found that there was no significant difference in the seasonal pattern of rainfall and temperature in the post dam period but a large part of the shallow and erratic wetlands physically vulnerable in terms of their existence have been reclaimed after construction of the dam in most cases the semi perennial wetlands have been converted into non wetlands and perennial wetlands into either semi perennial wetlands or non wetlands 4 2 season wise trends in wetland area in pre and post dam phases table 3 presents the general trends in the seasonal wetlands area from 1987 to 2016 indicating pre and post dam phases no definite trend is evident in the pre monsoon season of the pre dam phase as indicated by the very poor coefficient of determination r 2 0 098 but the same is enhanced in the post dam period as indicated by the stronger coefficient r 2 0 82 fig 4 a and b consecutively presents the year specific seasonal wetland area in the pre and post dam phases the average area in both phases was also calculated and is presented in the figures the average wetland area of the pre monsoon period decreased from 176 12km2 to 101 42km2 between the pre and post dam phases fig 4a on the other hand no significant change in wetland area was detected in the post monsoon season of the pre dam phase r 2 0 087 but after dam construction the wetlands area decreased by almost 50 from 1287 35km2 to 639 13km2 and the rate of wetland change accelerated r 2 0 8 fig 4b these findings further indicate that construction of the dam has significantly hastened the rate of wetland loss instability in the fluctuation of wetland area both during pre and post monsoon seasons has declined table 3 it is very usual that the reduction of water availability and the regulated channel state have reduced the high level fluctuation of wetland area graf 2006 pal 2016b in post dam conditions as the water supply to the wetland is very scanty there is very little chance of high level fluctuation of wetland area fig 5a and b presents the total water presence area for the pre monsoon season in pre and post dam states whereas fig 6a and b depicts the same for the post monsoon season water presence frequency wpf maps for the pre monsoon period show that the wetland area has declined from 93 05km2 to 76km2 between pre and post dam periods fig 5a and b on the other hand the total water presence area in the post monsoon season has declined from 1280 4 to 628 87km2 fig 6a and b in pre monsoon season of the pre dam phase the low moderate and high frequency water presence wetland categories cover 57 59 26 33 and 9 13km2 respectively while in the post dam phase these areas have declined to 54 2 19 75 and 2 05km2 in the respective frequency zones an almost identical pattern of wetland change is also seen in post monsoon conditions table 4 low moderate and high frequency wetland area decreased by 48 41 52 97 and 54 96 respectively in post dam circumstances figs 2 and 4 show that the volume of discharge is positively related to the extension of wetland area in the post monsoon period average discharge was high 171 67m3 in the pre dam state and in response the average wetland area was also high 1287 35km2 in the post dam state both discharge 56 82m3 and wetland area 639 13km2 declined this trend is also uniform in other seasons 4 3 validation of wetland maps the degree of agreement found between reference sites and identified wetland sites in the considered years is excellent for all the wpf categories table 5 this suggests that the wetland maps prepared based on the wpf approach are valid and provide a high degree of confidence table 6 shows that the degree of agreement is 100 in the base year and declines over progressive years this should not be taken to mean that the wetland maps of those years are incorrect however as the reference sites are inserted with respect to the base year of the respective phase and considered the same for progressive years such a situation is triggered by growing wetland loss if the reference sites were altered in every year the degree of agreement would be more satisfactory however this was done on purpose so as to focus on the trend of wetland loss the physical survey indicated that out of a total of 71 sites 63 sites have been transformed into agricultural land 7 into mango orchards and 1 converted to fallow land 4 4 character of wetlands transformation fig 7 depicts the intra class wetland transformation between pre and post dam phases for the two seasons table 7 presents the proportion of area under transformation from one inundation frequency class to another and the proportion of area kept as is the estimations indicate that in the pre monsoon season about 7 85km2 15 08 of total wetland area remains unchanged 20 19km2 of wetland area is lost and 23 27km2 of area is transformed the transformation trend is from high to medium to low inundation frequency classes on the other hand during the post monsoon season 1 43km2 76 18km2 and 81 97km2 of area remained unchanged in low moderate and high inundation frequency categories respectively relatively low lying positions acore part of the wetland wetland at the very proximate areas of the main river and wetlands with active tie channel s are partially out of the transformation trend but these are not out of danger either as transformation is rapidly intruding toward the core part of the wetland too therefore if such a water regulation condition continues these unaffected areas will also come under transformation in the near future about 92 72km2 of wetlands with low inundation frequency have been lost a rate that is significantly higher than the loss of wetland from other categories the less inundated fringing wetlands are exposed to direct human intervention 4 5 indices of wetland landscape in pre and post dam periods to assess the changes in the wetland landscape after the construction of the dam fig 8 a b and 9 a b present some indices of fragmentation such as the patch edge perforated and small core and large core indices for the pre and post dam phases in different seasons smaller size wetland patches and patch density have increased the numbers of large core 202 34ha and medium core 101 72 202 34ha wetlands have declined and low core wetland patches have noticeably increased wetland edge demarcation is quite difficult in the pre monsoon season table 8 because beyond the limit of water presence an extended outskirt area with high soil moisture and tall grasses is found also carried imprints of wetland the mean contiguity value total core area aggregation index etc were all found to have significantly attenuated in the post dam period statistics generated from figs 8a b and 9a b and table 8 support the above claims 5 discussion overall our study found significant reductions in wetland area and greater wetland fragmentation after a dam was built on the atreyee river in 2012 as compared to the preceding decades phenomena which are certainly not without impact on the local environment fauna and inhabitants of the area to better understand these findings in context we should first trace back the longer term history of the transformation of the wetlands in question before 1787 the major flow of what is today the teesta river passed through the atreyee atrai river excessive rains in 1787 abruptly brought down a vast inundation of sand and choked the atrai channel and major neo tectonic activities in the eighteenth century then shifted the teesta river toward a southeasterly direction debnath 2007 such historical incidents stopped the water supply to the atreyee atrai from the ice fed teesta system das and pal 2017 at present the atreyee river carries only rainwater so this means that a certain historical lineage exists in terms of dwindling spilling frequency and flow magnitude for inundating wetlands the ongoing wetland loss in the post dam period as evidenced by our results can be explained by highlighting the change in seasonal flow character flood frequency and magnitude of the rivers concerned in the post dam period as we have noted above the average monsoon discharge volume in the atreyee river has become attenuated by up to 66 86 flood frequency above the danger level is reduced by 100 peak discharge in the monsoon period is lowered by 72 21 in consequence of these alterations the spilling over of the river and its maximum limits of lateral extension have been squeezed significantly in the pre dam phase 30 of years registered water levels above the extreme danger level and 40 of years recorded water levels above danger level in the modified post dam hydrological paradigm by contrast the riverine flood plain wetlands have largely become modified for example due to the scarce supply of water from the river a large part of the wetland receives water from only rainfall and water in such cases concentrates only in the deeper part of the wetland depression the remainder of the wetland remains dry except for a few days of torrential rains so the relatively elevated fringe of the wetland either remains saturated in parts of the year or keeps dry as a result of this a greater part of the wetland has been converted into a low frequency water presence area the same situation becomes graver during non monsoon seasons when the dam diverts water for irrigation large numbers of government enterprises and privately owned river water lifting projects are running all along the river in the indian parts alone from samjia to chak bhatshal there are 55 large river lift irrigation rli projects however such reduction of the wetland area has constrained the wetland habitat and attenuating flood incidents have severely hampered the flood plain wetland habitat the erection of embankments across flood routes also prevents water from spilling into the floodplain pal 2015 astride the atreyee river a more than 16km long embankment has been constructed only in the indian part and this embankment has artificially increased the height of the flood spilling mark by 2 3m gradual anthropogenic capturing of the tie channels which are used to connect the wetland and the river no longer exist therefore the wetland does not receive water from the river except during the spilling period when one tie channel has not carried water for a few consecutive years people start capturing the course mainly for agriculture similar findings are reported by pal and akoma 2009 pal 2015 for the hijole wetland and the surrounding wetlands of the murshidabad district of india very fast rate groundwater level lowering in the flood plain region due to strong harvesting of ground water from underground aquifer delinks the vertical connectivity of the surface and subsurface water we found that about 325 02km2 of high and moderate water presence frequency wetland area in the atreyee river floodplain has converted to the low frequency wetland with a shallower depth and irregular water presence these areas are also entirely or partially exposed to the atmosphere during pre monsoon time this condition encourages peasants to intrude into these parts of the wetlands for cultivation causing further squeezing of wetland area growing perforation and fragmentation the emergence of a few patches of agricultural land within integrated wetland areas brings fragmentation increasing the number of patches and patch density similarly the construction of roads and built up land not only reduce the wetland area but also fragments the continuity of the wetland mondal and pal 2017 fragmentation brings further vulnerability as smaller size wetlands are known to be more vulnerable than larger ones tockner et al 2010 and linear shaped wetlands are more vulnerable than the same sized circular or nearly circular wetlands all these are strongly responsible for seasonal water scarcity narrowing hydro duration curtailing nutrient supply in the wetland habitats tockner et al 2010 and fragmentation of wetland integrity mondal and pal 2017 disrupting the life cycle of the habitat and lowering productivity of the ecosystems richter et al 2003 moreover all these hydro ecological alterations bring the danger of hardship to the basin dwellers who are dependent directly or indirectly on the river and riparian wetland for their lives and livelihood 6 conclusion the present study attempted to delineate and monitor the hydro ecologically dynamic seasonal floodplain wetlands of the atreyee river basin using a landsat satellite image based water presence frequency approach by so doing we aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for wetland inventorying and as such we recommend it for future studies of wetland delineation we also reported evidence on how flow modification through the dam has contributed to wetland loss wetland conversion and fragmentation our results show that in the post dam period the wetland area has been reduced by 20 during the pre monsoon season and by 50 during the post monsoon season mainly triggered by the reduction of flow availability in the atreyee river in its downstream segment at present the wetland area in this basin during the post monsoon season is 628 87km2 out of which 13 94 is relatively stable and 55 07 is susceptible to wetland loss fragmentation matrices calculated for the wetland landscape exhibit that fragmentation continues at a very fast rate due to the invasion of agricultural land the perforation of roads built up areas etc in consequence of this large core wetlands have converted into medium or low core wetlands the numbers of wetland patches have increased and the emerging fragmented linear shape has increased the feasibility of wetland vulnerability all these are usually caused by the loss of ecological connectivity among the fragmented patches the reduction of the wetland area and the ongoing fragmentation has squeezed the valuable habitat for rare and endangered species and may be causing declining species diversity discharge regulation as in the case examined here in has emerged as one of the major reasons behind wetland transformation and loss in india and indeed all over the world this study has contributed to our understanding of discharge regulation on wetlands and the methods used to study that impact we conclude that strategic efforts to evaluate and sustain eco flow the minimum flow required for sustaining the ecosystem are essential for ecological sustainability for instance much efforts for the ganga river are being made by the central pollution control board indian ministry of environment and forests other regional rivers should also be undertaken in the same way and strictly monitored conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to

1176,the objective of this study was to seek better insight into the natural factors that may contribute to hydrogeological drought in shallow hydrogeological ecosystems that exhibit significant seasonal and multiannual groundwater level dynamics with this aim we monitored groundwater levels in two groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes situated close together in the central part of the vistula valley regularly at 14 day intervals over a long term period 1999 2013 using a monitoring network of 17 piezometers of the monitoring network recording about 6600 observations overall the piezometers were situated such that they were not under the direct influence of anthropopressure thus allowing the results to be interpreted as the influence of natural factors on the quantitative state of gdes we found that the groundwater level changes over the study period can be classified as exhibiting hydroperiods of the periodic type with a typical seasonal level fluctuation pattern without any distinct long term trend statistical analysis showed that hydrogeological droughts characteristic of the summer months occur only during years when the lowest groundwater levels were observed shallow hydrogeological droughts occur periodically from summer to spring and the average duration of shallow droughts was 8 weeks overall this study illustrates how analysis of groundwater level fluctuations in gdes on multiannual and seasonal scales determining the fluctuation trends and the values of critical levels provides better understanding of the risk of groundwater drought hazard and occurrence assessment of the natural range of groundwater level fluctuations can then assist in effecting better local water resource management and may aid agricultural organizations and

study was carried out in the central part of the vistula valley a large river of the north european plain the examined section of the vistula valley is mostly located in the kampinos national park knp which spreads over an area of 385km2 northwest of the city of warsaw the gdes investigated the northern and southern marsh zones of the park cover 176 9km2 fig 1 the hydrogeological conditions of the knp area have been summarized in several previous publications e g krogulec 2003a b 2004 krogulec et al 2016 quaternary sediments here constitute a collector of groundwater there is a clear dichotomy of this unconfined aquifer of a total thickness of up to 50m in connection with its lithological shape the top part of the aquifer has a sandy and sandy gravel character whereas the bottom is formed by sandy silt sediments changing to sandy clay clay and till in places the surface of the aquitard formed by glacial tills and more often pliocene loams constituting the floor of the quaternary aquifer occurs in the region of knp at elevations ranging from 2 to 54m above mean sea level amsl baraniecka and konecka betley 1987 sarnacka 1992 krogulec 2004 the quaternary deposits are underlain by weakly permeable deposits occurring at the base of the alluvia variable geomorphological conditions occur in the vistula valley which is approx 50km broad including belts of dunes and marsh zones which comprise gdes along smaller water courses parallel to the vistula river channel in the marsh zones of the knp the lithology of surficial sediments is similar in the northern marsh zone studied fine sands are overlain by a thin layer of mud whereas in the southern marsh zone this occurs only locally a delimitation of the main groundwater circulation systems in the quaternary aquifer was proposed by krogulec 2004 based in a hydrodynamic model although the general flow directions in the aquifer are northward and westward to the main discharge base which is the vistula and bzura rivers intermediate system the groundwater circulation in gde areas should be considered a local system fig 1 a detailed description of this model based research has been presented in several publications krogulec 2004 2016 krogulec and zabłocki 2015 krogulec et al 2016 2 2 sampling and data analysis the gdes studied are located within a hydrogeological segment of the valley characterized by similar environmental and precipitation conditions the factor affecting the dynamics in shallow groundwater is the change in water quantity in the aquifer which in turn is influenced by such aspects as precipitation evaporation artificial discharge river infiltration and irrigation infiltration on a macrodynamic scale wang et al 2009 therefore groundwater level fluctuations may be treated as the resultant of multiple factors as a result in this study the water levels were not analysed as the effect of climate and environmental factors but were studied by means of the following fig 2

levels determination of hydroperiodical groundwater level changes assessment of the risk of hydrogeological drought in conditions of shallow groundwater level and significant dynamics of groundwater level changes indication of periods of hydrogeological drought in relation to seasonal and multiannual dynamics of groundwater level changes the analysis focused on observation sites located outside the significant influence of anthropogenic factors including shallow aquifers recharged by infiltration of precipitation through the aeration zone composed of permeable sediments located at a variable distance from 0 2 to 1 8km from small water courses near various ecosystems the area of the investigated gdes can be considered as lying outside the direct influence of anthropopressure observations of groundwater levels were conducted in the period 1999 2013 using a network of 17 piezometers with a 14 day interval between each observation 390 observations at each point located in northern and southern zones due to the length of the observation period the reliability of the obtained data is relatively high kazimierski et al 2009 there are almost no regional monitoring networks of groundwater monitoring conducting such long term observations with the exception of single observation sites 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of in groundwater level in 1999 2013 the groundwater levels in the marsh zones were found to be characterized by dynamic fluctuation fig 3 in the northern marsh zone the average annual groundwater depth over the entire study period of 1999 2013 was at the level of 1mbgs below ground surface whereas the average annual levels for each individual year in this period varied from 0 47mbgs in 2011 to 1 14mbgs in 2003 the maximal and minimal groundwater levels recorded at any point in time in the northern zone were 0 40mbgs above ground surface 2011 and 2 16mbgs 2003 respectively given the length of the observation period it can be assumed that this range roughly indicates the maximal and minimal groundwater levels in this environment fig 3 table 1 in the southern marsh zone the average groundwater depth for the entire study period 1999 2013 was around 1 1mbgs just slightly exceeding the average value from piezometers in the northern marsh zone the average annual levels in the southern zone ranged between 0 77mbgs in 2011 and 1 52mbgs in 2003 the minimal and maximal individual measurements observed during the study period in the southern zone were 0 83mbgs 2011 and 3 17mbgs 2006 showing a wider absolute range than for the northern zone fig 3 table 1 in all localities the groundwater levels varied over the period 1999 2013 without any distinct trend while exhibiting a typical seasonal level fluctuation pattern fig 3 estimated trend lines for all localities were calculated using linear logarithmic and polynomial types of equations the coefficients of determination r 2 obtained for the various analyses ranged from 0 10 to 0 51 for each piezometer indicating a low degree of fitting with the estimated model based on the analysis of groundwater level fluctuations the observation sites can be classified into groups depending on the recorded average depth of the groundwater level for a large majority of the observation points 14 sites the average annual groundwater levels fall between 0 5 to 1 5mbgs although a smaller or larger average depth of the groundwater level was observed for a few localities tables 1 and 2 overall the groundwater level changes can be classified as exhibiting hydroperiods of the periodic type the average value of the annual amplitude of groundwater levels observed using the piezometers varies within the range 0 55 0 88m the average depth of groundwater level and the amplitude of changes do not depend on the distance from the water sources or the neighbouring plant ecosystems this finding confirms the influence of many overlapping factors on the dynamics of groundwater level changes in shallow hydrogeological systems 3 2 seasonal fluctuations of groundwater level separate analyses were conducted for fluctuations in groundwater level in the summer may october and winter november april periods particular attention was paid to assessing groundwater level fluctuations in the summers when groundwater level changes are variable in particular years in the summer significant levels of fluctuations were characteristic for many years therefore a wide range of fluctuations in the summer can be considered to occur due to variable recharge and evapotranspiration figs 3 and 4 the lowest levels were found to occur at the transition from summer into fall between september and october ranging on average from 1 to 1 7mbgs for particular piezometers the annual high levels in spring were in the range of 0 05 0 20mbgs and the lowest being about 2mbgs table 3 the lowest levels occurred earlier in the southern marsh zone than that in the northern marsh zone between august and september reaching on average about 1 5mbgs and coming prior to the spring maximal levels which is typical of shallow aquifer systems chełmicki 1986 1989 konoplancew and siemionow 1979 analysis of the obtained data indicates a phenomenon of post seasonal persistance of both low and high groundwater levels at most observation sites these periods should be treated as short term within the observation period as a whole because they do not give rise to trend changes the highest and lowest groundwater levels observed during the whole study period of 1999 2013 were for seasonal changes in the years 2011 a normal year and 2003 a dry year respectively the course of seasonal depth changes in 2004 a year classified as normal with regard to rainfall is closest to the course of average seasonal changes in the period 1999 2013 median 3 3 groundwater drought the term groundwater or hydrogeological drought typically refers to a period of decreased groundwater levels that result in water related problems the amount of groundwater decline that would be considered a drought varies regionally and locally due to differences in groundwater conditions and groundwater needs for humans and the environment analysis of hydrogeological drought on a regional scale should be performed in relation to an area with similarly defined hydrogeological conditions in which the influence of meteorological and climatic factors can be considered similar for the entire study area various problems remain unresolved in terms of the definition identification and prediction of drought bonacci 1993 peters et al 2003 machlica et al 2010 groundwater drought processes and estimation methods were analysed by tallaksen and van lanen 2004 fleig et al 2010 intercompared circulation patterns and drought occurrence groundwater drought can be identified using three variables recharge groundwater levels and discharge from groundwater to the surface water system tate and gustard 2000 van lanen and peters 2000 of these three recharge and groundwater discharge cannot be measured directly the spatial and temporal aspects of groundwater levels provide indirect knowledge about groundwater recharge and discharge therefore in most cases groundwater levels are monitored to detect groundwater droughts tallaksen and van lanen 2004 for instance groundwater drought occurrence has been so studied in slovakia by fendeková and ženišová 2010 machlica and stojkovova 2008 machlica et al 2010 fendekova and fendek 2012 accordingly the time period for the analysis of a groundwater drought should necessarily be large usually more than a week or a month the long term average value of the base flow has been used as a comparative value during the process of base flow drought extremity assessment stahl 2001 tallaksen and van lanen 2004 fendekova and fendek 2012 gurwin 2014 long term average values of groundwater levels have been used at a regional scale to assess the hazard and occurrence of hydrogeological drought in gdes long term direct observations of groundwater levels using a groundwater monitoring network may be used as the base for statistical analysis of characteristic levels annual average and low levels used to indicate periods years or trends in hydrogeological drought occurrence in the present study precipitation conditions for particular years were classified after kaczorowska 1962 table 4 employing one of the most commonly used classifications applied in poland in meteorological and agrometeorological analyses and for water melioration issues to assess excess or deficiency of rainfall łabędzki 2004 kirschenstein and baranowski 2008 gąsiorek and musiał 2011 krogulec and zabłocki 2015 the lowest groundwater levels were observed in

1176,the objective of this study was to seek better insight into the natural factors that may contribute to hydrogeological drought in shallow hydrogeological ecosystems that exhibit significant seasonal and multiannual groundwater level dynamics with this aim we monitored groundwater levels in two groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes situated close together in the central part of the vistula valley regularly at 14 day intervals over a long term period 1999 2013 using a monitoring network of 17 piezometers of the monitoring network recording about 6600 observations overall the piezometers were situated such that they were not under the direct influence of anthropopressure thus allowing the results to be interpreted as the influence of natural factors on the quantitative state of gdes we found that the groundwater level changes over the study period can be classified as exhibiting hydroperiods of the periodic type with a typical seasonal level fluctuation pattern without any distinct long term trend statistical analysis showed that hydrogeological droughts characteristic of the summer months occur only during years when the lowest groundwater levels were observed shallow hydrogeological droughts occur periodically from summer to spring and the average duration of shallow droughts was 8 weeks overall this study illustrates how analysis of groundwater level fluctuations in gdes on multiannual and seasonal scales determining the fluctuation trends and the values of critical levels provides better understanding of the risk of groundwater drought hazard and occurrence assessment of the natural range of groundwater level fluctuations can then assist in effecting better local water resource management and may aid agricultural organizations and

scales varying from individual dependent surface water bodies or terrestrial ecosystems to aquifer scale for each objective the risks of not meeting that objective should be assessed the results of such analysis particularly the indication of fluctuation trends and values of hydrogeological drought may be applied in sustainable use and ecosystem services it should be emphasized that groundwater level changes may be caused by natural factors by anthropopressure but also by recent large scale projects involving the restoration and rehabilitation of damaged gdes considered to be among the most

episodic with completely irregular flow occurring only when water levels in the aquifer are very high and perennial having a continuous source year round 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out in the central part of the vistula valley a large river of the north european plain the examined section of the vistula valley is mostly located in the kampinos national park knp which spreads over an area of 385km2 northwest of the city of warsaw the gdes investigated the northern and southern marsh zones of the park cover 176 9km2 fig 1 the hydrogeological conditions of the knp area have been summarized in several previous publications e g krogulec 2003a b 2004 krogulec et al 2016 quaternary sediments here constitute a collector of groundwater there is a clear dichotomy of this unconfined aquifer of a total thickness of up to 50m in connection with its lithological shape the top part of the aquifer has a sandy and sandy gravel character whereas the bottom is formed by sandy silt sediments changing to sandy clay clay and till in places the surface of the aquitard formed by glacial tills and more often pliocene loams constituting the floor of the quaternary aquifer occurs in the region of knp at elevations ranging from 2 to 54m above mean sea level amsl baraniecka and konecka betley 1987 sarnacka 1992 krogulec 2004 the quaternary deposits are underlain by weakly permeable deposits occurring at the base of the alluvia variable geomorphological conditions occur in the vistula valley which is approx 50km broad including belts of dunes and marsh zones which comprise gdes along smaller water courses parallel to the vistula river channel in the marsh zones of the knp the lithology of surficial sediments is similar in the northern marsh zone studied fine sands are overlain by a thin layer of mud whereas in the southern marsh zone this occurs only locally a delimitation of the main groundwater circulation systems in the quaternary aquifer was proposed by krogulec 2004 based in a hydrodynamic model although the general flow directions in the aquifer are northward and westward to the main discharge base which is the vistula and bzura rivers intermediate system the groundwater circulation in gde areas should be considered a local system fig 1 a detailed description of this model based research has been presented in several publications krogulec 2004 2016 krogulec and zabłocki 2015 krogulec et al 2016 2 2 sampling and data analysis the gdes studied are located within a hydrogeological segment of the valley characterized by similar environmental and precipitation conditions the factor affecting the dynamics in shallow groundwater is the change in water quantity in the aquifer which in turn is influenced by such aspects as precipitation evaporation artificial discharge river infiltration and irrigation infiltration on a macrodynamic scale wang et al 2009 therefore groundwater level fluctuations may be treated as the resultant of multiple factors as a result in this study the water levels were not analysed as the effect of climate and environmental factors but were studied by means of the following fig 2 comparison of groundwater level fluctuations in two wetland areas the northern and southern marsh zones located within a river valley segment statistical analysis of monitoring data of groundwater levels determination of hydroperiodical groundwater level changes assessment of the risk of hydrogeological drought in conditions of shallow groundwater level and significant dynamics of groundwater level changes indication of periods of hydrogeological drought in relation to seasonal and multiannual dynamics of groundwater level changes the analysis focused on observation sites located outside the significant influence of anthropogenic factors including shallow aquifers recharged by infiltration of precipitation through the aeration zone composed of permeable sediments located at a variable distance from 0 2 to 1 8km from small water courses near various ecosystems the area of the investigated gdes can be considered as lying outside the direct influence of anthropopressure observations of groundwater levels were conducted in the period 1999 2013 using a network of 17 piezometers with a 14 day interval between each observation 390 observations at each point located in northern and southern zones due to the length of the observation period the reliability of the obtained data is relatively high kazimierski et al 2009 there are almost no regional monitoring networks of groundwater monitoring conducting such long term observations with the exception of single observation sites 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes of in groundwater level in 1999 2013 the groundwater levels in the marsh zones were found to be characterized by dynamic fluctuation fig 3 in the northern marsh zone the average annual groundwater depth over the entire study period of 1999 2013 was at the level of 1mbgs below ground surface whereas the average annual levels for each individual year in this period varied from 0 47mbgs in 2011 to 1 14mbgs in 2003 the maximal and minimal groundwater levels recorded at any point in time in the northern zone were 0 40mbgs above ground surface 2011 and 2 16mbgs 2003 respectively given the length of the observation period it can be assumed that this range roughly indicates the maximal and minimal groundwater levels in this environment fig 3 table 1 in the southern marsh zone the average groundwater depth for the entire study period 1999 2013 was around 1 1mbgs just slightly exceeding the average value from piezometers in the northern marsh zone the average annual levels in the southern zone ranged between 0 77mbgs in 2011 and 1 52mbgs in 2003 the minimal and maximal individual measurements observed during the study period in the southern zone were 0 83mbgs 2011 and 3 17mbgs 2006 showing a wider absolute range than for the northern zone fig 3 table 1 in all localities the groundwater levels varied over the period 1999 2013 without any distinct trend while exhibiting a typical seasonal level fluctuation pattern fig 3 estimated trend lines for all localities were calculated using linear logarithmic and polynomial types of equations the coefficients of determination r 2 obtained for the various analyses ranged from 0 10 to 0 51 for each piezometer indicating a low degree of fitting with the estimated model based on the analysis of groundwater level fluctuations the observation sites can be classified into groups depending on the recorded average depth of the groundwater level for a large majority of the observation points 14 sites the average annual groundwater levels fall between 0 5 to 1 5mbgs although a smaller or larger average depth of the groundwater level was observed for a few localities tables 1 and 2 overall the groundwater level changes can be classified as exhibiting hydroperiods of the periodic type the average value of the annual amplitude of groundwater levels observed using the piezometers varies within the range 0 55 0 88m the average depth of groundwater level and the amplitude of changes do not depend on the distance from the water sources or the neighbouring plant ecosystems this finding confirms the influence of many overlapping factors on the dynamics of groundwater level changes in shallow hydrogeological systems 3 2 seasonal fluctuations of groundwater level separate analyses were conducted for fluctuations in groundwater level in the summer may october and winter november april periods particular attention was paid to assessing groundwater level fluctuations in the summers when groundwater level changes are variable in particular years in the summer significant levels of fluctuations were characteristic for many years therefore a wide range of fluctuations in the summer can be considered to occur due to variable recharge and evapotranspiration figs 3 and 4 the lowest levels were found to occur at the transition from summer into fall between september and october ranging on average from 1 to 1 7mbgs for particular piezometers the annual high levels in spring were in the range of 0 05 0 20mbgs and the lowest being about 2mbgs table 3 the lowest levels occurred earlier in the southern marsh zone than that in the northern marsh zone between august and september reaching on average about 1 5mbgs and coming prior to the spring maximal levels which is typical of shallow aquifer systems chełmicki 1986 1989 konoplancew and siemionow 1979 analysis of the obtained data indicates a phenomenon of post seasonal persistance of both low and high groundwater levels at most observation sites these periods should be treated as short term within the observation period as a whole because they do not give rise to trend changes the highest and lowest groundwater levels observed during the whole study period of 1999 2013 were for seasonal changes in the years 2011 a normal year and 2003 a dry year respectively the course of seasonal depth changes in 2004 a year classified as normal with regard to rainfall is closest to the course of average seasonal changes in the period 1999 2013 median 3 3 groundwater drought the term groundwater or hydrogeological drought typically refers to a period of decreased groundwater levels that result in water related problems the amount of groundwater decline that would be considered a drought varies regionally and locally due to differences in groundwater conditions and groundwater needs for humans and the environment analysis of hydrogeological drought on a regional scale should be performed in relation to an area with similarly defined hydrogeological conditions in which the influence of meteorological and climatic factors can be considered similar for the entire study area various problems remain unresolved in terms of the definition identification and prediction of drought bonacci

drought occurrence groundwater drought can be identified using three variables recharge groundwater levels and discharge from groundwater to the surface water system tate and gustard 2000 van lanen and peters 2000 of these three recharge and groundwater discharge cannot be measured directly the spatial and temporal aspects of groundwater levels provide indirect knowledge about groundwater recharge and discharge therefore in most cases groundwater levels are monitored to detect groundwater droughts tallaksen and van lanen 2004 for instance groundwater drought occurrence has been so studied in slovakia by fendeková and ženišová 2010 machlica and stojkovova 2008 machlica et al 2010 fendekova and fendek 2012 accordingly the time period for the analysis of a groundwater drought should necessarily be large usually more than a week or a month the long term average value of the base flow has been used as a comparative value during the process of base flow drought extremity assessment stahl 2001 tallaksen and van lanen 2004 fendekova and fendek 2012 gurwin 2014 long term average values of groundwater levels have been used at a regional scale to assess the hazard and

1177,the finite volume point dilution method fvpdm is a single well tracer experiment which has been successfully used in many hydrogeological contexts to quantify groundwater fluxes during continuous injection of tracer into a well the tracer concentration evolution measured within the tested well directly depends on the groundwater flow crossing the well screens up to now the fvpdm mathematical formulation used to simulate the tracer concentration evolution measured in the tested well assumed perfect homogenization of the tracer along the tested interval which is a reasonable assumption in many cases however when fvpdm are performed in long screened boreholes or in very permeable aquifer materials the recirculation flow rate imposed to ensure mixing is suspected to be too low to perfectly homogenize the tracer in order to assess the effect of non perfect mixing on fvpdm results we introduce here a new discrete model that explicitly considers the recirculation flow rate the mathematical developments are validated using field measurements and a sensitivity analysis is proposed to assess the effect of the mixing flow rate on tracer concentration homogenization within the well results confirm that when the recirculation flow rate applied is not high enough compared to the groundwater flow rate the tracer distribution is not uniform in the tested interval in this case the use of the classical analytical solution commonly used to interpret the concentration evolution leads to highly overestimated groundwater fluxes the discrete model introduced here can be used instead to properly estimate groundwater fluxes and assess the tracer distribution within the tested interval the discrete model offers the possibility of interpreting field measurements conducted under non perfect mixing conditions and increases the range of fluxes that can be investigated through fvpdm keywords finite volume point dilution method non perfect mixing improved fvpdm model tracer

essential in many hydrogeological studies especially to understand contaminant transport and behavior to investigate groundwater surface water interactions or else in geothermal applications and in geotechnical engineering in this context tracer dilution tests have been widely developed and applied to quantify groundwater fluxes hall 1993 novakowski et al 1995 2006 west and odling 2007 drost et al 1968 lewis et al 1966 pitrak et al 2007 hatfield et al 2004 halevy et al 1967 among single well techniques the finite volume point dilution method fvpdm that is a generalization of classical point dilution tests was developed and validated brouyère 2003 brouyère et al 2008 fvpdm tests are performed by continuously injecting a tracer into the well at the top of the well or of the tested interval and monitoring the evolution of the tracer concentration into the same well fig 1 the water within the tested interval is continuously mixed through a mixing pump ensuring a homogeneous distribution of the tracer within the tested interval by doing so the water is extracted with a pump placed at the bottom of the tested interval and reinjected at the top of the tested interval during the experiment the tracer concentration within the well first increases before stabilizing and reaching a plateau brouyère et al 2008 demonstrated that the tracer concentration evolution and stabilization depends on the concentration of the injected water cinj on the tracer injection flow rate qinj and on the flow rate of the groundwater crossing the screen of the injection well qt in a part of the injected tracer is carried out of the well by the groundwater flow therefore the higher the groundwater fluxes the higher the tracer dilution and the lower the tracer concentration remaining in the well measured concentrations can be easily reproduced using the analytical solution introduced by brouyère et al 2008 by calibrating the only unknown parameter at steady state when concentration is stabilized the darcy flux in the aquifer the application of fvpdm in many hydrogeological contexts to characterize groundwater surface water interactions dujardin et al 2014 fractured aquifer jamin et al 2015 permafrost zone jamin et al 2020 complex sandy aquifer goderniaux et al 2010 brouyère et al 2008 or shallow alluvial aquifers wildemeersch et al 2014 demonstrated the robustness and reliability of the method to provide accurate groundwater fluxes estimates in addition since the tracer concentration is sensitive to changes in groundwater flow the method was also successfully applied under transient groundwater flow conditions jamin and brouyère 2018 jamin et al 2020 jamin et al 2015 analytical and numerical solutions classically used to interpret fvpdm tests brouyère 2003 brouyère et al 2008 jamin and brouyère 2018 and to model the tracer concentration evolution within the tested interval hw in fig 1 rely on the assumption that the mixing flow rate is high enough to ensure a uniform repartition of the tracer mass in the water column in practice it can be technically difficult to apply a mixing rate high enough to make sure the tracer concentration is homogenous in the well as observed by jamin and brouyère 2018 who performed fvpdm tests under pumping conditions in a high hydraulic conductivity aquifer they observed a nonlinear evolution of the groundwater flux with the pumping rate suggesting that the mixing flow rate applied during the experiment was too low compared to the groundwater transit flow rate passing through the well screen their results suggested that under high groundwater transit flow rate a significant portion of tracer may be carried out of the well before reaching the mixing pump located at the bottom of the tested interval therefore in case of non perfect mixing higher tracer concentrations may be found at the top of the tested interval than at the bottom such issues are suspected to appear when fvpdm are conducted in long screened wells in very permeable aquifer materials or else in fractured or heterogeneous aquifer as it has been observed for other tracer dilution tests poulsen et al 2019 yet the question of the effect of the mixing flow rate or recirculation flow rate on tracer concentration distribution within the tested interval has never been assessed until now in this context we introduce here a new discrete fvpdm model which allows simulating tracer concentration profiles in depth along the tested interval contrary to classical solutions commonly used to interpret fvpdm tests brouyère et al 2008 this discrete model explicitly considers the recirculation flow rate which allows assessing the distribution of tracer concentration along the tested interval this aims to assess the influence of this parameter on the tracer distribution along the tested interval and to propose a solution to interpret fvpdm tests performed under non perfect mixing conditions in the next sections the new discrete fvpdm model developed to simulate tracer concentration profiles depending on mixing flow rate is introduced then we rely on field data to illustrate the adequacy and relevance of the discrete model to interpret fvpdm results and quantify groundwater fluxes in the end a sensitivity analysis is proposed in order to assess the effect of the mixing flow rate on tracer concentration homogenization within the well and on the estimation of groundwater flux using the fvpdm method 2 material methods 2 1 presentation of the discrete model the analytical solution classically used to interpret fvdpm tests developed by brouyère et al 2008 relies on a model based on mass balance equations their approach consisted of considering that the variation of tracer mass and thus concentration measured over time within the whole tested interval fig 1 depends on the tracer mass entering within the tested interval and on the tracer mass leaving the interval for the discrete model introduced in this paper a similar approach is developed expect that the tested interval is discretized into a multitude of elementary cells thus the mass balance approach is applied for each cell which allows simulating the tracer concentration evolution in each cell and provides tracer concentration profiles moreover contrary to the classical solution approach this term refers to the approach developed by brouyère et al 2008 from now the discrete model is built to take into account the mixing applied within the interval which means that the recirculation flow rate is integrated in mass balance equations 2 1 1 discrete numerical model for the discrete model developed here the domain the volume of water is discretized into i elementary cells with vertical size δzi i 1 2 nz as shown in fig 2a time is discretized into nt time steps δt j 1 2 nt mass balance equations are written for each elementary cell considering that the mass of tracer changes over time depending on flow rates entering and leaving the cell i and on their respective concentrations in tracer the approach consists in defining for each cell entering and leaving flow rates to do so space is divided into two parts the screened interval discretized into nzscr cells and the tube interval no screens discretized into nz nzscr cells fig 2a this allows considering the effective geometry of the well and adapting the model for each experimental setup in the tube interval fig 2a b and c only vertical flow circulation occurs meaning that flow rate terms accounting for water and solute transport within the tubewell are the injection flow rate qinj and the recirculation flow rate qrecirc ensured by the mixing pump in the bottom of the tested interval in the screened interval figs 2a d and e besides the recirculation flow rate flow rate terms include exchanges between the well and the test aquifer system transit flow rate thus the transit flow rate q t i in corresponding to the flow crossing the well under injection conditions for each interval i is included in the mass balance equations the detailed mass balance equations written for each cell are detailed in appendix a once mass balance equations are defined it is possible to numerically evaluated each equation through the forward difference expression approximant of δt appendix a then the concentration of tracer cw can be calculated for each cell and each time step c w i j the initial conditions are c w i 1 c0 the tracer concentration at j 1 corresponds to the tracer concentration in the aquifer and in the well at initial time before tracer injection

transiting along the screen under ambient conditions qt i here in order to study the mixing within the well homogeneous flow conditions are assumed along the screen which means that the portion q inj i of the total injection flow rate leaving the screen is calculated following 5 q inj i q inj nz scr brouyère 2003 proposed a solution to calculate the transit flow rate q t in crossing the well

i 6 q t i in q cr i π sin arccos q inj i q cr i q inj i 2 π 2 arccos q inj i q cr i the transit flow rate depends on the importance of the injection rate compared to the critical injection rate qcr the term qcr corresponds to the injection rate above which the transit flow rate qt is cancelled radially diverging flow prevails making the flow estimation impossible brouyère et al 2008 qcr is calculated for each cell i following 7 q cr i π q t i 2 π r w z q app i with qapp i the apparent darcy flux measured for each interval δz the estimation of the effective darcy flux qd in the aquifer requires evaluating the value of flow distortion coefficient αw drost et al 1968 brouyère 2003 that expresses the ratio between the apparent water flow rate crossing the screen section and the theoretical or effective flow rate that would transit across the same section in the absence of the well q app α w q d in this study we focus on estimating the apparent darcy flux also called the apparent groundwater flux 2 1 3 space discretization the numerical scheme eq a 6 is applicable when the courant friedrich levi cfl stability condition is satisfied it requires that sizes of δz and δt have to be fixed so that the non dimensional courant number cr does not exceed 1 here cr is expressed as 8 cr q recirc π r w 2 t z 1 with the ratio q recirc π r w 2 accounting for the vertical flow velocity into the well 2 1 4 tracer distribution along the screened interval in the case of perfect mixing the tracer distribution is homogeneous all along the tested interval in contrast for the case of non perfect mixing lower tracer concentrations are expected at the bottom of the tested interval thus the ratio of concentrations between the bottom and the top of the tested interval called rb t can be used to assess the importance of tracer concentration gradient within the interval when the ratio rb t 1 the concentrations at the bottom and on the top of the screen tend to be equal meaning that the tracer concentration tends to be homogenous in the screened interval in ideal cases if the recirculation flow rate is sufficient to ensure the perfect homogenization of the tracer rb t should reach 1 conversely the ratio rb t decreases when significant differences in concentrations are observed between the bottom and the top of the tested interval thus lower ratio values can be associated to non perfect mixing conditions meaning that the tracer distribution is non uniform along the tested interval in practice this means that a significant portion of the tracer mass would be preferentially carried out of the well and lost before reaching the mixing pump located in the bottom of the well the ratio rb t is thus defined as the ratio between the value of the tracer concentration stabilization at the bottom of the tested interval and the value of the tracer concentration stabilization at the top and can be calculated using 9 r b t c w sta b nz c w stab nz nz scr

b 2 1 5 the inverse approach besides simulating tracer concentration profiles depending on flow and experimental conditions the purpose of developing a discrete model is to be able to interpret field data and estimate groundwater fluxes for both perfect and non perfect mixing conditions to do so the discrete model is coded in matlab and an inverse approach is used to estimate the optimal value of groundwater flow accounting for tracer concentration evolutions measured in the field note that the tracer concentration is measured within the recirculation loop fig 1 and the associated tracer evolution stands for the tracer evolution at the bottom the tested interval to the level of the pump first the tested interval is discretized into i elements of size δz depending on the geometry of the tested well and the time is discretized into nt time steps δt δz and δt are chosen so the courant number eq 8 does not exceed 1 then eqs 1 2 3 and 4 are used to model the tracer concentration evolution along the water column calculations are made over a large range of groundwater flow rates for each value of groundwater flow rates tested the rmse root mean square error between the concentration evolution modelled in the bottom of the well i nz using the discrete model and the tracer concentration measured in the field is calculated then the nonlinear optimization function fminsearch based on the nelder mead simplex algorithm lagarias et al 1998 automatically determines the value of groundwater flow rate associated with the minimal value of rmse which allows estimating the optimal value of groundwater flow accounting for the measured tracer concentration evolution in complement the same approach can be used to interpret the field data using the classical model brouyère et al 2008 in order to validate the inverse approach applied here and to compare both models 2 2 field application the adequacy and relevance of the new fvpdm discrete model was tested and illustrated using the field measurements presented by jamin and brouyère 2018 the aim of this study was to monitor transient groundwater fluxes in the alluvial aquifer of the river meuse near liège belgium where subsurface is characterized by an important vertical heterogeneity related to the presence of different layers of alluvial deposits inducing variable hydraulic properties with depth see wildemeersch et al 2014 for more details in their study jamin and brouyère 2018 observed that the mixing flow rate applied during the experiment was too low compared to the groundwater transit flow rate which affected the groundwater flow estimate we propose here to test this assumption by reinterpreting their measurements with the discrete model and to compare the associated results groundwater fluxes estimates with the one obtained using the classical approach 2 2 1 description of fvpdm tests jamin and brouyère 2018 performed two fvpdm tests simultaneously in a single borehole pz19 equipped with two internal piezometers the first piezometer pz19 shallow is screened over 0 9 m length in the upper part of the aquifer at 4 1 m depth constituted of fine sandy gravels the second piezometer pz19 deep is screened over 1 8 m length in the lower part of the aquifer at 7 95 m depth consisting of coarser gravels and pebbles previous studies showed that the mean hydraulic conductivity for the alluvial aquifer varies between 2 10 3 and 1 2 10 1 m s 1 and that the hydraulic conductivity is higher in the lower part of the aquifer than in the upper part brouyère 2001 wildemeersch et al 2014 transient flow conditions were imposed by pumping groundwater at different rates for 36 h in a pumping well located at 5 m from pz19 the pumping rate schema applied over time at the pumping well including phases with no pumping to approach ambient groundwater flow conditions is detailed in fig 3a table 1 presents experiment parameters for each fvpdm test jamin and brouyère 2018 applied the classical approach developed by brouyère et al 2008 assuming the perfect homogenization of the tracer to interpret the tracer concentration evolution measured in the bottom of each piezometer during the tracer injection concerning the fvpdm conducted in pz19 shallow a linear evolution of the measured groundwater flux with the pumping rate has been found which is logical and consistent the higher the pumping rate the higher the flux however for the fvpdm conducted in pz19 deep this linear relationship was not observed which was surprising to explain this the authors made the assumption that the mixing flow rate applied during the experiment conducted in pz19 deep could have been too low compared to the groundwater transit flow rate passing through the well screen indeed for pz19 shallow linear relation the maximum groundwater transit flow rate was estimated to be 5 26 10 6 m3 s 1 while for pz19 deep the maximum groundwater transit flow rate was estimated 70 times higher 3 80 10 4 m3 s 1 in both cases the recirculation flow rate applied was qrecirc 1 9 10 4 m3 s 1 which means that for pz19 deep the recirculation flow rate was much lower than the transit flow rate estimated thus a significant portion of the tracer mass is suspected to be preferentially carried out of the well and lost before reaching the mixing pump located in the bottom of the well meaning that the flow estimated in pz19 deep could be overestimated 2 2 2 application of the new discrete model and objectives we propose here to test the effect of the non perfect mixing on fvpdm results by reinterpreting the field measurements with the discrete model and to compare the associated results groundwater fluxes estimates with the one obtained using the classical solution firstly for pz19 shallow results of jamin and brouyère 2018 suggested a perfect homogenization of the tracer along the tested interval therefore groundwater fluxes estimates with the new discrete model obtained here are expected to be similar to the one obtained with the classical approach as proposed in jamin and brouyère 2018 studying this perfect mixing should allow validating the use of the discrete model as well as the associated inverse approach that allows finding the optimal value of groundwater flow accounting for the measured tracer concentration evolution secondly the assumption of non perfect mixing will be tested using the discrete model by simulating concentration profiles within the tested interval for pz19 deep by comparing groundwater fluxes estimates obtained with both the classical and the new discrete model we aim to assess the effect of the recirculation rate on tracer distribution within the well parameters used to implement the discrete model are similar as the one used in jamin and brouyère 2018 table 1 for pz19 shallow hw was discretized in 64 elementary cells δz 0 032 m with 29 cells in the screened interval for pz19 deep hw was discretized in 125 elementary cells δz 0 055 m with 33 cells in the screened interval for both cases δt was fixed at 0 1 s thus courant numbers were respectively 0 03 and 0 05 for pz19 shallow and pz19 deep ensuring the stability of computations the inverse approach previously described was applied to estimate groundwater fluxes from tracer concentration evolutions for both the new discrete fvpdm model and the classical model 2 3 sensitivity analysis in order to generalize the results obtained with the discrete model a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of recirculation flow rate and of injection flow rate on results of fvpdm tests this aims to define limits of the method advantages of the discrete model and to address recommendations about the use of fvpdm in different flow conditions just as proposed by brouyère et al 2005 2008 sensitivity analysis was made using nondimensional variables for the sake of generality to do so concentration terms were normalized according to the concentration in the tracer fluid cinj while flow rate terms were normalized according to the critical injection rate qcr as a reminder qcr corresponds to the injection rate above which the transit flow rate qt is cancelled radially diverging flow prevails making the flow estimation impossible thus normalized tracer concentration in the well is c w c w c inj and normalized injection and recirculation rates are respectively q inj q inj q cr and q recirc q recirc q cr in the classical approach brouyère et al 2005 proposed to normalize time t using tw corresponding to the time needed to replace water in the tested interval vw at the critical injection rate qcr such approach requires assuming an instantaneous mixing of the tracer within the tested interval which is not applicable for the discrete model in which recirculation flow rate is considered and tracer repartition within the well modelled in this case normalizing time requires considering the solute transport in depth depending on qinj and qrecirc which can be expressed using a lag time parameter τ i z i π r w 2 q inj q recirc corresponding to the time required for the tracer to reach depth zi therefore time was normalized such as t i t τ i t wi where twi corresponds to the time needed to replace the water in each cell at the critical injection rate twi vwi qcr i 3 results 3 1 field application 3 1 1 reproduction of field data fig 3 presents the interpretation of the fvpdm tests performed by jamin and brouyère 2018 in the alluvial aquifer of the river meuse these results correspond to optimal values of groundwater fluxes estimated using the inverse approach either with the classical model or the discrete model figs 3b c and d focus on the experiment conducted in the piezometer pz19 shallow field data are very well reproduced with both models for all steps of pumping rates applied fig 3b likewise groundwater fluxes estimates are very similar with both models fig 3c d and the linear relationship between pumping rate and groundwater fluxes is verified with both models fig 3d and the consistency and similarity of results obtained with both models allow validating the discrete model figs 3e f and g focus on the experiment conducted in the piezometer pz19 deep figs 3e compares the tracer concentration evolution measured in the bottom of the well during the experiment blue line with modelled tracer concentration evolutions the yellow line being associated to the classical approach and the green line to the discrete model once again field data can be very well reproduced with both models with rmses between field data and modelled data of 0 29 ppb for both cases however contrary to results obtained for pz19 shallow groundwater fluxes estimated with the classical model are significantly different and systematically higher than groundwater fluxes estimated with the discrete model fig 3f using the classical approach apparent darcy fluxes are estimated between 5 98 10 4 and 4 5 10 3 m s 1 qt between 5 47 10 5 and 4 11 10 4 m3 s 1 whereas the discrete model estimates apparent darcy fluxes between 5 28 10 4 and 2 39 10 3 m s 1 qt between 4 83 10 5 and 2 19 10 4 m3 s 1 interestingly the higher the pumping rate and groundwater fluxes the higher the difference on the fluxes estimates when pumping at 50 m3 h 1 difference on fluxes estimates reaches 81 6 however the difference still remains important for lower fluxes since under ambient groundwater flow conditions phases with no pumping the difference on estimated fluxes is 24 fig 3g shows groundwater fluxes evolution with pumping obtained with each model while the classical model predicts an exponential relationship between calculated groundwater fluxes and pumping rates in accordance with results of jamin and brouyère 2018 the discrete model predicts a linear relationship between both results suggest that each 10 m3 h 1 increment at the pumping well corresponds to an increment of 3 06 10 4 m s 1 i e 26 5 m d 1 in the apparent groundwater flux measured in pz19 deep in pz19 shallow each 10 m3 h 1 increment at the pumping well is associated to an increment of 1 77 10 5 m s 1 i e 1 5 m d 1 in the apparent groundwater flux 3 1 2 simulation of tracer concentration profiles in order to better understand why the classical model can not be applied for the deeper piezometers the tracer concentration profiles at the end of the first stage of pumping are simulated using the discrete model fig 4a and c for both piezometers the shapes of concentration profiles with depth are similar with uniform concentrations in the tube and a concentration decrease with depth in the screened interval however the ratio rb t between the concentration at the bottom and the concentration at top of the screen is 0 98 for the shallow piezometer fig 4a while 0 37 for the deep piezometer fig 4c this means that the tracer gradient is 2 6 times more important in the deep piezometer than in the shallow one thus for pz19 shallow even if the tracer concentration is not strictly homogeneous in the screened interval the concentration difference between the top and the bottom of this interval is relatively low therefore tracer concentration evolutions are relatively similar all along the screen and both models discrete and classical predict similar tracer concentration evolutions over time fig 4c conversely for pz19 deep a significant difference of concentrations is observed between the top and the bottom of the screen blue lines fig 4d if the classical model is used in this case the tracer concentration measured at the bottom of the interval is reproduced yellow line which necessarily requires to consider a higher value of groundwater flow that is why in the case of non perfect mixing conditions the classical approach leads to overestimate the effective value of groundwater fluxes in addition both models show significant differences concerning tracer concentration evolutions before tracer concentration stabilizes transient stage a significant time lag is observed between the injection start and the start of concentration rise with the discrete model while the concentration instantaneously starts increasing with the classical approach then with the discrete model the tracer concentration increases stepwise blue lines show oscillations sequential plateaus at the beginning of the experiment due to the water reinjection on top of the well and to the non instantaneous homogenization of the tracer within the well 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 non perfect mixing domain fig 5a shows the value of the ratio rb t ratio between the stabilized tracer concentration at the bottom of the tested interval and the stabilized tracer concentration on the top of the tested interval depending on q recirc and q inj this allows evaluating if concentrations are uniform along the screened interval according to flow conditions this plot is established using eq 9 and nondimensional variables so results are independent of the screened interval length fig 5b shows the difference between fluxes estimated using the classical model and fluxes estimates using the discrete model depending on flow and experimental conditions to obtain this plot concentrations profiles were first simulated for different values of q recirc and q inj using the discrete model then concentrations evolutions modelled at the bottom of the screened interval are interpreted using the classical model associated estimated values of groundwater fluxes are compared with effective values of groundwater fluxes this approach aims to define in which conditions the classical model is well suited to interpret field measurements as underlined in fig 5 results can be divided into two domains depending on the value of q recirc first for large values of q recirc 5 the difference of concentrations within the screened interval is 5 fig 5a meaning that the concentration can be considered uniform in the tested interval therefore data interpretation is similar regardless of the model applied discrete or classical with differences on groundwater fluxes estimates 3 5 fig 5b in this case results are similar for any value of q inj conversely for lower values of q recirc 5 concentrations can not be considered uniform along the tested interval and the lower the value of q recirc the more important the gradient of the concentration with depth fig 5a therefore the use of the classical model that only considers perfect mixing and homogenization of the tracer to interpret field measurements can induce significant discrepancies on groundwater fluxes estimates fig 5b the classical approach systematically overestimates groundwater fluxes with errors 50 as soon as q recirc 0 5 and errors 100 for q recirc 0 3 meaning that the estimated fluxes are at least twice more important than effective fluxes besides results show that for low values of q recirc the value of q inj has also significant effects on tracer distribution and thus on groundwater fluxes estimates thus errors on fluxes estimates are higher for lower values of q inj fig 5a also allows defining the limit of the fvpdm method indeed the limit of the method is reached as soon as the ratio rb t reaches 0 which means that the tracer never reaches the bottom of the well at least at a concentration which is below detection limit and data interpretation becomes impossible this limit is reached when q recirc 0 04 for q inj 0 01 or when q recirc 0 02 for q inj 0 05 note that when q inj 0 1 this limit is never reached meaning that the tracer systematically reaches the bottom of the screen in this case the injection flow rate is necessarily high enough to allow the tracer to reach the bottom even a small portion 3 2 2 tracer homogenization within the wellbore fig 6 shows the effect of the recirculation rate on tracer concentration evolutions at different depths in complement to fig 5 it allows visualizing the effect of q recirc and q inj on concentration profiles it clearly confirms that the higher the value of q recirc the better the tracer homogenization within the well thus for q recirc 20 tracer concentration evolutions are very similar regardless the depth considered with a ratio r b t of 0 985 and 0 988 for q inj 0 03 and 0 1 respectively fig 6c and f for lower values of q recirc the tracer concentration gradient in the well is way more important for instance the ratio r b t reaches 0 261 for q recirc 0 2 and q inj 0 03 and significant differences in tracer concentration evolutions are observed within the tested interval fig 6a note that the ratio r b t is systematically higher for q inj 0 03 than for q inj 0 1 in agreement with results presented in fig 5a this means that higher injection rates contribute to better mixing within the tested interval fig 6 also shows that results obtained with both approaches are similar for large values of q recirc for lower values of q recirc fig 6a b d and e the classical approach does not reflect the tracer concentration distribution but describes the average concentration indeed the stabilized concentration obtained with the classical model corresponds to the mean of stabilized concentrations obtained along the screened interval with the discrete approach 4 discussions results show that mixing within the tested interval depends on the recirculation flow rate compared to the groundwater flow rate crossing the well screens q recirc when q recirc 5 the recirculation flow can be considered high enough compared to groundwater fluxes to ensure the homogenization of the tracer within the tested interval in this case of perfect mixing conditions the concentration evolution measured in the bottom of the well can be interpreted either with the classical model developed by brouyère et al 2008 or with the discrete model presented here groundwater fluxes estimates will be similar with both models with differences on estimates 5 this was experimentally validated through fvpdm tests performed in the alluvial aquifer of the river meuse for the shallow piezometer pz19 shallow data interpretation with both models led to estimate qcr varying between 1 44 10 5 and 7 79 10 7 m3 s 1 meaning that the values of q recirc during the experiment varied between 13 2 and 244 note that since the classical model is easier to implement its use should be preferred in case of perfect mixing conditions conversely for non perfect mixing conditions q recirc 5 results demonstrate the importance of using the discrete fvpdm model introduced in this paper to interpret concentration evolution curves indeed the classical model may lead to high overestimates of groundwater fluxes as demonstrated with the interpretation of data collected in piezometer pz19 deep in this case the value of q recirc varies between 0 27 and 1 25 during the experiment such values suggest the recirculation flow rate is not high enough to ensure the homogenization of the tracer within the tested interval it leads to large errors on fluxes estimates while using the classical model between 14 and 82 in accordance with results presented in fig 5b whereas the classical model is only applicable when q recirc 5 the discrete model allows estimating fluxes even if experimental conditions are not ideal q recirc 5 in piezometer pz19 deep for instance considering the groundwater fluxes reached 2 26 10 4 m3 s 1 when pumping at 50 m3 h 1 the recirculation flow rate should have been around 128 l min 1 against 11 4 l min 1 to ensure the homogenization of the tracer and to make possible the use of the classical model which is hardly feasible in practice concerning the measurements made in piezometer pz19 deep groundwater flow estimates remain relatively high compared to the one obtained in piezometer pz19 shallow these results are in good agreement with the fact that higher values of hydraulic conductivities are found in the lower part of the aquifer wildemeersch et al 2014 however in case of very high groundwater flow non laminar flow could occur since the darcy s law is not applicable for non laminar flow fourar et al 2004 quinn et al 2011 this could explain why a non linear relationship has been initially found between the groundwater flux and the pumping rate however by considering the maximal groundwater flux estimated with the discrete model it can be assumed that the flow is laminar if the mean pore size diameter of the porous media is lower than 5 mm in this case the reynolds number is lower than 10 which ensures laminar flow bear 1972 the mean pore size diameter of the porous media has never been measured in the field but the lower part of aquifer consists of coarse gravels filled with sand and silt knowing that it is consistent to assume that the mean pore size diameter is lower than 5 mm moreover the fact that a linear relationship between the groundwater flux and the pumping rate with the improved model tends to confirm that laminar flow effectively occurs likewise the discrete model also allows modelling the time lag that can exists between the injection start and the concentration rise this time lag is not simulated with the classical approach since the mixing is assumed to be instantaneous in the tested interval for the classical model the time required to reach 99 of the stabilized concentration is estimated to be v w q inj q t in ln 0 01 which implies the concentration stabilization is reached simultaneously everywhere within the tested interval in case of non perfect mixing conditions the time required to reach 99 of the stabilized concentration is estimated to be v wi q inj i q t i in q recirc ln 0 01 from eq a 9 this involves that the time required to reach the steady state increases with depth which is perfectly consistent and that the higher the recirculation flow rate the shorter the stabilization time lastly this study also allows discussing the limits of fvpdm to investigate groundwater fluxes thus although the discrete model allows interpreting fvpdm tests while experimental conditions are not ideal q recirc 5 the limit of the method is reached for very low values of q recirc 0 4 for q inj 0 01 or 0 01 for q inj 0 05 in this case the recirculation flow rate is so weak compared to the groundwater flow rate that the tracer completely dissipates in the tested interval and the measured concentration at its bottom is zero fig 5 5 conclusion the discrete fvpdm model introduced in this paper allows assessing the vertical transport of the tracer along the well axis by explicitly considering the recirculation flow rate in the interpretation of fvpdm tests this study shows that when performing fvpdm in the field it is essential to accurately consider the value of the recirculation flow rate compared to the groundwater flow rate crossing the well screens neglecting the recirculation flow rate during field data interpretation can lead to significant overestimates of groundwater fluxes while the perfect repartition of the tracer is classically assumed when interpreting fvpdm it can be technically difficult to apply and maintain a mixing flow rate higher than groundwater transit flow rate without significantly perturbating the flow pattern around and within the tested well the discrete model introduced here allows interpreting fvpdm conducted in non perfect mixing conditions and thus increases the range of fluxes that can be investigated with fvpdm tests non perfect mixing conditions can be encountered in very permeable aquifer materials as highlighted in this paper but also when tests are performed in long screened wells moreover the discrete model can also be used to simulate vertical variations of groundwater flow or preferential horizontal flow paths since the groundwater flow value is set for each cell of the domain therefore the discrete model offers new perspectives for the characterization of groundwater flow including the possibility of investigating heterogeneous and fractures

1177,the finite volume point dilution method fvpdm is a single well tracer experiment which has been successfully used in many hydrogeological contexts to quantify groundwater fluxes during continuous injection of tracer into a well the tracer concentration evolution measured within the tested well directly depends on the groundwater flow crossing the well screens up to now the fvpdm mathematical formulation used to simulate the tracer concentration evolution measured in the tested well assumed perfect homogenization of the tracer along the tested interval which is a reasonable assumption in many cases however when fvpdm are performed in long screened boreholes or in very permeable aquifer materials the recirculation flow rate imposed to ensure mixing is suspected to be too low to perfectly homogenize the tracer in order to assess the effect of non perfect mixing on fvpdm results we introduce here a new discrete model that explicitly considers the recirculation flow rate the mathematical developments are validated using field measurements and a sensitivity analysis is proposed to assess the effect of the mixing flow rate on tracer concentration homogenization within the well results confirm that when the recirculation flow rate applied is not high enough compared to the groundwater flow rate the tracer distribution is not uniform in the tested interval in this case the use of the classical analytical solution commonly used to interpret the concentration evolution leads to highly overestimated groundwater fluxes the discrete model introduced here can be used instead to properly estimate groundwater fluxes and assess the tracer distribution within the tested interval the discrete model offers the possibility of interpreting field measurements conducted

essential in many hydrogeological studies especially to understand contaminant transport and behavior to investigate groundwater surface water interactions or else in geothermal applications and in geotechnical engineering in this context tracer dilution tests have been widely developed and applied to quantify groundwater fluxes hall 1993 novakowski et al 1995 2006 west and odling 2007 drost et al 1968 lewis et al 1966 pitrak et al 2007 hatfield et al 2004 halevy et al 1967 among single well techniques the finite volume point dilution method fvpdm that is a generalization of classical point dilution tests was developed and validated brouyère 2003 brouyère et al 2008 fvpdm tests are performed by continuously injecting a tracer into the well at the top of the well or of the tested interval and monitoring the evolution of the tracer concentration into the same well fig 1 the water within the tested interval is continuously mixed through a mixing pump ensuring a homogeneous distribution of the tracer within the tested interval by doing so the water is extracted with a pump placed at the bottom of the tested interval and reinjected at the top of the tested interval during the experiment the tracer concentration within the well first increases before stabilizing and reaching a plateau brouyère et al 2008 demonstrated that the tracer concentration evolution and stabilization depends on the concentration of the injected water cinj on the tracer injection flow rate qinj and on the flow rate of the groundwater crossing the screen of the injection well qt in a part of the injected tracer is carried out of the well by the groundwater flow therefore the higher the groundwater fluxes the higher the tracer dilution and the lower the tracer concentration remaining in the well measured concentrations can be easily reproduced using the analytical solution introduced by brouyère et al 2008 by calibrating the only unknown parameter at steady state when concentration is stabilized the darcy flux in the aquifer the application of fvpdm in many hydrogeological contexts to characterize groundwater surface water interactions dujardin et al 2014 fractured aquifer jamin et al 2015 permafrost zone jamin et al 2020 complex sandy aquifer goderniaux et al 2010 brouyère et al 2008 or shallow alluvial aquifers wildemeersch et al 2014 demonstrated the robustness and reliability of the method to provide accurate groundwater fluxes estimates in addition since the tracer concentration is sensitive to changes in groundwater flow the method was also successfully applied under transient groundwater flow conditions jamin and brouyère 2018 jamin et al 2020 jamin et al 2015 analytical and numerical solutions classically used to interpret fvpdm tests brouyère 2003 brouyère et al 2008 jamin and brouyère 2018 and to model the tracer concentration evolution within the tested interval hw in fig 1 rely on the assumption that the mixing flow rate is high enough to ensure a uniform repartition of the tracer mass in the water column in practice it can be technically difficult to apply a mixing rate high enough to make sure the tracer concentration is homogenous in the well as observed by jamin and brouyère 2018 who performed fvpdm tests under pumping conditions in a high hydraulic conductivity aquifer they observed a nonlinear evolution of the groundwater flux with the pumping rate suggesting that the mixing flow rate applied during the experiment was too low compared to the groundwater transit flow rate passing through the well screen their results suggested that under high groundwater transit flow rate a significant portion of tracer may be carried out of the well before reaching the mixing pump located at the bottom of the tested interval therefore in case of non perfect mixing higher tracer concentrations may be found at the top of the tested interval than at the bottom such issues are suspected to appear when fvpdm are conducted in long screened wells in very permeable aquifer materials or else in fractured or heterogeneous aquifer as it has been observed for other tracer dilution tests poulsen et al 2019 yet the question of the effect of the mixing flow rate or recirculation flow rate on tracer concentration distribution within the tested interval has never been assessed until now in this context we introduce here a new discrete fvpdm model which allows simulating tracer concentration profiles in depth along the tested interval contrary to classical solutions commonly used to interpret fvpdm tests brouyère et al 2008 this discrete model explicitly considers the recirculation flow rate which allows assessing the distribution of tracer concentration along the tested interval this aims to assess the influence of this parameter on the tracer distribution along the tested interval and to propose a solution to interpret fvpdm tests performed under non perfect mixing conditions in the next sections the new discrete fvpdm model developed to simulate tracer concentration profiles depending on mixing flow rate is introduced then we rely on field data to illustrate the adequacy and relevance of the discrete model to interpret fvpdm results and quantify groundwater fluxes in the end a sensitivity analysis is proposed in order to assess the effect of the mixing flow rate on tracer concentration homogenization within the well and on the estimation of groundwater flux using the fvpdm method 2 material methods 2 1 presentation of the discrete model the analytical solution classically used to interpret fvdpm tests developed by brouyère et al 2008 relies on a model based on mass balance equations their approach consisted of considering that the variation of tracer mass and thus concentration measured over time within the whole tested interval fig 1 depends on the tracer mass entering within the tested interval and on the tracer mass leaving the interval for the discrete model introduced in this paper a similar approach is developed expect that the tested interval is discretized into a multitude of elementary cells thus the mass balance approach is applied for each cell which allows simulating the tracer concentration evolution in each cell and provides tracer concentration profiles moreover contrary to the classical solution approach this term refers to the approach developed by brouyère et al 2008 from now the discrete model is built to take into account the mixing applied within the interval which means that the recirculation flow rate is integrated in mass balance equations 2 1 1 discrete numerical model for the discrete model developed here the domain the volume of water is discretized into i elementary cells with vertical size δzi i 1 2 nz as shown in fig 2a time is discretized into nt time steps δt j 1 2 nt mass balance equations are written for each elementary cell considering that the mass of tracer changes over time depending on flow rates entering and leaving the cell i and on their respective concentrations in tracer the approach consists in defining for each cell entering and leaving flow rates to do so space is divided into two parts the screened interval discretized into nzscr cells and the tube interval no screens discretized into nz nzscr cells fig 2a this allows considering the effective geometry of the well and adapting the model for each experimental setup in the tube interval fig 2a b and c only vertical flow circulation occurs meaning that flow rate terms accounting for water and solute transport within the tubewell are the injection flow rate qinj and the recirculation flow rate qrecirc ensured by the mixing pump in the bottom of the tested interval in the screened interval figs 2a d and e besides the recirculation flow rate flow rate terms include exchanges between the well and the test aquifer system transit flow rate thus the transit flow rate q t i in corresponding to the flow crossing the well under injection conditions for each interval i is included in the mass balance equations the detailed mass balance equations written for each cell are detailed in appendix a once mass balance equations are defined it is possible to numerically evaluated each equation through the forward difference expression approximant of δt appendix a then the concentration of tracer cw can be calculated for each cell and each time step c w i j the initial conditions are c w i 1 c0 the tracer concentration at j 1 corresponds to the tracer concentration in the aquifer and in the well at initial time before tracer injection the tracer concentration evolution at top of the well i 1 where the tracer injection takes place fig 2b can be modelled following 1 v wi c w 1 j 1 v wi c w 1 j q recirc c w nz j 1 q recirc c w 1 j q

transiting along the screen under ambient conditions qt i here in order to study the mixing within the well homogeneous flow conditions are assumed along the screen which means that the portion q inj

theoretical or effective flow rate that would transit across the same section in the absence of the well q app α w q d in this study we focus on estimating the apparent darcy flux also called the apparent groundwater flux 2 1 3 space discretization the numerical scheme eq a 6 is applicable when the courant friedrich levi cfl stability condition is satisfied it requires that sizes of δz and δt have to be fixed so that the non dimensional courant number cr does not exceed 1 here cr is expressed as 8 cr q recirc π r w 2 t z 1 with the ratio q recirc π r w 2 accounting for the vertical flow velocity into the well 2 1 4 tracer distribution along the screened interval in the case of perfect mixing the tracer distribution is homogeneous all along the tested interval in contrast for the case of non perfect mixing lower tracer concentrations are expected at the bottom of the tested interval thus the ratio of concentrations between the bottom and the top of the tested interval called rb t can be used to assess the importance of tracer concentration gradient within the interval when the ratio rb t 1 the concentrations at the bottom and on the top of the screen tend to be equal meaning that the tracer concentration tends to be homogenous in the screened interval in ideal cases if the recirculation flow rate is sufficient to ensure the perfect homogenization of the tracer rb t should reach 1 conversely the ratio rb t decreases when significant differences in concentrations are observed between the bottom and the top of the tested interval thus lower ratio values can be associated to non perfect mixing conditions meaning that the tracer distribution is non uniform along the tested interval in practice this means that a significant portion of the tracer mass would be preferentially carried out of the well and lost before reaching the mixing pump located in the bottom of the well the ratio rb t is thus defined as the ratio between the value of the tracer concentration stabilization at the bottom of the tested interval and the value of the tracer concentration stabilization at the top and can be calculated using 9 r b t c w sta b nz c w stab nz nz scr

b 2 1 5 the inverse approach besides simulating tracer concentration profiles depending on flow and experimental conditions the purpose of developing a discrete model is to be able to interpret field data and estimate groundwater fluxes for both perfect and non perfect mixing conditions to do so the discrete model is coded in matlab and an inverse approach is used to estimate the optimal value of groundwater flow accounting for tracer concentration evolutions measured in the field note that the tracer concentration is measured within the recirculation loop fig 1 and the associated tracer evolution stands for the tracer evolution at the bottom the tested interval to the level of the pump first the tested interval is discretized into i elements of size δz depending on the geometry of the tested well and the time is discretized into nt time steps δt δz and δt are chosen so the courant number eq 8 does not exceed 1 then eqs 1 2 3 and 4 are used to model the tracer concentration evolution along the water column calculations are made over a large range of groundwater flow rates for each value of groundwater flow rates tested the rmse root mean square error between the concentration evolution modelled in the bottom of the well i nz using the discrete model and the tracer concentration measured in the field is calculated then the nonlinear optimization function fminsearch based on the nelder mead simplex algorithm lagarias et al 1998 automatically determines the value of groundwater flow rate associated with the minimal value of rmse which allows estimating the optimal value of groundwater flow accounting for the measured tracer concentration evolution in complement the same approach can be used to interpret the field data using the classical model brouyère et al 2008 in order to validate the inverse approach applied here and to compare both models 2 2 field application the adequacy and relevance of the new fvpdm discrete model was tested and illustrated using the field measurements presented by jamin and brouyère 2018 the aim of this study was to monitor transient groundwater fluxes in the alluvial aquifer of the river meuse near liège belgium where subsurface is characterized by an important vertical heterogeneity related to the presence of different layers of alluvial deposits inducing variable hydraulic properties with depth see wildemeersch et al 2014 for more details in their study jamin and brouyère 2018 observed that the mixing flow rate applied during the experiment was too low compared to the groundwater transit flow rate which affected the groundwater flow estimate we propose here to test this assumption by reinterpreting their measurements with the discrete model and to compare the associated results groundwater fluxes estimates with the one obtained using the classical approach 2 2 1 description of fvpdm tests jamin and brouyère 2018 performed two fvpdm tests simultaneously in a single borehole pz19 equipped with two internal piezometers the first piezometer pz19 shallow is screened over 0 9 m length in the upper part of the aquifer at 4 1 m depth constituted of fine sandy gravels the second piezometer pz19 deep is screened over 1 8 m length in the lower part of the aquifer at 7 95 m depth consisting of coarser gravels and pebbles previous studies showed that the mean hydraulic conductivity for the alluvial aquifer varies between 2 10 3 and 1 2 10 1 m s 1 and that the hydraulic conductivity is higher in the lower part of the aquifer than in the upper part brouyère 2001 wildemeersch et al 2014 transient flow conditions were imposed by pumping groundwater at different rates for 36 h in a pumping well located at 5 m from pz19 the pumping rate schema applied over time at the pumping well including phases with no pumping to approach ambient groundwater flow conditions is detailed in fig 3a table 1 presents experiment parameters for each fvpdm test jamin and brouyère 2018 applied the classical approach developed by brouyère et al 2008 assuming the perfect homogenization of the tracer to interpret the tracer concentration evolution measured in the bottom of each piezometer during the tracer injection concerning the fvpdm conducted in pz19 shallow a linear evolution of the measured groundwater flux with the pumping rate has been found which is logical and consistent the higher the pumping rate the higher the flux however for the fvpdm conducted in pz19 deep this linear relationship was not observed which was surprising to explain this the authors made the assumption that the mixing flow rate applied during the experiment conducted in pz19 deep could have been too low compared to the groundwater transit flow rate passing through the well screen indeed for pz19 shallow linear relation the maximum groundwater transit flow rate was estimated to be 5 26 10 6 m3 s 1 while for pz19 deep the maximum groundwater transit flow rate was estimated 70 times higher 3 80 10 4 m3 s 1 in both cases the recirculation flow rate applied was qrecirc 1 9 10 4 m3 s 1 which means that for pz19 deep the recirculation flow rate was much lower than the transit flow rate estimated thus a significant portion of the tracer mass is suspected to be preferentially carried out of the well and lost before reaching the mixing pump located in the bottom of the well meaning that the flow estimated in pz19 deep could be overestimated 2 2 2 application of the new discrete model and objectives we propose here to test the effect of the non perfect mixing on fvpdm results by reinterpreting the field measurements with the discrete model and to compare the associated results groundwater fluxes estimates with the one obtained using the classical solution firstly for pz19 shallow results of jamin and brouyère 2018 suggested a perfect homogenization of the tracer along the tested interval therefore groundwater fluxes estimates with the new discrete model obtained here are expected to be similar to the one obtained with the classical approach as proposed in jamin and brouyère 2018 studying this perfect mixing should allow validating the use of the discrete model as well as the associated inverse approach that allows finding the optimal value of groundwater flow accounting for the measured tracer concentration evolution secondly the assumption of non perfect mixing will be tested using the discrete model by simulating concentration profiles within the tested interval for pz19 deep by comparing groundwater fluxes estimates obtained with both the classical and the new discrete model we aim to assess the effect of the recirculation rate on tracer distribution within the well parameters used to implement the discrete model are similar as the one used in jamin and brouyère 2018 table 1 for pz19 shallow hw was discretized in 64 elementary cells δz 0 032 m with 29 cells in the screened interval for pz19 deep hw was discretized in 125 elementary cells δz 0 055 m with 33 cells in the screened interval for both cases δt was fixed at 0 1 s thus courant numbers were respectively 0 03 and 0 05 for pz19 shallow and pz19 deep ensuring the stability of computations the inverse approach previously described was applied to estimate groundwater fluxes from tracer concentration evolutions for both the new discrete fvpdm model and the classical model 2 3 sensitivity analysis in order to generalize the results obtained with the discrete model a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the effect of recirculation flow rate and of injection flow rate on results of fvpdm tests this aims to define limits of the method advantages of the discrete model and to address recommendations about the use of fvpdm in different flow conditions just as proposed by brouyère et al 2005 2008 sensitivity analysis was made using nondimensional variables for the sake of generality to do so concentration terms were normalized according to the concentration in the tracer fluid cinj while flow rate terms were normalized according to the critical injection rate qcr as a reminder qcr corresponds to the injection rate above which the transit flow rate qt is cancelled radially diverging flow prevails making the flow estimation impossible thus normalized tracer concentration in the well is c w c w c inj and normalized injection and recirculation rates are respectively q inj q inj q cr and q recirc q recirc q cr in the classical approach brouyère et al 2005 proposed to normalize time t using tw corresponding to the time needed to replace water in the tested interval vw at the critical injection rate qcr such approach requires assuming an instantaneous mixing of the tracer within the tested interval which is not applicable for the discrete model in which recirculation flow rate is considered and tracer repartition within the well modelled in this case normalizing time requires considering the solute transport in depth depending on qinj and qrecirc which can be expressed using a lag time parameter τ i z i π r w 2 q inj q recirc corresponding to the time required for the tracer to reach depth zi therefore time was normalized such as t i t τ i t wi where twi corresponds to the time needed to replace the water in each cell at the critical injection rate twi vwi qcr i 3 results 3 1 field application 3 1 1 reproduction of field data fig 3 presents the interpretation of the fvpdm tests performed by jamin and brouyère 2018 in the alluvial aquifer of the river meuse these results correspond to optimal values of groundwater fluxes estimated using the inverse approach either with the classical model or the discrete model figs 3b c and d focus on the experiment conducted in the piezometer pz19 shallow field data are very well reproduced with both models for all steps of pumping rates applied fig 3b likewise groundwater fluxes estimates are very similar with both models fig 3c d and the linear relationship between pumping rate and groundwater fluxes is verified with both models fig 3d and the consistency and similarity of results obtained with both models allow validating the discrete model figs 3e f and g focus on the experiment conducted in the piezometer pz19 deep figs 3e compares the tracer concentration evolution measured in the bottom of the well during the experiment blue line with modelled tracer concentration evolutions the yellow line being associated to the classical approach and the green line to the discrete model once again field data can be very well reproduced with both models with rmses between field data and modelled data of 0 29 ppb for both cases however contrary to results obtained for pz19 shallow groundwater fluxes estimated with the classical model are significantly different and systematically higher than groundwater fluxes estimated with the discrete model fig 3f using the classical approach apparent darcy fluxes are estimated between 5 98 10 4 and 4 5 10 3 m s 1 qt between 5 47 10 5 and 4 11 10 4 m3 s 1 whereas the discrete model estimates apparent darcy fluxes between 5 28 10 4 and 2 39 10 3 m s 1 qt between 4 83 10 5 and 2 19 10 4 m3 s 1 interestingly the higher the pumping rate and groundwater fluxes the higher the difference on the fluxes estimates when pumping at 50 m3 h 1 difference on fluxes estimates reaches 81 6 however the difference still remains important for lower fluxes since under ambient groundwater flow conditions phases with no pumping the difference on estimated fluxes is 24 fig 3g shows groundwater fluxes evolution with pumping obtained with each model while the classical model predicts an exponential relationship between calculated groundwater fluxes and pumping rates in accordance with results of jamin and brouyère 2018 the discrete model predicts a linear relationship between both results suggest that each 10 m3 h 1 increment at the pumping well corresponds to an increment of 3 06 10 4 m s 1 i e 26 5 m d 1 in the apparent groundwater flux measured in pz19 deep in pz19 shallow each 10 m3 h 1 increment at the pumping well is associated to an increment of 1 77 10 5 m s 1 i e 1 5 m d 1 in the apparent groundwater flux 3 1 2 simulation of tracer concentration profiles in order to better understand why the classical model can not be applied for the deeper piezometers the tracer concentration profiles at the end of the first stage of pumping are simulated using the discrete model fig 4a and c for both piezometers the shapes of concentration profiles with depth are similar with uniform concentrations in the tube and a concentration decrease with depth in the screened interval however the ratio rb t between the concentration at the bottom and the concentration at top of the screen is 0 98 for the shallow piezometer fig 4a while 0 37 for the deep piezometer fig 4c this means that the tracer gradient is 2 6 times more important in the deep piezometer than in the shallow one thus for pz19 shallow even if the tracer concentration is not strictly homogeneous in the screened interval the concentration difference between the top and the bottom of this interval is relatively low therefore tracer concentration evolutions are relatively similar all along the screen and both models discrete and classical predict similar tracer concentration evolutions over time fig 4c conversely for pz19 deep a significant difference of concentrations is observed between the top and the bottom of the screen blue lines fig 4d if the classical model is used in this case the tracer concentration measured at the bottom of the interval is reproduced yellow line which necessarily requires to consider a higher value of groundwater flow that is why in the case of non perfect mixing conditions the classical approach leads to overestimate the effective value of groundwater fluxes in addition both models show significant differences concerning tracer concentration evolutions before tracer concentration stabilizes transient stage a significant time lag is observed between the injection start and the start of concentration rise with the discrete model while the concentration instantaneously starts increasing with the classical approach then with the discrete model the tracer concentration increases stepwise blue lines show oscillations sequential plateaus at the beginning of the experiment due to the water reinjection on top of the well and to the non instantaneous homogenization of the tracer within the well 3 2 sensitivity analysis 3 2 1 non perfect mixing domain fig 5a shows the value of the ratio rb t ratio between the stabilized tracer concentration at the bottom of the tested interval and the stabilized tracer concentration on the top of the tested interval depending on q recirc and q inj this allows evaluating if concentrations are uniform along the screened interval according to flow conditions this plot is established using eq 9 and nondimensional variables so results are independent of the screened interval length fig 5b shows the difference between fluxes estimated using the classical model and fluxes estimates using the discrete model depending on flow and experimental conditions to obtain this plot concentrations profiles were first simulated for different values of q recirc and q inj using the discrete model then concentrations evolutions modelled at the bottom of the screened interval are interpreted using the classical model associated estimated values of groundwater fluxes are compared with effective values of groundwater fluxes this approach aims to define in which conditions the classical model is well suited to interpret field measurements as underlined in fig 5 results can be divided into two domains depending on the value of q recirc first for large values of q recirc 5 the difference of concentrations within the screened interval is 5 fig 5a meaning that the concentration can be considered uniform in the tested interval therefore data interpretation is similar regardless of the model applied discrete or classical with differences on groundwater fluxes estimates 3 5 fig 5b in this case results are similar for any value of q inj conversely for lower values of q recirc 5 concentrations can not be considered uniform along the tested interval and the lower the value of q recirc the more important the gradient of the concentration with depth fig 5a therefore the use of the classical model that only considers perfect mixing and homogenization of the tracer to interpret field measurements can induce significant discrepancies on groundwater fluxes estimates fig 5b the classical approach systematically overestimates groundwater fluxes with errors 50 as soon as q recirc 0 5 and errors 100 for q recirc 0 3 meaning that the estimated fluxes are at least twice more important than effective fluxes besides results show that for low values of q recirc the value of q inj has also significant effects on tracer distribution and thus on groundwater fluxes estimates thus errors on fluxes estimates are higher for lower values of q inj fig 5a also allows defining the limit of the fvpdm method indeed the limit of the method is reached as soon as the ratio rb t reaches 0 which means that the tracer never reaches the bottom of the well at least at a concentration which is below detection limit and data interpretation becomes impossible this limit is reached when q recirc 0 04 for q inj 0 01 or when q recirc 0 02 for q inj 0 05 note that when q inj 0 1 this limit is never reached meaning that the tracer systematically reaches the bottom of the screen in this case the injection flow rate is necessarily high enough to allow the tracer to reach the bottom even a small portion 3 2 2 tracer homogenization within the wellbore fig 6 shows the effect of the recirculation rate on tracer concentration evolutions at different depths in complement to fig 5 it allows visualizing the effect of q recirc and q inj on concentration profiles it clearly confirms that the higher the value of q recirc the better the tracer homogenization within the well thus for q recirc 20 tracer concentration evolutions are very similar regardless the depth considered with a ratio r b t of 0 985 and 0 988 for q inj 0 03 and 0 1 respectively fig 6c and f for lower values of q recirc the tracer concentration gradient in the well is way more important for instance the ratio r b t reaches 0 261 for q recirc 0 2 and q inj 0 03 and significant differences in tracer concentration evolutions are observed within the tested interval fig 6a note that the ratio r b t is systematically higher for q inj 0 03 than for q inj 0 1 in agreement with results presented in fig 5a this means that higher injection rates contribute to better mixing within the tested interval fig 6 also shows that results obtained with both approaches are similar for large values of q recirc for lower values of q recirc fig 6a b d and e the classical approach does not reflect the tracer concentration distribution but describes the average concentration indeed the stabilized concentration obtained with the classical model corresponds to the mean of stabilized concentrations obtained along the screened interval with the discrete approach 4 discussions results show that mixing within the tested interval depends on the recirculation flow rate compared to the groundwater flow rate crossing the well screens q recirc when q recirc 5 the recirculation flow can be considered high enough compared to groundwater fluxes to ensure the homogenization of the tracer within the tested interval in this case of perfect mixing conditions the concentration evolution measured in the bottom of the well can be interpreted either with the classical model developed by brouyère et al 2008 or with the discrete model presented here groundwater fluxes estimates will be similar with both models with differences on estimates 5 this was experimentally validated through fvpdm tests performed in the alluvial aquifer of the river meuse for the shallow piezometer pz19 shallow data interpretation with both models led to estimate qcr varying between 1 44 10 5 and 7 79 10 7 m3 s 1 meaning that the values of q recirc during the experiment varied between 13 2 and 244 note that since the classical model is easier to implement its use should be preferred in case of perfect mixing conditions conversely for non perfect mixing conditions q recirc 5 results demonstrate the importance of using the discrete fvpdm model introduced in this paper to interpret concentration evolution curves indeed the classical model may lead to high overestimates of groundwater fluxes as demonstrated with the interpretation of data collected in piezometer pz19 deep in this case the value of q recirc varies between 0 27 and 1 25 during the experiment such values suggest the recirculation flow rate is not high enough to ensure the homogenization of the tracer within the tested interval it leads to large errors on fluxes estimates while using the classical model between 14 and 82 in accordance with results presented in fig 5b whereas the classical model is only applicable when q recirc 5 the discrete model allows estimating fluxes even if experimental conditions are not ideal q recirc 5 in piezometer pz19 deep for instance considering the groundwater fluxes reached 2 26 10 4 m3 s 1 when pumping at 50 m3 h 1 the recirculation flow rate should have been around 128 l min 1 against 11 4 l min 1 to ensure the homogenization of the tracer and to make possible the use of the classical model which is hardly feasible in practice concerning the measurements made in piezometer pz19 deep groundwater flow estimates remain relatively high compared to the one obtained in piezometer pz19 shallow these results are in good agreement with the fact that higher values of hydraulic conductivities are found in the lower part of the aquifer wildemeersch et al 2014 however in case of very high groundwater flow non laminar flow could occur since the darcy s law is not applicable for non laminar flow fourar et al 2004 quinn et al 2011 this could explain why a non linear relationship has been initially found between the groundwater flux and the pumping rate however by considering the maximal groundwater flux estimated with the discrete model it can be assumed that the flow is laminar if the mean pore size diameter of the porous media is lower than 5 mm in this case the reynolds number is lower than 10 which ensures laminar flow bear 1972 the mean pore size diameter of the porous media has never been measured in the field but the lower part of aquifer consists of coarse gravels filled with sand and silt knowing that it is consistent to assume that the mean pore size diameter is lower than 5 mm moreover the fact that a linear relationship between the groundwater flux and the pumping rate with the improved model tends to confirm that laminar flow effectively occurs likewise the discrete model also allows modelling the time lag that can exists between the injection start and the concentration rise this time lag is not simulated with the classical approach since the mixing is assumed to be instantaneous in the tested interval for the classical model the time required to reach 99 of the stabilized concentration is estimated to be v w q inj q t in ln 0 01 which implies the concentration stabilization is reached simultaneously everywhere within the tested interval in case of non perfect mixing conditions the time required to reach 99 of the stabilized concentration is estimated to be v wi q inj i q t i in q recirc ln 0 01 from eq a 9 this involves that the time required to reach the steady state increases with depth which is perfectly consistent and that the higher the recirculation flow rate the shorter the stabilization time lastly this study also allows discussing the limits of fvpdm to investigate groundwater fluxes thus although the discrete model allows interpreting fvpdm tests while experimental conditions are not ideal q recirc 5 the limit of the method is reached for very low values of q recirc 0 4 for q inj 0 01 or 0 01 for q inj 0 05 in this case the recirculation flow rate is so weak compared to the groundwater flow rate that the tracer completely dissipates in the tested interval and the measured concentration at its bottom is zero fig 5 5 conclusion the discrete fvpdm model introduced in this paper allows assessing the vertical transport of the tracer along the well axis by explicitly considering the recirculation flow rate in the interpretation of fvpdm tests this study shows that when performing fvpdm in the field it is essential to accurately consider the value of the recirculation flow rate compared to the groundwater flow rate crossing the well screens neglecting the recirculation flow rate during field data interpretation can lead to significant overestimates of groundwater fluxes while the perfect repartition of the tracer is classically assumed when interpreting fvpdm it can be technically difficult to apply and maintain a mixing flow rate higher than groundwater transit flow rate without significantly perturbating the flow pattern around and within the tested well the discrete model introduced here allows interpreting fvpdm conducted in non perfect mixing conditions and thus increases the range of fluxes that can be investigated with fvpdm tests non perfect mixing conditions can be encountered in very permeable aquifer materials as highlighted in this paper but also when tests are performed in long screened wells moreover the discrete model can also be used to simulate vertical variations of groundwater flow or preferential horizontal flow paths since the groundwater flow value is set for each cell of the domain therefore the discrete model offers new perspectives for the characterization of groundwater flow including the possibility of investigating heterogeneous and fractures

1178,thermal enhanced soil vapour extraction t sve is a remedial technique involving gas aqueous solid and nonaqueous phases along with mass and heat transfer interphase mass transfer of contaminants and water evaporation condensation will cause the redistribution of phase saturation eventually affecting the performance of t sve in this study a multiphase multicompositional and nonisothermal model was developed to simulate the t sve treatment of contaminated soil the model was calibrated using published data from the sve laboratory and t sve field experiments the temporal and spatial distributions of the contaminant concentrations in the four different phases the mass transfer rates and the temperatures are presented to reveal the coupling interactions that occur between multiple fields during t sve a series of parametric studies were carried out to investigate the effect of water evaporation and adsorbed dissolved contaminants on the t sve performance it was found that endothermic evaporation exothermic condensation and the interaction between different removal paths of a contaminant played critical roles in the thermal enhancement of sve ignoring them can result in significant differences in the removal efficiency values keywords numerical model t sve interphase mass transfer water evaporation removal rate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil vapour extraction sve is the most widely used method to remediate unsaturated soil contaminated by volatile organic compounds vocs gierke et al 1992 falta 1996 sve involves gas migration and mass transfer among the nonaqueous phase liquid napl the aqueous phase the solid phase and the gas phase many theoretical models have been established in the past decades to study the sve mechanism initially the interphase mass transfer was assumed to be in equilibrium johnson et al 1990 poulsen et al 1996 huang and goltz 2000 however liang and udell 1999 and yoon et al 2002 found that the contaminant concentrations in the effluent gas streams predicted by equilibrium models were much larger than those measured in field projects some sve models yoon et al 2003 fen and chang 2007 nguyen et al 2013 esrael et al 2017 then considered nonequilibrium interphase mass transfer specifically the interphase mass transfer coefficient varies with time due to changes in the gas flow rate and saturation conditions rathfelder et al 1991 yoon et al 2002 esrael et al 2017 generally the numerical modeling of sve is relatively mature with all the key influence factors being considered but some assumptions of modeling are limited to ambient temperature conditions and cannot be applied to thermally enhanced conditions thermal enhancement can accelerate the removal of vocs and semi vocs using sve which is termed thermally enhanced sve t sve price et al 1999 park et al 2005 t sve has been studied by many researchers but most of the literature emphasizes the laboratory and filed experiments and lacks the study of mechanism during the removal process of contaminants poppendieck et al 1999 heron et al 2005 park et al 2005 hinchee et al 2018 numerical simulations can further reveal the mechanism of vocs removal during the t sve process and help optimize the design and operation parameters of the system many t sve numerical models have been established considering gas phase flow multicomponent mass transfer and heat transport lingineni and dhir 1992 kaluarachchi and islam 1995 jang and aral 2005 mohamed et al 2007 some researchers wang et al 2019 xu et al 2022 found the important role the phase transformation and transport of water vapour played in the t sve process however they ignored the interphase mass transfer of contaminants that are of equal importance moreover most of previous researchers class et al 2002 jang and aral 2005 have considered the influences of temperature on several parameters such as density viscosity vapour pressure and diffusion coefficient but neglected the effects on the other parameters such as the mass transfer coefficient henry s law constant organic matter content and organic carbon water partition coefficient overall gas aqueous phase flow water vapour migration mass transfer of contaminants among phases and heat transport together with temperature effect need to be deeply and comprehensively considered in the establishment of a t sve numerical model for the removal mechanism during t sve the variations of soil temperature napl saturation and contaminant removal rates with time distance have been widely studied in the previous literature class and helmig 2002 burris et al 2018 yu et al 2019 shi et al 2022 however the effects of temperature on the phase change and the mechanism of mass transfer in the contaminated soil have not been well described for example from ambient temperature to above 50 c water evaporation and napl volatilization become more intense resulting in a significant redistribution of the three phase system thus a good understanding of thermally enhanced phase change and its effect on the heat transfer and soil vapour extraction is of great importance to provide a rational theoretical basis for the design of the t sve system one objective of the study presented in this paper was to develop a t sve model using comsol multiphysics software involving gas aqueous transport multicomponent migration and heat transfer moreover the model comprehensively considered the influence of temperature on the phase change nonequilibrium mass transfer of contaminants among the solid nonaqueous aqueous and gas phases and various parameters another objective was to characterize the effects of water evaporation condensation and interphase mass transfer on the performance of t sve regarding to heat transfer and removal efficiency 2 mathematical model establishment based on the conservation of mass momentum and energy a multiphase multicompositional and non isothermal

and ρ g j kg m3 and j g j kg m2 s are the mass density and the diffusion flux of component j in the gas phase respectively taking the mass fraction ω g j as the independent variable and substituting eqs 2 3 4 6 7 10 and 11 into eq 21 yield the expanded form of the mass conservation equation for multiple components in the gas phase as 22 φ s g ρ g ω g j t φ s g ρ g d g j ω g j ω g j m g m g j ρ g

and gas aqueous mass transfer rates kg m3 s respectively 2 4 equations of energy conservation in the subsurface heat energy transfer occurs through convection conduction and heat sources sinks due to phase change during t sve thermal convection is mainly due to gas phase flow while heat conduction depends on the complex properties of multiple phases solid aqueous gas and napl assuming local thermal equilibrium between all phases the energy balance of the system can be expressed as kaluarachchi and islam 1995 nield 2017 25 ρ s c p eff t t ρ g c p g v g t k t eff t eq g l evap i ng l vol

conductivities of the mixed gas aqueous napl and solid phase in contaminated soil w m k respectively 2 5 complementary relationship soil temperature is related to many important parameters leading to a comprehensive effect of thermal enhancement on interphase mass transfer and water evaporation as shown in fig 2 temperature directly affects the gas dynamic viscosity which in turn affects the gas flow velocity and finally affects the aqueous gas and napl gas mass transfer rates therefore the influences of temperature on parameters such as henry s law constant diffusion coefficient gas dynamic viscosity saturated vapour pressure have been considered for modeling nonequilibrium interphase mass transfer is described by a first order kinetics expression rathfelder et al 2000 specifically nonequilibrium mass transfer rates among gas aqueous napl and solid phases are described as follows 28 i ng φ s g k ng c ge k c g k i wg φ s g k wg c w k m w k h k c g k 29 i nw φ s w k nw c ge k h k c w k m w k i ws k ws c w k m w k k d c s k ρ d where k αβ is the α β phase mass transfer coefficient 1 s c β k and c βe k are the actual concentration and equilibrium contaminant concentration of component k in phase β respectively and h k is the henry coefficient of component k called the gas aqueous partition coefficient which describes the distribution capacity of organic contaminants between the gas and aqueous phases k d is the distribution coefficient which represents the distribution ratio of organic contaminants between soil particles and aqueous phase ml g according to wilkins et al 1995 and yoon et al 2002 the napl gas phase mass transfer coefficient can be expressed as 30 k ng k ng 0 s n s n 0 b where s n0 is the initial napl saturation k ng0 is the initial mass transfer coefficient between napl and gas phase 1 s and b is the empirical parameter the mass transfer coefficient describing the movement of contaminants between aqueous phase and gas phase can be expressed as chao et al 1998 31 k wg 10 2 49 d g k 0 16 u g 0 84 d 50 0 55 h k 0 61 where d 50 is the mean particle size of the porous media cm u g is the pore velocity of the gas phase cm s and u g vg φs g the mass transfer between napl and aqueous phase has been studied mainly in groundwater flow wilson and geankoplis 1966 dwivedi and upadhyay 1977 kumar et al 1977 rather than in sve in that situation the napl aqueous phase mass transfer coefficient can be calculated as miller et al 1990 32 k nw sh d w k d 50 2 where sh is the sherwood number and its value is set to 2 bowman et al 1961 the mass transfer coefficient between aqueous phase and solid phase can be expressed as brusseau et al 1989 33 k ws 10 0 301 k d 0 668 the water evaporation source term in contaminated soil can be expressed as li et al 2018 34 eq g aφ s w s wr rt m w a rgw ρ ge v ρ g v where aφ s w s wr rt m w is the water vapour mass transfer coefficient 1 s a relates to the characteristic scale of porous media and vapour diffusion s m2 m w is the molar mass of water kg mol and a rgw is the relative gas water interfacial area when a rgw 1 the area of the gas water interface is equal to the surface area of the soil particles based on the water matric suction relationship peng and brusseau 2005 proposed the functional relationship between a rgw and water phase saturation s w and the functional coefficient was related to the soil uniformity coefficient c u d 60 d 10 as follows 35 a rgw 1 α gw s w s wr 1 2 m gw m gw when s w s wr s w s wr when s w s wr 36 m gw 1 53 0 098 c u c u 3 5 1 2 c u 3

finer than the d 60 size considering the influence of matric suction and temperature the equilibrium vapour concentration ρ ge v can be expressed by the kelvin formula kg m3 campbell 1985 as 38 ρ ge v ρ v sat exp p cgw m w ρ w rt the saturated vapour density ρ v sat is mainly affected by temperature which can be described by the empirical formula of tetens 1930 39 ρ v sat p v sat m w rt p v sat 611 10 7 5 t 273 15 t 35 85 where p v sat pa is the saturated vapour pressure affected by temperature 3 model verification 3 1 sve model verification boudouch et al 2016 conducted unidirectional sve tests using a 25 cm long by 8 cm diameter column to investigate the remediation of toluene contaminated sandy soil a vacuum pump equipped with a flow metre was connected to the bottom of the column to generate four airflow rates of 9 5 14 1 22 and 30 1 l min the toluene concentrations in the effluent gas stream were measured over 24 h the initial saturation of toluene was set as 0 15 and the top of the column was exposed to the atmosphere the model only involved darcy s flow gas component migration and napl gas interphase mass transfer a one dimensional degenerated numerical model was then established using comsol multiphysics 6 0 to verify the test with the related parameters summarized in table s1 with similar water retention characteristics the values reported by chen et al 2021 were used p d 4 kpa and λ 0 63 yoon et al 2002 found a relationship between the napl gas mass transfer coefficient k ng and napl saturation initially an atmospheric pressure with equilibrium concentrations of contaminant vapours was set within the soil at the top of the column the gas pressure was fixed by an atmospheric pressure with a fixed water vapour concentration compared with the gaseous contaminants in the soil column the gaseous contaminants in air were negligible i e zero contaminant vapour concentration in air at the bottom a fixed gas flux was established with zero diffusive flux for the water vapour and contaminant vapour thus the boundary conditions for this model can be expressed as 40 p g 1 atm w g k 0 w g v w air v at the top of the column v g q g a c j g j 0 at the bottom of the column where q g is the airflow rate given in the literature a c is the cross section area of the soil column w air v is the mass fraction of water vapour in air which can be expressed as 41 w air v x air v m w m wair x air v p v sat hr 1 atm m wair m a 1 x air v m w x air v where hr is the relative humidity of air and m a is the molar mass of air kg mol with an atmospheric pressure and an initial temperature of t 0 the initial conditions for the model can be described as 42 p g 1 atm s n 0 0 15 w g k w g 0 k w g v w g 0 v where w g0 k and w g0 v are the initial mass fractions of contaminant vapour and water vapour in the soil expressed as 43 w g 0 k x g 0 k m n m g 0 w g 0 v x g 0 v m w m g 0 the initial molar mass of the mixed gas phase can be expressed as 44 m g 0 1 x g 0 k x g 0 v m air x g 0 k m n x g 0 v m w x g 0 k p gc sat t t 0 1 atm x g 0 k p ge v t t 0 1 atm for the numerical calculation the maximum mesh size of 25 cm long soil column was set as 0 5 mm and the bottom boundary was refined using a maximum mesh size of 10 4 mm with appropriate values of k ng0 and b the modelled contaminant concentrations in the effluent gas showed a consistent variation tendency with the experimental data for different flow rates fig 3 in this case the difference between calculated and measured mass concentration values can be observed in the early stage especially for the low flow rate the reason may be that napl is distributed unevenly along depth due to gravity therefore the calculated mass concentration values were slightly higher than the measured values in the early stage and rapidly decreased the value of k ng0 increased from 0 25 s 1 to 1 8 s 1 as the airflow rate increased from 9 5 l min to 30 1 l min and from 0 3 s 1 to 1 1 s for airflow rates of 14 1 and 22 l min respectively therefore the relationship between k ng0 and the air flow rate was fitted and calibrated by numerical calculation as 45 k ng 0 150 v g 1 5 the empirical parameter b represents the decreasing napl gas mass transfer with a reduction in napl saturation through the use of eq 45 a large number of calculations and the verification of experimental results it is verified that the value of b increased slightly with increasing air velocity in order to simplify the calculation the empirical parameter b was set as 1 7 in this model 3 2 t sve model verification hinchee et al 2018 conducted a field experiment of 1 4 dioxane soil remediation using t sve the system was configured with four injection wells at the corners surrounding a 6 1 m long 6 1 m wide and 9 1 m deep treatment zone and a central extraction well the soil temperature in the inner ring close to the extraction well and outer ring close to the injection wells 1 4 dioxane removal results were measured over 400 days the initial 1 4 dioxane concentration of 20 mg kg the soil porosity of 0 4 and an initial water content of 0 15 were selected with other parameter values listed in table s2 it is worth noting that 1 4 dioxane is totally miscible in water so only dissolved and vaporized contaminants were considered in this verification following geometric symmetry the shaded region as shown in fig 5 a was used for modeling then a two dimensional numerical model is established to verify the field experiment according to the characteristics of silty sand and sandy silt in the treated zone the parameters of water retention curve were selected as p d 9 346 kpa and λ 1 145 which derived from the data fitting reported by zhao et al 2015 atmospheric pressure is applied at the injection well with a heating temperature of t heat 393 15 k 120 c and a flow rate of q g 2 5 m3 min at the extraction well all the symmetry planes are set as a zero flux boundary thus the boundary conditions are expressed as 46 p g 1 atm n ρ w v w 0 w g k 0 w g v w air v n j w k 0 t t heat at injection thermal screens v g q g a c p w p g p cgw t 0 n ρ g d g j w g j 0 n j w k 0 n q q 0 at extraction screens n ρ g v g 0 n ρ w v w 0 n j g j 0 n j w k 0 n q 0 at symmetry plane where w air v is calculated using eq 41 q denotes the heat flux and q 0 represents a heat flux that enters the domain 47 q 0 t 0 t k g where k g is the heat transfer coefficient of the gas phase w m2 k with an atmospheric pressure an initial water phase saturation of s w0 0 6375 and an initial temperature of t 0 293 15 k 20 c the initial conditions for the t sve model can be described as 48 p g 0 1 atm p w 0 p g 0 p cgw t 0 s w s w 0 s g s g 0 t t 0 w g k 0 w g v w g 0 v c w 0 k 20 mg kg ρ φ s w 0 m w k for deep contaminated soil the experiment results of the lower treatment zone were verified the 1 4 dioxane removal results and soil temperature of outer and inner rings computed by the proposed model agree well with those measured by hinchee et al 2018 fig 4 the difference is mainly due to the complexity of soil heterogeneity in practice thus the correctness of the proposed model has been proved to some extent see figure 4 4 model application to reveal the interactions between seepage field and temperature field the distribution characteristics of darcy velocity multiphase contaminant concentration and interphase mass transfer rate under t sve conditions are presented the effect of water evaporation and interphase mass transfer on the t sve performance were analysed 4 1 geometry initial and boundary conditions thermal sve is generally applied to remediate deep contaminated soil below 1 m using extraction wells and injection wells also functioning as thermal wells stegemeier and vinegar 2001 these wells with a radius of r w are arranged in a square with a horizontal distance of l between injection wells and extraction wells as presented in fig 5 a following the symmetry principle a right angled triangle between two adjacent injection wells shown in shadow was selected for modeling in this study for deep contaminated soils horizontal gas streamlines fig 5 c can be observed in the interlayers where well screens were open however in the overlying and underlying uncontaminated areas vaporized contaminants have long migration paths and low flow velocity therefore the contaminants are mainly removed in the plane where the well screens are located ignoring the effect of adjacent uncontaminated areas on the sve performance this problem can be simplified into a two dimensional planar model i e the shaded region in fig 5 a the boundary conditions are shown in fig 5 b the well screens are open at the depth of the contaminated area to allow vapour extraction atmospheric pressure is applied at the injection well screens with a heating temperature of t heat and a vacuum pressure of p e at the extraction well screens all the symmetry planes are set as a zero flux boundary thus the boundary conditions are expressed as 49 p g 1 atm n ρ w v w 0 w g k 0 w g v w air v n j w k 0 t t heat at injection thermal screens p g p e n ρ w v w 0 n ρ g d g j w g j 0 n j w k 0 n q q 0 at extraction screens n ρ g v g 0 n ρ w v w 0 n j g j 0 n j w k 0 n q 0 at symmetry plane the initial saturations of napl and water were assumed to be s n0 0 03 and s w0 0 5 respectively with an atmospheric pressure and an initial temperature of t 0 293 15 k 20 c the equilibrium concentrations of contaminant in the gas aqueous and solid phases were also assumed at t 0 then the initial condition can be denoted as 50 p g 0 1 atm p w 0 p g 0 p cgw t 0 s w s w 0 s n s n 0 t t 0 w g k w g 0 k w g v w g 0 v c w 0 k p gc sat t t 0 rt 0 h k t t 0 c s 0 k c w 0 k m w k k d t t 0 in the following a well radius of r w 0 3 m a horizontal well spacing of l 6 m between the injection wells and the extraction wells and a heating temperature of t heat 353 15 k 80 c were assumed unless otherwise stated toluene with low solubility was adopted as the target contaminant in the following the numerical model was established and solved using comsol multiphysics 6 0 with the related parameters listed in table s3 4 2 contaminant mass and heat transfer during t sve with an injection pressure of 0 kpa and an extraction pressure of 10 kpa relative to the atmospheric pressure all the streamlines begin at the injection wells and end at the extraction wells fig 6 the gas flow velocity around the well screens e g 0 5 cm s was much larger than that in other regions e g 0 02 cm s in the middle area between two adjacent injection wells vaporized contaminants have long migration paths and low flow velocity which means it is harder to be extracted moreover the overall gas flow velocity at the later stage of extraction slightly decreases compared with the initial stage due to the increase of gas dynamic viscosity with temperature after continuous extraction for 72 h all the napl was removed within a 1 5 m radius around the injection well s n approaches zero as shown in blue while most of the rest of the domain almost remained initial napl saturation as shown in red in fig 7 a there were transition areas shown in green and yellow between the remediated area and unremediated area indicating a napl saturation gradient at the 168th hour the transition area expanded to approximately 2 5 m away from the injection well with the shape changing from an injection facing arc to an approximately straight line fig 7 b this was because the remediation performance between the injection wells and the adjacent extraction wells was better than that between the adjacent injection wells due to a shorter gas migration path and a larger gas velocity moreover the spatial distributions of the contaminant concentrations in the gas aqueous and solid phases c g c w and c s respectively were similar to that of s n however the removal fronts of c w and c s were slightly closer to the injection wells than those of c g and s n which depend on the mass transfer coefficients indicating quicker removal of the contaminant in the gaseous and nonaqueous phases basically the sve method removes the gaseous contaminant in soil pores c g which is supplied by the contaminants in the nonaqueous phase and aqueous phase s n and c w through k ng and k wg respectively c w is resupplied by the contaminants in the nonaqueous phase and solid phase s n and c s through k nw and k sw respectively thus contaminant removal during sve can be classified into two paths 1 from s n to c g and 2 from s n and c s to c w and then to c g as shown in fig 7 the napl gas solid aqueous and aqueous gas mass transfer rates respectively i ng i sw and i wg increased with the distance away from the injection well to peaks in red and then decreased to small values close to zero in contrast the napl aqueous mass transfer rate i nw had a rapid increase at the removal front and gradually decreased to a small value the peak and range of i nw were much smaller than those of i ng i sw and i wg and i ng was first among them all the mass transfer rates decreased over time as shown in fig 7 a and b thus it can be concluded that napl gas mass transfer was the dominant mechanism of removal followed by mass transfer from the solid phase to the aqueous phase and then to the gaseous phase for the vocs with low solubility soil temperature has an influence on many parameters during t sve as shown in fig 2 as a result of the phase change caused by heating and extraction the gas saturation s g slightly decreased with increasing distance from the injection well fig 8 a dramatic decrease in s g around the extraction well can be observed which was caused by the redistribution of soil moisture with increasing distance the napl gas mass transfer coefficient k ng had a significant increase due to the increase in napl saturation s n however the difference between the equilibrium concentration and actual concentration of the gaseous contaminant c ge c g significantly decreases due to a decrease in c ge with decreasing temperature t and an increase in c g thus the variation in the napl gas mass transfer rate i ng φs g k ng c ge c g was mainly due to a balance between the increasing k ng and decreasing c ge c g for the solid aqueous mass transfer rate i sw k sw ρ d c s k d c w m w k its variation with the distance away from the injection well was mainly due to a balance between the increases in both the adsorbed concentration c s and dissolved concentration k d c w m w n where the partition coefficient k d increased with decreasing t by increasing the organic carbon content f oc the decreasing solid aqueous mass transfer coefficient k sw was less significant similarly the variation in the aqueous gas mass transfer rate i wg φs g k wg c w hm w k c g was mainly due to a balance between the increasing c w and the decreasing henry constant h with decreasing t along the distance from the injection heating well the variation in the temperature can be divided into four zones the boundary lowering zone stable heating zone front lowering zone and initial temperature zone fig 9 the boundary lowering zone was within several centimetre around the heating well where the temperature rapidly dropped from the heating temperature of 80 c to 59 c at t 24 h this was because the vapour concentration around the well was significantly lower than the saturated vapour concentration at the heating temperature resulting in significant heat adsorption and soil moisture evaporation fig 10 b as the temperature decreased the saturated vapour concentration dropped accordingly and together with the increasing vapour concentration the heat transfer in the soil and moisture evaporation remained balanced in the stable heating zone in the front lowering zone the temperature gradually decreased to a minimum value of 19 c and then rose to the initial temperature of 20 c the minimum temperature was due to the heat adsorption caused by napl volatilization fig 10 b napl volatilization still occurred in the initial temperature zone which led to a slight decrease in the temperature additionally continuous heating expanded the range of the stable heating zone over time while continuous napl volatilization decreased the soil temperature in the initial temperature zone continuous heating and extraction also cause the redistribution of soil moisture fig 10 a at t 24 h the water saturation s w decreased from the initial value of 0 5 to 0 42 around the injection heating well but it significantly increased to 0 85 around the extraction well this was because the water vapour evaporated from the heated soil migrated to the extraction well and condensed more water condensation occurred around the extraction well due to the lower saturated vapour concentration at the larger vacuum pressure generally the soil moisture in the entire region decreased over time at t 336 h s w around the heating well decreased to 0 33 but this value was larger than the expected value this was due to the supply of liquid water through advection from the extraction well to the injection well see the streamline in fig 10 a 4 3 effect of water evaporation and adsorbed dissolved contaminant to reveal the effect of interphase mass transfer on the t sve performance the proposed model case 1 was degenerated into four cases neglecting water evaporation condensation eq g case 2 neglecting the adsorbed dissolved contaminant i sw i wg and i nw case 3 neglecting thermal enhancement applied at the heating well i e t heat t 0 case 4 and neglecting the effect of gas velocity on the initial napl gas mass transfer coefficient i e k ng0 150 average v g 1 5 by using the average v g 8 18 10 4 m s case 5 the other parameters were unchanged in case 2 without water evaporation the boundary lowering zone that had been observed in case 1 disappeared with a gradual decrease in temperature from t heat to t 0 with the distance from the heating well fig 11 the heating zone in case 2 was significantly narrower than that seen in case 1 which indicates that the endothermic evaporation and exothermic condensation accompanying vapour migration played an important role in the influence distance of thermal enhancement in case 4 without thermal enhancement continuous vapour extraction caused a 10 c decrease in temperature around the injection well due to the heat adsorption caused by water evaporation and condensation moreover the temperature distributions of cases 3 and 5 were similar to that of case 1 with a slight difference shown in the enlarged figure when i sw i wg and i nw were neglected case 3 more mass transfer occurred between the nonaqueous and gaseous phases together with more heat release resulting in a slightly lower temperature than that of case 1 using an average value of k ng0 over the entire region as adopted in case 5 led to lower temperature in the middle of the contaminated region relative to the smaller k ng0 used in case 1 due to the smaller vg and higher temperature around the extraction well relative to the larger k ng0 used in case 1 due to larger vg thus it is important to consider the evaporation and condensation of soil moisture during t sve neglecting the phenomenon will result in an overestimation the soil temperature around the heating well but significantly underestimate the range of the heating zone due to the narrower range of the heating zone in case 2 much shorter removal fronts of napl and gaseous contaminant from the injection heating well were observed compared to case 1 s n and c g in fig 12 a and b case 4 with t heat t 0 had an even shorter removal front than case 2 due to the lower temperature around the injection well to characterize the remediation efficiency the removal rate γ t is defined as 51 γ t 1 c tot t c tot 0 100 where c tot t represents the total concentration at time t kg m3 and c tot 0 is the initial total concentration kg m3 as shown in fig 13 the removal rates of cases 2 and 4 were close and both were smaller than that of case 1 by approximately 10 which indicates the critical role the endothermic evaporation and exothermic condensation play in the thermal enhancement to sve for case 3 without i sw i wg and i nw there were still some nonaqueous contaminants s n in the range of 0 75 1 75 m from the heating well fig 12 a however the gaseous contaminant concentrations c g of cases 1 and 3 in this range were the same fig 12 b but were supplied in different ways i e from the aqueous phase through i wg and the nonaqueous phase through i ng moreover case 3 had a smaller peak napl saturation beyond the removal front than case 1 fig 12 a which might have been due to the competition between the from s n to c g removal path path 1 and the from s n and c s to c w and then to c g removal path path 2 specifically the mass transfer between the napl and aqueous phases was slower than that between the napl and gas phases larger concentrations of gaseous contaminants in case 1 were due to the fact that the supply following both paths 1 and 2 may in turn inhibit the napl gas mass transfer i e smaller c ge c g eventually the contaminant removal in case 3 was more effective than that of case 1 and the maximum difference in removal rate occurred in the intermediate stage and exceeded 10 fig 13 additionally case 5 with a constant value of k ng0 had larger values of s n than case 1 around the extraction well fig 12 a this was because case 5 neglected the amplification of the gas velocity around the extraction well as shown in fig 6 and hence the napl gas mass transfer rate was significantly underestimated together with smaller values of s n immediately beyond the removal front the removal efficiency of case 5 was close to that of case1 with a maximum difference of less than 2 fig 13 thus neglecting the effect of gas velocity on k ng0 by averaging mainly affected the spatial distribution of the contaminants rather than the removal rate 5 conclusions this study established a t sve model that incorporates gas aqueous flow water vapour migration mass transfer of contaminants among phases and heat transfer together with temperature effect the model was applied to reveal the mechanism of mass and heat transfer during t sve and analyze the effects of water evaporation and adsorbed dissolved contaminants the main conclusions drawn are as follows 1 for the vocs with low solubility such as toluene napl gas mass transfer is the dominant removal mechanism followed by mass transfer from the solid phase to the aqueous phase and then to the gaseous phase 2 affected by napl volatilization and water evaporation condensation in the soil the heat energy transfer was divided into four zones as the distance from the injection heating well increased namely the boundary lowering zone stable heating zone front lowering zone and initial temperature zone 3 endothermic evaporation and exothermic condensation play a critical role in the thermal enhancement of sve ignoring them will overestimate the soil temperature around the heating well but significantly underestimate the size of the heating zone and the removal rate of contaminants 4 for the vocs with low solubility such as toluene ignoring the removal path of contaminants from the nonaqueous and solid phases to the aqueous phase and then to the gas phase will result in a significant overestimation of the t sve removal efficiency especially in the intermediate stage of remediation this might be due to competition with another removal path of contaminants from the nonaqueous phase to the gas phase credit authorship contribution statement qi teng zheng

1178,thermal enhanced soil vapour extraction t sve is a remedial technique involving gas aqueous solid and nonaqueous phases along with mass and heat transfer interphase mass transfer of contaminants and water evaporation condensation will cause the redistribution of phase saturation eventually affecting the performance of t sve in this study a multiphase multicompositional and nonisothermal model was developed to simulate the t sve treatment of contaminated soil the model was calibrated using published data from the sve laboratory and t sve field experiments the temporal and spatial distributions of the contaminant concentrations in the four different phases the mass transfer rates and the temperatures are presented to reveal the coupling interactions that occur between multiple fields during t sve a series of parametric studies were carried out to investigate the effect of water evaporation and adsorbed dissolved contaminants on the t sve performance it was found that endothermic evaporation exothermic condensation and the interaction between different removal paths of a contaminant played critical roles in the thermal enhancement of sve ignoring them can result in significant differences in the removal efficiency values keywords numerical model t sve interphase mass transfer water evaporation removal rate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil vapour extraction sve is the most widely used method to remediate unsaturated soil contaminated by volatile organic compounds vocs gierke et al 1992 falta 1996 sve involves gas migration and mass transfer among the nonaqueous phase liquid napl the aqueous phase the solid phase and the gas phase many theoretical models have been established in the past decades to study the sve mechanism initially the interphase mass transfer was assumed to be in equilibrium johnson et al 1990 poulsen et al 1996 huang and goltz 2000 however liang and udell 1999 and yoon et al 2002 found that the contaminant concentrations in the effluent gas streams predicted by equilibrium models were much larger than those measured in field projects some sve models yoon et al 2003 fen and chang 2007 nguyen et al 2013 esrael et al 2017 then considered nonequilibrium interphase mass transfer specifically the interphase mass transfer coefficient varies with time due to changes in the gas flow rate and saturation conditions rathfelder et al 1991 yoon et al 2002 esrael et al 2017 generally the numerical modeling of sve is relatively mature with all the key influence factors being considered but some assumptions of modeling are limited to ambient temperature conditions and cannot be applied to thermally enhanced conditions thermal enhancement can accelerate the removal of vocs and semi vocs using sve which is termed thermally enhanced sve t sve price et al 1999 park et al 2005 t sve has been studied by many researchers but most of the literature emphasizes the laboratory and filed experiments and lacks the study of mechanism during the removal process of contaminants poppendieck et al 1999 heron et al 2005 park et al 2005 hinchee et al 2018 numerical simulations can further reveal the mechanism of vocs removal during the t sve process and help optimize the design and operation parameters of the system many t sve numerical models have been established considering gas phase flow multicomponent mass transfer and heat transport lingineni and dhir 1992 kaluarachchi and islam 1995 jang and aral 2005 mohamed et al 2007 some researchers wang et al 2019 xu et al 2022 found the important role the phase transformation and transport of water vapour played in the t sve process however they ignored the interphase mass transfer of contaminants that are of equal importance moreover most of previous researchers class et al 2002 jang and aral 2005 have considered the influences of temperature on several parameters such as density viscosity vapour pressure and diffusion coefficient but neglected the effects on the other parameters such as the mass transfer coefficient henry s law constant organic matter content and organic carbon water partition coefficient overall gas aqueous phase flow water vapour migration mass transfer of contaminants among phases and heat transport together with temperature effect need to be deeply and comprehensively considered in the establishment of a t sve numerical model for the removal mechanism during t sve the variations of soil temperature napl saturation and contaminant removal rates with time distance have been widely studied in the previous literature class and helmig 2002 burris et al 2018 yu et al 2019 shi et al 2022 however the effects of temperature on the phase change and the mechanism of mass transfer in the contaminated soil have not been well described for example from ambient temperature to above 50 c water evaporation and napl volatilization become more intense resulting in a significant redistribution of the three phase system thus a good understanding of thermally enhanced phase change and its effect on the heat transfer and soil vapour extraction is of great importance to provide a rational theoretical basis for the design of the t sve system one objective of the study presented in this paper was to develop a t sve model using comsol multiphysics software involving gas aqueous transport multicomponent migration and heat transfer moreover the model comprehensively considered the influence of temperature on the phase change nonequilibrium mass transfer of contaminants among the solid nonaqueous aqueous and gas phases and various parameters another objective was to characterize the effects of water evaporation condensation and interphase mass transfer on the performance of t sve regarding to heat transfer and removal efficiency 2 mathematical model establishment based on the conservation of mass momentum and energy a multiphase multicompositional and non isothermal model was developed to simulate t sve the model involves several governing equations coupled with each other in terms of prime variables 2 1 assumptions and system parameters the t sve coupled mathematical model of contaminated soil is based on the continuum theory of porous media as shown in fig 1 a typical representative element volume rev was given to develop the model the assumptions were adopted in the formulation of the model the heterogeneity of contaminated soil and the mechanical deformation of the solid matrix were neglected the transport of both the gas and aqueous phases

covered by a layer of water film and the mass transfer processes between napl and solid phases and between gas and solid phases were ignored silka 1988 as the immobile napl volatilizes into the gas phase or dissolves into the aqueous phase the napl saturation changes can be expressed using the first order relationships as follows 19 ρ n φ s n t i gn i wn where i gn and i wn represent the gas napl phase and aqueous napl phase mass transfer rates kg m3 s respectively sorption of dissolved contaminants on soil particles retards the transport of contaminants and the sorption capacity depends

and gas aqueous mass transfer rates kg m3 s respectively 2 4 equations of energy conservation in the subsurface heat energy transfer occurs through convection conduction and heat sources sinks due to phase change during t sve thermal convection is mainly due to gas phase flow while heat conduction depends on the complex properties of multiple phases solid aqueous gas and napl assuming local thermal equilibrium between all phases the energy balance of the system can be expressed as kaluarachchi and islam 1995 nield 2017 25 ρ s c p eff t t ρ g c p g v g t k t eff t eq g l evap i ng l vol

conductivities of the mixed gas aqueous napl and solid phase in contaminated soil w m k respectively 2 5 complementary relationship soil temperature is related to many important parameters leading to a comprehensive effect of thermal enhancement on interphase mass transfer and water evaporation as shown in fig 2 temperature directly affects the gas dynamic viscosity which in turn affects the gas flow velocity and finally affects the aqueous gas and napl gas mass transfer rates therefore the influences of temperature on parameters such as henry s law constant diffusion coefficient gas dynamic viscosity saturated vapour pressure have been considered for modeling nonequilibrium interphase mass transfer is described by a first order kinetics expression rathfelder et al 2000 specifically nonequilibrium mass transfer rates among gas aqueous napl and solid phases are described as follows 28 i ng φ s g k ng c ge k c g k i wg φ s g k wg c w k m w k h k c g k 29 i nw φ s w k nw c ge k h k

component k in phase β respectively and h k is the henry coefficient of component k called the gas aqueous partition coefficient which describes the distribution capacity of organic contaminants between the gas and aqueous phases k d is the distribution coefficient which represents the distribution ratio of organic contaminants between soil particles and aqueous phase ml g according to wilkins et al 1995 and yoon et al 2002 the napl gas phase mass transfer coefficient can be expressed as 30 k ng k ng 0 s n s n 0 b where s n0 is the initial napl saturation k ng0 is the initial mass transfer coefficient between napl and gas phase 1 s and b is the empirical parameter the mass transfer coefficient describing the movement of contaminants between aqueous phase and gas phase can be expressed as chao et al 1998 31 k wg 10 2 49 d g k 0 16 u g 0 84 d 50 0 55 h k 0 61 where d 50 is the mean particle size of the porous media cm u g is the pore velocity of the gas phase cm s and u g vg φs g the mass transfer between napl and aqueous phase has been studied mainly in groundwater flow wilson and geankoplis 1966 dwivedi and upadhyay 1977 kumar et al 1977 rather than in sve in that situation the napl aqueous phase mass transfer coefficient can be calculated as miller et al 1990 32 k nw sh d w k d 50 2 where sh is the sherwood number and its value is set to 2 bowman et al 1961 the mass transfer coefficient between aqueous phase and solid phase can be expressed as brusseau et al 1989 33 k ws 10 0 301 k d 0 668 the water evaporation source term in contaminated soil can be expressed as li et al 2018 34 eq g aφ s w s wr rt m w a rgw ρ ge v ρ g v where aφ s w s wr rt m w is the water vapour mass transfer coefficient 1 s a relates to the characteristic scale of porous

of the soil particles based on the water matric suction relationship peng and brusseau 2005 proposed the functional relationship between a rgw and water phase saturation s w and the functional

finer than the d 60 size considering the influence of matric suction and temperature the equilibrium vapour concentration ρ ge v can be expressed by the kelvin formula kg m3 campbell 1985 as 38 ρ ge v ρ v sat exp p cgw m w ρ w rt the saturated vapour density ρ v sat is mainly affected by temperature which can be described by the empirical formula of tetens 1930 39 ρ v sat p v sat m w rt p v sat 611 10 7 5 t 273 15 t 35 85 where p v sat pa is the saturated vapour pressure affected by temperature 3 model verification 3 1 sve model verification boudouch et al 2016 conducted unidirectional sve tests using a 25 cm long by 8 cm diameter column to investigate the remediation of toluene contaminated sandy soil a vacuum pump equipped with a flow metre was connected to the bottom of the column to generate four airflow rates of 9 5 14 1 22 and 30 1 l min the toluene concentrations in the effluent gas stream were measured over 24 h the initial saturation of toluene was set as 0 15 and the top of the column was exposed to the atmosphere the model only involved darcy s flow gas component migration and napl gas interphase mass transfer a one dimensional degenerated numerical model was then established using comsol multiphysics 6 0 to verify the test with the related parameters summarized in table s1 with similar water retention characteristics the values reported by chen et al 2021 were used p d 4 kpa and λ 0 63 yoon et al 2002 found a relationship between the napl gas mass transfer coefficient k ng and napl saturation initially an atmospheric pressure with equilibrium concentrations of contaminant vapours was set within the soil at the top of the column the gas pressure was fixed by an atmospheric pressure with a fixed water vapour concentration compared with the gaseous contaminants in the soil column the gaseous contaminants in air were negligible i e zero contaminant vapour concentration in air at the bottom a fixed gas flux was established with zero diffusive flux for the water vapour and contaminant vapour thus the boundary conditions for this model can be expressed as 40 p g 1 atm w g k 0 w g v w air v at the top of the column v g q g a c j g j 0 at the bottom of the column where q g is the airflow rate given in the literature a c is the cross section area of the soil column w air v is the mass fraction of water vapour in air which can be expressed as 41 w air v x air v m w m wair x air v p v sat hr 1 atm m wair m a 1 x air v m w x air v where hr is the relative humidity of air and m a is the molar mass of air kg mol with an atmospheric pressure and an initial temperature of t 0 the initial conditions for the model can be described as 42 p g 1 atm s n 0 0 15 w g k w g 0 k w g v w g 0 v where w g0 k and w g0 v are the initial mass fractions of contaminant vapour and water vapour in the soil expressed as 43 w g 0 k x g 0 k m n m g 0 w g 0 v x g 0 v m w m g 0 the initial molar mass of the mixed gas phase can be expressed as 44 m g 0 1 x g 0 k x g 0 v m air x g 0 k m n x g 0 v m w x g 0 k p gc sat t t 0 1 atm x g 0 k p ge v t t 0 1 atm for the numerical calculation the maximum mesh size of 25 cm long soil column was set as 0 5 mm and the bottom boundary was refined using a maximum mesh size of 10 4 mm with appropriate values of k ng0 and b the modelled contaminant concentrations in the effluent gas showed a consistent variation tendency with the experimental data for different flow rates fig 3 in this case the difference between calculated and measured mass concentration values can be observed in the early stage especially for the low flow rate the reason may be that napl is distributed unevenly along depth due to gravity therefore the calculated mass concentration values were slightly higher than the measured values in the early stage and rapidly decreased the value of k ng0 increased from 0 25 s 1 to 1 8 s 1 as the airflow rate increased from 9 5 l min to 30 1 l min and from 0 3 s 1 to 1 1 s for airflow rates of 14 1 and 22 l min respectively therefore the relationship between k ng0 and the air flow rate was fitted and calibrated by numerical calculation as 45 k ng 0 150 v g 1 5 the empirical parameter b represents the decreasing napl gas mass transfer with a reduction in napl saturation through the use of eq 45 a large number of calculations and the verification of experimental results it is verified that the value of b increased slightly with increasing air velocity in order to simplify the calculation the empirical parameter b was set as 1 7 in this model 3 2 t sve model verification hinchee et al 2018 conducted a field experiment of 1 4 dioxane soil remediation using t sve the system was configured with four injection wells at the corners surrounding a 6 1 m long 6 1 m wide and 9 1 m deep treatment zone and a central extraction well the soil temperature in the inner ring close to the extraction well and outer ring close to the injection wells 1 4 dioxane removal results were measured over 400 days the initial 1 4 dioxane concentration of 20 mg kg the soil porosity of 0 4 and an initial water content of 0 15 were selected with other parameter values listed in table s2 it is worth noting that 1 4 dioxane is totally miscible in water so only dissolved and vaporized contaminants were considered in this verification following geometric symmetry the shaded region as shown in fig 5 a was used for modeling then a two dimensional numerical model is established to verify the field experiment according to the characteristics of silty sand and sandy silt in the treated zone the parameters of water retention curve were selected as p d 9 346 kpa and λ 1 145 which derived from the data fitting reported by zhao et al 2015 atmospheric pressure is applied at the injection well with a heating temperature of t heat 393 15 k 120 c and a flow rate of q g 2 5 m3 min at the extraction well all the symmetry planes are set as a zero flux boundary thus the boundary conditions are expressed as 46 p g 1 atm n ρ w v w 0 w g k 0 w g v w air v n j w k 0 t t heat at injection thermal screens v g q g a c p w p g p cgw t 0 n ρ g d g j w g j 0 n j w k 0 n q q 0 at extraction screens n

where k g is the heat transfer coefficient of the gas phase w m2 k with an atmospheric pressure an initial water phase saturation of s w0 0 6375 and an initial temperature of t 0 293 15 k 20 c the initial conditions for the t sve model can be described as 48 p g 0 1 atm p w 0 p g 0 p cgw t 0 s w s w 0 s g s g 0 t t 0 w g k 0 w g v w g 0 v c w 0 k 20 mg kg ρ φ s w 0 m w k for deep contaminated soil the experiment results of the lower treatment zone were verified the 1 4 dioxane removal results and soil temperature of outer and inner rings computed by the proposed model agree well with those measured by hinchee et al 2018 fig 4 the difference is mainly due to the complexity of soil heterogeneity in practice thus the correctness of the proposed model has been proved to some extent see figure 4 4 model application to reveal the interactions between seepage field and temperature field the distribution characteristics of darcy velocity multiphase contaminant concentration and interphase mass transfer rate under t sve conditions are presented the effect of water evaporation and interphase mass transfer on the t sve performance were analysed 4 1 geometry initial and boundary conditions thermal sve is generally applied to remediate deep contaminated soil below 1 m using extraction wells and injection wells also functioning as thermal wells stegemeier and vinegar 2001 these wells with a radius of r w are arranged in a square with a horizontal distance of l between injection wells and extraction wells as presented in fig 5 a following the symmetry principle a right angled triangle between two adjacent injection wells shown in shadow was selected for modeling in this study for deep contaminated soils horizontal gas streamlines fig 5 c can be observed in the interlayers where well screens were open however in the overlying and underlying uncontaminated areas vaporized contaminants have long migration paths and low flow velocity therefore the contaminants are mainly removed in the plane where the well screens are located ignoring the effect of adjacent uncontaminated areas on the sve performance this problem can be simplified into a two dimensional planar model i e the shaded region in fig 5 a the boundary conditions are shown in fig 5 b the well screens are open at the depth of the contaminated area to allow vapour extraction atmospheric pressure is applied at the injection well screens with a heating temperature of t heat and a vacuum pressure of p e at the extraction well screens all the symmetry planes are set as a zero flux boundary thus the boundary conditions are expressed as 49 p g 1 atm n ρ w v w 0 w g k 0 w g v w air v n j w k 0 t t heat at injection thermal screens p g p e n ρ w v w 0 n ρ g d g j w g j 0 n j w k 0 n q q 0 at extraction screens n ρ g v g 0 n ρ w v w 0 n j g j 0 n j w k 0 n q 0 at symmetry plane the initial saturations of napl and water were assumed to be s n0 0 03 and s w0 0 5 respectively with an atmospheric pressure and an initial temperature of t 0 293 15 k 20 c the equilibrium concentrations of contaminant in the gas aqueous and solid phases were also assumed at t 0 then the initial condition can be denoted as 50 p g 0 1 atm p w 0 p g 0 p cgw t 0 s w s w 0 s n s n 0 t t 0 w g k w g 0 k w g v w g 0 v c w 0 k p gc sat t t 0 rt 0 h k t t 0 c s 0 k c w 0 k m w k k d t t 0 in the following a well radius of r w 0 3 m a horizontal well spacing of l 6 m between the injection wells and the extraction wells and a heating temperature of t heat 353 15 k 80 c were assumed unless otherwise stated toluene with low solubility was adopted as the target contaminant in the following the numerical model was established and solved using comsol multiphysics 6 0 with the related parameters listed in table s3 4 2 contaminant mass and heat transfer during t sve with an injection pressure of 0 kpa and an extraction pressure of 10 kpa relative to the atmospheric pressure all the streamlines begin at the injection wells and end at the extraction wells fig 6 the gas flow velocity around the well screens e g 0 5 cm s was much larger than that in other regions e g 0 02 cm s in the middle area between two adjacent injection wells vaporized contaminants have long migration paths and low flow velocity which means it is harder to be extracted moreover the overall gas flow velocity at the later stage of extraction slightly decreases compared with the initial stage due to the increase of gas dynamic viscosity with temperature after continuous extraction for 72 h all the napl was removed within a 1 5 m radius around the injection well s n approaches zero as shown in blue while most of the rest of the domain almost remained initial napl saturation as shown in red in fig 7 a there were transition areas shown in green and yellow between the remediated area and unremediated area indicating a napl saturation gradient at the 168th hour the transition area expanded to approximately 2 5 m away from the injection well with the shape changing from an injection facing arc to an approximately straight line fig 7 b this was because the remediation performance between the injection wells and the adjacent extraction wells was better than that between the adjacent injection wells due to a shorter gas migration path and a larger gas velocity moreover the spatial distributions of the contaminant concentrations in the gas aqueous and solid phases c g c w and c s respectively were similar to that of s n however the removal fronts of c w and c s were slightly closer to the injection wells than those of c g and s n which depend on the mass transfer coefficients indicating quicker removal of the contaminant in the gaseous and nonaqueous phases basically the sve method removes the gaseous contaminant in soil pores c g which is supplied by the contaminants in the nonaqueous phase and aqueous phase s n and c w through k ng and k wg respectively c w is resupplied by the contaminants in the nonaqueous phase and solid phase s n and c s through k nw and k sw respectively thus contaminant removal during sve can be classified into two paths 1 from s n to c g and 2 from s n and c s to c w and then to c g as shown in fig 7 the napl gas solid aqueous and aqueous gas mass transfer rates respectively i ng i sw and i wg increased with the distance away from the injection well to peaks in red and then decreased to small values close to zero in contrast the napl aqueous mass transfer rate i nw had a rapid increase at the removal front and gradually decreased to a small value the peak and range of i nw were much smaller than those of i ng i sw and i wg and i ng was first among them all the mass transfer rates decreased over time as shown in fig 7 a and b thus it can be concluded that napl gas mass transfer was the dominant mechanism of removal followed by mass transfer from the solid phase to the aqueous phase and then to the gaseous phase for the vocs with low solubility soil temperature has an influence on many parameters during t sve as shown in fig 2 as a result of the phase change caused by heating and extraction the gas saturation s g slightly decreased with increasing distance from the injection well fig 8 a dramatic decrease in s g around the extraction well can be observed which was caused by the redistribution of soil moisture with increasing distance the napl gas mass transfer coefficient k ng had a significant increase due to the increase in napl saturation s n however the difference between the equilibrium concentration and actual concentration of the gaseous contaminant c ge c g significantly decreases due to a decrease in c ge with decreasing temperature t and an increase in c g thus the variation in the napl gas mass transfer rate i ng φs g k ng c ge c g was mainly due to a balance between the increasing k ng and decreasing c ge c g for the solid aqueous mass transfer rate i sw k sw ρ d c s k d c w m w k its variation with the distance away from the injection well was mainly due to a balance between the increases in both the adsorbed concentration c s and dissolved concentration k d c w m w n where the partition coefficient k d increased with decreasing t by increasing the organic carbon content f oc the decreasing solid aqueous mass transfer coefficient k sw was less significant similarly the variation in the aqueous gas mass transfer rate i wg φs g k wg c w hm w k c g was mainly due to a balance between the increasing c w and the decreasing henry constant h with decreasing t along the distance from the injection heating well the variation in the temperature can be divided into four zones the boundary lowering zone stable heating zone front lowering zone and initial temperature zone fig 9 the boundary lowering zone was within several centimetre around the heating well where the temperature rapidly dropped from the heating temperature of 80 c to 59 c at t 24 h this was because the vapour concentration around the well was significantly lower than the saturated vapour concentration at the heating temperature resulting in significant heat adsorption and soil moisture evaporation fig 10 b as the temperature decreased the saturated vapour concentration dropped accordingly and together with the increasing vapour concentration the heat transfer in the soil and moisture evaporation remained balanced in the stable heating zone in the front lowering zone the temperature gradually decreased to a minimum value of 19 c and then rose to the initial temperature of 20 c the minimum temperature was due to the heat adsorption caused by napl volatilization fig 10 b napl volatilization still occurred in the initial temperature zone which led to a slight decrease in the temperature additionally continuous heating expanded the range of the stable heating zone over time while continuous napl volatilization decreased the soil temperature in the initial temperature zone continuous heating and extraction also cause the redistribution of soil moisture fig 10 a at t 24 h the water saturation s w decreased from the initial value of 0 5 to 0 42 around the injection heating well but it significantly increased to 0 85 around the extraction well this was because the water vapour evaporated from the heated soil migrated to the extraction well and condensed more water condensation occurred around the extraction well due to the lower saturated vapour concentration at the larger vacuum pressure generally the soil moisture in the entire region decreased over time at t 336 h s w around the heating well decreased to 0 33 but this value was larger than the expected value this was due to the supply of liquid water through advection from the extraction well to the injection well see the streamline in fig 10 a 4 3 effect of water evaporation and adsorbed dissolved contaminant to reveal the effect of interphase mass transfer on the t sve performance the proposed model case 1 was degenerated into

parameters were unchanged in case 2 without water evaporation the boundary lowering zone that had been observed in case 1 disappeared with a gradual decrease in temperature from t heat to t 0 with the distance from the heating well fig 11 the heating zone in case 2 was significantly narrower than that seen in case 1 which indicates that the endothermic evaporation and exothermic condensation accompanying vapour migration played an important role in the influence distance of thermal enhancement in case 4 without thermal enhancement continuous vapour extraction caused a 10 c decrease in temperature around the injection well due to the heat adsorption caused by water evaporation and condensation moreover the temperature distributions of cases 3 and 5 were similar to that of case 1 with a slight difference shown in the enlarged figure when i sw i wg and i nw were neglected case 3 more mass transfer occurred between the nonaqueous and gaseous phases together with more heat release resulting in a slightly lower temperature than that of case 1 using an average value of k ng0 over the entire region as adopted in case 5 led to lower temperature in the middle of the contaminated region relative to the smaller k ng0 used in case 1 due to the smaller vg and higher temperature around the extraction well relative to the larger k ng0 used in case 1 due to larger vg thus it is important to consider the evaporation and condensation of soil moisture during t sve neglecting the phenomenon will result in an overestimation the soil temperature around the heating well but significantly underestimate the range of the heating zone due to the narrower range of the heating zone in case 2 much shorter removal fronts of napl and gaseous contaminant from the injection heating well were observed compared to case 1 s n and c g in fig 12 a and b case 4 with t heat t 0 had an even shorter removal front than case 2 due to the lower temperature around the injection well to characterize the remediation efficiency the removal rate γ t is defined as 51 γ t 1 c tot t c tot 0 100 where c tot t represents the total concentration at time t kg m3 and c tot 0 is the initial total concentration kg m3 as shown in fig 13 the removal rates of cases 2 and 4 were close and both were smaller than that of case 1 by approximately 10 which indicates the critical role the endothermic evaporation and exothermic condensation play in the thermal enhancement to sve for case 3 without i sw i wg and i nw there were still some nonaqueous contaminants s n in the range of 0 75 1 75 m from the heating well fig 12 a however the gaseous contaminant concentrations c g of cases 1 and 3 in this range were the same fig 12 b but were supplied in different ways i e from the aqueous phase through i wg and the nonaqueous phase through i ng moreover case 3 had a smaller peak napl saturation beyond the removal front than case 1 fig 12 a which might have been due to the competition between the from s n to c g removal path path 1 and the from s n and c s to c w and then to c g removal path path 2 specifically the mass transfer between the napl and aqueous phases was slower than that between the napl and gas phases larger concentrations of gaseous contaminants in case 1 were due to the fact that the supply following both paths 1 and 2 may in turn inhibit the napl gas mass transfer i e smaller c ge c g eventually the contaminant removal in case 3 was more effective than that of case 1 and the maximum difference in removal rate occurred in the intermediate stage and exceeded 10 fig 13 additionally case 5 with a constant value of k ng0 had larger values of s n than case 1 around the extraction well fig 12 a this was because case 5 neglected the amplification of the gas velocity around the extraction well as shown in fig 6 and hence the napl gas mass transfer rate was significantly underestimated together with smaller values of s n immediately beyond the removal front the removal efficiency of case 5 was close to that of case1 with a maximum difference of less than 2 fig 13 thus neglecting the effect of gas velocity on k ng0 by averaging mainly affected the spatial distribution of the contaminants rather than the removal rate 5 conclusions this study established a t sve model that incorporates gas aqueous flow water vapour migration mass transfer of contaminants among phases and heat transfer together with temperature effect the model was applied to reveal the mechanism of mass and heat transfer during t sve and analyze the effects of water evaporation and adsorbed dissolved contaminants the main conclusions drawn are as follows 1 for the vocs with low solubility such as toluene napl gas mass transfer is the dominant removal mechanism followed by mass transfer from the solid phase to the aqueous phase and then to the gaseous phase 2 affected by napl volatilization and water evaporation condensation in the soil the heat energy transfer was divided into four zones as the distance from the injection heating well increased namely the boundary lowering zone stable heating zone front lowering zone and initial temperature zone 3 endothermic evaporation and exothermic condensation play a critical role in the thermal enhancement of sve ignoring them will overestimate the soil temperature around the heating well but significantly underestimate the size of the heating zone and the removal rate of contaminants 4 for the vocs with low solubility such as toluene ignoring the removal path of contaminants from the nonaqueous and solid phases to the aqueous phase and then to the gas phase will result in a significant overestimation of the t sve removal efficiency especially in the intermediate stage of remediation this might be due to competition with another removal path of contaminants from the nonaqueous phase to the gas phase credit authorship contribution statement qi teng zheng

1179,the degradation of trichloroethylene tce vapors by zero valent iron copper fe cu and iron nickel fe ni bimetals with 1 5 and 20 weight content wt of cu or ni was tested in anaerobic batch vapor systems carried out at ambient room temperature 20 2 c under partially saturated conditions the concentrations of tce and byproducts were determined at discrete reaction time intervals 4 h 7 days by analyzing the headspace vapors in all the experiments up to 99 9 degradation of tce in the gas phase was achieved after 2 4 days with zero order tce degradation kinetic constants in the range of 134 332 g mair 3d 1 fe ni showed a higher reactivity towards tce vapors compared to fe cu with up to 99 9 tce dechlorination after 2 days of reaction i e significantly higher than zero valent iron alone that in previous studies was found to achieve comparable tce degradation after minimum 2 weeks of reaction the only detectable byproducts of the reactions were c3 c6 hydrocarbons neither vinyl chloride or dichloroethylene peaks were detected in the tested conditions above their method quantification limits that were in the order of 0 01 g mair 3 in view of using the tested bimetals in horizontal permeable reactive barriers hprbs placed in the unsaturated zone to treat chlorinated solvent vapors emitted from contaminated groundwater the experimental results obtained were integrated into a simple analytical model to simulate the reactive transport of vapors through the barrier it was found that an hprb of 20 cm could be potentially effective to ensure tce vapors reduction

introduction in the past decades chlorinated solvents have been extensively used in various civil and industrial applications u s epa 2004a harnisch et al 2011 tang et al 2022 which caused groundwater and soil contamination by these substances damgaard et al 2013 rossi et al 2015 dumas et al 2018 when released into the environment most chlorinated solvents form a dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl that can accumulate into low permeability layers and persist as a long term secondary source for hundreds of years u s epa 2004a o carroll et al 2013 damgaard et al 2013 koenig et al 2015 wanner et al 2018 consequently many groundwater bodies in industrial and civil areas are affected by diffuse contamination by these substances i e large areas with low medium levels of contamination mackay

vapor intrusion causing potential long term risks to the human health of the residents bekele et al 2013 eklund et al 2012 verginelli et al 2017 ma et al 2020 in sites characterized by diffuse pollution the adoption of traditional remediation techniques to remove the source of contamination is complex and not sustainable citychlor 2013 azzellino et al 2019 and thus it could be more suitable to act through risk management strategies aimed at assessing the actual risk due to vapor intrusion zingaretti et al 2019 in this view it was recently proposed to passively treat vocs vapors by applying horizontal permeable reactive barriers hprbs placed in the unsaturated zone of contaminated areas mahmoodlu et al 2014 2015 verginelli et al 2017 a similar application consisting of a reactive top cover for landfills was also developed in the past years to treat halogenated trace gases from landfill flue gas such as chlorofluorocarbons cfcs scheutz et al 2000 or chlorinated grenier et al 2004 vapors regarding hprbs potassium permanganate kmno4 and zero valent iron zvi were tested as filling materials mahmoodlu et al 2014 2015 zingaretti et al 2019 2020 zvi is commonly used as a reductive agent for the degradation of chlorinated solvents in groundwater itrc 2011 chao et al 2012 but showed also a good reactivity towards the dechlorination in the gas phase scheutz et al 2000 grenier et al 2004 zingaretti et al 2019 2020 in the last years zvi bimetals based on iron with a secondary transition metal with a higher redox standard potential have been also widely investigated for the enhancement of chlorinated compounds removal from water kim and carraway 2003 xu et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 liu et al 2017 nickel ni and copper cu were commonly used to produce zvi bimetals with the aim of catalyzing the dehalogenation reactions xu et al 2012 chao et al 2012 liu et al 2017 venkateshaiah et al 2022 literature results pointed out that these metals enhance iron corrosion and molecular hydrogen dissociation xu et al 2012 liu et al 2017 increasing the availability of electrons e and atomic hydrogen h necessary for the reductive dehalogenation reactions of chlorinated pollutants induced by zvi ruan et al 2019 scaria et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 tang et al 2022 the reductive dehalogenation reactions of trichloroethylene tce induced by zvi coupled to ni or cu are reported in eqs 1 4 in particular in the presence of zvi and ni or cu tce dechlorination to ethylene eqs 2 and 4 occurs through iron corrosion catalyzed by cu and ni eq 1 and dissociation of molecular hydrogen produced from the corrosion of zvi ruan et al 2019 liu et al 2021 catalyzed mostly by ni eq 3 xu et al 2012 duan et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 1 3 f e 0 cu ni 3 f e 2 6 e 2 c 2 hc l 3 3 h 6 e c

reached through different pathways β elimination is considered the primary pathway for tce degradation by zvi roberts et al 1996 which involves the production of chloroacetylene that is then transformed to acetylene and rapidly reduced to ethylene campbell et al 1997 a second reaction pathway for the dechlorination by zvi is hydrogenolysis arnold and roberts 2000 for which less chlorinated byproducts such as vinyl chloride vc or dichloroethylene dce are produced and subsequently degraded to ethylene campbell et al 1997 zvi bimetallic particles can be physically or chemically produced gunawardana et al 2011 scaria et al 2020 the most used methods are chemical solution deposition and mechanical alloying e g ball milling liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017 zvi bimetals were investigated for the treatment of chlorinated solvents in the aqueous phase obtaining different performance depending on the secondary metal used kim and carraway 2003 he et al 2018 venkateshaiah et al 2022 and on the production method xu et al 2012 several studies of bimetals based on zvi and ni rather than cu observed improved chlorinated compounds removal in the aqueous phase because ni is a hydrogenation catalyst and enhance the formation of atomic hydrogen which is fundamental to directly substitute chlorine in the dehalogenation process kim and carraway 2003 yin et al 2012 he et al 2018 zhuang et al 2021 regarding the production method xu et al 2012 produced a bimetal based on iron and ni with both chemical solution deposition and ball milling observing an increased dechlorination activity using the latter method furthermore different authors reported that physical methods such as milling are more advantageous in producing zvi bimetals as no reagents are required and due to the larger scale production in a relatively short time james et al 2012 liu et al 2014 scaria et al 2020 yin et al 2022 furthermore using a milling technique it is possible to obtain micrometric particles which are more convenient in view of the application in hprbs to avoid eventual problems of particle aggregation during the treatment of chlorinated vapors zingaretti et al 2020 chemical methods such as chemical solution deposition are instead more indicated to produce bimetallic nanoparticles liu et al 2014 in a recent work settimi et al 2022 produced and characterized disc milled micrometric zero valent fe cu and fe ni bimetals for the treatment of tce in the vapor phase in the preliminary batch tests at 1 day of reaction settimi et al 2022 found that fe cu and fe ni bimetals can be potentially effective towards dechlorination of tce in the gas phase in this work the preliminary study of settimi et al 2022 is deepened to investigate the tce degradation kinetic rates by different types of zero valent fe cu and fe ni bimetals with 1 wt 5 wt and 20 wt content of cu or ni specifically for each bimetal the tce degradation kinetic rates were analyzed by anaerobic batch vapor tests carried out at discrete reaction time intervals 4 h 7 days under partially saturated conditions based on the obtained degradation kinetic rates the feasibility of using these bimetals as constituents for hprbs placed in the unsaturated zone as a mitigation strategy for chlorinated vapors emitted from contaminated groundwater was examined using a simple analytical model that allows to calculate the theoretical thickness of the barrier required to effectively reduce tce vapors finally the expected lifetime of the hprb due to iron consumption during the treatment of contaminated vapors was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the bimetals used in this work for the degradation tests of tce in the vapor phase were the ones produced and characterized by settimi et al 2022 these reactive materials are micrometric disc milled fe cu and fe ni bimetals with cu or ni contents of 1 wt fe 1 cu and fe 1 ni 5 wt fe 5 cu and fe 5 ni and 20 wt fe 20 cu and fe 20 ni fe cu and fe ni bimetals were characterized by relatively similar specific surface areas ssa resulted in the range of 0 2 0 7 m2g 1 settimi et al 2022 for more details on the characterization of these bimetals readers can refer to settimi et al 2022 tce 99 supplied by alfa aesar was used to test the produced bimetals in tce degradation experiments 2 2 tce degradation tests using bimetals batch degradation tests at different reaction times were performed using the same configuration and procedure previously adopted by zingaretti et al 2019 2020 for zvi and settimi et al 2022 for fe cu and fe ni bimetals namely the tce degradation experiments were carried out at ambient room temperature 20 2 c in transparent glass vials under anaerobic conditions obtained by purging the vials with n2 1 0 005 g of reactive material i e the reactive bed was weighed with an analytical balance denver instrument si 234 and placed at the bottom of the vial partially saturated conditions i e a water content of 10 wt in the material were obtained adding 100 0 02 μl of milli q water zeener power ii previously saturated with n2 with a 0 1 ml gilson pipette the presence of water is fundamental for tce degradation reactions induced by zvi bimetals as the hydrogen produced from its dissociation allows the c cl bond breakage in chlorinated compounds u s epa 2004b itrc 2011 after that 5 0 05 μl of pure tce was fed using a glass syringe hamilton 5 μl glass syringe into a glass tube of 200 μl capacity from which it could volatilize in the vial and get in contact with the reactive material finally the vials were sealed with a ptfe silicone septum cap using a 20 mm vial crimper from the quantity of the pure tce injected 5 μl the tce density 1 46 g cm 3 and the nominal vial volume 20 ml the initial concentration of tce in the tests was estimated equal to 365 g mair 3 note that for this estimation it was considered the nominal volume of the vial 20 ml although the effective volume of the vial could be 0 5 1 ml higher however this approximation can be partially compensated by the fact that a part of the vial s headspace was occupied by the reactive material and the glass tube to assess the potential losses of tce vapors from the vial the degradation tests i e with reactive material and control tests i e without the reactive material were carried out in parallel all the tests were conducted in triplicate the experimental setup described above is depicted in fig 1 the reactive materials involved in the tce degradation tests were subjected to an acidic washing pretreatment to remove possible oxide layers on the surface of the particles thus enhancing the reactivity towards dehalogenation reactions guan et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 the acidic washing was performed by putting the materials in contact with hcl 0 1 m for 1 h and then rinsing with milli q water zeener power ii saturated with n2 after the pretreatment each material was stored in anaerobic conditions to avoid the eventual reformation of passivating films tce degradation tests at different reaction times were performed using each produced material specifically tests at 18 h 1 2 3 4 and 7 days were carried out furthermore because of the expected higher reactivity compared to fe cu bimetals for fe ni bimetals also tests at 4 and 8 h of reaction time were performed the residual tce concentration in the vapor phase was measured at the end of each degradation test in the headspace of the vials by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector gc fid sequential dechlorination experiments were also carried out using fe cu and fe ni bimetals with 5 of cu or ni content to evaluate the stability of the dechlorination with time these tests were performed in triplicate with the same layout described earlier fig 1 in particular 1 0 005 g of bimetal was weighed with an analytical balance denver instrument si 234 and tested repeatedly in five cycles of tce dechlorination in the vapor phase in the batch vapor systems at the end of each cycle which lasted 3 days the residual tce concentration in the vial was measured by gc fid analyses with the same configuration described above after that 5 0 05 μl of pure tce was refilled in the glass tube using a glass syringe hamilton 5 μl glass syringe to start the successive treatment cycle the residual tce concentrations detected at the end of each cycle allowed to assess the dechlorination stability of the produced zvi bimetals for sequential tce treatments the instrument used for gc fid analyses was a shimadzu gas chromatograph gc qp2010se equipped with an equity 5 column 30 m 0 25 mm id x 0 25 mm film thickness helium 0 9 ml min 1 was used as carrier gas the oven temperature was set to start from 40 c and arrive to 150 c with an increase of 8 c per minute note that with this method the tce detection limit in the gas phase was around 0 01 g mair 3 thus allowing to measure tce removal up to at least 99 99 using an initial concentration of 365 g mair 3 corresponding to 0 0365 g mair 3 i e higher than the detection limit of the methods used 3 results and discussion 3 1 tce degradation by bimetals the results of the tce degradation tests conducted using the produced bimetals at different reaction times are shown in fig 2 the results shown in the figure referred to the average values obtained in the different replicates conducted for each test in the figure the error bars relative to the standard deviation of the tests conducted in triplicate are also reported it can be noticed that the deviations obtained in the different replicates were relatively low see error bars in the figure with coefficients of variation i e the ratio between the standard deviation and the average of the replicates in all the performed tests lower than 15 the results were expressed in terms of the normalized concentration of tce in the vapor phase c t r c control as a function of the reaction time t r the degradation kinetic dashed lines in fig 2 were derived from the experimental data assuming a zero order degradation kinetic 5 c t r c control k obs t r 1 with 6 k obs k 0 c 0 7 t r t t l where c t r g mair 3 is the residual tce concentration in the vapor phase measured at the end of each degradation test and c control g mair 3 is the tce concentration of the relative control test k obs d 1 is the slope of the zero order linear kinetic that is equal to the ratio between the zero order degradation rate constant k 0 g mair 3d 1 and c 0 g mair 3 that is the initial concentration of tce in the vials i e 365 g mair 3 t r d is the reaction time that was calculated as a function of the effective duration of the test t d and t l d that is the latency time necessary to obtain the effective contact between tce in the vapor phase and the reactive material this latency time was estimated equal to 4 8 h by considering the volatilization and diffusion of tce vapors in the reactive material and the subsequent dissolution in the interstitial water see section s1 of supplementary material the estimated zero order kinetic constants k 0 and the degradation rates normalized to the specific surface area k ssa are reported in table 1 the k ssa values were estimated as follows zingaretti et al 2020 johnson et al 1996 xu et al 2012 8 k ssa k 0 v ssa m where ssa m2g 1 is the specific surface area estimated for the tested bimetals v is the nominal vial volume 20 ml and m is the bimetal mass used for the batch tce degradation tests 1 g regarding fe cu bimetals fig 2a c the highest tce dechlorination performances were obtained using fe 1 cu with a 99 9 tce reduction in 2 days and a zero order kinetic constant of 207 g mair 3d 1 using fe 5 cu and fe 20 cu lower dechlorination performances were obtained in the degradation tests with a 99 9 removal of tce in 3 4 days and estimated zero order kinetic constants of 153 and 134 g mair 3d 1 respectively see table 1 by normalizing the degradation rate constant to the ssa it was found that the different fe cu bimetals were characterized by a similar reactivity see k ssa values in table 1 conversely using fe ni bimetals better results were obtained compared to fe cu ones in terms of tce degradation performances namely as shown in fig 2d f using the fe ni bimetals a 99 9 tce removal was achieved in maximum 2 days the tce removal in the vapor phase proved to increase passing from 1 of ni to 5 with a slight worsening in the performances adding higher ni contents i e 20 specifically using fe 1 ni a 99 9 degradation of the contaminant was observed in a shorter reaction time compared to the analogue fe cu bimetal with an estimated zero order kinetic constant of 278 g mair 3d 1 see table 1 furthermore using fe 5 ni the zero order kinetic constants increased to 332 g mair 3d 1 while using fe 20 a slight decrease of the constant to 300 g mair 3d 1 was observed see table 1 in addition the k ssa values estimated for fe 5 ni and fe 20 ni were similar and slightly higher than fe 1 ni see table 1 the removal kinetic performances observed in this work were found consistent with the 1 day batch tests carried out by settimi et al 2022 in such preliminary tests settimi et al 2022 found that fe ni bimetals were more reactive towards dechlorination compared to fe cu ones and fe 5 ni and fe 1 ni ensured the highest tce degradation it is worth noting that in this work the tce degradation trends resulted well fitted by a linear zero order kinetic this result is in contrast with different studies on tce degradation by bimetals carried out in the aqueous phase e g kim and carraway 2003 venkateshaiah et al 2022 or in the gas phase using zvi alone zingaretti et al 2019 2020 that observed exponential first order kinetics although other studies on the degradation kinetics of tce in the gas phase by bimetals are not available it can be argued that the kinetics obtained in this work reflect the degradation expected for high concentrations in the gas phase note that in these experiments the initial tce vapor concentration was near to the saturation thus not excluding that for lower concentrations below the detection limit of 0 01 g mair 3 achieved in this work exponential trend can be expected in terms of treatment time using the bimetals tested in this work enhanced performances in terms of tce removal in the vapor phase compared to the results obtained by zingaretti et al 2020 using zvi only were observed zingaretti et al 2020 indeed using different types of iron powders in analogous degradation tests observed a 99 9 removal of tce after more than 2 weeks of reaction in this study instead analogous tce removal rates in the vapor phase were observed for reaction times of 2 4 days for fe cu and 2 days for fe ni bimetals thus suggesting that the combination of the milling treatment and the addition of the secondary metal catalyst on zvi allowed to significantly improve the tce degradation performances in the vapor phase regarding the different performances of the two types of bimetals tested in this work the obtained results are consistent with the previous findings available in the literature based on the experiments carried out in the aqueous phase it is indeed recognized that fe ni systems allow obtaining better performances for tce degradation compared to fe cu ones in fact ni is a better catalyst for the dechlorination of chlorinated compounds than cu due to the different reaction mechanisms kim and carraway 2003 in particular the effects promoted by the presence of the catalyst metal on iron are the enhancement of electron transfer by iron corrosion creating a galvanic couple in the bimetal and the dissociation of molecular hydrogen he et al 2018 besides the better catalytic ability of fe ni systems compared to fe cu ones is probably due to the fact that ni can catalyze both electron transfer and dechlorination by the dissociation of h2 produced from the corrosion of zvi he et al 2018 ruan et al 2019 while cu catalyzes the degradation of tce mainly through galvanic corrosion duan et al 2016 for example kim and carraway 2003 chao et al 2012 he et al 2018 and venkateshaiah et al 2022 produced bimetallic particles based on iron coupled with ni and cu and other transition metals with chemical deposition to degrade tce in the aqueous phase obtaining faster removals using fe ni bimetals compared to fe cu ones furthermore the tce removal results obtained using the produced materials are comparable with previous literature on the degradation of chlorinated compounds in the aqueous phase by zvi bimetals liu et al 2022 prepared several fe ni bimetals with different ni contents in the range of 0 5 10 and observed faster tce removal performances in the aqueous phase by increasing the ni content to 5 and a worsening of removal performances for higher ni concentration probably due to the excessive ni load on the zvi surface chao et al 2012 studied fe cu bimetals with cu contents in the range of 0 4 14 to dechlorinate 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and observed a decrease in the kinetic constant increasing the cu content the obtained results and the ones reported in the literature highlight that increasing the ni content until 5 in fe ni bimetals resulted in improving tce removal while adding high cu content on fe cu bimetals higher than 1 probably results in lowering the dechlorination efficiency the dechlorination ability of bimetals in the vapor phase was instead poorly investigated to our knowledge only grenier et al 2004 tested fe 40 ni particles to degrade cis 1 2 dichloroethylene cis dce in the vapor phase and observed better performances compared to using iron alone finally considering the relatively low values of specific surface area ssa measured for the bimetals produced in the range of 0 2 0 7 m2g 1 see settimi et al 2022 it can be argued that the catalysis of iron corrosion and of atomic hydrogen generation induced by the presence of cu or ni is the main factor affecting the enhancement in tce removal performances comparing to the use of iron alone the results obtained in terms of k ssa confirmed that ni has better catalytic activity than cu in enhancing dechlorination with catalysis playing a key role rather than the ssa of the particles 3 2 degradation byproducts the byproducts detected at the end of the tce degradation tests see fig s1 were similar to those found by zingaretti et al 2019 2020 in which several zvi powders were tested for the degradation of tce in the vapor phase with the same layout used in this work these byproducts were identified as c3 6 hydrocarbons as found in previous studies on tce degradation in the vapor phase induced by zvi zingaretti et al 2019 2020 campbell et al 1997 neither vinyl chloride nor dichloroethylene peaks were detected in the tested conditions above their method detection limits that were in the order of 0 01 g mair 3 these results suggest that the addition of cu or ni on iron did not influence the degradation pathway of tce but only catalyzed the degradation reactions based on the chromatograms reported in fig s1 a tce mass balance was performed by comparing the residual tce and the c3 6 hydrocarbon byproducts i e degraded tce masses detected at the end of the degradation tests with the tce mass measured in the parallel control tests in particular the degraded tce mass was estimated by stoichiometrically converting the byproducts chromatographic peaks areas detected at the end of the degradation tests using a relative response factor to gc fid for c3 6 hydrocarbons to tce based on average literature values thermo environmental instruments 2000 more details on the tce mass balance calculation are reported in section 2 of supplementary material the tce mass balance fig s2 resulted in all tests almost equal to 100 i e the sum of the residual and degraded tce masses was approximately equal to the mass of tce detected in the control test thus the removal of tce in the vapor phase obtained in the different degradation tests can be mainly ascribed to a reduction of tce to c3 6 hydrocarbons while other effects such as adsorption of tce on the reactive material and the presence of other byproducts e g vc or dce can be considered negligible 3 3 sequential dechlorination experiments the results obtained in the sequential dechlorination experiments carried out using fe 5 cu and fe 5 ni bimetals are shown in fig 3 the materials were repeatedly used in tce degradation tests for 5 successive cycles the reaction time chosen for each cycle of treatment was 3 days because a 99 9 tce removal was expected using both bimetals a fairly constant extent of dechlorination was observed in all 5 cycles for both the bimetals tested in particular using fe 5 cu bimetal fig 3a the dechlorination percentages remained over 95 with good reproducibility of the tests conducted in triplicate similarly using fe 5 ni bimetal fig 3b the dechlorination remained over 95 in the first 4 cycles and lowered to almost 90 at the end of the 5th cycle similar results were achieved in previous studies using fe cu and fe ni bimetals in successive dechlorination experiments carried out in the aqueous phase for instance liu et al 2017 tested a ball milled fe 5 cu in 5 cycles of 4 cp dechlorination with 10 h of reaction time observing good stability with dechlorination percentages between 93 and 97 xu et al 2012 performed 10 cycles of dechlorination experiments using a ball milled fe 15 ni bimetal with a reaction time of 60 min observing good stability i e removal percentages higher than 90 in 4 cp degradation for all the cycles zhang et al 2018 performed 10 cycles of 4 cp dechlorination using a fe ni bimetal observing good removal rates i e higher than 90 in the first 5 cycles and a slight worsening after the 5th cycle but maintaining the dechlorination percentages higher than 85 3 4 estimation of the hprb thickness based on the results obtained in the batch tests it was estimated the thickness of a hypothetical horizontal permeable reactive barrier hprb placed in the unsaturated zone for attenuating tce in the vapor phase in eq 9 is reported the simplified relationship used to evaluate the thickness of the hprb necessary to attenuate the tce vapors neglecting possible factors e g passivation that can affect the treatment over time 9 c hprb in c hprb out k 0 t where k 0 g mair 3d 1 is the zero order degradation constant obtained from the tce batch degradation experiments for each material tested t d is the time necessary for the contaminated vapors to pass through the barrier and c hprb in g mair 3 and c hprb out g mair 3 are respectively the tce concentration in the vapor phase at the bottom and at the top of the barrier although uncommon in contaminated sites as a worst case scenario the concentration of tce entering the barrier c hprb in was set equal to 515 8 g mair 3 which corresponds to the maximum tce concentration in the vapor phase calculated as the product of the tce solubility in water 1 28 103 mg l 1 u s epa 2017 and the dimensionless henry s constant relative to tce 0 403 at 25 c u s epa 2017 c hprb out was instead set equal to zero for assessing the minimum thickness needed to ensure a complete degradation of tce vapors in the hprb the time necessary for the contaminated vapors to pass through the barrier t was calculated as follows crank 1979 10 t d 2 2 d hprb where d m is the preliminary estimated hprb minimum thickness necessary to obtain a complete removal of tce from the contaminated vapors passing through the barrier and d hprb m2h 1 is the diffusion coefficient of tce in the vapor phase in the hprb calculated by the following relationship millington and quirk 1961 11 d hprb d a tce θ a hprb 10 3 θ e hprb 2 where θ e hprb and θ a hprb are the effective and the air filled porosity of the reactive bed respectively assumed equal to 0 5 and 0 15 zingaretti et al 2019 and d a tce cm2s 1 is the tce diffusion coefficient in air assumed equal to 0 0687 cm2s 1 u s epa 2015 substituting eq 10 into eq 9 it was possible to calculate the minimum hprb thickness for each tested material as follows 12 d 2 d hprb c hprb in k 0 the calculated minimum hprb thicknesses required to degrade the tce vapors using the different bimetals tested are reported in table 2 according to this theoretical calculation a thickness of the hprb in the order of 20 cm could be potentially sufficient to efficiently degrade tce vapors this could represent a significant improvement compared to previous estimations by zingaretti et al 2020 that for zvi alone estimated that a barrier of 1 m was needed to attenuate the tce vapor concentrations of 99 9 note that in the case of tce concentrations in the vapor phase lower than the saturation concentration i e 515 8 g mair 3 the thickness of the hprb can be lower than 20 cm namely the thickness required for obtaining a complete tce removal as a function of the tce concentration in the vapor phase are shown in fig 4 in the figure three different values of initial concentration of tce in the vapor phase are assumed i e the saturation concentration in the vapor phase c sat vap the 50 of saturation 50 c sat vap and the 10 of saturation 10 c sat vap it can be observed that assuming a concentration equal to the 10 of the saturation concentration i e more representative of what can be expected in the case of diffuse groundwater contamination the minimum hprb thickness to ensure a complete tce removal for all the tested materials can be of 5 cm or lower it is worth pointing out that these hprb thicknesses are purely indicative as they were calculated on the basis of different simplifying assumptions that do not account for the long term behavior of bimetals in the field e g reduction of the performances due to iron passivation scaled up experiments are thus needed for a proper design of hprb that can ensure an effective treatment of vapors in the subsurface 3 5 iron consumption due to oxidation in the hprb assuming a complete dechlorination of tce vapors in the hprb it is possible to estimate the lifetime of the barrier t hprb ox as a result of the consumption of iron due to its oxidation verginelli et al 2017 13 t hprb ox ρ b d hprb η zvi γ j hprb where d hprb m is the hprb thickness that was considered equal to 0 2 m according to the results discussed in the previous section j hprb g m 2d 1 is the flux of vapors through the barrier γ gzvi gtce is the stoichiometric mass ratio between iron and tce η zv i is the weight ratio between zvi and the catalyst forming the bimetals and ρ b ton m 3 is the density of the considered material

to create bimetals η zv i is equal to 0 99 0 95 and 0 8 for fe 1 catalyst fe 5 catalyst and fe 20 catalyst respectively furthermore ρ b ton m 3 is the density of the bimetal used in the barrier that according to verginelli et al 2017 was estimated based on the masses of iron m zvi and catalyst m cat the densities of the materials constituting the reactive bed ρ cat and ρ zvi and its effective

for ni and 7 86 ton m 3 for zvi u s epa 2017 using eq 16 bimetal densities produced were esteemed equal to respectively 3 93 ton m 3 for fe 1 cu and fe 1 ni 3 95 ton m 3 for fe 5 cu and fe 5 ni 4 03 ton m 3 for fe 20 cu and 4 02 ton m 3 for fe 20 ni the flux of vapors through the barrier was estimated assuming a 1 d diffusion dominated transport with zero order reaction 17 d hprb 2 c z 2 k 0 θ w h 0 where c g mair 3 is the concentration of tce in the vapor phase in the hprb θ w is the water filled porosity in the barrier assumed 0 35 zingaretti et al 2019 k 0 g mair 3d 1 is the zero order degradation kinetic constant characteristic of each material tested as potential filling material for hprbs d hprb m2d 1 is the diffusion coefficient of tce through the barrier see eq 11 and h is the dimensionless henry s constant of tce equal to 0 403 at 25 c u s epa 2015 an analytical solution of eq 17 was obtained assuming as boundary conditions a vapor concentration equal to c hprb in entering the barrier z 0 and a negligible concentration leaving the barrier with a thickness d hprb i e assuming a complete tce removal through the hprb assumed at z d hprb 18 c z 0 c hprb in 19 c z d hprb c

differentiating eq 20 with respect to z the vapor flux through the barrier can be calculated as 21 j hprb d hprb c z d hprb z k 0 θ w d hprb 2 2 h d hprb c hprb in 2 h d hprb assuming d hprb equal to 0 2 m i e a sufficient thickness for complete tce removal for each material tested and c hprb in equal to the saturation of tce in the vapor phase i e 515 8 g mair 3 by substituting eqs 15 16 and 21 into eq 13 it was found that the consumption time of the iron in the hprb with a fixed thickness of 0 2 m is in the range of 40 70 years depending on the material chosen see table 2 note that the estimated lifetime of zvi in terms of its consumption it is expected to be higher than other filling material such as potassium permanganate kmno4 for which verginelli et al 2017 estimated a lifetime in the order of 10 20 years thus these results highlighted that the lifetime of the barrier in terms of iron consumption is not an issue however other phenomena such as iron passivation need to be investigated to evaluate the long term effectiveness of this application schrick et al 2002 guan et al 2015 4 conclusions tce degradation in the vapor phase under partially saturated conditions by fe cu and fe ni bimetals was investigated by performing batch degradation tests at different reaction times 4 h 7 days a zero order degradation kinetic was observed using all the tested materials with rate constants in the range of 134 332 g mair 3d 1 in all the experiments up to 99 9 degradation of tce vapors was obtained after 2 4 days of reaction in particular using fe cu bimetals a 99 9 tce degradation was reached in a maximum of 4 days of treatment fe 1 cu showed the best tce removal performances while higher cu contents i e 5 20 resulted in lower tce dechlorination performances as also observed in previous studies carried out in the aqueous phase chao et al 2012 conversely fe ni systems showed better tce dechlorination results obtaining a 99 9 tce degradation in maximum 2 days higher tce removal performances were achieved using a ni content of 5 compared to 1 and 20 similar findings were also obtained in a previous study carried out in the aqueous phase liu et al 2022 the improved results observed using fe ni compared to fe cu are consistent with previous literature on tce degradation in the aqueous phase kim and carraway 2003 chao et al 2012 he et al 2018 venkateshaiah et al 2022 furthermore the stability of the dechlorination ability of the produced bimetals was investigated by performing 5 cycles of tce degradation tests with 3 days of reaction time each using fe 5 cu and fe 5 ni bimetals observing relatively stable and over 90 tce removal performances at the end of each degradation test c3 6 hydrocarbons were detected as reaction byproducts in analogy to previous studies zingaretti et al 2019 2020 based on the areas of the detected peaks measured from the chromatograms a tce mass balance was performed which accounted for almost 100 suggesting that tce removal was mainly ascribed to tce dehalogenation while other effects e g adsorption on the reactive materials and the formation of other degradation byproducts e g vc or dce can be considered negligible the produced fe cu and fe ni bimetals showed a significant enhancement in reactivity towards tce vapors compared to zvi alone tested in previous studies zingaretti et al 2019 2020 probably ascribed to the presence of the catalyst kim and carraway 2003 venkateshaiah et al 2022 but also to the milling treatment which can form strains and defects in the particles that can favor the electron transfer and release xu et al 2012 yin et al 2022 in view of using the tested bimetals as constituents for hprbs the experimental results obtained were integrated into an analytical model to simulate the reactive transport through the reactive barrier estimating that an hprb in the range of 20 cm could potentially ensure an effective reduction of tce vapors the values obtained were quite smaller than the ones estimated by zingaretti et al 2020 for an hprb made by zvi which accounted for 1 m thus further highlighting the better performances of bimetals compared to iron alone finally the iron consumption due to oxidation of the hprb was estimated in the range of 40 70 years i e higher than other filling materials proposed in the literature e g kmno4 verginelli et al 2017 these findings highlighted that the lifetime of the barrier in terms of iron consumption is not an issue although to estimate the effective lifetime of the barrier also passivation phenomena of bimetals need to be investigated to evaluate the long term effectiveness of the treatment as reported in previous studies schrick et al 2002 guan et al 2015 it is also worth noting that in view of using the produced bimetals for hprbs it could be necessary to use complementary filling materials e g sand to avoid possible vapors diffusion problems and lateral bypass during the treatment that could affect the barrier design parameters thus further tests will be needed for a future scale up of the proposed technology credit authorship contribution statement clarissa settimi methodology

1179,the degradation of trichloroethylene tce vapors by zero valent iron copper fe cu and iron nickel fe ni bimetals with 1 5 and 20 weight content wt of cu or ni was tested in anaerobic batch vapor systems carried out at ambient room temperature 20 2 c under partially saturated conditions the concentrations of tce and byproducts were determined at discrete reaction time intervals 4 h 7 days by analyzing the headspace vapors in all the experiments up to 99 9 degradation of tce in the gas phase was achieved after 2 4 days with zero order tce degradation kinetic constants in the range of 134 332 g mair 3d 1 fe ni showed a higher reactivity towards tce vapors compared to fe cu with up to 99 9 tce dechlorination after 2 days of reaction i e significantly higher than zero valent iron alone that in previous studies was found to achieve comparable tce degradation after minimum 2 weeks of reaction the only detectable byproducts of the reactions were c3 c6 hydrocarbons neither vinyl

horizontal permeable reactive barriers hprbs placed in the unsaturated zone to treat chlorinated solvent vapors emitted from contaminated groundwater the experimental results obtained were integrated into a simple analytical model to simulate the reactive transport of vapors through the barrier it was found that an hprb of 20 cm could be potentially effective to ensure tce vapors reduction

introduction in the past decades chlorinated solvents have been extensively used in various civil and industrial applications u s epa 2004a harnisch et al 2011 tang et al 2022 which caused groundwater and soil contamination by these substances damgaard et al 2013 rossi et al 2015 dumas et al 2018 when released into the environment most chlorinated solvents form a dense non aqueous phase liquid

et al 2018 consequently many groundwater bodies in industrial and civil areas are affected by diffuse contamination by these substances i e large areas with low medium levels of contamination mackay and cherry 1989 mccarty 2010 azzellino et al 2019 being chlorinated solvents volatile organic compounds vocs contaminated vapors volatilize from groundwater and enter into overlying buildings i e vapor intrusion causing potential long term risks to the human health of the residents bekele et al 2013 eklund et al 2012 verginelli et al 2017 ma et al 2020 in sites characterized by diffuse pollution the adoption of traditional remediation techniques to remove the source of contamination is complex and not sustainable citychlor 2013 azzellino et al 2019 and thus it could be more suitable to act through risk management strategies aimed at assessing the actual risk due to vapor intrusion zingaretti et al 2019 in this view it was recently proposed to passively treat vocs vapors by applying horizontal permeable reactive barriers hprbs placed in the unsaturated zone of contaminated areas mahmoodlu et al 2014 2015 verginelli et al 2017 a similar application consisting of a reactive top cover for landfills was also developed in the past years to treat halogenated trace gases from landfill flue gas such as chlorofluorocarbons cfcs scheutz et al 2000 or chlorinated grenier et al 2004 vapors regarding hprbs potassium permanganate kmno4 and zero valent iron zvi were tested as filling materials mahmoodlu et al 2014 2015 zingaretti et al 2019 2020 zvi is commonly used as a reductive agent for the degradation of chlorinated solvents in groundwater itrc 2011 chao et al 2012 but showed also a good reactivity towards the dechlorination in the gas phase scheutz et al 2000 grenier et al 2004 zingaretti et al 2019 2020 in the last years zvi bimetals based on iron with a secondary transition metal with a higher redox standard potential have been also widely investigated for the enhancement of chlorinated compounds removal from water kim and carraway 2003 xu et al 2012 xiong et al 2015 liu et al 2017 nickel ni and copper cu were commonly used to produce zvi bimetals with the aim of catalyzing the dehalogenation reactions xu et al 2012 chao et al 2012 liu et al 2017 venkateshaiah et al 2022 literature results pointed out that these metals enhance iron corrosion and molecular hydrogen dissociation xu et al 2012 liu et al 2017 increasing the availability of electrons e and atomic hydrogen h necessary for the reductive dehalogenation reactions of chlorinated pollutants induced by zvi ruan et al 2019 scaria et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 tang et al 2022 the reductive dehalogenation reactions of trichloroethylene tce induced by zvi coupled to ni or cu are reported in eqs 1 4 in particular in the presence of zvi and ni or cu tce dechlorination to ethylene eqs 2 and 4 occurs through iron corrosion catalyzed by cu and ni eq 1 and dissociation of molecular hydrogen produced from the corrosion of zvi ruan et al 2019 liu et al 2021 catalyzed mostly by ni eq 3 xu et al 2012 duan et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 1 3 f e 0 cu ni 3 f e 2 6 e 2 c 2 hc l 3 3 h 6 e c

reached through different pathways β elimination is considered the primary pathway for tce degradation by zvi roberts et al 1996 which involves the production of chloroacetylene that is then transformed to acetylene and rapidly reduced to ethylene campbell et al 1997 a second reaction pathway for the dechlorination by zvi is hydrogenolysis arnold and roberts 2000 for which less chlorinated byproducts such as vinyl chloride vc or dichloroethylene dce are produced and subsequently degraded to ethylene campbell et al 1997 zvi bimetallic particles can be physically or chemically produced gunawardana et al 2011 scaria et al 2020 the most used methods are chemical solution deposition and mechanical alloying e g ball milling liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017 zvi bimetals were investigated for the treatment of chlorinated solvents in the aqueous phase obtaining different performance depending on the secondary metal used kim and carraway 2003 he et al 2018 venkateshaiah et al 2022 and on the production method xu et al 2012 several studies of bimetals based on zvi and ni rather than cu observed improved chlorinated compounds removal in the aqueous phase because ni is a hydrogenation catalyst and enhance the formation of atomic hydrogen which is fundamental to directly substitute chlorine in the dehalogenation process kim and carraway 2003 yin et al 2012 he et al 2018 zhuang et al 2021 regarding the production method xu et al 2012 produced a bimetal based on iron and ni with both chemical solution deposition and ball milling observing an increased dechlorination activity using the latter method furthermore different authors reported that physical methods such as milling are more advantageous in producing zvi bimetals as no reagents are required and due to the larger scale production in a relatively short time james et al 2012 liu et al 2014 scaria et al 2020 yin et al 2022 furthermore using a milling technique it is possible to obtain micrometric particles which are more convenient in view of the application in hprbs to avoid eventual problems of particle aggregation during the treatment of chlorinated vapors zingaretti et al 2020 chemical methods such as chemical solution deposition are instead more indicated to produce bimetallic nanoparticles liu et al 2014 in a recent work settimi et al 2022 produced and characterized disc milled micrometric zero valent fe cu and fe ni bimetals for the treatment of tce in the vapor phase in the preliminary batch tests at 1 day of reaction settimi et al 2022 found that fe cu and fe ni bimetals can be potentially effective towards dechlorination of tce in the gas phase in this work the preliminary study of settimi et al 2022 is deepened to investigate the tce degradation kinetic rates by different types of zero valent fe cu and fe ni bimetals with 1 wt 5 wt and 20 wt content of cu or ni specifically for each bimetal the tce degradation kinetic rates were analyzed by anaerobic batch vapor tests carried out at discrete reaction time intervals 4 h 7 days under partially saturated conditions based on the obtained degradation kinetic rates the feasibility of using these bimetals as constituents for hprbs placed in the unsaturated zone as a mitigation strategy for chlorinated vapors emitted from contaminated groundwater was examined using a simple analytical model that allows to calculate the theoretical thickness of the barrier required to effectively reduce tce vapors finally the expected lifetime of the hprb due to iron consumption during the treatment of contaminated vapors was evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the bimetals used in this work for the degradation tests of tce in the vapor phase were the ones produced and characterized by settimi et al 2022 these reactive materials are micrometric disc milled fe cu and fe ni bimetals with cu or ni contents of 1 wt fe 1 cu and fe 1 ni 5 wt fe 5 cu and fe 5 ni and 20 wt fe 20 cu and fe 20 ni fe cu and fe ni bimetals were characterized by relatively similar specific surface areas ssa resulted in the range of 0 2 0 7 m2g 1 settimi et al 2022 for more details on the characterization of these bimetals readers can refer to settimi et al 2022 tce 99 supplied by alfa aesar was used to test the produced bimetals in tce degradation experiments 2 2 tce degradation tests using bimetals batch degradation tests at different reaction times were performed using the same configuration and procedure previously adopted by zingaretti et al 2019 2020 for zvi and settimi et al 2022 for fe cu and fe ni bimetals namely the tce degradation experiments were carried out at ambient room temperature 20 2 c in transparent glass vials under anaerobic conditions obtained by purging the vials with n2 1 0 005 g of reactive material i e the reactive bed was weighed with an analytical balance denver instrument si 234 and placed at the bottom of the vial partially saturated conditions i e a water content of 10 wt in the material were obtained adding 100 0 02 μl of milli q water zeener power ii previously saturated with n2 with a 0 1 ml gilson pipette the presence of water is fundamental for tce degradation reactions induced by zvi bimetals as the hydrogen produced from its dissociation allows the c cl bond breakage in chlorinated compounds u s epa 2004b itrc 2011 after that 5 0 05 μl of pure tce was fed using a glass syringe hamilton 5 μl glass syringe into a glass tube of 200 μl capacity from which it could volatilize in the vial and get in contact with the reactive material finally the vials were sealed with a ptfe silicone septum cap using a 20 mm vial crimper from the quantity of the pure tce injected 5 μl the tce density 1 46 g cm 3 and the nominal vial volume 20 ml the initial concentration of tce in the tests was estimated equal to 365 g mair 3 note that for this estimation it was considered the nominal volume of the vial 20 ml although the effective volume of the vial could be 0 5 1 ml higher however this approximation can be partially compensated by the fact that a part of the vial s headspace was occupied by the reactive material and the glass tube to assess the potential losses of tce vapors from the vial the degradation tests i e with reactive material and control tests i e without the reactive material were carried out in parallel all the tests were conducted in triplicate the experimental setup described above is depicted in fig 1 the reactive materials involved in the tce degradation tests were subjected to an acidic washing pretreatment to remove possible oxide layers on the surface of the particles thus enhancing the reactivity towards dehalogenation reactions guan et al 2015 zhang et al 2022 the acidic washing was performed by putting the materials in contact with hcl 0 1 m for 1 h and then rinsing with milli q water zeener power ii saturated with n2 after the pretreatment each material was stored in anaerobic conditions to avoid the eventual reformation of passivating films tce degradation tests at different reaction times were performed using each produced material specifically tests at 18 h 1 2 3 4 and 7 days were carried out furthermore because of the expected higher reactivity compared to fe cu bimetals for fe ni bimetals also tests at 4 and 8 h of reaction time were performed the residual tce concentration in the vapor phase was measured at the end of each degradation test in the headspace of the vials by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector gc fid sequential dechlorination experiments were also carried out using fe cu and fe ni bimetals with 5 of cu or ni content to evaluate the stability of the dechlorination with time these tests were performed in triplicate with the same layout described earlier fig 1 in particular 1 0 005 g of bimetal was weighed with an analytical balance denver instrument si 234 and tested repeatedly in five cycles of tce dechlorination in the vapor phase in the batch vapor systems at the end of each cycle which lasted 3 days the residual tce concentration in the vial was measured by gc fid analyses with the same configuration described above after that 5 0 05 μl of pure tce was refilled in the glass tube using a glass syringe hamilton 5 μl glass syringe to start the successive treatment cycle the residual tce concentrations detected at the end of each cycle allowed to assess the dechlorination stability of the produced zvi bimetals for sequential tce treatments the instrument used for gc fid analyses was a shimadzu gas chromatograph gc qp2010se equipped with an equity 5 column 30 m 0 25 mm id x 0 25 mm film thickness helium 0 9 ml min 1 was used as carrier gas the oven temperature was set to start from 40 c and arrive to 150 c with an increase of 8 c per minute note that with this method the tce detection limit in the gas phase was around 0 01 g mair 3 thus allowing to measure tce removal up to at least 99 99 using an initial concentration of 365 g mair 3 corresponding to 0 0365 g mair 3 i e higher than the detection limit of the methods used 3 results and discussion 3 1 tce degradation by bimetals the results of the tce degradation tests conducted using the produced bimetals at different reaction times are shown in fig 2 the results shown in the figure referred to the average values obtained in the different replicates conducted for each test in the figure the error bars relative to the standard deviation of the tests conducted in triplicate are also reported it can be noticed that the deviations obtained in the different replicates were relatively low see error bars in the figure with coefficients of variation i e the ratio between the standard deviation and the average of the replicates in all the performed tests lower than 15 the results were expressed in terms of the normalized concentration of tce in the vapor phase c t r c control as a function of the reaction time t r the degradation kinetic dashed lines in fig 2 were derived from the experimental data assuming a zero order degradation kinetic 5 c t r c control k obs t r 1 with 6 k obs k 0 c 0 7 t r t t l where c t r g mair 3 is the residual tce concentration in the vapor phase measured at the end of each degradation test and c control g mair 3 is the tce concentration of the relative control test k obs d 1 is the slope of the zero order linear kinetic that is equal to the ratio between the zero order degradation rate constant k 0 g mair 3d 1 and c 0 g mair 3 that is the initial concentration of tce in the vials i e 365 g mair 3 t r d is the reaction time that was calculated as a function of the effective duration of the test t d and t l d that is the latency time necessary to obtain the effective contact between tce in the vapor phase and the reactive material this latency time was estimated equal to 4 8 h by considering the volatilization and diffusion of tce vapors in the reactive material and the subsequent dissolution in the interstitial water see section s1 of supplementary material the estimated zero order kinetic constants k 0 and the degradation rates normalized to the specific surface area k ssa are reported in table 1 the k ssa values were estimated as follows zingaretti et al 2020 johnson et al 1996 xu et al 2012 8 k ssa k 0 v ssa m where ssa m2g 1 is the specific surface area estimated for the tested bimetals v is the nominal vial volume 20 ml and m is the bimetal mass used for the batch tce degradation tests 1 g regarding fe cu bimetals fig 2a c the highest tce dechlorination performances were obtained using fe 1 cu with a 99 9 tce reduction in 2 days and a zero order kinetic constant of 207 g mair 3d 1 using fe 5 cu and fe 20 cu lower dechlorination performances were obtained in the degradation tests with a 99 9 removal of tce in 3 4 days and estimated zero order kinetic constants of 153 and 134 g mair 3d 1 respectively see table 1 by normalizing the degradation rate constant to the ssa it was found that the different fe cu bimetals were characterized by a similar reactivity see k ssa values in table 1 conversely using fe ni bimetals better results were obtained compared to fe cu ones in terms of tce degradation performances namely as shown in fig 2d f using the fe ni bimetals a 99 9 tce removal was achieved in maximum 2 days the tce removal in the vapor phase proved to increase passing from 1 of ni to 5 with a slight worsening in the performances adding higher ni contents i e 20 specifically using fe 1 ni a 99 9 degradation of the contaminant was observed in a shorter reaction time compared to the analogue fe cu bimetal with an estimated zero order kinetic constant of 278 g mair 3d 1 see table 1 furthermore using fe 5 ni the zero order kinetic constants increased to 332 g mair 3d 1 while using fe 20 a slight decrease of the constant to 300 g mair 3d 1 was observed see table 1 in addition the k ssa values estimated for fe 5 ni and fe 20 ni were similar and slightly higher than fe 1 ni see table 1 the removal kinetic performances observed in this work were found consistent with the 1 day batch tests carried out by settimi et al 2022 in such preliminary tests settimi et al 2022 found that fe ni bimetals were more reactive towards dechlorination compared to fe cu ones and fe 5 ni and fe 1 ni ensured the highest tce degradation it is worth noting that in this work the tce degradation trends resulted well fitted by a linear zero order kinetic this result is in contrast with different studies on tce degradation by bimetals carried out in the aqueous phase e g kim and carraway 2003 venkateshaiah et al 2022 or in the gas phase using zvi alone zingaretti et al 2019 2020 that observed exponential first order kinetics although other studies on the degradation kinetics of tce in the gas phase by bimetals are not available it can be argued that the kinetics obtained in this work reflect the degradation expected for high concentrations in the gas phase note that in these experiments the initial tce vapor concentration was near to the saturation thus not excluding that for lower concentrations below the detection limit of 0 01 g mair 3 achieved in this work exponential trend can be expected in terms of treatment time using the bimetals tested in this work enhanced performances in terms of tce removal in the vapor phase compared to the results obtained by zingaretti et al 2020 using zvi only were observed zingaretti et al 2020 indeed using different types of iron powders in analogous degradation tests observed a 99 9 removal of tce after more than 2 weeks of reaction in this study instead analogous tce removal rates in the vapor phase were observed for reaction times of 2 4 days for fe cu and 2 days for fe ni bimetals thus suggesting that the combination of the milling treatment and the addition of the secondary metal catalyst on zvi allowed to significantly improve the tce degradation performances in the vapor phase regarding the different performances of the two types of bimetals tested in this work the obtained results are consistent with the previous findings available in the literature based on the experiments carried out in the aqueous phase it is indeed recognized that fe ni systems allow obtaining better performances for tce degradation compared to fe cu ones in fact ni is a better catalyst for the dechlorination of chlorinated compounds than cu due to the different reaction mechanisms kim and carraway 2003 in particular the effects promoted by the presence of the catalyst metal on iron are the enhancement of electron transfer by iron corrosion creating a galvanic couple in the bimetal and the dissociation of molecular hydrogen he et al 2018 besides the better catalytic ability of fe ni systems compared to fe cu ones is probably due to the fact that ni can catalyze both electron transfer and dechlorination by the dissociation of h2 produced from the corrosion of zvi he et al 2018 ruan et al 2019 while cu catalyzes the degradation of tce mainly through galvanic corrosion duan et al 2016 for example kim and carraway 2003 chao et al 2012 he et al 2018 and venkateshaiah et al 2022 produced bimetallic particles based on iron coupled with ni and cu and other transition metals with chemical deposition to degrade tce in the aqueous phase obtaining faster removals using fe ni bimetals compared to fe cu ones furthermore the tce removal results obtained using the produced materials are comparable with previous literature on the degradation of chlorinated compounds in the aqueous phase by zvi bimetals liu et al 2022 prepared several fe ni bimetals with different ni contents in the range of 0 5 10 and observed faster tce removal performances in the aqueous phase by increasing the ni content to 5 and a worsening of removal performances for higher ni concentration probably due to the excessive ni load on the zvi surface chao et al 2012 studied fe cu bimetals with cu contents in the range of 0 4 14 to dechlorinate 4 chlorophenol 4 cp and observed a decrease in the kinetic constant increasing the cu content the obtained results and the ones reported in the literature highlight that increasing the ni content until 5 in fe ni bimetals resulted in improving tce removal while adding high cu content on fe cu bimetals higher than 1 probably results in lowering the dechlorination efficiency the dechlorination ability of bimetals in the vapor phase was instead poorly investigated to our knowledge only grenier et al 2004 tested fe 40 ni particles to degrade cis 1 2 dichloroethylene cis dce in the vapor phase and observed better performances compared to using iron alone finally considering the relatively low values of specific surface area ssa measured for the bimetals produced in the range of 0 2 0 7 m2g 1 see settimi et al 2022 it can be argued that the catalysis of iron corrosion and of atomic hydrogen generation induced by the presence of cu or ni is the main factor affecting the enhancement in tce removal performances comparing to the use of iron alone the results obtained in terms of k ssa confirmed that ni has better catalytic activity than cu in enhancing dechlorination with catalysis playing a key role rather than the ssa of the particles 3 2 degradation byproducts the byproducts detected at the end of the tce degradation tests see fig s1 were similar to those found by zingaretti et al 2019 2020 in which several zvi powders were tested for the degradation of tce in the vapor phase with the same layout used in this work these byproducts were identified as c3 6 hydrocarbons as found in previous studies on tce degradation in the vapor phase induced by zvi zingaretti et al 2019 2020 campbell et al 1997 neither vinyl chloride nor dichloroethylene peaks were detected in the tested conditions above their method detection limits that were in the order of 0 01 g mair 3 these results suggest that the addition of cu or ni on iron did not influence the degradation pathway of tce but only catalyzed the degradation reactions based on the chromatograms reported in fig s1 a tce mass balance was performed by comparing the residual tce and the c3 6 hydrocarbon byproducts i e degraded tce masses detected at the end of the degradation tests with the tce mass measured in the parallel control tests in particular the degraded tce mass was estimated by stoichiometrically converting the byproducts chromatographic peaks areas detected at the end of the degradation tests using a relative response factor to gc fid for c3 6 hydrocarbons to tce based on average literature values thermo environmental instruments 2000 more details on the tce mass balance calculation are reported in section 2 of supplementary material the tce mass balance fig s2 resulted in all tests almost equal to 100 i e the sum of the residual and degraded tce masses was approximately equal to the mass of tce detected in the control test thus the removal of tce in the vapor phase obtained in the different degradation tests can be mainly ascribed to a reduction of tce to c3 6 hydrocarbons while other effects such as adsorption of tce on the reactive material and the presence of other byproducts e g vc or dce can be considered negligible 3 3 sequential dechlorination experiments the results obtained in the sequential dechlorination experiments carried out using fe 5 cu and fe 5 ni bimetals are shown in fig 3 the materials were repeatedly used in tce degradation tests for 5 successive cycles the reaction time chosen for each cycle of treatment was 3 days because a 99 9 tce removal was expected using both bimetals a fairly constant extent of dechlorination was observed in all 5 cycles for both the bimetals tested in particular using fe 5 cu bimetal fig 3a the dechlorination percentages remained over 95 with good reproducibility of the tests conducted in triplicate similarly using fe 5 ni bimetal fig 3b the dechlorination remained over 95 in the first 4 cycles and lowered to almost 90 at the end of the 5th cycle similar results were achieved in previous studies using fe cu and fe ni bimetals in successive dechlorination experiments carried out in the aqueous phase for instance liu et al 2017 tested a ball milled fe 5 cu in 5 cycles of 4 cp dechlorination with 10 h of reaction time observing good stability with dechlorination percentages between 93 and 97 xu et al 2012 performed 10 cycles of dechlorination experiments using a ball milled fe 15 ni bimetal with a reaction time of 60 min observing good stability i e removal percentages higher than 90 in 4 cp degradation for all the cycles zhang et al 2018 performed 10 cycles of 4 cp dechlorination using a fe ni bimetal observing good removal rates i e higher than 90 in the first 5 cycles and a slight worsening after the 5th cycle but maintaining the dechlorination percentages higher than 85 3 4 estimation of the hprb thickness based on the results obtained in the batch tests it was estimated the thickness of a hypothetical horizontal permeable reactive barrier hprb placed in the unsaturated zone for attenuating tce in the vapor phase in eq 9 is reported the simplified relationship used to evaluate the thickness of the hprb necessary to attenuate the tce vapors neglecting possible factors e g passivation that can affect the treatment over time 9 c hprb in c hprb out k 0 t where k 0 g mair 3d 1 is the zero order degradation constant obtained from the tce batch degradation experiments for each material tested t d is the time necessary for the contaminated vapors to pass through the barrier and c hprb in g mair 3 and c hprb out g mair 3 are respectively the tce concentration in the vapor phase at the bottom and at the top of the barrier although uncommon in contaminated sites as a worst case scenario the concentration of tce entering the barrier c hprb in was set equal to 515 8 g mair 3 which corresponds to the maximum tce concentration in the vapor phase calculated as the product of the tce solubility in water 1 28 103 mg l 1 u s epa 2017 and the dimensionless henry s constant relative to tce 0 403 at 25 c u s epa 2017 c hprb out was instead set equal to zero for assessing the minimum thickness needed to ensure a complete degradation of tce vapors in the hprb the time necessary for the contaminated vapors to pass through the barrier t was calculated as follows crank 1979 10 t d 2 2 d hprb where d m is the preliminary estimated hprb minimum thickness necessary to obtain a complete removal of tce from the contaminated vapors passing through the barrier and d hprb m2h 1 is the diffusion coefficient of tce in the vapor phase in the hprb calculated by the following relationship millington and quirk 1961 11 d hprb d a tce θ a hprb 10 3 θ e hprb 2 where θ e hprb and θ a hprb are the effective and the air filled porosity of the reactive bed respectively assumed equal to 0 5 and 0 15 zingaretti et al 2019 and d a tce cm2s 1 is the tce diffusion coefficient in air assumed equal to 0 0687 cm2s 1 u s epa 2015 substituting eq 10 into eq 9 it was possible to calculate the minimum hprb thickness for each tested material as follows 12 d 2 d hprb c hprb in k 0 the calculated minimum hprb thicknesses required to degrade the tce vapors using the different bimetals tested are reported in table 2 according to this theoretical calculation a thickness of the hprb in the order of 20 cm could be potentially sufficient to efficiently degrade tce vapors this could represent a significant improvement compared to previous estimations by zingaretti et al 2020 that for zvi alone estimated that a barrier of 1 m was needed to attenuate the tce vapor concentrations of 99 9 note that in the case of tce concentrations in the vapor phase lower than the saturation concentration i e 515 8 g mair 3 the thickness of the hprb can be lower than 20 cm namely the thickness required for obtaining a complete tce removal as a function of the tce concentration in the vapor phase are shown in fig 4 in the figure three different values of initial concentration of tce in the vapor phase are assumed i e the saturation concentration in the vapor phase c sat vap the 50 of saturation 50 c sat vap and the 10 of saturation 10 c sat vap it can be observed that assuming a concentration equal to the 10 of the saturation concentration i e more representative of what can be expected in the case of diffuse groundwater contamination the minimum hprb thickness to ensure a complete tce removal for all the tested materials can be of 5 cm or lower it is worth pointing out that these hprb thicknesses are purely indicative as they were calculated on the basis of different simplifying assumptions that do not account for the long term behavior of bimetals in the field e g reduction of the performances due to iron passivation scaled up experiments are thus needed for a proper design of hprb that can ensure an effective treatment of vapors in the subsurface 3 5 iron consumption due to oxidation in the hprb assuming a complete dechlorination of tce vapors in the hprb it is possible to estimate the lifetime of the barrier t hprb ox as a result of the consumption of iron due to its oxidation verginelli et al 2017 13 t hprb ox ρ b d hprb η zvi γ j hprb where d hprb m is the hprb thickness that was considered equal to 0 2 m according to the results discussed in the previous section j hprb g m 2d 1 is the flux of vapors through the barrier γ gzvi gtce is the stoichiometric mass ratio between iron and tce η zv i is the weight ratio between zvi and the catalyst forming the bimetals and ρ b ton m 3 is the density of the considered material iron or bimetals the stoichiometric mass ratio between iron and tce γ can be considered equal to 1 275 gzvigtce 1 from the following degradation reaction zingaretti et al 2019 14 3 f e 0 c 2 hc l 3 3 h 3 f e 2 c 2 h 4 3 c l furthermore the percentage ratio by weight between zvi and the catalyst forming the bimetals η zv i was calculated as follows 15 η zvi m zvi m zvi m cat the weight ratio used to create bimetals η zv i is equal to 0 99 0 95 and 0 8 for fe 1 catalyst fe 5 catalyst and fe 20 catalyst respectively furthermore ρ b ton m 3 is the density of the bimetal used in the barrier that according to verginelli et al 2017 was estimated based on the masses of iron m zvi and catalyst m cat the densities of the materials constituting the reactive bed ρ cat and ρ zvi and its effective porosity θ e set to 0 5 zingaretti et al 2020 16 ρ b m cat m zvi m cat ρ cat m zvi ρ zvi 1 1 θ e the densities of the catalysts and iron were set equal to respectively 8 96 ton m 3 for cu 8 90 ton m 3 for ni and 7 86 ton m 3 for zvi u s epa 2017 using eq 16 bimetal densities produced were esteemed equal to respectively 3 93 ton m 3 for fe 1 cu and fe 1 ni 3 95 ton m 3 for fe 5 cu and fe 5 ni 4 03 ton m 3 for fe 20 cu and 4 02 ton m 3 for fe 20 ni the flux of vapors through the barrier was estimated assuming a 1 d diffusion dominated transport with zero order reaction 17 d hprb 2 c z 2 k 0 θ w h 0 where c g mair 3 is the concentration of tce in the vapor phase in the hprb θ w is the water filled porosity in the barrier assumed 0 35 zingaretti et al 2019 k 0 g mair 3d 1 is the zero order degradation kinetic constant characteristic of each material tested as potential filling material for hprbs d hprb m2d 1 is the diffusion coefficient of tce through the barrier see eq 11 and h is the dimensionless henry s constant of tce equal to 0 403 at 25 c u s epa 2015 an analytical solution of eq 17 was obtained assuming as boundary conditions a vapor concentration equal to c hprb in entering the barrier z 0 and a negligible concentration leaving the barrier with a thickness d hprb i e assuming a complete tce removal through the hprb assumed at z d hprb 18 c z 0 c hprb in 19 c z d hprb c hprb out 0 based on these initial and boundary conditions the following analytical solution was obtained 20 c z k 0 θ w 2 d h p r b h z 2 k 0 θ w d h p r b 2 d hprb h c hprb in d hprb z c hprb in by differentiating eq 20 with respect to z the vapor flux through the barrier can be calculated as 21 j hprb d hprb c z d hprb z k 0 θ w d hprb 2 2 h d hprb c hprb in 2 h d hprb assuming d hprb equal to 0 2 m i e a sufficient thickness for complete tce removal for each material tested and c hprb in equal to the saturation of tce in the vapor phase i e 515 8 g mair 3 by substituting eqs 15 16 and 21 into eq 13 it was found that the consumption time of the iron in the hprb with a fixed thickness of 0 2 m is in the range of 40 70 years depending on the material chosen see table 2 note that the estimated lifetime of zvi in terms of its consumption it is expected to be higher than other filling material such as potassium permanganate kmno4 for which verginelli et al 2017 estimated a lifetime in the order of 10 20 years thus these results highlighted that the lifetime of the barrier in terms of iron consumption is not an issue however other phenomena such as iron passivation need to be investigated to evaluate the long term effectiveness of this application schrick et al 2002 guan et al 2015 4 conclusions tce degradation in the vapor phase under partially saturated conditions by fe cu and fe ni bimetals was investigated by performing batch degradation tests at different reaction times 4 h 7 days a zero order degradation kinetic was observed using all the tested materials with rate constants in the range of 134 332 g mair 3d 1 in all the experiments up to 99 9 degradation of tce vapors was obtained after 2 4 days of reaction in particular using fe cu bimetals a 99 9 tce degradation was reached in a maximum of 4 days of treatment fe 1 cu showed the best tce removal performances while higher cu contents i e 5 20 resulted in lower tce dechlorination performances as also observed in previous studies carried out in the aqueous phase chao et al 2012 conversely fe ni systems showed better tce dechlorination results obtaining a 99 9 tce degradation in maximum 2 days higher tce removal performances were achieved using a ni content of 5 compared to 1 and 20 similar findings were also obtained in a previous study carried out in the aqueous phase liu et al 2022 the improved results observed using fe ni compared to fe cu are consistent with previous literature on tce degradation in the aqueous phase kim and carraway 2003 chao et al 2012 he et al 2018 venkateshaiah et al 2022 furthermore the stability of the dechlorination ability of the produced bimetals was investigated by performing 5 cycles of tce degradation tests with 3 days of reaction time each using fe 5 cu and fe 5 ni bimetals observing relatively stable and over 90 tce removal performances at the end of each degradation test c3 6 hydrocarbons were detected as reaction byproducts in analogy to previous studies zingaretti et al 2019 2020 based on the areas of the detected peaks measured from the chromatograms a tce mass balance was performed which accounted for almost 100 suggesting that tce removal was mainly ascribed to tce dehalogenation while other effects e g adsorption on the reactive materials and the formation of other degradation byproducts e g vc or dce can be considered negligible the produced fe cu and fe ni bimetals showed a significant enhancement in reactivity towards tce vapors compared to zvi alone tested in previous studies zingaretti et al 2019 2020 probably ascribed to the presence of the catalyst kim and carraway 2003 venkateshaiah et al 2022 but also to the milling treatment which can form strains and defects in the particles that can favor the electron transfer and release xu et al 2012 yin et al 2022 in view of using the tested bimetals as constituents for hprbs the experimental results obtained were integrated into an analytical model to simulate the reactive transport through the reactive barrier estimating that an hprb in the range of 20 cm could potentially ensure an effective reduction of tce vapors the values obtained were quite smaller than the ones estimated by zingaretti et al 2020 for an hprb made by zvi which accounted for 1 m thus further highlighting the better performances of bimetals compared to iron alone finally the iron consumption due to oxidation of the hprb was estimated in the range of 40 70 years i e higher than other filling materials proposed in the literature e g kmno4 verginelli et al 2017 these findings highlighted that the lifetime of the barrier in terms of iron consumption is not an issue although to estimate the effective lifetime of the barrier also passivation phenomena of bimetals need to be investigated to evaluate the long term effectiveness of the treatment as reported in previous studies schrick et al 2002 guan et al 2015 it is also worth noting that in view of using the produced bimetals for hprbs it could be necessary to use complementary filling materials e g sand to avoid possible vapors diffusion problems and lateral bypass during the treatment that could affect the barrier design parameters thus further tests will be needed for a future scale up of the proposed technology credit authorship contribution statement clarissa settimi methodology
