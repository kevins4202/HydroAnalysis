24170,modeling processes span multiple disciplines and aim to generate new knowledge about a given process or system for subsequent analysis or control mathematical models are representations of these systems using mathematical equations and parameters which may or may not be interpretable depending on their application or use in the specific case of the life cycle of l botrana the goal of the mathematical model is to develop a model based decision support system mb dss that enables experts to monitor the evolution of the pest using predictive models based on these predictions timely decisions can be made to control and eradicate the pest the interpretability of model parameters is critical to the design of mb dss systems this paper analyzes the response of the growth model of l botrana under laboratory conditions and proposes a new structure that considers two limiting factors of growth temperature and relative humidity the proposed analysis seeks to determine the best growth kinetics while preserving the compromise between the model s fit to experimental data interpretability identifiability and sensitivity of the model parameters the results show an improvement in the fit descriptive capacity and number of inputs considered by the model graphical abstract keywords lobesia botrana growth kinetics interpretability parametric sensitivity identifiability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mathematical models represent a means of obtaining information about the behavior of systems and they should describe or reflect in some way the relevant properties of the system being modeled mathematical models are never identical to the actual process and are usually substantially less complex because they are a simplified representation of the phenomena occurring in the process hangos and cameron 2001 to represent a real world problem in mathematical terms knowledge of the phenomena taking place in the system to be modeled is required the scope of the mathematical model must be delimited and the available data their precision and those variables that are not available to be measured must be taken into account in this sense in fields such as biology ecology or medicine among others there are two main approaches for the processes representation in mathematical terms this is empirical models and first principles based semi physical models fpbsm hangos and cameron 2001 the former uses the measurement data of the inputs and outputs of the process or system to build a model of it and therefore its structure and parameters are estimated bohlin 2006 the fpbsm uses an appropriate combination of expert knowledge theories laws or principles to determine the structure of the model and some values of the model parameters and then uses measured experimental data to find values for parameters of the already proposed structure lema perez 2018 it is required to highlight that the parameters of a model are as important as its structure parametric interpretability is a property that accounts for the meaning of a parameter within a mathematical model the greater the interpretability of a model the greater its explanatory capacity this facilitates the extraction of knowledge from the mathematical model both from its state variables and from other internal structures of the model functional and structural parameters as well as the development of model based decision support systems the above highlighting that although less interpretable models such as empirical ones provide valuable information about the system state variables modeled it is difficult to infer additional knowledge regarding the modeled process authors such as cano et al 2013 state that the interpretability of a model is as important as its accuracy on the other hand authors such as lema perez 2018 and lopez restrepo et al 2020 addressed the theoretical issues related to parametric interpretability by defining the concepts of general interpretability and contextualized interpretability in recent years the concept of interpretability has gained importance especially in the area of empirical modeling since several authors in the field have explored different techniques to provide this type of model with physical meaning nauck 2003 emphasized the importance of parametric interpretability stating that this quality is especially important in areas where humans often make decisions or in those applications where machines support or are responsible for such decision making based on the premise that in order to generate an interpretable model it is necessary to be able to measure its degree of interpretability the authors proposed in their work an interpretability index applied to neuro fuzzy systems narayanan and ching 2019 and le and clarke 2019 proposed techniques or methods to provide parametric interpretability to different empirical mathematical models these works highlighted the need to maintain the interpretability accuracy trade off during mathematical model developing however while in the area of empirical modeling interpretability is an issue of current relevance in the area of gray box modeling some questions remain unresolved such as why is parameter interpretability important in gray box models is there any relationship between the interpretability of a parameter and its identifiability this paper addresses the concept of parametric interpretability in the context of the application of modeling the growth process of lobesia botrana lobesia botrana or grapevine moth is a pest of economic importance for various countries including the argentine republic where there is under official control thus phytosanitary control of the pest includes monitoring activities through the use of pheromone traps or delta traps chemical biological control activities based on the use of pesticides and control actions by sexual confusion based on the use of pheromones in the environment to confuse the males all of the above with the objective of containing the diffusion of pest altamira et al 2020 altimira et al 2021 different researchers around the world especially in europe have focused their efforts on developing mathematical models that describe the life cycle and voltinism process of l botrana considering the environmental conditions of each region to develop decision support systems dss that serve as a predictive tool for personnel making decisions regarding pest control in 1981 touzeau et al presented the first biological model to predict the life cycle of the grapevine moth touzeau 1981 subsequently other researchers in armend√°riz et al 2007 burgardta et al 2010 and dagatti and becerra 2015 presented modifications or simplifications of touzeau s model for other regions of the world amo salas et al 2011 presented an empirical model in 2011 for determining the maximum flight times of l botrana they emphasize the need for a biologically plausible model or one that can be explained or justified biologically control methods are most effective when applied at the moth s most vulnerable stages according to the authors according to ortega lopez et al 2014 the generation of knowledge about the pest would assist winegrowers in making optimal decisions to control the pest they propose a prediction model and stress that the model must incorporate biotic and abiotic factors to address the sustainable management of pests such as l botrana gilioli et al 2016 developed a stochastic mathematical model based on field data the authors place special emphasis on estimating biodemographic variables of moths abiotic factors including mortality rates and growth rates carlos et al 2018 in 2018 pointed out that accurate phenological information is crucial to the effective application of pesticides against l botrana based on data collected in the field the authors developed a mathematical model for the degree days dd their model included biotic and abiotic variables in order to aid in the design of decision support systems in 2020 authors such as rossini and castex presented novel approaches that sought to describe the life cycle and voltinism of l botrana in order to describe the critical stages of development and define strategies for the containment of the pest castex et al 2020 rossini et al 2020a rossini in the same year in rossini et al 2020b emphasized the importance of having biologically meaningful parameters in the moth life cycle models in order to facilitate the interaction between the end user and the mathematical model the current study analyzes the response of the fpbsm model to l botrana growth rates under laboratory conditions considering temperature and humidity as growth limiting factors aguirre zapata et al 2022 in order to analyze the goodness of fit of the kinetics in the mathematical model three properties are taken into account i structural identifiability of the mathematical model ii sensitivity coefficients of the model regarding each kinetic parameter and iii the parameters interpretability of each kinetic the growth kinetics were selected based on the best combination of the properties mentioned above the idea is to obtain the best representation of the growth process of l botrana with the highest percentage of fit while maintaining the interpretability and identifiability of the model parameters this work proposes the use of properties such as parametric interpretability identifiability and sensitivity during the modeling process this work is organized as follows in section 2 the equations of the l botrana life cycle model are presented discusses the different growth limiting factors for the month as well as their effects on different growth stages and describes some of the most commonly used growth kinetics in the literature in section 3 the results corresponding to the sensitivity analysis and parameter adjustment developed for each of the kinetics described in section 2 3 are presented finally section 4 summarizes the modeling results and discusses the properties analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 life cycle process model of lobesia botrana semi physical models based on first principles are usually composed of a basic structure whose parameters are called structural parameters and an extended structure made up of the constitutive and assessment equations that describe the structural parameters of the model the parameters of this second level of the specification are called functional parameters 2 1 1 basic model structure in aguirre zapata et al 2022 the development of a semi physical model based on first principles fpbsm for the life cycle process of l botrana in laboratory conditions and particularized for the region of cuyo in argentina was presented the model was developed based on the methodology proposed by in alvarez et al in alvarez et al 2009 the proposed model is a nonlinear continuous time model constituted by four differential equations where each one of them represents one of four stages of month growth 16 constitutive and assessment equations and 14 parameters and constants 1 d e l t

of live adults k j is the growth rate for each growth stage and k j d is the mortality rate associated with each growth stage where the subindex j represents each of the moth s growth stages this is egg larvae pupae and adult 2 1 2 extended structure the eqs 5 8 constitutes the extended structure of the life cycle model of l botrana in aguirre zapata et al 2022 the modeling hypothesis is considered to describe in detail the relationships posed in the equations in the original model growth rates were modeled from a monod equation considering the accumulated degree days add as the only limiting factor for growth as shown in eqs 5 to 7 the growth equation is understood as the mathematical relationship that represents the transition between each of the moth s growth stages egg larvae

correspond to the maximum growth rate for each growth stage see eq 8 that are calculated based on the mortality rates at each time instant d d j is the degree days for each growth stage a d d j is the cumulative degree days described by the touzeau equation widely used in the literature touzeau 1981 k j s is the half velocity constant for each growth stage the other parameters and constants of the mathematical model are presented in table 1 2 2 limiting growth factors 2 2 1 temperature according to the literature the temperature is an abiotic factor with the greatest influence on the growth process and voltinism of l botrana and the most important driving force in this type of living organism that lacks internal temperature regulation mechanisms the moth mortality rate is low at medium temperatures regardless of relative humidity making these temperatures ideal for moth growth moosavi et al 2018 study highlights that direct exposure to high temperatures increases the mortality of eggs and larvae and changes how eggs hatch moth generations are determined by accumulated degree days in a given area in some regions with optimal temperature conditions 10 c to 30 c there are two to four generations per year while in regions with more extreme temperatures there are five generations per year rios castro et al 2016 2 2 2 relative humidity according to the literature low temperatures with high humidity and high temperatures with low humidity have negative effects on insect development the most favorable condition occurs at temperatures of 25 30 c accompanied by the relative humidity of 55 65 al zyoud and elmosa 2001 venette et al 2003 similarly extreme temperatures and humidity strongly affect the development of l botrana gabel and thi√©ry 1994 it is known that relative humidity plays a crucial role on the embryonic coscoll√° et al 1986 and imaginal torres vila et al 1993 stages of l botrana likewise the evolution of the embryogenesis process is strongly influenced by temperature egg survival as well as diapause and inhibition are determined by the combined action of humidity and temperature gabel and thi√©ry 1994 vitta 2020 the number of generations is determined by a combination of several factors including photoperiod the temperature in relation to the developmental threshold and microclimate together with low humidity latitude and feeding type vitta 2020 table 2 presents a summary of some works related to the mathematical modeling of the life cycle of l botrana and its relationship with the environmental variables considered in the current work temperature and humidity in this sense and taking as a starting point the modularity of mathematical models based on first principles fpbsm the addition of the parameter relative humidity as a limiting factor of moth growth is considered the above in order to enrich the predictions of the mathematical model guarantees its identifiability and seeks to maintain the interpretability of its parameters in the context of the model application in the mathematical model developed in aguirre zapata et al 2022 the temperature in degree days was considered as the only limiting factor for the growth ofl botrana however since relative humidity can favor or inhibit the development of the moth in this work this limiting factor is added amo salas et al 2011 altimira et al 2021 2 3 growth kinetics equations as described in aguirre zapata et al 2022 the model presented in eqs 1 4 was developed based on the hypothesis that the moth growth process could be represented by means of equations and parameters that are characteristic of the modeling of the growth process of some microorganisms in this sense different mathematical structures are found in the literature to describe the kinetics of growth in biological systems such as those presented in monod 1949 moser et al 1958 and peringer et al 1974 most of these are generalizable to the growth process of different microorganisms or specific for modeling the growth kinetics of l botrana like the one presented by pasquali et al 2018 all of the above equations differ from each other in the number of parameters considered and their parametric interpretability the kinetics considered are evaluated and compared in terms of identifiability and parametric interpretability in order to select the one that allows a better model fit without sacrificing the interpretability of the model parameters in the following subscript j refers to the stages of l botrana thus j 1 the egg stage j 2 the larval stage j 3 the pupal stage and j 4 the adult stage the new growth limiting factor is added as a summation considering that both factors temperature and humidity are equally influential in the development process and neither of them inhibits the effect of the other 2 3 1 the monod equation kinetic equations describing the specific growth rate Œº of microorganisms as a function of substrate concentration s are a valuable tool in biotechnological processes when conditions can be chosen such that only one compound is growth limiting the monod equation is often used eq 9 this is a mathematical model that relates microbial growth rates in an aqueous medium to the concentration of a limiting nutrient monod 1949 dochain 1986 heijnen and romein 1995 this equation was proposed by james monod in 1949 and was originally based on the concept of a single rate limiting enzyme which controls growth via michaelis menten kinetics copeland 2000 9 Œº m o n o d t Œº m a x s t k s s t where Œº is the specific growth rate of the microorganism Œº m a x is the maximum specific growth rate of the microorganism s is the concentration of the growth limiting substrate and k s is the half velocity constant growth stages Œº m a x and k s are empirical coefficients that differ among species and are in function of environmental conditions okpokwasili and nweke 2006 in the model described above aguirre zapata et al 2022 the growth rates of each phenomenological stage were modeled using a monod equation see eq 5 considering the accumulated degree days add as the limiting factor considering the air humidity as a second

kinetic models which describe the growth rate of a biological population as a function of a single limiting substrate is given by eq 11 bader 1978 where the term a j is an empirical parameter with no physical meaning 11 Œº e x p t Œº m a x t 1 e a j s t k s it is used less frequently than the monod model because the exponential term leads to mathematical complexities that are often avoided bader

j h both growth limiting factors are assumed to have the same value of a j although these values could be different since they have no concrete physical meaning they can be assumed to be the same for both 2 3 3 mankad and bungay equation mb mankad and bungay proposed a model for microbial growth with more than one limiting nutrient mankad and bungay 1988 this model uses conventional monod formulations and weighs the contribution of potentially limiting nutrients according to their half saturation constants no coefficients other than those found in the monod equations are introduced for each limiting nutrient in this approach growth rates under dual substrate limitation are expressed in terms of the weighted average of rates under individual nutrient limitations 13 13 Œº m b t Œº m a

hill equation is an enzyme kinetics equation used to describe the degree of cooperativity in non michaelian kinetics weiss 1997 distefano 2015 the simplest form of the hill function of order n is

growth logan et al 1976 thereby resolving the inability of the original model to estimate a low temperature growth threshold lactin et al 1995 the growth rate function 20 describe the growth response curve typically there is no growth below a lower temperature threshold while the growth rate increases and reaches a maximum at an optimal temperature and then it declines rapidly approaching zero at

Œ≥ s is the asymptote to which the function tends at low temperatures and Œ¥ s is a coefficient of amplification of the curve using this kinetic model pasquali estimated the parameters of the growth rate function for l botrana pasquali et al 2018 by means of the least square method using the dataset reported in briere and pracros 1998 and baumg√§rtner and baronio 1988 the value of parameters for all stages are given in table 3 as already mentioned humidity is considered the second limiting factor therefore given that the lactin equation only considers temperature as a limiting factor in this work looking for simplicity a monod equation is added to the lactin function to represent the effect of humidity on the rate of development eq 21 the equations are summed in order to consider the effect of both growth limiting factors temperature and humidity such summation is reasonable considering that i both equations are dimensionless ii moth development occurs when both limiting growth factors are under optimal conditions as described in section 3 iii an addition and not a product or subtraction is described considering that moth development is modulated by both growth limiting factors in equal measure and because they are of similar order of magnitude neither inhibits the effect of the other 21 k j t Œ¥ j m a x 0 e Œ± j t t e Œ± j t m t m t t Œ≤ j Œ≥ j Œº j m a x t h t k j

goodness of the model mathematical structure and the availability of experimental data with relevant information for the identification of this set of parameters the analysis of the identifiability of a mathematical model focuses on two fundamental aspects i the evaluation of the structure of the mathematical model structural identifiability and ii the problem of identifying the unknown parameters of the model practical identifiability brun et al 2001 balsa canto et al 2010 2 4 1 structural identifiability structural identifiability analysis focuses on the possibility of finding a unique set of parameters for a model taking into account the mathematical structure of the model the structural identifiability of a model can be local unique solution within a neighborhood or global unique solution in the whole parameters space in this work the strike goldd structural identifiability taken as extended generalized observability with lie derivatives and decomposition software is used to carry out the structural identifiability analysis of the l botrana life cycle model considering the different growth kinetics cited in section 2 3 the strike goldd software was presented by villaverde et al in 2016 and is a tool to perform structural identifiability analysis of complex mathematical models used in systems biology and other areas of knowledge using a differential geometry approach in their proposal the authors reformulate the identifiability problem as an augmented observability problem in which the rank of the observability identifiability matrix which is constructed using lie derivatives gives information about the local structural identifiability of the parameters a previous structural identifiability analysis was performed for the growth model of l botrana under laboratory conditions and with a single limiting factor of growth temperature zapata et al 2022 in the current work both temperature and humidity are considered as limiting factors of growth within each of the presented growth kinetics for all cases monod exponential mankad hill and lactin kinetics the result was that the variable mortality rates i e larval k l d pupal k p d and adult k a d are structurally locally identifiable all the other empirical parameters of growth kinetics turned out to be structurally unidentifiable which implies that it is not possible to find a unique value for them neither in a general way nor in a specific neighborhood these parameters were adjusted heuristically seeking to reduce the prediction error of the mathematical model to regarding the experimental data and considering the restrictions of each parameter according to its meaning and nature 2 4 2 practical identifiability although structural identifiability makes it possible to evaluate the goodness of the mathematical structure of a developed model and to ensure that its structural parameters are uniquely identifiable in practice this may not be possible due to the lack of information contained in the experimental data used for this purpose by applying practical identifiability analysis one can evaluate whether it is possible to assign unique values to the unknown parameters of a mathematical model using experimental data or experimental schemes subject to noise experimental data and experimental noise are closely related to this property practical identifiability can be determined in two ways i a apriori to anticipate the quality of the selected experimental scheme or ii a posteriori to assess the quality of the parameter estimates after calibration or adjustment of the mathematical model balsa canto et al 2010 in this work an a priori practical identifiability analysis is performed through the sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the mathematical model used this analysis is performed considering the model parameters as individuals within the model and the sensitivity of the rigid parameters parameter combinations postulated in monsalve bravo et al 2022 is not considered the a posteriori practical identifiability analysis is not addressed due to the limitations of conducting new l botrana cultivation experiments under laboratory conditions 2 4 3 sensitivity analysis as described by garcia tirado et al in garcia tirado et al 2018 a sensitivity analysis on the influence of the parameters on the model output could be enlightening for two of the main problems associated with the lack of practical identifiability this is i correlated parameters and ii parameters with no influence on the model output chis et al suggested the use of sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative influence of parameters on model output and to anticipate the lack of structural or practical identifiability chis et al 2011 in this sense parametric sensitivity makes it possible to classify and rank the parameters of a model in terms of their relative influence on the model s predictions outputs balsa canto et al 2010 local parametric sensitivities can be defined as shown in eq 22 where e corresponds to the experiment number o to the model output and Œ∏ i to the parameters of the mathematical model 22 s e Œ∏ i j e y j e o Œ∏ i t s e o in view of the above balsa canto proposes the use of the latin hypercube sampling lhs method and the use of five factors of importance Œª Œ∏ previously described by brun in brun et al 2001 balsa canto and banga 2011 and balsa canto et al 2016 the above as an alternative to the monte carlo method in terms of computational cost to obtain a more accurate estimate of the classification of the parameters of a model the lhs method allows exploring the sensitivity in a wide parameter space without requiring an excessive number of samples this translates into a lower computational cost especially valuable in gray box mathematical models of bioprocesses which usually have many parameters in this type of models the parametric identification problem goes from seeking to find the real values of a set of unknown parameters to become a problem that seeks to find physically interpretable parameter values in order to adequately describe the input output data of the process the sensitivity coefficients themselves contain relevant information about the importance of individual parameters a large sensitivity coefficient will mean that a change in the parameter Œ∏ n will have a significant effect on the model output y which makes the parameter Œ∏ n identifiable with the available data if all other parameters are fixed the significance factors Œª Œ∏ presented in brun et al 2001 and balsa canto et al 2010 are used to obtain information from the calculation of sensitivities in this sense Œª Œ∏ m s q r presented in eq 23 allows quantifying the sensitivity of the model to a given parameter 23 Œª Œ∏ i m s q r 1 n d m c 1 n l h s e 1 n e o 1 n o s 1 n s s Œ∏ i j e o t s e o 2 where n e is the number of experiments n o the number of observed variables observable n l h s the number of samples in the lhs algorithm n s the specific sampling time for each experiment with a given observable n d n l h s n i n o n s and s Œ∏ i j e o t s e o the parameter sensitivity Œ∏ i with observable j in experiment e with sampling time t s for the particular case of the growth process of l botrana considering that the same sampling time is considered in all the experiments the term s 1 n s is not considered in eq 23 the parameters of the lhs algorithm were set as follows n e 3 because three experiments are available at 20 c 2 c n o 4 because the data are available on the cultivation of l botrana in laboratory conditions in its four growth stages egg larva pupa and adult as described in aguirre zapata et al 2022 and herrera et al 2016 and n l h s 1000 because no significant differences were found with higher number of iterations the results obtained after applying the sensitivity analysis considering each of the kinetics described in section 2 3 are presented below 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis for life cycle model of l botrana in this section based on the importance factor Œª Œ∏ m s q r the qualitative results are presented for each growth kinetic monod exponential mb hill and lactin in two different types of figures the sensitivity curve on the left side allows visualizing the correspondence between the sensitivity factor y axis with a particular parameter x axis in descending order on the other hand the chromatic image of sensitivity on the right side allows visualizing the degree of influence of a particular parameter x axis on a particular output of the mathematical model y axis 3 1 1 monod kinetic for the case of monod kinetics a total of 12 parameters are considered the results of the analysis are presented in fig 1 for this case it is observed that the parameter with the greatest influence on the output of the mathematical model is the mortality rate associated with the egg stage k e d followed by the mortality rates of the other growth stages in this case the parameter with the least influence turned out to be the average growth rate constant associated with moisture in the egg stage k e h 3 1 2 exponential kinetic for the case of exponential kinetics a total of 16 parameters are considered the results of the analysis are presented in fig 2 the parameter with the greatest influence on the output of the life cycle model turns out to be the mortality rate associated with the larval stage k l d followed by the mortality rates of the other stages the uninterpretable parameters a e a l a p and a a turned out to have no influence on the model output so they could take any value 3 1 3 mankad and bungay kinetic mb for the case of mb kinetics a total of 12 parameters are considered the results of the analysis are presented in fig 3 it is important to highlight as it was described in section 2 3 the mb kinetics is a weighted monod equation so it was expected that the parameters would be ranked in the same way the egg stage mortality rate k e d being the parameter with the greatest influence on the model and the k e h parameter having the least influence 3 1 4 hill kinetic for the case of hill kinetics a total of 13 parameters is considered the results of the analysis are presented in fig 4 for this case similar to the exponential kinetics the larval mortality rate k l d turned out to be the parameter with the greatest influence on the output of the mathematical model followed by the egg mortality rate k e d and the exponential factor Œ± the parameter with the least influence is k a t 3 1 5 lactin kinetic for the case of lactin kinetics two different cases were considered i unknown Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ and Œ¥ parameters subject to adjustment i e the analysis was performed with a total of 20 parameters ii Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ and Œ¥ parameters treated as constants since their values are presented in pasquali et al 2018 for the latter case the analysis was performed with a total of 8 parameters the results of the analysis of both cases are presented in fig 5 for case i the amigo2 toolbox resulted in a sensitivity equal to 0 for all parameters such a result may indicate that these parameters have no influence on the output of the mathematical model which does not make sense given the large number of parameters or it could indicate that the available experiments do not contain sufficient information for the identification of this set of parameters i e lack of practical identifiability for case ii considering for the analysis only the mortality rate and the parameters associated to the kinetics with limiting factor humidity it is observed that the parameter with the greatest influence on the model output is the mortality rate of the egg stage k e d and the one with the least influence k a t table 4 summarizes the results quantitatively presenting the values of the sensitivity coefficients for each parameter for the different structures considered based in it it is possible to conclude that for all cases the egg mortality rate has high sensitivity coefficients especially with the mb and lactin kinetics for all the cases in which the k a h parameter was the common denominator it turned out to have the least influence on the output of the mathematical model regarding the exponential kinetics it became evident that when considering it the model lost sensitivity to parameters such as the average growth rate constants which translates into a loss of degrees of freedom for the model fitting 3 2 parameter identification parameter identification was performed considering the methodology proposed in a previous work zapata et al 2022 constant parameters were identified by using the nonlinear least squares method johansson 1993 and time varying parameters were identified by using an extended kalman filter for the identification process unknown parameter vectors were defined as shown in eq 24 24 Œ∏ u m d k e t k e h k l d k l t k l h k p d k p t k p h k a d k a t k a h Œ∏ u e x p

exponential e x p mankad and bungay m b hill h and lactin l c kinetics respectively in all cases the egg mortality rate k e d was not considered in the identification problem since the previous identifiability analysis presented in zapata et al 2022 indicated that this parameter should be fixed to guarantee the identifiability of the other parameters in view of the contextualized interpretability of this parameter it was possible to reconstruct it from experimental data or from existing literature so k e d was set as a known parameter see zapata et al 2022 also once the sensitivity analysis was performed for all cases the egg mortality rate turned out to have a high sensitivity coefficient which indicates that it is the parameter with the greatest impact on the output of the mathematical model the experimental data available for the evaluation of growth kinetics come from a laboratory rearing experiment of l botrana in mendoza argentina under controlled conditions of temperature humidity and photoperiod herrera et al 2016 experimental conditions included a temperature of 20 2 c relative humidity of 30 50 and a photoperiod of 16 8 h l o an artificial diet containing the necessary nutrients was used as a growth medium for the moth ferreira et al 2003 in a previously sterilized container intended for rearing the artificial diet was placed and the eggs that reached adulthood were placed inside three replicas of 30 eggs of 24 h age were made replicates will be referred to as r 1 r 2 and r 3 in this study fig 6 shows the growth curves obtained from laboratory rearing considering that some experimental observations were outside the moth growth trend it was necessary to preprocess the experimental data for identification of unknown parameters the constant parameter values identified by the nonlinear least squares optimization algorithm for each growth kinetic are presented in table 5 the mortality rates error tables and response curves of the model fitted with each growth kinetics are presented below according to the results presented in table 5 it is observed that the parameters associated with the exponential kinetics have considerably lower values than for the other growth kinetics the parameters k l t k l t k p t and k a t are consistent in the order of value identified the other parameters turn out to have differences of one or more orders in the value of their parameters it is of interest to contrast the values of the parameters k l t k l t k p t and k a t obtained in this work with those obtained in zapata et al 2022 where the values found for this set of parameters were Œ∏ 9 8 1 0 3 2 8 1 0 3 5 5 1 0 3 8 5 1 0 3 it is observed that for almost all comparable cases excluding exponential kinetics the order and magnitude of the parameters is maintained which allows maintaining the conclusion presented in zapata et al 2022 that the stage that is mostly influenced by temperature is the larval stage l l below are the qualitative and quantitative results obtained after adjusting the unknown parameters of the mathematical model see eq 24 considering each of the growth kinetics evaluated eq 25 shows the mae mean absolute error performance index used for the quantitative analysis 25 m a e j i 1 n y j x j n 26 m a e j 100 m a e j m a x x j with n the number of experimental points y j the value predicted by the model and x j the experimental value the qualitative results are presented in terms of the absolute error see eq 25 and the absolute percentage error which is calculated as shown in eq 26 the maximum and minimum absolute error for each of the growth stages are also presented 3 2 1 monod equation in fig 7 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the monod growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different replicates at 20 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 6 fig 7 shows that the fit for all growth stages is smooth and follows the trend of the experimental data the egg stage e l shows a fast behavior that may be explained by modeling uncertainties originating from intermediate stages of egg development that were not modeled torres vila 1995 however it is the egg stage that shows the lowest absolute error equivalent to 6 47 the larval stage l l shows over excitation in the first days of growth which causes it to have a minimum absolute error of 1 1 however it adjusts quickly and correctly describes the dynamics of that growth stage the adult stage a l shows one of the highest maximum absolute errors 65 at about day 35 3 2 2 exponential kinetics in fig 8 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the exponential growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different replicates at 20 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 7 fig 8 shows the growth curves fitted considering the exponential kinetics for this case more abrupt changes in dynamics less smooth are observed compared to those obtained with monod kinetics as for the egg stage e l the exponential kinetics allows describing its dynamics more slowly in contrast to the monod kinetics however the adult stage presents an undesirable overshoot which makes the error in this stage higher than 100 the maximum mae error for all stages is significantly higher than the kinetics analyzed in the previous section 3 2 3 mankad equation in fig 9 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the mankad growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different replicates at 20 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 8 in fig 9 the fitting curves of the model with mb kinetics are observed for all cases the fit is adequate however the mb equation is in essence a monod kinetic so this result was expected when using mb kinetics there was a marked improvement over monod in terms of the egg growth curve velocity and absolute error from 6 47 to 4 2 and the over excitation identified in the larval stage with mb kinetics the percent fit for all growth stages was equal to or greater than 74 3 2 4 hill kinetics in fig 10 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the hill growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different replicates at 20 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 9 hill kinetics as shown in fig 10 had a similar fit to that obtained with mb kinetics the main difference between hill kinetics and mb kinetics is observed at the adult stage where there is a small over excitation in the middle of the growth cycle that is compensated in terms of the error with the amplitude of the curve at steady state the hills kinetics favors the model to present a minimum mae absolute error of almost 0 in all its growth stages 3 2 5 lactin equation in fig 11 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the lactin growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different experimental runs at 20 c 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 10 although lactin kinetics was specifically designed for the growth process of l botrana in this work it is the second kinetics with the largest absolute error after exponential kinetics in this case the main problems observed have to do with the speed of response of the egg stage and the overshoots in the following stages being especially significant the overshoot in the adult stage a l 4 conclusions and discussion some papers have attempted to illustrate the trade off between the interpretability of a mathematical model and the degree of fit to experimental data this is why authors such as linardatos et al 2020 state that it is difficult to trust systems whose decisions cannot be interpreted regardless of the fact that as a model s explanatory capacity increases its predictive capacity decreases however linardatos and other authors such as stiglic et al 2020 have not considered identifiability and parametric sensitivity as properties that can influence the degree of fit of mathematical models while accompanying the interpretability of a mathematical model and which therefore are properties that should be considered when delving into the development or derivation of equations that describe the internal dynamics of the modeled processes in this work it was assumed that there is a dependency relationship between the properties evaluated it is i parametric interpretability ii structural identifiability iii parametric sensitivity and iv model fit or precision to experimental data in order to analyze the results obtained in selecting the growth kinetics these properties were considered in order to maintain the degree of compromise between the mathematical model and the intrinsic structural properties table 11 summarizes the properties evaluated in the l botrana growth model the model s percentage fit considering the four growth stages is presented in the table Œ∏ represents the parameters of the growth kinetics i p the number of parameters with interpretability n i p the number of parameters non interpretables lema perez et al 2019 i d the number of identifiable parameters and s c the number of parameters with high h medium m and low l sensitivity in light of the properties analyzed exponential kinetic should be discarded for this application because they have a low fit percentage and also introduce four uninterpretable and non identifiable functional parameters which although the model presents a low sensitivity to them are difficult to adjust making it difficult to match the mathematical model to experimental results although hill kinetic has a high fit percentage it introduces a parameter Œ± that is uninterpretable and cannot be identified with a medium sensitivity coefficient which indicates that small changes in this parameter can have a positive or negative effect on the mathematical model output in mathematical models for the design of decision support systems parameters with medium or high sensitivity should be able to be bounded in their numerical value and have general or contextualized interpretability lema perez et al 2019 so that the user can access a larger number of model parameters to interact with it in terms of interpretability and identifiability the mb kinetics is equal to the monod kinetic since it is an extension of it as a result of its mathematical form larvae and pupae mortality parameters k l d and k p d go from having high sensitivity coefficients to having medium sensitivity coefficients which is not desirable since mortality rates are one of the most important biotic factors in the mathematical model and this should be reflected in the output of the model in conclusion monod s and lactin s kinetics offer the highest percentage of fit of the model to experimental data in terms of interpreting its parameters and knowing the model s sensitivity to all of them the monod kinetics is superior due to the impossibility of determining the model s sensitivity to unknown unidentifiable and uninterpretable lactin kinetic parameters this kinetics is discarded consequently the result of this analysis indicates that monod kinetics more adequately represents the rate of moth development under laboratory conditions offering a better relationship between the properties of interpretability identifiability sensitivity as a result it is necessary to analyze the mathematical model s intrinsic properties as part of the mathematical model s deduction process in particular when selecting the constitutive or valuation equations for the mathematical model and deciding which level of specification the mathematical model will have the analysis of its intrinsic properties is crucial credit authorship contribution statement estefania aguirre zapata

24170,modeling processes span multiple disciplines and aim to generate new knowledge about a given process or system for subsequent analysis or control mathematical models are representations of these systems using mathematical equations and parameters which may or may not be interpretable depending on their application or use in the specific case of the life cycle of l botrana the goal of the mathematical model is to develop a model based decision support system mb dss that enables experts to monitor the evolution of the pest using predictive models based on these predictions timely decisions can be made to control and eradicate the pest the interpretability of model parameters is critical to the design of mb dss systems this paper analyzes the response of the growth model of l botrana under laboratory conditions and proposes a new structure that considers two limiting factors of growth temperature and relative humidity the proposed analysis seeks to determine the best growth kinetics while preserving the compromise between the model s fit to experimental data interpretability identifiability and sensitivity of the model parameters the results show an improvement in the fit descriptive capacity and number of inputs considered by the model graphical abstract keywords lobesia botrana growth kinetics interpretability parametric sensitivity identifiability data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction mathematical models represent a means of obtaining information about the behavior of systems and they should describe or reflect in some way the relevant properties of the system being modeled mathematical models are never identical to the actual process and are usually substantially less complex because they are a simplified representation of the phenomena occurring in the process hangos and cameron 2001 to represent a real world problem in mathematical terms knowledge of the phenomena taking place in the system to be modeled is required the scope of the mathematical model must be delimited and the available data their precision and those variables that are not available to be measured must be taken into account in this sense in fields such as biology ecology or medicine among others there are two main approaches for the processes representation in mathematical terms this is empirical models and first principles based semi physical models fpbsm hangos and cameron 2001 the former uses the measurement data of the inputs and outputs of the process or system to build a model of it and therefore its structure and parameters are estimated bohlin 2006 the fpbsm uses an appropriate combination of expert knowledge theories laws or principles to determine the structure of the model and some values of the model parameters and then uses measured experimental data to find values for parameters of the already proposed structure lema perez 2018 it is required to highlight that the parameters of a model are as important as its structure parametric interpretability is a property that accounts for the meaning of a parameter within a mathematical model the greater the interpretability of a model the greater its explanatory capacity this facilitates the extraction of knowledge from the mathematical model both from its state variables and from other internal structures of the model functional and structural parameters as well as the development of model based decision support systems the above highlighting that although less interpretable models such as empirical ones provide valuable information about the system state variables modeled it is difficult to infer additional knowledge regarding the modeled process authors such as cano et al 2013 state that the interpretability of a model is as important as its accuracy on the other hand authors such as lema perez 2018 and lopez restrepo et al 2020 addressed the theoretical issues related to parametric interpretability by defining the concepts of general interpretability and contextualized interpretability in recent years the concept of interpretability has gained importance especially in the area of empirical modeling since several authors in the field have explored different techniques to provide this type of model with physical meaning nauck 2003 emphasized the importance of parametric interpretability stating that this quality is especially important in areas where humans often make decisions or in those applications where machines support or are responsible for such decision making based on the premise that in order to generate an interpretable model it is necessary to be able to measure its degree of interpretability the authors proposed in their work an interpretability index applied to neuro fuzzy systems narayanan and ching 2019 and le and clarke 2019 proposed techniques or methods to provide parametric interpretability to different empirical mathematical models these works highlighted the need to maintain the interpretability accuracy trade off during mathematical model developing however while in the area of empirical modeling interpretability is an issue of current relevance in the area of gray box modeling some questions remain unresolved such as why is parameter interpretability important in gray box models is there any relationship between the interpretability of a parameter and its identifiability this paper addresses the concept of parametric interpretability in the context of the application of modeling the growth process of lobesia botrana lobesia botrana or grapevine moth is a pest of economic importance for various countries including the argentine republic where there is under official control thus phytosanitary control of the pest includes monitoring activities through the use of pheromone traps or delta traps chemical biological control activities based on the use of pesticides and control actions by sexual confusion based on the use of pheromones in the environment to confuse the males all of the above with the objective of containing the diffusion of pest altamira et al 2020 altimira et al 2021 different researchers around the world especially in europe have focused their efforts on developing mathematical models that describe the life cycle and voltinism process of l botrana considering the environmental conditions of each region to develop decision support systems dss that serve as a predictive tool for personnel making decisions regarding pest control in 1981 touzeau et al presented the first biological model to predict the life cycle of the grapevine moth touzeau 1981 subsequently other researchers in armend√°riz et al 2007 burgardta et al 2010 and dagatti and becerra 2015 presented modifications or simplifications of touzeau s model for other regions of the world amo salas et al 2011 presented an empirical model in 2011 for determining the maximum flight times of l botrana they emphasize the need for a biologically plausible model or one that can be explained or justified biologically control methods are most effective when applied at the moth s most vulnerable stages according to the authors according to ortega lopez et al 2014 the generation of knowledge about the pest would assist winegrowers in making optimal decisions to control the pest they propose a prediction model and stress that the model must incorporate biotic and abiotic factors to address the sustainable management of pests such as l botrana gilioli et al 2016 developed a stochastic mathematical model based on field data the authors place special emphasis on estimating biodemographic variables of moths abiotic factors including mortality rates and growth rates carlos et al 2018 in 2018 pointed out that accurate phenological information is crucial to the effective application of pesticides against l botrana based on data collected in the field the authors developed a mathematical model for the degree days dd their model included biotic and abiotic variables in order to aid in the design of decision support systems in 2020 authors such as rossini and castex presented novel approaches that sought to describe the life cycle and voltinism of l botrana in order to describe the critical stages of development and define strategies for the containment of the pest castex et al 2020 rossini et al 2020a rossini in the same year in rossini et al 2020b emphasized the importance of having biologically meaningful parameters in the moth life cycle models in order to facilitate the interaction between the end user and the mathematical model the current study analyzes the response of the fpbsm model to l botrana growth rates under laboratory conditions considering temperature and humidity as growth limiting factors aguirre zapata et al 2022 in order to analyze the goodness of fit of the kinetics in the mathematical model three properties are taken into account i structural identifiability of the mathematical model ii sensitivity coefficients of the model regarding each kinetic parameter and iii the parameters interpretability of each kinetic the growth kinetics were selected based on the best combination of the properties mentioned above the idea is to obtain the best representation of the growth process of l botrana with the highest percentage of fit while maintaining the interpretability and identifiability of the model parameters this work proposes the use of properties such as parametric interpretability identifiability and sensitivity during the modeling process this work is organized as follows in section 2 the equations of the l botrana life cycle model are presented discusses the different growth limiting factors for the month as well as their effects on different growth stages and describes some of the most commonly used growth kinetics in the literature in section 3 the results corresponding to the sensitivity analysis and parameter adjustment developed for each of the kinetics described in section 2 3 are presented finally section 4 summarizes the modeling results and discusses the properties analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 life cycle process model of lobesia botrana semi physical models based on first principles are usually composed of a basic structure whose parameters are called structural parameters and an extended structure made up of the constitutive and assessment equations that describe the structural parameters of the model the parameters of this second level of the specification are called functional parameters 2 1 1 basic model structure in aguirre zapata et al 2022 the development of a semi physical model based on first principles fpbsm for the life cycle process of l botrana in laboratory conditions and particularized for the region of cuyo in argentina was presented the model was developed based on the methodology proposed by in alvarez et al in alvarez et al 2009 the proposed model is a nonlinear continuous time model constituted by four differential equations where each one of them represents one of four stages of month growth 16 constitutive and assessment equations and 14 parameters and constants 1 d e l t

egg larvae pupae and adult 2 1 2 extended structure the eqs 5 8 constitutes the extended structure of the life cycle model of l botrana in aguirre zapata et al 2022 the modeling hypothesis is considered to describe in detail the relationships posed in the equations in the original model growth rates were modeled from a monod equation considering the accumulated degree days add as the only limiting factor for growth as shown in eqs 5 to 7 the growth equation is understood as the mathematical relationship that represents the transition between each of the moth s growth stages egg larvae

cumulative degree days described by the touzeau equation widely used in the literature touzeau 1981 k j s is the half velocity constant for each growth stage the other parameters and constants of the mathematical model are presented in table 1 2 2 limiting growth factors 2 2 1 temperature according to the literature the temperature is an abiotic factor with the greatest influence on the growth process and voltinism of l botrana and the most important driving force in this type of living organism that lacks internal temperature regulation mechanisms the moth mortality rate is low at medium temperatures regardless of relative humidity making these temperatures ideal for moth growth moosavi et al 2018 study highlights that direct exposure to high temperatures increases the mortality of eggs and larvae and changes how eggs hatch moth generations are determined by accumulated degree days in a given area in some regions with optimal temperature conditions 10 c to 30 c there are two to four generations per year while in regions with more extreme temperatures there are five generations per year rios castro et al 2016 2 2 2 relative humidity according to the literature low temperatures with high humidity and high temperatures with low humidity have negative effects on insect development the most favorable condition occurs at temperatures of 25 30 c accompanied by the relative humidity of 55 65 al zyoud and elmosa 2001 venette et al 2003 similarly extreme temperatures and humidity strongly affect the development of l botrana gabel and thi√©ry 1994 it is known that relative humidity plays a crucial role on the embryonic coscoll√° et al 1986 and imaginal torres vila et al 1993 stages of l botrana likewise the evolution of the embryogenesis process is strongly influenced by temperature egg survival as well as diapause and inhibition are determined by the combined action of humidity and temperature gabel and thi√©ry 1994 vitta 2020 the number of generations is determined by a combination of several factors including photoperiod the temperature in relation to the developmental threshold and microclimate together with low humidity latitude and feeding type vitta 2020 table 2 presents a summary of some works related to the mathematical modeling of the life cycle of l botrana and its relationship with the environmental variables considered in the current work temperature and humidity in this sense and taking as a starting point the modularity of mathematical models based on first principles fpbsm the addition of the parameter relative humidity as a limiting factor of moth growth is considered the above in order to enrich the predictions of the mathematical model guarantees its identifiability and seeks to maintain the interpretability of its parameters in the context of the model application in the mathematical model developed in aguirre zapata et al 2022 the temperature in degree days was considered as the only limiting factor for the growth ofl botrana however since relative humidity can favor or inhibit the development of the moth in this work this limiting factor is added amo salas et al 2011 altimira et al 2021 2 3 growth kinetics equations as described in aguirre zapata et al 2022 the model presented in eqs 1 4 was developed based on the hypothesis that the moth growth process could be represented by means of equations and parameters that are characteristic of the modeling of the growth process of some microorganisms in this sense different mathematical structures are found in the literature to describe the kinetics of growth in biological systems such as those presented in monod 1949 moser et al 1958 and peringer et al 1974 most of these are generalizable to the growth process of different microorganisms or specific for modeling the growth kinetics of l botrana like the one presented by pasquali et al 2018 all of the above equations differ from each other in the number of parameters considered and their parametric interpretability the kinetics considered are evaluated and compared in terms of identifiability and parametric interpretability in order to select the one that allows a better model fit without sacrificing the interpretability of the model parameters in the following subscript j refers to the stages of l botrana thus j 1 the egg stage j 2 the larval stage j 3 the pupal stage and j 4 the adult stage the new growth limiting factor is added as a summation considering that both factors temperature and humidity are equally influential in the development process and neither of them inhibits the effect of the other 2 3 1 the monod equation kinetic equations describing the specific growth rate Œº of microorganisms as a function of substrate concentration s are a valuable tool in biotechnological processes when conditions can be chosen such that only one compound is growth limiting the monod equation is often used eq 9 this is a mathematical model that relates microbial growth rates in an aqueous medium to the concentration of a limiting nutrient monod 1949 dochain 1986 heijnen and romein 1995 this equation was proposed by james monod in 1949 and was originally based on the concept of a single rate limiting enzyme which controls growth via michaelis menten kinetics copeland 2000 9 Œº m o n o d t Œº m a x s t k s s t where Œº is the specific growth

the growth rates of each phenomenological stage were modeled using a monod equation see eq 5 considering the accumulated degree days add as the limiting factor considering the air humidity as a second

both 2 3 3 mankad and bungay equation mb mankad and bungay proposed a model for microbial growth with more than one limiting nutrient mankad and bungay 1988 this model uses conventional monod formulations and weighs the contribution of potentially limiting nutrients according to their half saturation constants no coefficients other than those found in the monod equations are introduced for each limiting nutrient in this approach growth rates under dual substrate limitation are expressed in terms of the weighted average of rates under individual nutrient limitations 13 13 Œº m b t Œº m a

rate function for l botrana pasquali et al 2018 by means of the least square method using the dataset reported in briere and pracros 1998 and baumg√§rtner and baronio 1988 the value of parameters for all stages are given in table 3 as already mentioned humidity is considered the second limiting factor therefore given that the lactin equation only considers temperature as a limiting factor in this work looking for simplicity a monod equation is added to the lactin function to represent the effect of humidity on the rate of development eq 21 the equations are summed in order to consider the effect of both growth limiting factors temperature and humidity such summation is reasonable considering that i both equations are dimensionless ii moth development occurs when both limiting growth factors are under optimal conditions as described in section 3 iii an addition and not a product or subtraction is described considering that moth development is modulated by both growth limiting

goodness of the model mathematical structure and the availability of experimental data with relevant information for the identification of this set of parameters the analysis of the identifiability of a mathematical model focuses on two fundamental aspects i the evaluation of the structure of the mathematical model structural identifiability and ii the problem of identifying the unknown parameters of the model practical identifiability brun et al 2001 balsa canto et al 2010 2 4 1 structural identifiability structural identifiability analysis focuses on the possibility of finding a unique set of parameters for a model taking into account the mathematical structure of the model the structural identifiability of a model can be local unique solution within a neighborhood or global unique solution in the whole parameters space in this work the strike goldd structural identifiability taken as extended generalized observability with lie derivatives and decomposition software is used to carry out the structural identifiability analysis of the l botrana life cycle model considering the different growth kinetics cited in section 2 3 the strike goldd software was presented by villaverde et al in 2016 and is a tool to perform structural identifiability analysis of complex mathematical models used in systems biology and other areas of knowledge using a differential geometry approach in their proposal the authors reformulate the identifiability problem as an augmented observability problem in which the rank of the observability identifiability matrix which is constructed using lie derivatives gives information about the local structural identifiability of the parameters a previous structural identifiability analysis was performed for the growth model of l botrana under laboratory conditions and with a single limiting factor of growth temperature zapata et al 2022 in the current work both temperature and humidity are considered as limiting factors of growth within each of the presented growth kinetics for all cases monod exponential mankad hill and lactin kinetics the result was that the variable mortality rates i e larval k l d pupal k p d and adult k a d are structurally locally identifiable all the other empirical parameters of growth kinetics turned out to be structurally unidentifiable which implies that it is not possible to find a unique value for them neither in a general way nor in a specific neighborhood these parameters were adjusted heuristically seeking to reduce the prediction error of the mathematical model to regarding the experimental data and considering the restrictions of each parameter according to its meaning and nature 2 4 2 practical identifiability although structural identifiability makes it possible to evaluate the goodness of the mathematical structure of a developed model and to ensure that its structural parameters are uniquely identifiable in practice this may not be possible due to the lack of information contained in the experimental data used for this purpose by applying practical identifiability analysis one can evaluate whether it is possible to assign unique values to the unknown parameters of a mathematical model using experimental data or experimental schemes subject to noise experimental data and experimental noise are closely related to this property practical identifiability can be determined in two ways i a apriori to anticipate the quality of the selected experimental scheme or ii a posteriori to assess the quality of the parameter estimates after calibration or adjustment of the mathematical model balsa canto et al 2010 in this work an a priori practical identifiability analysis is performed through the sensitivity analysis of the parameters of the mathematical model used this analysis is performed considering the model parameters as individuals within the model and the sensitivity of the rigid parameters parameter combinations postulated in monsalve bravo et al 2022 is not considered the a posteriori practical identifiability analysis is not addressed due to the limitations of conducting new l botrana cultivation experiments under laboratory conditions 2 4 3 sensitivity analysis as described by garcia tirado et al in garcia tirado et al 2018 a sensitivity analysis on the influence of the parameters on the model output could be enlightening for two of the main problems associated with the lack of practical identifiability this is i correlated parameters and ii parameters with no influence on the model output chis et al suggested the use of sensitivity analysis to evaluate the relative influence of parameters on model output and to anticipate the lack of structural or practical identifiability chis et al 2011 in this sense parametric sensitivity makes it possible to classify and rank the parameters of a model in terms of their relative influence on the model s predictions outputs balsa canto et al 2010 local parametric sensitivities can be defined as shown in eq 22 where e corresponds to the experiment number o to the model output and Œ∏ i to the parameters of the mathematical model 22 s e Œ∏ i j e y j e o Œ∏ i t s e o in view of the above balsa canto proposes the use of the latin hypercube sampling lhs method and the use of five factors of importance Œª Œ∏ previously described by brun in brun et al 2001 balsa canto and banga 2011 and balsa canto et al 2016 the above as an alternative to the monte carlo method in terms of computational cost to obtain a more accurate estimate of the classification of the parameters of a model the lhs method allows exploring the sensitivity in a wide parameter space without requiring an excessive number of samples this translates into a lower computational cost especially valuable in gray box mathematical models of bioprocesses which usually have many parameters in this type of models the parametric identification problem goes from seeking to find the real values of a set of unknown parameters to become a problem that seeks to find physically interpretable parameter values in order to adequately describe the input output data of the process the sensitivity coefficients themselves contain relevant information about the importance of individual parameters a large sensitivity coefficient will mean that a change in the parameter Œ∏ n will have a significant effect on the model output y which makes the parameter Œ∏ n identifiable with the available data if all other parameters are fixed the significance factors Œª Œ∏ presented in brun et al 2001 and balsa canto et al 2010 are used to obtain information from the calculation of sensitivities in this sense Œª Œ∏ m s q r presented in eq 23 allows quantifying the sensitivity of the model to a given parameter 23 Œª Œ∏ i m s q r 1 n d m c 1 n l h s e 1 n e o 1 n o s 1 n s s Œ∏ i j e o t s e o 2 where n e is the number of experiments n o the number of observed variables observable n l h s the number of samples in the lhs algorithm n s the specific sampling time for each experiment with a given observable n d n l h s n i n o n s and s Œ∏ i j e o t s e o the parameter sensitivity Œ∏ i with observable j in experiment e with sampling time t s for the particular case of the growth process of l botrana considering that the same sampling time is considered in all the experiments the term s 1 n s is not considered in eq 23 the parameters of the lhs algorithm were set as follows n e 3 because three experiments are available at 20 c 2 c n o 4 because the data are available on the cultivation of l botrana in laboratory conditions in its four growth stages egg larva pupa and adult as described in aguirre zapata et al 2022 and herrera et al 2016 and n l h s 1000 because no significant differences were found with higher number of iterations the results obtained after applying the sensitivity analysis considering each of the kinetics described in section 2 3 are presented below 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis for life cycle model of l botrana in this section based on the importance factor Œª Œ∏ m s q r the qualitative results are presented for each growth kinetic monod exponential mb hill and lactin in two different types of figures the sensitivity curve on the left side allows visualizing the correspondence between the sensitivity factor y axis with a particular parameter x axis in descending order on the other hand the chromatic image of sensitivity on the right side allows visualizing the degree of influence of a particular parameter x axis on a particular output of the mathematical model y axis 3 1 1 monod kinetic for the case of monod kinetics a total of 12 parameters are considered the results of the analysis are presented in fig 1 for this case it is observed that the parameter with the greatest influence on the output of the mathematical model is the mortality rate associated with the egg stage k e d followed by the mortality rates of the other growth stages in this case the parameter with the least influence turned out to be the average growth rate constant associated with moisture in the egg stage k e h 3 1 2 exponential kinetic for the case of exponential kinetics a total of 16 parameters are considered the results of the analysis are presented in fig 2 the parameter with the greatest influence on the output of the life cycle model turns out to be the mortality rate associated with the larval stage k l d followed by the mortality rates of the other stages the uninterpretable parameters a e a l a p and a a turned out to have no influence on the model output so they could take any value 3 1 3 mankad and bungay kinetic mb for the case of mb kinetics a total of 12 parameters are considered the results of the analysis are presented in fig 3 it is important to highlight as it was described in section 2 3 the mb kinetics is a weighted monod equation so it was expected that the parameters would be ranked in the same way the egg stage mortality rate k e d being the parameter with the greatest influence on the model and the k e h parameter having the least influence 3 1 4 hill kinetic for the case of hill kinetics a total of 13 parameters is considered the results of the analysis are presented in fig 4 for this case similar to the exponential kinetics the larval mortality rate k l d turned out to be the parameter with the greatest influence on the output of the mathematical model followed by the egg mortality rate k e d and the exponential factor Œ± the parameter with the least influence is k a t 3 1 5 lactin kinetic for the case of lactin kinetics two different cases were considered i unknown Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ and Œ¥ parameters subject to adjustment i e the analysis was performed with a total of 20 parameters ii Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ and Œ¥ parameters treated as constants since their values are presented in pasquali et al 2018 for the latter case the analysis was performed with a total of 8 parameters the results of the analysis of both cases are presented in fig 5 for case i the amigo2 toolbox resulted in a sensitivity equal to 0 for all parameters such a result may indicate that these parameters have no influence on the output of the mathematical model which does not make sense given the large number of parameters or it could indicate that the available experiments do not contain sufficient information for the identification of this set of parameters i e lack of practical identifiability for case ii considering for the analysis only the mortality rate and the parameters associated to the kinetics with limiting factor humidity it is observed that the parameter with the greatest influence on the model output is the mortality rate of the egg stage k e d and the one with the least influence k a t table 4 summarizes the results quantitatively presenting the values of the sensitivity coefficients for each parameter for the different structures considered based in it it is possible to conclude that for all cases the egg mortality rate has high sensitivity coefficients especially with the mb and lactin kinetics for all the cases in which the k a h parameter was the common denominator it turned out to have the least influence on the output of the mathematical model regarding the exponential kinetics it became evident that when considering it the model lost sensitivity to parameters such as the average growth rate constants which translates into a loss of degrees of freedom for the model fitting 3 2 parameter identification parameter identification was performed considering the methodology proposed in a previous work zapata et al 2022 constant parameters were identified by using the nonlinear least squares method johansson 1993 and time varying parameters were identified by using an extended kalman filter for the identification process unknown parameter vectors were defined as shown in eq 24 24 Œ∏ u m d k e t k e h k l d k l t k l h k p d k p t k p h k a d k a t k a h Œ∏ u e x p k e t k e h k l d k l t k l h k p d k p t k p h k a d k a t k a h a e a l a p a a Œ∏ u m b k e t k e h k l d k l t k l h k p d k p t k p h k a d k a t k a h Œ∏ u h k e t k e h k l d k l t k l h k p d k p t k p h k a d k a t k a h Œ± Œ∏ u l c k e h k l d k l h k p d k p h k a d k a h where Œ∏ u m d Œ∏ u e x p Œ∏ u m b Œ∏ u h and Œ∏ u l c are the vectors of unknown parameters considering monod m d exponential e x p mankad and bungay m b hill h and lactin l c kinetics respectively in all cases the egg mortality rate k e d was not considered in the identification problem since the previous identifiability analysis presented in zapata et al 2022 indicated that this parameter should be fixed to guarantee the identifiability of the other parameters in view of the contextualized interpretability of this parameter it was possible to reconstruct it from experimental data or from existing literature so k e d was set as a known parameter see zapata et al 2022 also once the sensitivity analysis was performed for all cases the egg mortality rate turned out to have a high sensitivity coefficient which indicates that it is the parameter with the greatest impact on the output of the mathematical model the experimental data available for the evaluation of growth kinetics come from a laboratory rearing experiment of l botrana in mendoza argentina under controlled conditions of temperature humidity and photoperiod herrera et al 2016 experimental conditions included a temperature of 20 2 c relative humidity of 30 50 and a photoperiod of 16 8 h l o an artificial diet containing the necessary nutrients was used as a growth medium for the moth ferreira et al 2003 in a previously sterilized container intended for rearing the artificial diet was placed and the eggs that reached adulthood were placed inside three replicas of 30 eggs of 24 h age were made replicates will be referred to as r 1 r 2 and r 3 in this study fig 6 shows the growth curves obtained from laboratory rearing considering that some experimental observations were outside the moth growth trend it was necessary to preprocess the experimental data for identification of unknown parameters the constant parameter values identified by the nonlinear least squares optimization algorithm for each growth kinetic are presented in table 5 the mortality rates error tables and response curves of the model fitted with each growth kinetics are presented below according to the results presented in table 5 it is observed that the parameters associated with the exponential kinetics have considerably lower values than for the other growth kinetics the parameters k l t k l t k p t and k a t are consistent in the order of value identified the other parameters turn out to have differences of one or more orders in the value of their parameters it is of interest to contrast the values of the parameters k l t k l t k p t and k a t obtained in this work with those obtained in zapata et al 2022 where the values found for this set of parameters were Œ∏ 9 8 1 0 3 2 8 1 0 3 5 5 1 0 3 8 5 1 0 3 it is observed that for almost all comparable cases excluding exponential kinetics the order and magnitude of the parameters is maintained which allows maintaining the conclusion presented in zapata et al 2022 that the stage that is mostly influenced by temperature is the larval stage l l below are the qualitative and quantitative results obtained after adjusting the unknown parameters of the mathematical model see eq 24 considering each of the growth kinetics evaluated eq 25 shows the mae mean absolute error performance index used for the quantitative analysis 25 m a e j i 1 n y j x j n 26 m a e j 100 m a e j m a x x j with n the number of experimental points y j the value predicted by the model and x j the experimental value the qualitative results are presented in terms of the absolute error see eq 25 and the absolute percentage error which is calculated as shown in eq 26 the maximum and minimum absolute error for each of the growth stages are also presented 3 2 1 monod equation in fig 7 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the monod growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different replicates at 20 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 6 fig 7 shows that the fit for all growth stages is smooth and follows the trend of the experimental data the egg stage e l shows a fast behavior that may be explained by modeling uncertainties originating from intermediate stages of egg development that were not modeled torres vila 1995 however it is the egg stage that shows the lowest absolute error equivalent to 6 47 the larval stage l l shows over excitation in the first days of growth which causes it to have a minimum absolute error of 1 1 however it adjusts quickly and correctly describes the dynamics of that growth stage the adult stage a l shows one of the highest maximum absolute errors 65 at about day 35 3 2 2 exponential kinetics in fig 8 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the exponential growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different replicates at 20 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 7 fig 8 shows the growth curves fitted considering the exponential kinetics for this case more abrupt changes in dynamics less smooth are observed compared to those obtained with monod kinetics as for the egg stage e l the exponential kinetics allows describing its dynamics more slowly in contrast to the monod kinetics however the adult stage presents an undesirable overshoot which makes the error in this stage higher than 100 the maximum mae error for all stages is significantly higher than the kinetics analyzed in the previous section 3 2 3 mankad equation in fig 9 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the mankad growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different replicates at 20 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 8 in fig 9 the fitting curves of the model with mb kinetics are observed for all cases the fit is adequate however the mb equation is in essence a monod kinetic so this result was expected when using mb kinetics there was a marked improvement over monod in terms of the egg growth curve velocity and absolute error from 6 47 to 4 2 and the over excitation identified in the larval stage with mb kinetics the percent fit for all growth stages was equal to or greater than 74 3 2 4 hill kinetics in fig 10 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the hill growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different replicates at 20 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 9 hill kinetics as shown in fig 10 had a similar fit to that obtained with mb kinetics the main difference between hill kinetics and mb kinetics is observed at the adult stage where there is a small over excitation in the middle of the growth cycle that is compensated in terms of the error with the amplitude of the curve at steady state the hills kinetics favors the model to present a minimum mae absolute error of almost 0 in all its growth stages 3 2 5 lactin equation in fig 11 the growth curves of l botrana are presented with the lactin growth kinetics and considering two limiting growth factors in contrast to the experimental data from three different experimental runs at 20 c 2 c the mae associated with each growth stage with respect to the original experimental data and the preprocessed experimental data is presented in table 10 although lactin kinetics was specifically designed for the growth process of l botrana in this work it is the second kinetics with the largest absolute error after exponential kinetics in this case the main problems observed have to do with the speed of response of the egg stage and the overshoots in the following stages being especially significant the overshoot in the adult stage a l 4 conclusions and discussion some papers have attempted to illustrate the trade off between the interpretability of a mathematical model and the degree of fit to experimental data this is why authors such as linardatos et al 2020 state that it is difficult to trust systems whose decisions cannot be interpreted regardless of the fact that as a model s explanatory capacity increases its predictive capacity decreases however linardatos and other authors such as stiglic et al 2020 have not considered identifiability and parametric sensitivity as properties that can influence the degree of fit of mathematical models while accompanying the interpretability of a mathematical model and which therefore are properties that should be considered when delving into the development or derivation of equations that describe the internal dynamics of the modeled processes in this work it was assumed that there is a dependency relationship between the properties evaluated it is i parametric interpretability ii structural identifiability iii parametric sensitivity and iv model fit or precision to experimental data in order to analyze the results obtained in selecting the growth kinetics these properties were considered in order to maintain the degree of compromise between the mathematical model and the intrinsic structural properties table 11 summarizes the properties evaluated in the l botrana growth model the model s percentage fit considering the four growth stages is presented in the table Œ∏ represents the parameters of the growth kinetics i p the number of parameters with interpretability n i p the number of parameters non interpretables lema perez et al 2019 i d the number of identifiable parameters and s c the number of parameters with high h medium m and low l sensitivity in light of the properties analyzed exponential kinetic should be discarded for this application because they have a low fit percentage and also introduce four uninterpretable and non identifiable functional parameters which although the model presents a low sensitivity to them are difficult to adjust making it difficult to match the mathematical model to experimental results although hill kinetic has a high fit percentage it introduces a parameter Œ± that is uninterpretable and cannot be identified with a medium sensitivity coefficient which indicates that small changes in this parameter can have a positive or negative effect on the mathematical model output in mathematical models for the design of decision support systems parameters with medium or high sensitivity should be able to be bounded in their numerical value and have general or contextualized interpretability lema perez et al 2019 so that the user can access a larger number of model parameters to interact with it in terms of interpretability and identifiability the mb kinetics is equal to the monod kinetic since it is an extension of it as a result of its mathematical form larvae and pupae mortality parameters k l d and k p d go from having high sensitivity coefficients to having medium sensitivity coefficients which is not desirable since mortality rates are one of the most important biotic factors in the mathematical model and this should be reflected in the output of the model in conclusion monod s and lactin s kinetics offer the highest percentage of fit of the model to experimental data in terms of interpreting its parameters and knowing the model s sensitivity to all of them the monod kinetics is superior due to the impossibility of determining the model s sensitivity to unknown unidentifiable and uninterpretable lactin kinetic parameters this kinetics is discarded consequently the result of this analysis indicates that monod kinetics more adequately represents the rate of moth development under laboratory conditions offering a better relationship between the properties of interpretability identifiability sensitivity as a result it is necessary to analyze the mathematical model s intrinsic properties as part of the mathematical model s deduction process in particular when selecting the constitutive or valuation equations for the mathematical model and deciding which level of specification the mathematical model will have the analysis of its intrinsic properties is crucial credit authorship contribution statement estefania aguirre zapata

24171,pest management approaches based on integrated pest management ipm suggest that pesticide use could be reduced if dose recommendations move from a toxicological perspective how much is needed to kill pests to an ecological perspective how much is needed to guarantee crop yield while minimizing environmental damage however the success of pesticides in maintaining crop yield security may be compromised by the evolution of resistance which can be accelerated by reducing pesticide doses to explore these relationships we developed a mathematical model to evaluate the potential effect of pesticide dosing and pesticide induced stress on mutation rates leading to major single gene resistance or the accumulation of the multiple mutations leading to multi factorial resistance one of the main focuses was to determine the relative importance of resistance development generated before i e pre resistance and after i e post resistance pesticide exposure tracking the proliferation of resistance under distinct scenarios of pesticide dosing our findings suggest that the relative importance of post resistance increases under low pesticide doses and is particularly significant for the accumulation of resistance factors after pesticides are introduced on the other hand our model shows that lowering pesticide doses when used in conjunction with other control measures can reduce the impact of post resistance development high pesticide doses may also hasten resistance if mutation rates increasingly scale with pesticide doses this is due to the faster accumulation of resistance factors during pesticide administration under these circumstances both ecological i e reducing pesticide doses minimizing biodiversity damage and evolutionary i e preventing resistance evolution perspectives to the ipm framework are reconciled by lowering pesticide doses our results demonstrate the importance of taking evolution into account to evaluate management consequences highlighting the urgent need to integrate the evolutionary perspective into pest management models to promote sustainability keywords resistance evolution crops ipm evolutionary biology agriculture pesticides food security data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction modern agriculture uses 2 million tons year of pesticides e g insecticides fungicides and herbicides to control pest populations sharma et al 2019 however the widespread use of pesticides has led to escalating problems of resistance in pest populations gould et al 2018 although pesticides can control pests inappropriate use can promote the selection of resistant genotypes in targeted or existing pest species gardner et al 1998 a parallel could be drawn from medicine where the use of drugs has led to increased problems of antibiotic resistance in bacteria jacopin et al 2020 or chemotherapy resistance in cancerous cells mansoori et al 2017 similarly in crop and pest management there is a growing concern about worsening trends in biodiversity and climate change d√≠az et al 2020 roque et al 2021 therefore understanding the evolution of pesticide resistance is critical for global food security green et al 2020 there is a general trend toward using lower pesticide doses as a recommendation from both ecoregulatory and economic views colin et al 2020 a perspective that is particularly desirable for the implementation of integrated pest management ipm an ecological based approach to pest control that emphasizes the use of multiple sustainable strategies e g transgenic pathogen and insect resistant crops biological control plant diversity and cultural control to minimize harm to the environment and human health while maintaining crop productivity and making agriculture less dependent on synthetic pesticides green et al 2020 for example colin et al 2020 aiming the conservation of insect populations argue that ecological principles are key to supporting the reduction of current pesticide doses used around the world the stress imposed by pesticides has been acknowledged as a major factor supporting the reduction in pesticide doses because sub lethal doses alone can diminish the capacity of pest populations to find food mates or avoid predators berec et al 2007 the main rationale behind this argument is that total eradication of pests is not needed to assure treatment effectiveness and economic return from crops and that pesticide dosage reduction should be also beneficial because it would slow the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations colin et al 2020 however the evolution of resistance is a complex process and reducing pesticide doses may result in unfavorable outcomes e g slow accumulation of small resistance factors gressel 2011 pesticide resistance may arise through different mechanisms such as random mutations low level resistance polygenes gene amplifications and a series of single allelic mutations in a single gene resulting in non resistant individuals differentiating into resistant ones hawkins et al 2019 theoretical and empirical work has demonstrated that lower pesticide doses with their lower selection pressure might delay the evolution of single gene resistance powles and yu 2010 however random mutations may foster traits that impact pesticide catabolism and or sequestration resulting in resistant individuals hawkins et al 2019 consequently while low pesticide doses may delay the emergence of single gene resistance they may promote the selection of multi factorial e g polygenic resistance fostering the spread of resistance in addition oxidative stress which is generated by many herbicides hassan and nemat alla 2005 may lead to increased rates of mutations which was able to confer resistance to antibiotics in microorganisms ciofu et al 2005 despite such evidence there is still a gap between the research about how varying mutation rates affects the evolution of pesticide resistance and how this information can advance the ipm approach lastly standing genetic variation that is present before the administration of pesticides can increase the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations lucas et al 2015 when standard genetic variation at minor loci i e at a loci that may have been previously overlooked is brought together by recombination under selection rapid evolution of resistance can occur however the relative importance of the standing genetic variation that originates before pesticide intervention compared to the mutations acquired after pesticide use has received little attention under the ipm approach in this study we explore a mathematical model aiming to answer i whether distinct pesticide doses affect the proliferation of pesticide resistance ii how resistance evolution is affected by variable mutation rates as a function of pesticide doses and iii whether major single gene mutations or the accumulation of the multiple mutations leading to multi factorial resistance are differentially affected by pesticide dosing regimens we also discuss some implications of our findings for the development of ipm 2 methods many previous mathematical models were developed to study resistance evolution to pesticides however most of them do not take into consideration multifactorial resistance or that mutation frequencies vary with pesticide doses gressel 2011 rex consortium 2010 here we will use a simple modeling approach to evaluate the evolution of resistance as this evolution may depend on novel mutations or pre existing traits that could form the basis of resistance adaptations hawkins et al 2019 one way to evaluate the effect of pesticides on the evolution of resistance is to compare the proliferation of resistant individuals that are living prior to the administration of pesticides and those that are produced only after pesticides are introduced fig 1 komarova and wodarz 2005 tomasetti and levy 2010 our goal is to establish a relationship between two types of resistant individuals the ones that naturally emerge before the application of pesticides and their offspring pre resistance fig 1a and the ones that emerge after the application of pesticides and their offspring post resistance fig 1b by comparing the population growth of the two types of resistance individuals we can infer how pesticides doses affect this relation for example if by lowering pesticide doses the population of post resistance individuals is found to be much larger than the population of pre resistance individuals that indicates that the strategy of lowering pesticide doses in order to diminish the proliferation of resistance does not work also we modeled two other important factors that play a role in the proliferation of resistance the genetic mechanism by which the resistance appears and how other alternative pesticide free ipm methods e g biological control or cultural control interact with pesticide doses and the evolution of resistance 2 1 model formulation we denote the number of non resistant individuals at time t by n t the number of individuals fully resistant to pesticides at time t is denoted by a t and the number of individuals that have undergone a mutation or several mutations to acquire a resistance factor but are not fully resistant yet is denoted by a1 n 1 t where n is the number of resistance factors needed to acquire full resistance mutations m leading to resistance occur as a distributive process resulting in non resistant individuals mutating into resistant ones we assume that the mutation rate m is relatively low in comparison to the intrinsic population growth rate r such that m r to study how the genetic mechanism that leads to resistance interacts with pesticide doses we ran simulations in which one two or three resistance factors are needed to achieve resistance if just one resistance factor is needed single gene resistance the process is linear n a as described in the equations below but if more resistance factors are needed the process occurs as an event network as illustrated in fig 2 we assume that organisms grow through clonal expansion growth characteristic that match some types of pests such as fungus lucas et al 2015 and herbs vil√† and d antonio 1998 with negligible turn over rates these features greatly simplify the model structure allowing us to focus on the variables that are more important for our objectives through the analysis of the model pesticide administration starts at t t for the scenario where only one independent mutation is needed to acquire resistance and there is a relatively small mutation rate m the model can be written as 1 1 for t t d n d t r n t d a d t r a t m n t 1 2 for t t d n d t r n t p n t d a d t r a t m p Œ± n t where r is the population growth rate m is the mutation rate p is the per capita pesticide induced death rate and Œ± is the sensitivity of mutation rates to the pesticide dosage the equations in 1 1 describe the condition before pesticide administration while the equations in 1 2 represent the dynamics after pesticides introduction where we introduce the term p the per capita pesticide induced death rate reflecting the pesticide dosage colin et al 2020 to evaluate the potential effects of pesticides as mutagenic stressors mutation rates m scales with pesticide dosage p the term Œ± represents the sensitivity of mutation rates to the pesticide dosage where Œ± 0 if p 1 the greater the Œ± the greater the mutation rates become with increasing pesticide doses which would reflect increasing stressful scenarios imposed by pesticide administration ramakrishnan et al 2019 for Œ± 0 mutations rates are insensitive to pesticide doses which reflects a

the specific model formulations for 2 and 3 resistance factors needed for effective resistance to pesticides please refer to the supplementary material s1 if an individual acquired one mutation leading to the occurrence of a specific resistance factor it does not make it less vulnerable to pesticides i e p is unaffected therefore the accumulation of resistance factors is only effective against pesticides when in combination although this assumption can be considered an over simplification based on some empirical observations van den bosch et al 2011 it reflects the multi step genetic changes needed for acquired resistance hawkins et al 2019 thus if there is no fitness advantage to obtaining one of three resistance factors then the evolution of resistance will be slowed therefore we can see our model as a conservative one where multi factorial resistance emergence is relatively slow the model allows the evaluation of resistance evolution when only a single resistance factor is needed for effective resistance eq 1 or when n resistance factors eqs 1 and 2 supplementary material s1 are required the mutation rate m is unchanged for acquiring any resistance factor to further investigate the role of ipm on pesticide resistance evolution we modified our model to incorporate alternative control methods e g biological control or cultural control beyond pesticide use where pest individuals are continuously removed from the population irrespective of pesticide use such practices are advised as remedial efforts to control pests in light of the reductions in pesticide doses green et al 2020 as an assumption such alternative control methods are not subjected to resistance evolution or at least not at a time scale compared to the pesticide resistance regardless of what the alternative ipm methods may be the final outcome for the model would be the same a death or removal rate of pest individuals whether resistant to pesticides or not so to include effects of these ipm methods in our model we introduced a per capita death rate c for both sensitive and resistant pest individuals after pesticides are introduced supplementary material s3 for simplicity we performed such modification only in the equations where one mutation is required for achieving resistance however the same conclusions are obtained if we use the equations where two or three mutations are required finally to specifically evaluate the effect of pesticides on the evolution of resistance we seek to determine the relative roles of the pre pesticide i e pre resistance and the post pesticide i e post resistance phase for the generation of resistant pest mutants thus we artificially set the mutation rate to zero right after pesticide administration starts that is mutations can be generated only before pesticide administration we refer to this as the pre resistance at time t and denote it by apre resistance t representing the pesticide resistance exclusively from the offspring of resistant individuals existing before pesticide administration we wanted to compare it to the pesticide resistance that emerges after pesticide administration the latter represents the resistance that is generated by mutations that occur exclusively during pesticide administration and the offspring of those resistance individuals which we denote by apost resistance t and refer to it as the post resistance at time t 3 results when the pest is detected and the pesticide administration starts this specific period can be related to the total size of the pest

solution of the system of equations 1 1 at time t which is then multiplied by an exponential term ert that represents the growth of resistant individuals during pesticide administration for the

is inversely proportional to pesticide dosage and the time taken to the administration of pesticides before pest detection i e t fig 3 a for t t if p is lower than the pest population recruitment the evolution of resistance is likely to be greater after pesticide administration for a sufficiently large time solution details for the scenarios where more resistance factors are needed are presented in supplementary material s2 in the multi factorial resistance scenario where only the combination of two or more mutations leads to pesticide resistance the assessment of the relative importance of pre and post resistance evolution are given by 8 a p o s t r e s i s t a n c e a p r e r e s i s t a n c e 2 p 2 Œ± p 2 t 2 1 p Œ± 1 t for two factorial resistance 9 a p o s t r e s i s t a n c e a p

greater than the pre resistance as the number of required resistance factors to achieve pesticide resistance increases fig 3b in the case of a mutagenic pesticide the mutation rates can become much higher during the administration of pesticides reverting the preceding results fig 3c this result holds for single to multiple resistance factors needed for resistance and for p 1 under such conditions the resistance generated during pesticide administration becomes increasingly more sensitive to pesticide doses as the parameter Œ± the sensitivity of mutation rates to pesticide dosage increases until Œ± 1 for Œ± 1 the resistance generated during pesticide administration increasingly exceeds the pre resistance as pesticide doses increases thus when pesticides cause an increase in mutation rates lower pesticide doses are less likely to accelerate the development of resistance regardless of the number of resistance factors involved lastly when the pest population is being controlled beyond pesticide use through alternative ipm control methods described previously in the methods section with the introduction of the per capita death rate c for t t the assessment of the post resistance evolution is given by 10 a p o s t r e s i s t a n c e t s m e r c t e r c p t p a 1 dividing eq 10 by eq 5 11 a p o s t r e s i s t a n c e a p r e r e s i s t a n c e e c p t e p t 1 p a 1 r ln s n 0 for t t and p 1 we found that apre resistance t will always be greater than apost resistance t for any c 0 for both mutagenic and non mutagenic pesticides solution details for both conditions are presented in the supplementary material s3 this result suggests that additional control of pest individuals during pesticide administration i e continuous removal of individuals can lessen the resistance evolution in the long term even when lower pesticide doses are employed 4 discussion in this study we showed that whether distinct pesticide doses affect the proliferation of pesticide resistance may depend on multiple factors for non mutagenic pesticides we observed that lowering pesticide doses may accelerate the proliferation of resistance as the populations of resistance individuals that emerged after the pesticide administration grow faster than the populations of pre resistance individuals on the other hand if pesticides are mutagenic Œ± 0 then the post resistance populations grow faster than the pre resistance ones with increasing pesticide doses especially for higher values of mutation rates sensitivity Œ± answering our question on how resistance evolution is affected by variable mutation rates as a function of pesticide doses this suggests that reducing pesticide doses may be a more effective strategy for preventing the evolution of resistance when the pesticide has a high mutagenic potential at last to answer whether major single gene mutations or the accumulation of the multiple mutations leading to multi factorial resistance are differentially affected by pesticide dosing regimens we conclude that the effect of lowering pesticide doses on the evolution of resistance increases as the number of resistance factors n increases in the following we discuss the likely mechanism affecting these patterns despite the claims that pest populations would hardly evolve resistance to certain pesticides bradshaw et al 1997 empirical evidence shows that the evolution to these novel compounds continues worldwide heap 2014 especially when low doses are applied busi and powles 2009 early empirical evidence for the accumulation of resistance factors to insecticides mckenzie et al 1992 and herbicides heap and knight 1982 where low doses were used corroborate these outcomes we observed a stronger dependency of a multi step resistance evolution during pesticide administration on lower pesticide doses this result is reflected in the non linear dependency on the expression 1 pn for the relative importance of post resistance prevalence where n represents the number of required resistance factors to fully achieve resistance the key to understanding this process lies in how resistance emerges in the population in the context of one required mutation to resistance the number of resistant mutants produced during population growth up to size s is given by s m ln s n 0 r this quantity depends therefore linearly on 1 r but for n required mutations the solution is given by s m ln s n 0 r n the dependence on 1 r is now stronger than linear and if the number of required mutations is increased a fixed intrinsic population growth rate contributes dwindling to the production of resistant mutants this dependency on multiple required mutations makes fully resistant individuals increasingly less likely until t but prone to prosper for sufficiently large t under low pesticide doses in other words the importance of the preexistence of resistance in pest populations diminishes as the number of required resistance factors for resistance increases in a general evolutionary sense it would normally be expected that quantitative traits would likely evolve via the recombination of standing genetic variation whereas major mutations would be more likely to arise spontaneously and be selected rather than lost via drift as would more likely happen pre selection following the onset of selection our model formulation does not contrast different mutation processes and the breeding inheritance of distinct reproductive systems however based on our assumptions and the essential features to contrast the effects of pesticide dosing on the evolution of resistance our result directly sheds light on how the evolution of resistance to multiple pesticides may also be favored under low pesticide doses resistance to multiple pesticides can be driven by mutations at distinct loci powles and yu 2010 which may accumulate through the buildup of a collection of resistance factors a common strategy to avoid resistance evolution is to diversify pesticides in mixtures or rotations madgwick and kanitz 2023 if multiple pesticides are applied in conjunction the pest is unlikely to resist the pesticide treatment if their mechanism of action are distinct diggle et al 2003 although long term data has shown that such strategies are not necessarily effective in preventing resistance development hicks et al 2018 we observed that such resistance to multiple pesticides is likely to emerge in the long term if pesticide doses are ineffective in suppressing pest populations e g at low pesticide doses although not specifically related to multiple pesticide resistance empirical evidence shows that pest high survival rates are the culprit of the development of resistance to novel compounds such as glyphosate neve and powles 2005 which is in agreement with our results so instead of combining multiple novel pesticides to avoid the development of resistance or to use the minimum amount of pesticides necessary to avoid reaching the economic injury level in the present the combination of multiple evolutionary smart ipm techniques prioritizing preventive methods rather than curative ones such as plant vaccination intra and interspecific crop diversity and plant natural resistance and tolerance might be a safer and long term efficient option barzman et al 2015 stenberg 2017 it has been shown that biological controls the use of natural enemies and cultural controls the modification of cropping practices provide valuable alternatives to insecticides for the suppression of major arthropod crop pests mills and daane 2005 we found that the integration of various control methods is not just important for pest reduction but may represent the key to the success of the ipm approach in preventing resistance evolution the greater the pest mortality post pesticide administration i e p the lower the pest population growth and the number of mutants generated will be analogously if the source of pest mortality comes from further methods i e c not just pesticides both subpopulations i e pesticide resistant and non resistant will have lower growth rates diminishing resistance proliferation during the pesticide administration phase thus developing novel control methods and integrating distinct approaches that render various sources of pest mortality is pivotal for effective ipm in preventing resistance fostering such additional methods can be achieved through different approaches one of them is to augment through periodic release natural enemies of exotic or indigenous pests that cannot persist year round van lenteren 2000 the inoculation of small populations of natural enemies can be used to enhance colonization at crucial periods for season long pest suppression similarly large populations can be used for urgent suppression but often without a longer lasting impact a more passive approach would involve the conservation of natural enemy populations through habitat manipulation e g building nests or the alteration of crop production practices that directly harm these species harrison et al 2019 therefore in attempt to reduce pesticide resistance the identification of synergistic approaches in suppressing pest populations may represent a key practical challenge for effective crop management when concomitantly promoting the reduction in pesticide doses when pesticides can induce higher mutation rates alternative approaches in suppressing pest populations may become particularly important this is because higher pesticide doses can lead to an increase in the evolution of resistance with mutation rates growing as pesticide doses scale up although there is significant uncertainty surrounding some resistance management decisions gould et al 2018 a particular important finding of our work is that when pesticides increase mutation rates or select target genes van den bosch et al 2011 both the ecological e g reducing pesticide doses minimizing damage to biodiversity and evolutionary e g preventing resistance evolution perspectives of the ipm framework can be reconciled by lowering pesticide doses and implementing alternative approaches management strategies therefore should consider how to get rid of subpopulations of pests especially those pesticide resistant or with high mutation rates the use of transgenic crops that are resistant to pathogens and insects as part of a rotation can also be an effective ipm option kos et al 2009 a particular transgenic crop which have an inserted bacterial gene that produces lethal toxins to certain pests bacillus thuringiensis or bt toxin has barely selected for field resistance whereas organic bt treated crops have selected for many more cases of resistance gressel 2011 thus monitoring and forecasting pesticide effects on known resistance alleles will become crucial in decision support tools helping to determine when interventions such as reductions in pesticide doses are necessary or harmful for preventing resistance we advocate the development of fast and accurate methods for monitoring resistance alleles within pest populations and the funding of fundamental research on the evolutionary ecology of pest management through evolutionary modeling and experimental evolution which could be subsequently translated into applications green et al 2020 the gradual evolution of pesticide resistance through mutation can reduce the effectiveness of pest control measures and may lead to the development of pest outbreaks this can ultimately result in lower crop yields higher production costs and increased use of pesticides which can accelerate the evolution of pesticide resistance so in facing the huge complexity and importance regarding our food production the reconciliation of both ecological and evolutionary perspectives of ipm is a fruitful opportunity that can shed a light on the role that pesticide doses and alternative ipm methods have in the evolution of resistance 5 conclusion it is pivotal that pesticide dosing should follow ecological principles which would promote large benefits for biodiversity conservation colin et al 2020 public health hallenbeck and cunningham burns 2012 and likewise minimize economic impacts hicks et al 2018 but we show that lowering pesticide doses will not always prevent the evolution of resistance the ecological perspective to the ipm paradigm states that for low density pest populations low pesticide doses would be sufficient to promote their control due to sustained physiological stress colin et al 2020 however as highlighted in gressel 2011 we are confronted with a conundrum that has contradictory outcomes low pesticide doses might delay the evolution of major single gene resistance but may rapidly select for resistance due to the slow accumulation of resistance factors in pest populations thus an evolutionary perspective to the ipm is also needed in this context we argue that integrating methods and evaluating combined control effects is crucial for lessening the resistance evolution under the ipm approach in addition when we take into consideration the potential physiological stress induced by pesticides the resistance generated during pesticide administration may exceed the pre pesticide resistance in real word scenarios as a future avenue for research we claim therefore that understanding the stress imposed by pesticides on pest populations not just on behavioral or developmental traits but on mutation rates will further help elucidate the challenges imposed by lowering pesticide doses on pesticide evolution and directly support decisions for pesticide dosage reduction based on our findings we argue that a shift in the model of food production into a more sustainable form by reducing pesticide doses to control pests just beyond economic impairing levels would also need an evaluation of the evolutionary

24171,pest management approaches based on integrated pest management ipm suggest that pesticide use could be reduced if dose recommendations move from a toxicological perspective how much is needed to kill pests to an ecological perspective how much is needed to guarantee crop yield while minimizing environmental damage however the success of pesticides in maintaining crop yield security may be compromised by the evolution of resistance which can be accelerated by reducing pesticide doses to explore these relationships we developed a mathematical model to evaluate the potential effect of pesticide dosing and pesticide induced stress on mutation rates leading to major single gene resistance or the accumulation of the multiple mutations leading to multi factorial resistance one of the main focuses was to determine the relative importance of resistance development generated before i e pre resistance and after i e post resistance pesticide exposure tracking the proliferation of resistance under distinct scenarios of pesticide dosing our findings suggest that the relative importance of post resistance increases under low pesticide doses and is particularly significant for the accumulation of resistance factors after pesticides are introduced on the other hand our model shows that lowering pesticide doses when used in conjunction with other control measures can reduce the impact of post resistance development high pesticide doses may also hasten resistance if mutation rates increasingly scale with pesticide doses this is due to the faster accumulation of resistance factors during pesticide administration under these circumstances both ecological i e reducing pesticide doses minimizing biodiversity damage and evolutionary i e preventing resistance evolution perspectives to the ipm framework are reconciled by lowering pesticide doses our results demonstrate the importance of taking evolution into account to evaluate management consequences highlighting the urgent need to integrate the evolutionary perspective into pest management models to promote sustainability keywords resistance evolution crops ipm evolutionary biology agriculture pesticides food security data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction modern agriculture uses 2 million tons year of pesticides e g insecticides fungicides and herbicides to control pest populations sharma et al 2019 however the widespread use of pesticides has led to escalating problems of resistance in pest populations gould et al 2018 although pesticides can control pests inappropriate use can promote the selection of resistant genotypes in targeted or existing pest species gardner et al 1998 a parallel could be drawn from medicine where the use of drugs has led to increased problems of antibiotic resistance in bacteria jacopin et al 2020 or chemotherapy resistance in cancerous cells mansoori et al 2017 similarly in crop and pest management there is a growing concern about worsening trends in biodiversity and climate change d√≠az et al 2020 roque et al 2021 therefore understanding the evolution of pesticide resistance is critical for global food security green et al 2020 there is a general trend toward using lower pesticide doses as a recommendation from both ecoregulatory and economic views colin et al 2020 a perspective that is particularly desirable for the implementation of integrated pest management ipm an ecological based approach to pest control that emphasizes the use of multiple sustainable strategies e g transgenic pathogen and insect resistant crops biological control plant diversity and cultural control to minimize harm to the environment and human health while maintaining crop productivity and making agriculture less dependent on synthetic pesticides green et al 2020 for example colin et al 2020 aiming the conservation of insect populations argue that ecological principles are key to supporting the reduction of current pesticide doses used around the world the stress imposed by pesticides has been acknowledged as a major factor supporting the reduction in pesticide doses because sub lethal doses alone can diminish the capacity of pest populations to find food mates or avoid predators berec et al 2007 the main rationale behind this argument is that total eradication of pests is not needed to assure treatment effectiveness and economic return from crops and that pesticide dosage reduction should be also beneficial because it would slow the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations colin et al 2020 however the evolution of resistance is a complex process and reducing pesticide doses may result in unfavorable outcomes e g slow accumulation of small resistance factors gressel 2011 pesticide resistance may arise through different mechanisms such as random mutations low level resistance polygenes gene amplifications and a series of single allelic mutations in a single gene resulting in non resistant individuals differentiating into resistant ones hawkins et al 2019 theoretical and empirical work has demonstrated that lower pesticide doses with their lower selection pressure might delay the evolution of single gene resistance powles and yu 2010 however random mutations may foster traits that impact pesticide catabolism and or sequestration resulting in resistant individuals hawkins et al 2019 consequently while low pesticide doses may delay the emergence of single gene resistance they may promote the selection of multi factorial e g polygenic resistance fostering the spread of resistance in addition oxidative stress which is generated by many herbicides hassan and nemat alla 2005 may lead to increased rates of mutations which was able to confer resistance to antibiotics in microorganisms ciofu et al 2005 despite such evidence there is still a gap between the research about how varying mutation rates affects the evolution of pesticide resistance and how this information can advance the ipm approach lastly standing genetic variation that is present before the administration of pesticides can increase the development of pesticide resistance in pest populations lucas et al 2015 when standard genetic variation at minor loci i e at a loci that may have been previously overlooked is brought together by recombination under selection rapid evolution of resistance can occur however the relative importance of the standing genetic variation that originates before pesticide intervention compared to the mutations acquired after pesticide use has received little attention under the ipm approach in this study we explore a mathematical model aiming to answer i whether distinct pesticide doses affect the proliferation of pesticide resistance ii how resistance evolution is affected by variable mutation rates as a function of pesticide doses and iii whether major single gene mutations or the accumulation of the multiple mutations leading to multi factorial resistance are differentially affected by pesticide dosing regimens we also discuss some implications of our findings for the development of ipm 2 methods many previous mathematical models were developed to study resistance evolution to pesticides however most of them do not take into consideration multifactorial resistance or that mutation frequencies vary with pesticide doses gressel 2011 rex consortium 2010 here we will use a simple modeling approach to evaluate the evolution of resistance as this evolution may depend on novel mutations or pre existing traits that could form the basis of resistance adaptations hawkins et al 2019 one way to evaluate the effect of pesticides on the evolution of resistance is to compare the proliferation of resistant individuals that are living prior to the administration of pesticides and those that are produced only after pesticides are introduced fig 1 komarova and wodarz 2005 tomasetti and levy 2010 our goal is to establish a relationship between two types of resistant individuals the ones that naturally emerge before the application of pesticides and their offspring pre resistance fig 1a and the ones that emerge after the application of pesticides and their offspring post resistance fig 1b by comparing the population growth of the two types of resistance individuals we can infer how pesticides doses affect this relation for example if by lowering pesticide doses the population of post resistance individuals is found to be much larger than the population of pre resistance individuals that indicates that the strategy of lowering pesticide doses in order to diminish the proliferation of resistance does not work also we modeled two other important factors that play a role in the proliferation of resistance the genetic mechanism by which the resistance appears and how other alternative pesticide free ipm methods e g biological control or cultural control interact with pesticide doses and the evolution of resistance 2 1 model formulation we denote the number of non resistant individuals at time t by n t the number of individuals fully resistant to pesticides at time t is denoted by a t and the number of individuals that have undergone a mutation or several mutations to acquire a resistance factor but are not fully resistant yet is denoted by a1 n 1 t where n is the number of resistance factors needed to acquire full resistance mutations m leading to resistance occur as a distributive process resulting in non resistant individuals mutating into resistant ones we assume that the mutation rate m is relatively low in comparison to the intrinsic population growth rate r such that m r to study how the genetic mechanism that leads to resistance interacts with pesticide doses we ran simulations in which one two or three resistance factors are needed to achieve resistance if just one resistance factor is needed single gene resistance the process is linear n a as described in the equations below but if more resistance factors are needed the process occurs as an event network as illustrated in fig 2 we assume that organisms grow through clonal expansion growth characteristic that match some types of pests such as fungus lucas et al 2015 and herbs vil√† and d antonio 1998 with negligible turn over rates these features greatly simplify the model structure allowing us to focus on the variables that are more important for our objectives through the analysis of the model pesticide administration starts at t t for the scenario where only one independent mutation is needed to acquire resistance and there is a relatively small mutation rate m the model can be written as 1 1 for t t d n d t r n t d a d t r a t m n t 1 2 for t t d n d t r n t p n t d a d t r a t m p Œ± n t where r is the population growth rate m is the mutation rate p is the per capita pesticide induced death rate and Œ± is the sensitivity of mutation rates to the pesticide dosage the equations in 1 1 describe the condition before pesticide administration while the equations in 1 2 represent the dynamics after pesticides introduction where we introduce the term p the per capita pesticide induced death rate reflecting the pesticide dosage colin et al 2020 to evaluate the potential effects of pesticides as mutagenic stressors mutation rates m scales with pesticide dosage p the term Œ± represents the sensitivity of mutation rates to the pesticide dosage where Œ± 0 if p 1 the greater the Œ± the greater the mutation rates become with increasing pesticide doses which would reflect increasing stressful scenarios imposed by pesticide administration ramakrishnan et al 2019 for Œ± 0 mutations rates are insensitive to pesticide doses which reflects a

the specific model formulations for 2 and 3 resistance factors needed for effective resistance to pesticides please refer to the supplementary material s1 if an individual acquired one mutation

against pesticides when in combination although this assumption can be considered an over simplification based on some empirical observations van den bosch et al 2011 it reflects the multi step genetic changes needed for acquired resistance hawkins et al 2019 thus if there is no fitness advantage to obtaining one of three resistance factors then the evolution of resistance will be slowed

pre and post resistance evolution are given by 8 a p o s t r e s i s t a n c e a p r e r e s i s t a n c e 2 p 2 Œ± p 2 t 2 1 p Œ± 1 t for two factorial resistance 9 a p o s t r e s i s t a n c e a p

greater than the pre resistance as the number of required resistance factors to achieve pesticide resistance increases fig 3b in the case of a mutagenic pesticide the mutation rates can become much higher during the administration of pesticides reverting the preceding results fig 3c this result holds for single to multiple resistance factors needed for resistance and for p 1 under such conditions the resistance generated during pesticide administration becomes increasingly more sensitive to pesticide doses as the parameter Œ± the sensitivity of mutation rates to pesticide dosage increases until Œ± 1 for Œ± 1 the resistance generated during pesticide administration increasingly exceeds the pre resistance as pesticide doses increases thus when pesticides cause an increase in mutation rates lower pesticide doses are less likely to accelerate the development of resistance regardless of the number of resistance factors involved lastly when the pest population is being controlled beyond pesticide use through alternative ipm control methods described previously in the methods section with the introduction of the per capita death rate c for t t the assessment of the

conditions are presented in the supplementary material s3 this result suggests that additional control of pest individuals during pesticide administration i e continuous removal of individuals can lessen the resistance evolution in the long term even when lower pesticide doses are employed 4 discussion in this study we showed that whether distinct pesticide doses affect the proliferation of pesticide resistance may depend on multiple factors for non mutagenic pesticides we observed that lowering pesticide doses may accelerate the proliferation of resistance as the populations of resistance individuals that emerged after the pesticide administration grow faster than the populations of pre resistance individuals on the other hand if pesticides are mutagenic Œ± 0 then the post resistance populations grow faster than the pre resistance ones with increasing pesticide doses especially for higher values of mutation rates sensitivity Œ± answering our question on how resistance evolution is affected by variable mutation rates as a function of pesticide doses this suggests that reducing pesticide doses may be a more effective strategy for preventing the evolution of resistance when the pesticide has a high mutagenic potential at last to answer whether major single gene mutations or the accumulation of the multiple mutations leading to multi factorial resistance are differentially affected by pesticide dosing regimens we conclude that the effect of lowering pesticide doses on the evolution of resistance increases as the number of resistance factors n increases in the following we discuss the likely mechanism affecting these patterns despite the claims that pest populations would hardly evolve resistance to certain pesticides bradshaw et al 1997 empirical evidence shows that the evolution to these novel compounds continues worldwide heap 2014 especially when low doses are applied busi and powles 2009 early empirical evidence for the accumulation of resistance factors to insecticides mckenzie et al 1992 and herbicides heap and knight 1982 where low doses were used corroborate these outcomes we observed a stronger dependency of a multi step resistance evolution during pesticide administration on lower pesticide doses this result is reflected in the non linear dependency on the expression 1 pn for the relative importance of post resistance prevalence where n represents the number of required resistance factors to fully achieve resistance the key to understanding this process lies in how resistance emerges in the population in the context of one required mutation to resistance the number of resistant mutants produced during population growth up to size s is given by s m ln s n 0 r this quantity depends therefore linearly on 1 r but for n required mutations the solution is given by s m ln s n 0 r n the dependence on 1 r is now stronger than linear and if the number of required mutations is increased a fixed intrinsic population growth rate contributes dwindling to the production of resistant mutants this dependency on multiple required mutations makes fully resistant individuals increasingly less likely until t but prone to prosper for sufficiently large t under low pesticide doses in other words the importance of the preexistence of resistance in pest populations diminishes as the number of required resistance factors for resistance increases in a general evolutionary sense it would normally be expected that quantitative traits would likely evolve via the recombination of standing genetic variation whereas major mutations would be more likely to arise spontaneously and be selected rather than lost via drift as would more likely happen pre selection following the onset of selection our model formulation does not contrast different mutation processes and the breeding inheritance of distinct reproductive systems however based on our assumptions and the essential features to contrast the effects of pesticide dosing on the evolution of resistance our result directly sheds light on how the evolution of resistance to multiple pesticides may also be favored under low pesticide doses resistance to multiple pesticides can be driven by mutations at distinct loci powles and yu 2010 which may accumulate through the buildup of a collection of resistance factors a common strategy to avoid resistance evolution is to diversify pesticides in mixtures or rotations madgwick and kanitz 2023 if multiple pesticides are applied in conjunction the pest is unlikely to resist the pesticide treatment if their mechanism of action are distinct diggle et al 2003 although long term data has shown that such strategies are not necessarily effective in preventing resistance development hicks et al 2018 we observed that such resistance to multiple pesticides is likely to emerge in the long term if pesticide doses are ineffective in suppressing pest populations e g at low pesticide doses although not specifically related to multiple pesticide resistance empirical evidence shows that pest high survival rates are the culprit of the development of resistance to novel compounds such as glyphosate neve and powles 2005 which is in agreement with our results so instead of combining multiple novel pesticides to avoid the development of resistance or to use the minimum amount of pesticides necessary to avoid reaching the economic injury level in the present the combination of multiple evolutionary smart ipm techniques prioritizing preventive methods rather than curative ones such as plant vaccination intra and interspecific crop diversity and plant natural resistance and tolerance might be a safer and long term efficient option barzman et al 2015 stenberg 2017 it has been shown that biological controls the use of natural enemies and cultural controls the modification of cropping practices provide valuable alternatives to insecticides for the suppression of major arthropod crop pests mills and daane 2005 we found that the integration of various control methods is not just important for pest reduction but may represent the key to the success of the ipm approach in preventing resistance evolution the greater the pest mortality post pesticide administration i e p the lower the pest population growth and the number of mutants generated will be analogously if the source of pest mortality comes from further methods i e c not just pesticides both subpopulations i e pesticide resistant and non resistant will have lower growth rates diminishing resistance proliferation during the pesticide administration phase thus developing novel control methods and integrating distinct approaches that render various sources of pest mortality is pivotal for effective ipm in preventing resistance fostering such additional methods can be achieved through different approaches one of them is to augment through periodic release natural enemies of exotic or indigenous pests that cannot persist year round van lenteren 2000 the inoculation of small populations of natural enemies can be used to enhance colonization at crucial periods for season long pest suppression similarly large populations can be used for urgent suppression but often without a longer lasting impact a more passive approach would involve the conservation of natural enemy populations through habitat manipulation e g building nests or the alteration of crop production practices that directly harm these species harrison et al 2019 therefore in attempt to reduce pesticide resistance the identification of synergistic approaches in suppressing pest populations may represent a key practical challenge for effective crop management when concomitantly promoting the reduction in pesticide doses when pesticides can induce higher mutation rates alternative approaches in suppressing pest populations may become particularly important this is because higher pesticide doses can lead to an increase in the evolution of resistance with mutation rates growing as pesticide doses scale up although there is significant uncertainty surrounding some resistance management decisions gould et al 2018 a particular important finding of our work is that when pesticides increase mutation rates or select target genes van den bosch et al 2011 both the ecological e g reducing pesticide doses minimizing damage to biodiversity and evolutionary e g preventing resistance evolution perspectives of the ipm framework can be reconciled by lowering pesticide doses and implementing alternative approaches management strategies therefore should consider how to get rid of subpopulations of pests especially those pesticide resistant or with high mutation rates the use of transgenic crops that are resistant to pathogens and insects as part of a rotation can also be an effective ipm option kos et al 2009 a particular transgenic crop which have an inserted bacterial gene that produces lethal toxins to certain pests bacillus thuringiensis or bt toxin has barely selected for field resistance whereas organic bt treated crops have selected for many more cases of resistance gressel 2011 thus monitoring and forecasting pesticide effects on known resistance alleles will become crucial in decision support tools helping to determine when interventions such as reductions in pesticide doses are necessary or harmful for preventing resistance we advocate the development of fast and accurate methods for monitoring resistance alleles within pest populations and the funding of fundamental research on the evolutionary ecology of pest management through evolutionary modeling and experimental evolution which could be subsequently translated into applications green et al 2020 the gradual evolution of pesticide resistance through mutation can reduce the effectiveness of pest control measures and may lead to the development of pest outbreaks this can ultimately result in lower crop yields higher production costs and increased use of pesticides which can accelerate the evolution of pesticide resistance so in facing the huge complexity and importance regarding our food production the reconciliation of both ecological and evolutionary perspectives of ipm is a fruitful opportunity that can shed a light on the role that pesticide doses and alternative ipm methods have in the evolution of resistance 5 conclusion it is pivotal that pesticide dosing should follow ecological principles which would promote large benefits for biodiversity conservation colin et al 2020 public health hallenbeck and cunningham burns 2012 and likewise minimize economic impacts hicks et al 2018 but we show that lowering pesticide doses will not always prevent the evolution of resistance the ecological perspective to the ipm paradigm states that for low density pest populations low pesticide doses would be sufficient to promote their control due to sustained physiological stress colin et al 2020 however as highlighted in gressel 2011 we are confronted with a conundrum that has contradictory outcomes low pesticide doses might delay the evolution of major single gene resistance but may rapidly select for resistance due to the slow accumulation of resistance factors in pest populations thus an evolutionary perspective to the ipm is also needed in this context we argue that integrating methods and evaluating combined control effects is crucial for lessening the resistance evolution under the ipm approach in addition when we take into consideration the potential physiological stress induced by pesticides the resistance generated during pesticide administration may exceed the pre pesticide resistance in real word scenarios as a future avenue for research we claim therefore that understanding the stress imposed by pesticides on pest populations not just on behavioral or developmental traits but on mutation rates will further help elucidate the challenges imposed by lowering pesticide doses on pesticide evolution and directly support decisions for pesticide dosage reduction based on our findings we argue that a shift in the model of food production into a more sustainable form by reducing pesticide doses to control pests just beyond economic impairing levels would also need an evaluation of the evolutionary

24172,when attempting to model an ecosystem compromises must be made to retain the essence of the system and its functioning here we explore the implications of these aggregations on a modelled ecosystem by using ecopath to model the plankton food web in the strait of georgia sog a temperate coastal system on the west coast of canada in three seasons the food web is defined by fifteen functional groups representing autotrophic phytoplankton the microbial loop and mesozooplankton in three seasons differentiated by node biomass productivity and diet variations in the community composition lead to shifts in trophic behaviour and food web structure seasonally in spring autotrophic phytoplankton i e diatoms are the main source of carbon for the system in summer and winter the microbial loop becomes more important due to limited primary production these structural changes within the plankton food web throughout a year have implications for higher trophic levels including the seasonal availability and quality of food for planktivorous fish finally we compared this detailed seasonal approach to plankton modelling with a more common simplified approach and examined its impacts on the entire ecosystem the microbial loop is often excluded from coastal ecosystem models but is an important component influencing trophic positions and transfer efficiencies however aggregating plankton groups appears to be an adequate approach to plankton modelling in the sog but modelling decisions should be driven by the research question keywords plankton food web ecopath modelling ecosystem interactions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the construction of accurate food web models is critical for quantifying the importance of different components of oceanic ecosystems they are used to aid in understanding ecosystem functioning and for applications like assessing potential commercial yields in the strait of georgia sog on the west coast of canada fig 1 numerical biological and coupled physical biological models have been widely used for such purposes in the past few decades examples include dalsgaard et al 1998 li et al 2000 martell et al 2002 preikshot 2007 collins et al 2009 li et al 2010 allen and wolfe 2013 pe√±a et al 2016 and olson et al 2020 these studies have mostly focused on higher trophic levels e g fish marine mammals and or biophysical interactions where representations of ecological interactions within the plankton community were greatly simplified however plankton are a critical ecosystem component and are the key link between primary producers and fish more attention is needed to understand their interactions historically linking primary producers and higher trophic levels in this modelling has often been done by simplifying a diverse range of plankton into just a few groups i e the nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton or npz approach franks 2002 although this is not always the case i e mitra et al 2014 yet copepods in the sog are known to have a wide range of diets including prey ranging from bacteria and detritus to phytoplankton proto and metazoans el sabaawi et al 2009a 2010 costalago et al 2020 additionally mixotrophic plankton and the microbial loop increasingly recognized as critical to food web structure e g vargas et al 2007 are often not considered at all one approach which we will consider here is to model the system with many more groups although there are other philosophical approaches that could be considered i e verity and smetacek 1996 galbraith et al 2015 further more complex food web models are often constructed on a year averaged approach this approach ignores the large variations in plankton community composition and trophic behaviour throughout the year in temperate regions as the light driven spring bloom is very different in nature from nutrient limited summer productivity harrison et al 1983 both of these potential oversimplifications in modelling could lead to misrepresentations and erroneous results which could have cascading impacts in understanding the dynamics of the whole ecosystem here we investigate whether oversimplification of the planktonic component is important in the sog ecosystem by first developing a detailed 15 group quasi steady but seasonally varying plankton food web model using the ecopath framework christensen and walters 2004 the ecopath approach allows us to systematically assess the importance of different components of the planktonic ecosystem in a consistent manner this taxonomically diverse seasonal model provides insights into how carbon pathways and trophic interactions within the plankton community function and how these functions vary between the seasons we then simplify the model by aggregating the plankton groups with averaged rate parameters to reduce the plankton component complexity to that found in an existing sog ecopath model which includes higher trophic levels preikshot 2007 this allows us to examine the effects of this aggregation on the overall food web structure and on the higher trophic levels in particular 2 methods 2 1 study area and biomass data the sog is a large semi enclosed basin situated between vancouver island to the west and the british columbia mainland to the east fig 1 it is connected to the pacific ocean through relatively shallow passages on the north and south ends here we focus on the deep offshore portions in the north and central strait outlined area in fig 1 the surface area of interest is approximately 4600 km2 with a maximum depth of 430 m and average depth of 330 m physical circulation is estuarine with a surface outflow of brackish water mostly through the southern channels balanced by nutrient rich upwelling of deeper waters whose residence time in the strait is more than half a year pawlowicz et al 2007 olson et al 2020 although the freshwater input has a large seasonal component the estuarine circulation is only weakly dependent on this component and is relatively steady year round riche and pawlowicz 2014 high resolution biomass data are available for both the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in recent years fig 2 the zooplankton biomass dataset maintained by fisheries and oceans canada dfo and described in detail in mackas et al 2013 perry et al 2021 spans 2006 2017 although most samples are in 2012 2017 and consists of species level biomass data in g dry weight d w m 3 zooplankton data were collected using vertical net tows from various depths across the sog and in both daytime and nighttime samples were collected using bongo and scor nets with a mesh size of 200 to 335 Œº m and a mouth diameter of 0 42 to 0 58 m after a careful evaluation we only considered tows to depths of 200 m to capture known diel vertical migrators harrison et al 1983 mackas et al 2013 mcewan 2022 in both day and night tows resulting in a dataset of 399 tows fig 2 we examined the regional variability of the mesozooplankton community by dividing the sog into two regions supplemental material fig s1 1 although some regional variations do exist supplemental material fig s1 2 they were smaller than the seasonal variations so it was reasonable to consider the sog as a single geographic region with seasonal variation the strait wide average community composition was weighted by the area of each region although long term changes in both sog zooplankton biomass and community structure have been documented by perry et al 2021 year to year variation over the years in our dataset was reported to be only on the order of 20 and so it seemed reasonable to aggregate all our measurements across years zooplankton biomass was converted from g d w to g carbon gc using conversion factors of 0 1 gc g d w for gelatinous zooplankton 0 2 gc g d w for gastropods and 0 4 gc g d w for all other groups harris et al 2000 monthly and seasonal averages were then calculated following the methods described in mackas et al 2013 first total sample biomass for each group was log transformed as log 10 b c where b is biomass in gc m 2 and c is a constant to account for zero observations with an order of magnitude related to the detection threshold either 0 01 or 0 001 g d w m 2 converted to gc m 2 using the conversion factors above next averages were computed on the transformed dataset finally results were raised to a power of 10 to recover the original units this estimate is thus the median rather than the mean in the natural scale a seasonal analysis of night day biomass ratios for all groups was carried out to investigate possible net avoidance and any remaining diurnal vertical migration effects even after restricting our dataset to deep tows in areas with bottom depths 200 m only euphausiids in summer had a statistically significant difference between day and night biomass mcewan 2022 thus daytime estimates of euphausiids in july to october were increased by a multiplicative factor of 2 59 to correct for this difference note that this factor is different from the value of 3 used year round in mackas et al 2013 and perry et al 2021 based on shaw and robinson 1998 we use our calculated value because it is based on the more extensive and recent dataset used in this analysis although the food web results described below are not sensitive to this change phytoplankton biomass and community composition were derived from 5 years 2015 2017 and 2019 2020 of pigment data measured using high performance liquid chromatography hplc collected on routine cruises by dfo there were 4 to 9 cruises per year between february and november with 5 to 15 stations per cruise fig 2 one pigment sample per station was collected in niskin bottles between 0 and 5 m depth cell count data were also provided for 25 of the stations used to determine species dominance the 311 pigment samples were analysed using chemtax version 1 95 which derives estimates of biomass contributions of phytoplankton taxa relative to total chlorophyll a chl a mackey et al 1996 eight expected taxa were selected based on the associated microscope counts and from a literature review i e stockner et al 1979 belluz et al 2021 diatoms dinoflagellates cyanobacteria prasinophytes crytophytes dictychophytes haptophytes and raphidophytes volumetric concentrations were converted to areal amounts using conversion factors derived from conductivity temperature depth ctd fluorometry profiles taken at the time of sampling methods regarding chemtax analysis and depth integration are detailed in supplemental material s2 these phytoplankton data were converted to carbon biomass using a c chl a ratio of 50 g g 1 welschmeyer et al 1991 booth et al 1993 kirchman et al 1993 boyd et al 1995 although recent data show that the c chl a ratio varies seasonally i e jakobsen and markager 2016 this constant ratio was used year round again we examined the regional variability of the phytoplankton community supplemental material s1 3 the small variations found were taken into account by weighting the strait wide average community composition by the area of each region ciliate and heterotrophic flagellate biomass were not recorded in either of the datasets described above both are too small to be retained by zooplankton nets and heterotrophic flagellates are not pigmented thus missed by hplc analysis the estimates of these two groups were derived from sampling completed during the strait of georgia ecosystem monitoring stratogem program pawlowicz et al 2003 samples were collected at station s4 1 fig 1 during surveys carried out weekly to monthly between april 2002 and june 2005 in total 52 phytoplankton samples were collected at a depth of 5 m using niskin bottles the detailed composition of these samples was obtained through observation identification and enumeration of the settled particles under a zeiss axiovert 10 inverted microscope cell abundance was converted to carbon biomass using estimates of cell biovolume from haigh et al 1992 and converted to carbon using the equations of strathmann 1967 biomass was depth integrated using the median m 3 m 2 ratio from the previous pigment analysis the ciliate mesodinium rubrum also known as myrionecta rubra was an important component of the plankton system in the stratogem sampling and was assumed to represent the ciliate population in the study area m rubrum is a mixotrophic plankton that can photosynthesize by ingesting cryptophytes and retaining their chloroplasts gustafson et al 2000 so they have some pigmentation it is possible that this pigmentation was caught by the hplc analysis but recognized as cryptophyte biomass leading to a slight overestimation of cryptophyte biomass however the relative contribution of cryptophytes to total phytoplankton biomass is comparable in both the cell counts and hplc analysis within 10 so this contamination is probably minimal finally although bacterial abundances for the sog have been reported in the literature seki and kennedy 1969 bell and albright 1981 there are no recent measurements instead the ecopath model was used to estimate the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria as part of the modelling process the literature estimates were reserved for comparison with model outputs 2 2 ecopath model we developed seasonal steady state food web models using ecopath 6 6 5 https ecopath org for the plankton community to investigate trophic interactions at different times of the year ecopath is a widely used ecological modelling software that creates a snapshot of an ecosystem by aggregating ecologically important species into functional groups fgs linked by trophic interactions the model assumes a mass balance within the system over an arbitrary period in this case a season such that the fluxes of model currency here carbon into an fg must equal the fluxes out of that group christensen et al 2005 as implemented here production for the i th fg is described using 1 b i p b i e e i j 1 n b j q b j d c j i 0 where b i and b j are the biomasses of prey and predator respectively gc m 2 p b i is the production biomass ratio d 1 e e i is the ecotrophic efficiency which represents the proportion of mortality that is explicitly modelled where e e i 1 implies that all losses are due to predation and e e i 0 implies that all losses are due to natural processes and the functional group fg mass gets converted to detritus q b i is the consumption biomass ratio d 1 d c j i is the fraction of losses by consumption in the i th group as prey in the diet of the j th predator group i e j d c j i 1 and n is the number of potential consumer groups christensen et al 2005 an ecopath model requires any three of the four basic input parameters b p b q b e e to be defined for each group and calculates the fourth missing parameter by enforcing the mass balance among the groups a diet composition is also required for each consumer group supplemental material s3 tables s3 3 s3 5 ecopath models can also include terms for losses due to fisheries migration and biomass accumulation but these have been excluded in this study eq 1 is used to enforce a mass balance between the fgs within each fg mass balance is described using 2 q i p i r i 1 g s i q i where q i is consumption rate gc m 2 d 1 with q i b i q b i p i is production rate gc m 2 d 1 with p i b i p b i r i is respiration rate gc m 2 d 1 and g s i is the fraction of unassimilated food loss due to feces and directed to detritus q i and p i are calculated from eq 1 and g s i is a model input making r i an output of the model once the food web parameters have been determined the ecopath software can calculate a trophic level tl for each fg lindeman 1942 odum and heald 1975 producers and detritus are assigned a tl of 1 and consumers have a tl of 1 plus the weighted average of the prey s tl christensen et al 2005 2 3 model construction and balancing phytoplankton and zooplankton fgs and their biomasses were largely aggregated and defined based on the major taxa seen in the analysis of biomass data and their role in the ecosystem section 3 1 thus mesozooplankton were divided into 10 fgs ordered by trophic level tl from highest to lowest 1 gelatinous zooplankton 2 chaetognaths 3 amphipods 4 decapods 5 euphausiids 6 large copepods 7 other zooplankton 8 gastropods 9 small medium copepods and 10 appendicularians then in addition to a group of pure autotrophic phytoplankton two mixotrophic microzooplankton fgs were included ciliates and flagellates finally there was a heterotrophic bacteria group and a detritus group detrital biomass was set to a value of 1 gc m 2 although this value does not impact model outputs p b estimates for the photosynthetic groups were calculated using measurements of primary productivity in the sog based on 13c measurements in 2017 2018 other p b and q b estimates were based on values from literature or assumptions and varied seasonally see supplemental material s3 mixotrophic production is modelled in ecopath using the proportion of production from primary production parameter or trophic mode tm the tm ranges between 0 for heterotrophs and 1 for autotrophs tm for ciliates was assumed to be 0 90 year round d alelio et al 2016 flagellate tm was calculated based on the ratio of heterotrophic flagellate production to pigmented flagellate mixotrophic and autotrophic production and the associated b and p b values and varied seasonally section 3 1 a microbial loop was represented by the trophic interactions between the two mixotrophic microzooplankton groups flagellates and ciliates heterotrophic bacteria and detritus only one detritus group was included representing flows from unassimilated food and dead organic matter g s i is typically in the range of 0 2 to 0 4 for plankton christensen et al 2005 heymans et al 2016 so g s i 0 3 was assumed for all groups bacterial biomass was left unknown but an e e of 0 90 was assumed for all seasons diet links between predator and prey were identified in the literature and when not available using knowledge of size classes and feeding strategy e g whether filter feeders or selective hunters the scale of these links were based on feeding strategy and prey biomass there are many subtleties in this determination which are explained in detail in the supplemental material s4 note that cannibalism within a group is allowed and often occurs when fgs aggregate different species imported food i e terrestrial detritus is not considered as it is known to be only a small part of this food web costalago et al 2020 for each model three of the four basic input parameters were provided for each fg usually b p b q b the ecopath software then estimated the missing parameter for each group e e for all but bacteria an ecopath model is considered to be consistent with current pelagic food web functioning under two general conditions first all p q values p q p b q b should be between 0 2 and 0 4 for bacteria and mesozooplankton groups christensen et al 2005 this was checked during the process of defining p b and q b values for the mixotrophic groups p q is greater than 1 because most of the production comes from autotrophic activity second e e should be less than one for all groups that is more of any group is grown than is consumed by other groups a model with this property is considered balanced if after an initial run of the ecopath model some e e s were found to be larger than one unbalanced the diet matrix was adjusted to bring this e e down as diets were judged to be the input parameter with the highest level of uncertainty adjustment was carried out systematically in an iterative process as follows the diet fraction for the predator fg responsible for the greatest consumption of a prey group with the highest unbalanced e e was slightly reduced so more of its food was obtained proportionately from other sources and the model re run if the group s e e was still 1 the process was repeated if after this recalculation a different group had a larger e e the small diet fraction reduction was then applied to this other group the process was repeated until all e e were 1 typically the unbalanced groups were those that were consumed by many other groups small medium copepods fg 9 and other zooplankton fg 7 often initial adjustments were made to amphipod diets as they had high consumption rates q b q b more details explained in supplemental material s4 3 results our food web description developed in four steps first we describe the plankton community composition in the strait of georgia sog in an average year using monthly means second using these results we separate the year into three seasons spring summer and winter and construct mass balanced food web models for each season these food web models thus represent our best knowledge regarding the functioning of this planktonic ecosystem third we aggregate these models in a similar manner as those in npz system models by averaging biomasses and rate parameters finally the simplified model is then inserted into an existing annual average ecopath model that includes higher trophic levels to examine the effects of our improved knowledge 3 1 plankton community composition the monthly mean phytoplankton community fig 3 shows that a spring bloom occurs in march april with a strong dominance of diatoms 85 skeletonema costatum thalassiosira spp chaetoceros spp and a peak phytoplankton biomass of 11 6 gc m 2 summer june to october biomass is lower than the spring average of 3 71 gc m 2 including heterotrophic flagellates and more variable with episodic blooms dominated by flagellates including cryptophytes i e telaulax spp and dictyochophytes i e dinobryon spp raphidophytes heterosigma akashiwo are a harmful algae that bloom occasionally but only in summer a large bloom occurred in summer of 2018 esenkulova et al 2021 but this year is not included in our hplc dataset phytoplankton biomass in winter november to february is low average of 2 44 gc m 2 including heterotrophic flagellates and dominated by small cells i e cryptophytes the heterotrophic flagellate pigmented flagellate ratios are 0 54 0 17 and 0 15 in spring summer and winter respectively this results in an estimated heterotrophic flagellate biomass of 0 70 0 22 and 0 14 g m 2 in spring summer and winter respectively the fraction of heterotrophs is low in winter but this might be underestimated because winter is dominated by small cells 20 Œº m which could be missed by microscope counts however these ratios are similar to the average heterotrophic autotrophic nanoflagellate ratio found in the northeastern pacific of 0 63 in may and 0 25 in february doherty 1995 the primary producer taxa captured by hplc were aggregated into two fgs based on their role in the ecosystem fully autotrophic phytoplankton and mixotrophic flagellates fig 4 fully autotrophic phytoplankton include diatoms prasinophytes haptophytes and cyanobacteria flagellates comprise a large selection of auto mixo and heterotrophs but as prey they are mostly indistinguishable and so were put into a second group which is then mixotrophic in nature this flagellate fg contains cryptophytes dinoflagellates raphidophytes dictyochophytes and heterotrophic flagellates jeong et al 2010 stoecker et al 2017 the community composition within these two fgs varies seasonally fig 4 with e g phytoplankton almost completely composed of diatoms in spring but only about 50 of the biomass in other seasons a third group of primary producers ciliates the mixotroph m rubrum identified through microscope counts was included as an additional mixotrophic fg its biomass is particularly significant in the summer fig 4 but is of more minor importance in other seasons both flagellates and m rubrum are included as separate components in a recent coupled physical biological model of the sog olson et al 2020 and so we do the same here turning to larger zooplankton it is simpler to describe variations after aggregating our data into the functional groups we will use in our model on average total zooplankton biomass peaks in july at 9 49 gc m 2 and is a minimum in winter with a lowest observed value of 2 59 gc m 2 in february fig 5 trends suggest that january values might even lower although no observations are available this biomass is dominated by crustaceans year round primarily small medium copepods e g metridia pacifica calanus pacificus and calanus marshallae making up 30 44 of zooplankton biomass followed by amphipods e g cyphocaris challengeri euphausiids primarily euphausia pacifica and large copepods e g neocalanus plumchrus and eucalanus bungii the relative proportion of most groups is roughly constant year round so that the biomass of each group increases rapidly after the spring bloom and remains high through the summer until declining again through the winter 3 2 seasonal models on the basis of the monthly breakdowns we identified 3 different seasonal community structures a spring march may period with high diatom dominated phytoplankton biomass and intermediate zooplankton biomass a summer june october ecosystem with high zooplankton biomass and an intermediate phytoplankton biomass with a high proportion of ciliates and flagellates and a winter november february ecosystem with low plankton biomass using our seasonally varying biomass data as well as other input parameters like growth rates see supplemental material s3 food web models in the ecopath framework are now set up and adjusted until balanced fig 6 following procedures described in section 2 3 spring has the highest total biomass tb of the three seasons 16 76 gc m 2 fig 6 primarily due to the high phytoplankton biomass 46 of tb this phytoplankton biomass proportion decreases to 16 and 20 of the tb in summer and winter respectively the decrease in phytoplankton dominance after the spring is complemented by a relative increase in mixotrophic biomass fgs 11 12 from 16 in spring to 20 and 22 of tb in summer and winter respectively consistent with the community composition analysis in section 3 1 this leads to a shift in trophic structure as a higher proportion of carbon flow passes through the microbial loop i e between detritus and bacteria before reaching mesozooplankton in contrast mesozooplankton biomass fgs 1 10 is highest in summer 7 76 gc m 2 with small medium copepods fg 9 making up the largest proportion in every season estimated heterotrophic bacteria biomass ranges from 0 36 gc m 2 in winter to 1 46 gc m 2 in summer although this value is determined by our assumed e e of 0 90 for this group assuming a smaller e e would result in proportionately more bacterial biomass without affecting the rest of the system the ecopath analysis indicates that the planktonic component of the food web in the sog spans 3 trophic levels fig 6 the highest trophic levels seen in the models are 3 04 in spring chaetognaths 3 13 in summer gelatinous zooplankton and 3 20 in winter gelatinous zooplankton all mesozooplankton have lower trophic levels in the spring than the other two seasons table 1 indicative of the shift to more herbivorous activity in this season after the spring bloom microzooplankton increase in dominance and zooplankton diets shift to reflect this change in food availability increasing their trophic position flagellates and ciliates are between tls 1 and 2 because of their mixotrophic behaviour flows beginning with primary producers and detritus form the main energy pathways in the system total system flow is defined as the sum of all flows in the system i e consumption respiration and total flows to detritus christensen et al 2005 the proportion of this system flow that originates from detritus as opposed to primary producers accounts for 50 48 and 53 of system flow in spring summer and winter respectively this indicates that system production is highly dependent on the detritus pool year round which highlights the importance of the microbial loop in the system where energy is transferred up the food web through detritus bacteria and microzooplankton total consumption flows tc are highest in summer fig 6 in all three seasons small medium copepods fg 9 and heterotrophic bacteria fg 13 have the highest consumption rates 25 35 of tc each in spring flagellates also account for a large proportion of tc 15 mainly with their consumption of phytoplankton and flagellates of the other mesozooplankton groups large copepods fg 6 amphipods fg 3 and other zooplankton fg 7 have the largest consumption rates zooplankton respiration is also highest in summer at 0 70 gc m 2 d 1 compared with spring and winter values of 0 50 and 0 17 gc m 2 d 1 respectively primary productivity pp ranges from 0 63 in winter to 5 01 in spring gc m 2 d 1 with an annual average of 2 19 gc m 2 d 1 in spring phytoplankton productivity fg 14 contributes 81 of the total pp due primarily to the diatom bloom after spring this dominance of the pp pool declines as mixotrophic microzooplankton groups fgs 11 12 increase in importance in summer 48 of pp comes from fg 14 and 52 comes from fgs 11 12 in winter 51 of pp comes from fg 14 and 49 comes from fgs 11 12 lower trophic level groups i e detritus and primary producers had their highest ecotrophic efficiencies e e s of 0 6 0 8 in summer table 1 a high e e for primary producers means that most of their production is being consumed by higher groups indicating that there is less excess food available low natural mortality in this season the high e e for detritus in summer indicates less material flowing into this pool and more flowing out of it this highlights the importance of these groups as food sources to omnivorous and carnivorous zooplankton on the other hand the low e e s for detritus and primary producers in spring 0 2 indicate that there is a large amount of carbon exported into detritus thus fuelling the detrital food chain the high e e of grazing groups i e small medium copepods gastropods other zooplankton in summer and winter emphasizes their importance as a critical link between primary producers and carnivorous zooplankton some of the zooplankton groups may have artificially low e e s because predation by fish was not explicitly included in the models we return to this later however using these e e s the amount of mesozooplankton production fgs 1 10 unused in the plankton system and therefore theoretically available to higher trophic levels is 54 2 gc m 2 yr 1 which is 43 of total zooplankton production 3 3 group aggregation these seasonal models highlight the complexities of the trophic interactions within the plankton community in the sog however when groups are aggregated and the flows combined one can get a picture of the overall relative structure of the system fig 7 we aggregated the system into six functional groups carnivorous zooplankton cz fgs 1 4 omnivorous zooplankton oz fgs 5 10 mixotrophic microzooplankton mz fgs 11 12 heterotrophic bacteria hb fg 13 phytoplankton ph fg 14 and detritus d fg 15 rate parameters for each group are calculated as a biomass weighted average of the rates for all fgs combined in spring ph are the main energy source for oz who then transfer energy to cz fig 7 in summer and winter mz shift to become the more dominant carbon source for these groups while system biomass and magnitude of carbon flows are much higher in summer than winter the relative structure of the system is very similar this structure could represent the system under limiting conditions where nutrient limitation is occurring in summer and light limitation is occurring in winter interestingly the structure of the microbial loop consisting of d hb and mz is remarkably similar between the three seasons and makes up a large proportion of system carbon flow 30 many food web models aggregate the plankton community in a similar way often simplifying into just a few groups averaged over a year christensen et al 2005 with this in mind we calculated parameters that could be used in a typical year average model with a simplified plankton structure input parameters were calculated by summing the total fluxes over the three seasons for all fgs within each aggregated group with the length of each season accounted for and then dividing by total biomass b tables 2 and 3 and converted to consistent units biomass was converted using a wet weight carbon ratio of 8 33 g g 1 for cz and oz harris et al 2000 6 g g 1 for mz and ph preikshot 2007 and 10 g g 1 for hb romanova and sazhin 2010 p b and q b rates were converted to yearly values these aggregated average parameter estimates are derived from a more quantitative analysis of the plankton community than most sog models to date to evaluate the utility of this approach these aggregated groups and calculated parameters were put into an existing ecopath with ecosim ewe model for the sog preikshot 2007 preikshot et al 2013 replacing their plankton groups the objective of the preikshot 2007 model was to investigate changes in fished species marine mammals and bird populations by running a time dynamic simulation between 1950 and 2002 this preikshot 2007 model represents the sog ecosystem using 53 functional groups 5 of which represent plankton phytoplankton krill herbivorous zooplankton carnivorous zooplankton and jellies using wet weight as a currency our cz group replaced the original carnivorous zooplankton fg 41 and jellies fg 43 groups oz replaced the original herbivorous zooplankton group fg 42 and krill group fg 40 predation of these original groups were summed for the new group parameter values for ph replaced those used in the original phytoplankton group fg 51 mz and hb groups were added we only ran the static ecopath part of the model with these changes to the plankton community the model still nearly balances except the e e of carnivorous zooplankton was 1 01 a minor adjustment to fish consumption of zooplankton would allow the model to balance the original model had higher zooplankton b s but lower p b s compared to our annual average model resulting in comparable productivity p total zooplankton productivity was 1078 t km 2 yr 1 and 967 t km 2 yr 1 in the original and updated models respectively in the updated model 13 of zooplankton productivity is consumed by whales and fish 128 t km 2 yr 1 and 6 is consumed by other non zooplankton groups i e benthic filter feeders 57 t km 2 yr 1 pp from phytoplankton was also similar at 2860 t km 2 yr 1 and 2669 t km 2 yr 1 in the original and updated models respectively however pp from the new mixotrophic group increased total pp substantially by 1521 t km 2 yr 1 the inclusion of the microbial loop also increased the proportion of flow originating from detritus as opposed to primary producers from 20 to 30 trophic levels generally increased due to less strictly herbivorous feeding by zooplankton and the inclusion of the microbial loop the model included fisheries in the sog and the mean trophic level of the catch increased from 3 48 to 3 60 4 discussion with 15 functional groups representing plankton and detritus divided into 3 seasons we have constructed the most complex planktonic system of any existing sog food web model indeed existing models including dalsgaard et al 1998 li et al 2000 martell et al 2002 preikshot 2007 collins et al 2009 li et al 2010 allen and wolfe 2013 pe√±a et al 2016 olson et al 2020 typically have only used two to five groups to represent plankton including seasonality and increased complexity allows us to more closely align the food web with available knowledge about specific taxa and their interactions however in addition to this basic structure food web model construction in the ecopath framework also requires specifying a large number of physiological parameters to ensure that a given structure works in the sense of allowing all groups to have enough food while maintaining a mass balance assumption as usual for ecopath models these parameters were mostly determined from existing literature as well as judgments about both food sources and the feeding strategies of different groups here these judgments were implemented systematically by defining the degree of carnivory herbivory bacterial and detrital consumption supplemental material s3 the initial model runs for each season showed that the general food web structures were mostly internally consistent with the available biomass for most groups supporting ecosystem needs however a small number of functional groups were usually unbalanced on this initial run with more biomass being consumed than was available judging that diet compositions were the least well known parameters in the model a tuning took place in which the fraction of these unbalanced groups in the diet of their major consumer was iteratively reduced without changing the overall feeding strategy until balance was achieved although we carried this out tuning manually the algorithm could be implemented in computer code in the future by including more complexity and seasonality in our models we were able to investigate how the food web varies seasonally and infer how these changes may impact other components of the ecosystem e g nutrient availability for fish we also examined how this added complexity compares to the more common simplified approach however before going further we should evaluate our models by comparing our initial biomass and community composition estimates with others for the sog and also by comparing other parameters such as trophic positions productivities and bacterial biomass estimates with existing but independent knowledge about the sog ecosystem 4 1 seasonal plankton biomass and community composition our analysis of planktonic biomass and community composition in the deep strait of georgia is reasonably consistent with existing analyses of these datasets e g mackas et al 2013 belluz et al 2021 perry et al 2021 based on this analysis we suggest it is reasonable to divide the plankton ecosystem into three periods spring march may summer june october and winter november february the spring period is characterized by high productivity and begins with the spring diatom bloom known to be triggered by increased light levels and surface layer stability stockner et al 1979 collins et al 2009 suchy et al 2022 and the subsequent increase in copepod reproduction harrison et al 1983 on average over the hplc dataset 2015 2020 excluding 2018 phytoplankton biomass peaked in march and was heavily dominated by diatoms 86 of phytoplankton biomass although the spring bloom is known to typically occur between late february to early april collins et al 2009 allen and wolfe 2013 the monthly average biomass in march 11 6 gc m 2 or 7 mgchl a m 3 was within the range of a typical spring bloom based on satellite derived estimates of the sog from 2003 to 2016 6 2 14 1 mgchl a m 3 suchy et al 2022 as well as bottle samples from 2015 to 2018 in the northern sog 7 05 12 4 mgchl a m 3 belluz et al 2021 spring blooms in the sog can reach 15 mgchl a m 3 harrison et al 1983 however these peaks might not be directly reflected in the monthly average as the spring progresses nutrients are depleted and grazing increases causing the diatom bloom to crash biomass over the summer period is lower than in spring and flagellates and ciliates increase in dominance figs 3 4 consistent with known patterns stockner et al 1979 harrison et al 1983 belluz et al 2021 reintroduction of nutrients to the surface layer by wind or tidal events is known to stimulate occasional late summer or early autumn phytoplankton blooms collins et al 2009 pe√±a et al 2016 belluz et al 2021 zooplankton biomass peaks in mid summer on average in july at 9 49 gc m 2 fig 5 largely driven by increased copepod reproduction harrison et al 1983 copepods fgs 6 and 9 make up about 45 of the zooplankton biomass year round followed by amphipods and euphausiids consistent with previous analyses in the sog mackas et al 2013 perry et al 2021 suchy et al 2022 previous studies have determined that zooplankton biomass peaks about one month after maximum chl a biomass e g stockner et al 1979 pe√±a et al 2016 although exact timing and community composition of the zooplankton peak may vary with bloom timing suchy et al 2022 in winter primary production is light limited and phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses are at a minimum 4 2 trophic positions the weighted average trophic level tl of mesozooplankton was 2 36 2 51 and 2 50 in spring summer and winter respectively the increase in trophic level from spring to summer is consistent with the findings of flores ruiz 2020 where zooplankton in the sog had a mean one standard deviation tl of 2 14 0 09 in april 2 26 0 07 in august and 2 53 0 28 in december based on stable nitrogen isotope analysis it is also consistent with the stable isotope analysis by el sabaawi et al 2010 where copepods had lower trophic positions in the spring due to herbivorous feeding the changes in trophic position from season to season affect the total food chain length and therefore efficiency of energy transfer hairston and hairston 1993 post 2002 the mean path length defined as the average number of groups an inflow or outflow passes through finn 1976 varies seasonally in spring when the system is primarily supported by the phytoplankton group the mean path length is short 2 71 indicating that the system is more resilient to perturbations in this season post 2002 the mean path length was longer in summer 6 22 and winter 4 70 when flagellates and the microbial loop play a larger role in supporting the system increasing the complexity of trophic interactions these longer chains indicate that the system may be less stable than in the spring 4 3 system productivity in the models seasonal conditions were represented by changes in functional group biomass b and p b q b rates which allowed for investigation into productivity p fluctuations throughout a year both primary and secondary productivities can be compared primary productivity pp in the sog has been estimated using a variety of methods table 4 while estimates of gross and net primary productivity new primary production and net community production are not easily comparable they give an indication of ecosystem functioning the pp estimates and seasonal trends from our models are slightly larger than the other known estimates but within reason crustacean productivity ranged from 0 09 winter to 0 42 summer gc m 2 d 1 with a yearly average of 0 27 gc m 2 d 1 these results are supported by estimates of crustacean secondary productivity using the chitobase method i e suchy et al 2016 sastri and dower 2009 and empirical model estimates kwong et al 2020 in suchy et al 2016 crustacean productivity in nearby saanich inlet ranged between 0 01 and 0 65 gc m 2 d 1 the annual average crustacean productivity in the sog measured by sastri and dower 2009 was 0 21 gc m 2 d 1 4 4 bacteria and the microbial loop a novel aspect of our modelling is the attempt to include a microbial loop the role of bacteria in the sog is not well studied yet these models indicate that a substantial proportion about 30 of carbon biomass is cycled through this part of the food web because limited heterotrophic bacterial biomass data were available we allowed the models to estimate bacterial carbon assuming an ecotrophic efficiency of 0 90 bacterial biomass estimates ranged from 0 36 to 1 46 gc m 2 although these estimates can be increased by decreasing the assumed e e without otherwise affecting our models these estimates were within the range 0 04 to 3 gc m 2 measured by seki and kennedy 1969 and the summer range 0 8 to 1 7 gc m 2 reported by bell and albright 1981 from 8 to 17 mgc m 3 assuming depth integration to 100 m the model estimates are also comparable to measurements in other coastal regions bacterial biomass within the upper 50 m of the water column ranges from 0 303 to 0 925 gc m 2 in reloncav√≠fjord chile gonz√°lez et al 2010 in the polar fjord kongsfjorden svalbard bacterial biomass ranged from 0 4 to 2 7 gc m 2 iversen and seuthe 2011 there may be other significant consumers such as benthic filter feeders i e glass sponge reefs kahn et al 2018 which may suggest that bacterial biomass is underestimated in our models indeed glass sponges are abundant in the sog forming reefs covering hundreds of square kilometres conway et al 2005 kahn et al 2018 and removing bacterial carbon at high rates i e 0 96 gc m 2 d 1 over the reefs chu and leys 2010 on the other hand glass sponge reefs only cover a small percentage of the sog s total area 0 2 of 6800 km2 dunham et al 2018 so although effects might be large in some places overall it is likely low detritus and phytoplankton are the two primary sources of organic carbon in the system thus bacteria may form an important alternate food source for filter feeders especially in the winter seki and kennedy 1969 albright 1983 bell and albright 1981 estimated the ratios of bacterial production to phytoplankton production as 0 25 1 in the strait and 0 04 1 during the spring bloom this is consistent with our results of 0 10 0 17 1 in summer and winter and 0 04 1 in spring the higher ratio outside of the spring bloom highlights the increased importance of the detrital carbon pathway as a food source outside of the spring bloom both mixotrophic groups fgs 11 12 play a large role in the transfer of energy from bacteria to the higher trophic levels because mixotrophy is advantageous when the availability of light and or nutrients is low p√•lsson and gran√©li 2004 stoecker et al 2017 leles et al 2018 by consuming these smaller particles including bacteria that are less available to zooplankton due to their small size mixotrophic microzooplankton become an important pathway enhancing carbon flow to mesozooplankton consumers ward and follows 2016 stoecker et al 2017 as demonstrated in the model aggregation section 3 3 this enhancement then translates into an increase in trophic transfer efficiency tte the ratio of production between two consecutive trophic levels landry and calbet 2004 ward and follows 2016 leles et al 2018 when the microbial loop was included in the preikshot 2007 model tte increased from 16 to 25 4 5 nutritional content of zooplankton the plankton community in the strait of georgia is temporally highly variable due to high turnover rates and changing conditions i e temperature nutrients light availability throughout a year as many zooplankton are opportunistic feeders this variability translates to considerable changes in food availability and therefore diet composition for many zooplankton el sabaawi et al 2009b 2010 changes in diet from autotrophic phytoplankton mostly diatoms in spring to flagellates in summer and winter also has implications on the nutritional quality of zooplankton as prey in terms of their fatty acid composition a common indicator of nutritional quality is the dha epa ratio meaning the ratio of the fatty acids fas docosahexaenoic acid dha a marker for flagellates and eicosapentaenoic acid epa a marker for diatoms mayzaud et al 1989 dalsgaard et al 2003 kainz et al 2004 nutritional quality in each season can be estimated using 3 dha epa e s t b d dha d b f dha f b d epa d b f epa f where b d and b f are the biomasses of diatoms d and flagellates f respectively mg d w m 2 dha and epa are the average fa content of each group Œº g fa mg d w 1 from peltomaa et al 2019 because of the shift from diatom dominated production in spring to flagellate dominated production in summer and winter we calculate that the dha epa ratio available is 70 higher in summer when compared to spring this higher nutritional value in summer over spring will transfer to zooplankton indeed costalago et al 2020 measured that zooplankton across the sog had 11 to 44 higher dha epa ratios in the summer compared to spring making them higher quality food and impacting the dynamics growth and survival of their consumers i e juvenile pacific salmon and pacific herring john et al 2001 costalago et al 2020 4 6 the use of simplified community dynamics in numerical models standard applications for food web models include fisheries management questions heymans et al 2014 or investigating biological physical interactions i e collins et al 2009 pe√±a et al 2016 olson et al 2020 due to lack of knowledge or computational resources planktonic ecosystems are often set up in a rather ad hoc manner with rate parameters undergoing some tuning so that results e g timing of blooms magnitude of production are reasonable an alternative approach would be to derive a simpler model of a planktonic ecosystem by explicitly aggregating a more complex and realistic model such as those described here but does this alternative provide any advantages in practice we investigated this question by aggregating the 15 group 3 season system derived here into 6 groups modelled over a year we then replaced the plankton community in an existing sog ecopath model with this aggregate section 3 3 our parameters were defined quantitatively using the relative contributions of individual plankton taxa throughout the year but interestingly this quantitative and more detailed approach did not make a substantial difference to the overall ecosystem fulton et al 2003 while the input parameter values differed i e b p b q b phytoplankton and zooplankton productivity only varied slightly 10 the inclusion of the microbial loop specifically mixotrophy had the biggest impact on our understanding of food web dynamics its inclusion increased pp which then increased the delivery of organic material to higher trophic levels however few food web models include groups representing the microbial loop i e heterotrophic bacteria mixo or heterotrophic flagellates and microzooplankton when considered over an average year aggregating the plankton community had minimal impact on the modelled system for the strait of georgia however taking this more detailed multi taxa approach can answer certain research questions indeed the few ecopath type models that take this approach aim to investigate specific aspects of the plankton community such as characterizing the roles of key species pav√©s et al 2015 estimating hard to measure parameters webber et al 2015 or determining how bloom conditions change the community structure d alelio et al 2016 indeed our detailed models can also investigate some of these questions for the strait of georgia overall the modelling approach should be determined by a careful consideration of the research aims 4 7 model shortcomings and opportunities for expansion construction of any model involves compromises and we have made a number of them first the phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass datasets were collected over different time periods 2015 2017 2019 2020 for phytoplankton via hplc 2003 2005 for cell counts and 2006 2017 for zooplankton fluctuations in oceanographic conditions over these different time periods may impact average community composition and biomass estimates but for the years in which data were available biomass fluctuations have been previously reported as small perry et al 2021 however zooplankton community structure is known to vary over 5 to 10 year periods perry et al 2021 which were not considered in the averaging procedures here the aim of the modelling was to get a baseline understanding of the system which we judged was best achieved using the most amount of data available in the future efforts could be made to stratify the data to periods of these known long term variabilities and give insights into whether the food web structure also varies over those time periods despite the large variations in plankton community composition and biomass between the seasons we assumed quasi steady state conditions within each season net migration and biomass accumulation terms were set to zero since plankton are highly susceptible to physical processes such as currents there will inevitably be some migration into or out of the study area despite the sog being a relatively enclosed basin however pe√±a et al 2016 estimated the total export of plankton from the sog to be 7 of primary production for phytoplankton and 18 of secondary production for zooplankton and losses due to circulation within seasonal time scales have been found to be minimal relative to other terms i e consumption fluxes li et al 2000 suggesting that this is only a minor problem regarding biomass accumulation our monthly average plankton populations remained relatively stable in summer and winter states making a quasi steady state a reasonable assumption this is less true in spring which is highly dynamic with large changes in both phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass however more frequent systematic sampling recently reported in summer also shows evidence of many short term blooms of both major and minor constituents belluz et al 2021 esenkulova et al 2021 despite this the seasonal breakdown still provides more information than a year average the ecopath framework does allow for non steady state conditions through the use of migration and biomass accumulation terms which may be important especially in spring during the bloom accumulation of dissolved oxygen from primary productivity is known to be an important part of the oxygen budget at these times wang et al 2019 and such accumulation may be true for biomass budgets as well further resolving these seasonal dynamics in the modelling may lead to different results although we do not include trophic levels above plankton in these models this will only be a problem if the flow of carbon to these other higher levels is significantly larger than those within the planktonic ecosystem fortunately the updated whole ecosystem model section 3 3 showed that only 19 of zooplankton productivity is consumed by groups not included in our models in the plankton models these losses flow to detritus instead this additional flux to detritus is within the uncertainty of the models and does not impact ecosystem functioning so consideration of the plankton system alone is an acceptable approximation 5 conclusions within the sog the trophic structure of the planktonic food web varies seasonally and we have been able to construct plausible food webs within the systematic framework of ecopath modelling additionally our food web models provide estimates for important ecological parameters where limited field measurements exist including primary and secondary productivity respiration rates trophic transfer efficiency and bacterial biomass these model estimates are generally consistent with field measurements making these models a valuable new resource for future sog studies during spring bloom conditions diatoms are the primary driver of energy flows through the system outside of these bloom conditions however when primary productivity is limited by nutrients or light the microbial loop shifts to serve a more important role despite this importance many components of the microbial loop are not well studied in the sog including the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria and to a lesser degree microzooplankton this is a key gap in the understanding of bottom up controls in the sog as productivity is heavily influenced by environmental forcing understanding the small scale interactions at the bottom of the food web will only become more important as the climate varies mitra et al 2014 additionally there are indications that primary productivity is a key variable in leading to predictable outcomes particularly in time dynamic simulations christensen and walters 2011 the inclusion of mixotrophic plankton in the modelled system allows for a better definition of its impacts over time all modelling exercises are a balance between complexity and effectiveness where the balance point depends on the modelling goal our results indicate that complex models are not always necessary to understand certain fisheries system dynamics such as general fish yields indeed it has been suggested that beyond the most basic model structures predictability decreases as models become more complex fulton et al 2003 and references within however in these simple models many details are lost which may be important for some research interests for instance these intricate details become important when investigating the impacts of small scale processes that may cascade up the food web such as seasonal nutrition availability or contaminant transfer in this study only two modelling approaches were compared dis aggregated seasonal models versus an aggregated year averaged model comparison with other modelling approaches such as the npzd framework i e pe√±a et al 2016 olson et al 2020 may lead to different conclusions overall the modelling approach requires a thoughtful

24172,when attempting to model an ecosystem compromises must be made to retain the essence of the system and its functioning here we explore the implications of these aggregations on a modelled ecosystem by using ecopath to model the plankton food web in the strait of georgia sog a temperate coastal system on the west coast of canada in three seasons the food web is defined by fifteen functional groups representing autotrophic phytoplankton the microbial loop and mesozooplankton in three seasons differentiated by node biomass productivity and diet variations in the community composition lead to shifts in trophic behaviour and food web structure seasonally in spring autotrophic phytoplankton i e diatoms are the main source of carbon for the system in summer and winter the microbial loop becomes more important due to limited primary production these structural changes within the plankton food web throughout a year have implications for higher trophic levels including the seasonal availability and quality of food for planktivorous fish finally we compared this detailed seasonal approach to plankton modelling with a more common simplified approach and examined its impacts on the entire ecosystem the microbial loop is often excluded from coastal ecosystem models but is an important component influencing trophic positions and transfer efficiencies however aggregating plankton groups appears to be an adequate approach to plankton modelling in the sog but modelling decisions should be driven by the research question keywords plankton food web ecopath modelling ecosystem interactions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the construction of accurate food web models is critical for quantifying the importance of different components of oceanic ecosystems they are used to aid in understanding ecosystem functioning and for applications like assessing potential commercial yields in the strait of georgia sog on the west coast of canada fig 1 numerical biological and coupled physical biological models have been widely used for such purposes in the past few decades examples include dalsgaard et al 1998 li et al 2000 martell et al 2002 preikshot 2007 collins et al 2009 li et al 2010 allen and wolfe 2013 pe√±a et al 2016 and olson et al 2020 these studies have mostly focused on higher trophic levels e g fish marine mammals and or biophysical interactions where representations of ecological interactions within the plankton community were greatly simplified however plankton are a critical ecosystem component and are the key link between primary producers and fish more attention is needed to understand their interactions historically linking primary producers and higher trophic levels in this modelling has often been done by simplifying a diverse range of plankton into just a few groups i e the nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton or npz approach franks 2002 although this is not always the case i e mitra et al 2014 yet copepods in the sog are known to have a wide range of diets including prey ranging from bacteria and detritus to phytoplankton proto and metazoans el sabaawi et al 2009a 2010 costalago et al 2020 additionally mixotrophic plankton and the microbial loop increasingly recognized as critical to food web structure e g vargas et al 2007 are often not considered at all one approach which we will consider here is to model the system with many more groups although there are other philosophical approaches that could be considered i e verity and smetacek 1996 galbraith et al 2015 further more complex food web models are often constructed on a year averaged approach this approach ignores the large variations in plankton community composition and trophic behaviour throughout the year in temperate regions as the light driven spring bloom is very different in nature from nutrient limited summer productivity harrison et al 1983 both of these potential oversimplifications in modelling could lead to misrepresentations and erroneous results which could have cascading impacts in understanding the dynamics of the whole ecosystem here we investigate whether oversimplification of the planktonic component is important in the sog ecosystem by first developing a detailed 15 group quasi steady but seasonally varying plankton food web model using the ecopath framework christensen and walters 2004 the ecopath approach allows us to systematically assess the importance of different components of the planktonic ecosystem in a consistent manner this taxonomically diverse seasonal model provides insights into how carbon pathways and trophic interactions within the plankton community function and how these functions vary between the seasons we then simplify the model by aggregating the plankton groups with averaged rate parameters to reduce the plankton component complexity to that found in an existing sog ecopath model which includes higher trophic levels preikshot 2007 this allows us to examine the effects of this aggregation on the overall food web structure and on the higher trophic levels in particular 2 methods 2 1 study area and biomass data the sog is a large semi enclosed basin situated between vancouver island to the west and the british columbia mainland to the east fig 1 it is connected to the pacific ocean through relatively shallow passages on the north and south ends here we focus on the deep offshore portions in the north and central strait outlined area in fig 1 the surface area of interest is approximately 4600 km2 with a maximum depth of 430 m and average depth of 330 m physical circulation is estuarine with a surface outflow of brackish water mostly through the southern channels balanced by nutrient rich upwelling of deeper waters whose residence time in the strait is more than half a year pawlowicz et al 2007 olson et al 2020 although the freshwater input has a large seasonal component the estuarine circulation is only weakly dependent on this component and is relatively steady year round riche and pawlowicz 2014 high resolution biomass data are available for both the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in recent years fig 2 the zooplankton biomass dataset maintained by fisheries and oceans canada dfo and described in detail in mackas et al 2013 perry et al 2021 spans 2006 2017 although most samples are in 2012 2017 and consists of species level biomass data in g dry weight d w m 3 zooplankton data were collected using vertical net tows from various depths across the sog and in both daytime and nighttime samples were collected using bongo and scor nets with a mesh size of 200 to 335 Œº m and a mouth diameter of 0 42 to 0 58 m after a careful evaluation we only considered tows to depths of 200 m to capture known diel vertical migrators harrison et al 1983 mackas et al 2013 mcewan 2022 in both day and night tows resulting in a dataset of 399 tows fig 2 we examined the regional variability of the mesozooplankton community by dividing the sog into two regions supplemental material fig s1 1 although some regional variations do exist supplemental material fig s1 2 they were smaller than the seasonal variations so it was reasonable to consider the sog as a single geographic region with seasonal variation the strait wide average community composition was weighted by the area of each region although long term changes in both sog zooplankton biomass and community structure have been documented by perry et al 2021 year to year variation over the years in our dataset was reported to be only on the order of 20 and so it seemed reasonable to aggregate all our measurements across years zooplankton biomass was converted from g d w to g carbon gc using conversion factors of 0 1 gc g d w for gelatinous zooplankton 0 2 gc g d w for gastropods and 0 4 gc g d w for all other groups harris et al 2000 monthly and seasonal averages were then calculated following the methods described in mackas et al 2013 first total sample biomass for each group was log transformed as log 10 b c where b is biomass in gc m 2 and c is a constant to account for zero observations with an order of magnitude related to the detection threshold either 0 01 or 0 001 g d w m 2 converted to gc m 2 using the conversion factors above next averages were computed on the transformed dataset finally results were raised to a power of 10 to recover the original units this estimate is thus the median rather than the mean in the natural scale a seasonal analysis of night day biomass ratios for all groups was carried out to investigate possible net avoidance and any remaining diurnal vertical migration effects even after restricting our dataset to deep tows in areas with bottom depths 200 m only euphausiids in summer had a statistically significant difference between day and night biomass mcewan 2022 thus daytime estimates of euphausiids in july to october were increased by a multiplicative factor of 2 59 to correct for this difference note that this factor is different from the value of 3 used year round in mackas et al 2013 and perry et al 2021 based on shaw and robinson 1998 we use our calculated value because it is based on the more extensive and recent dataset used in this analysis although the food web results described below are not sensitive to this change phytoplankton biomass and community composition were derived from 5 years 2015 2017 and 2019 2020 of pigment data measured using high performance liquid chromatography hplc collected on routine cruises by dfo there were 4 to 9 cruises per year between february and november with 5 to 15 stations per cruise fig 2 one pigment sample per station was collected in niskin bottles between 0 and 5 m depth cell count data were also provided for 25 of the stations used to determine species dominance the 311 pigment samples were analysed using chemtax version 1 95 which derives estimates of biomass contributions of phytoplankton taxa relative to total chlorophyll a chl a mackey et al 1996 eight expected taxa were selected based on the associated microscope counts and from a literature review i e stockner et al 1979 belluz et al 2021 diatoms dinoflagellates cyanobacteria prasinophytes crytophytes dictychophytes haptophytes and raphidophytes volumetric concentrations were converted to areal amounts using conversion factors derived from conductivity temperature depth ctd fluorometry profiles taken at the time of sampling methods regarding chemtax analysis and depth integration are detailed in supplemental material s2 these phytoplankton data were converted to carbon biomass using a c chl a ratio of 50 g g 1 welschmeyer et al 1991 booth et al 1993 kirchman et al 1993 boyd et al 1995 although recent data show that the c chl a ratio varies seasonally i e jakobsen and markager 2016 this constant ratio was used year round again we examined the regional variability of the phytoplankton community supplemental material s1 3 the small variations found were taken into account by weighting the strait wide average community composition by the area of each region ciliate and heterotrophic flagellate biomass were not recorded in either of the datasets described above both are too small to be retained by zooplankton nets and heterotrophic flagellates are not pigmented thus missed by hplc analysis the estimates of these two groups were derived from sampling completed during the strait of georgia ecosystem monitoring stratogem program pawlowicz et al 2003 samples were collected at station s4 1 fig 1 during surveys carried out weekly to monthly between april 2002 and june 2005 in total 52 phytoplankton samples were collected at a depth of 5 m using niskin bottles the detailed composition of these samples was obtained through observation identification and enumeration of the settled particles under a zeiss axiovert 10 inverted microscope cell abundance was converted to carbon biomass using estimates of cell biovolume from haigh et al 1992 and converted to carbon using the equations of strathmann 1967 biomass was depth integrated using the median m 3 m 2 ratio from the previous pigment analysis the ciliate mesodinium rubrum also known as myrionecta rubra was an important component of the plankton system in the stratogem sampling and was assumed to represent the ciliate population in the study area m rubrum is a mixotrophic plankton that can photosynthesize by ingesting cryptophytes and retaining their chloroplasts gustafson et al 2000 so they have some pigmentation it is possible that this pigmentation was caught by the hplc analysis but recognized as cryptophyte biomass leading to a slight overestimation of cryptophyte biomass however the relative contribution of cryptophytes to total phytoplankton biomass is comparable in both the cell counts and hplc analysis within 10 so this contamination is probably minimal finally although bacterial abundances for the sog have been reported in the literature seki and kennedy 1969 bell and albright 1981 there are no recent measurements instead the ecopath model was used to estimate the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria as part of the modelling process the literature estimates were reserved for comparison with model outputs 2 2 ecopath model we developed seasonal steady state food web models using ecopath 6 6 5 https ecopath org for the plankton community to investigate trophic interactions at different times of the year ecopath is a widely used ecological modelling software that creates a snapshot of an ecosystem by aggregating ecologically important species into functional groups fgs linked by trophic interactions the model assumes a mass balance within the system over an arbitrary period in this case a season such that the fluxes of model currency here carbon into an fg must equal the fluxes out of that group christensen et al 2005 as implemented here production for the i th fg is described using 1 b i p b i e e i j 1 n b j q b j d c j i 0 where b i and b j are the biomasses of prey and predator respectively gc m 2 p b i is the production biomass ratio d 1 e e i is the ecotrophic efficiency which represents the proportion of mortality that is explicitly modelled where e e i 1 implies that all losses are due to predation and e e i 0 implies that all losses are due to natural processes and the functional group fg mass gets converted to detritus q b i is the consumption biomass ratio d 1 d c j i is the fraction of losses by consumption in the i th group as prey in the diet of the j th predator group i e j d c j i 1 and n is the number of potential consumer groups christensen et al 2005 an ecopath model requires any three of the four basic input parameters b p b q b e e to be defined for each group and calculates the fourth missing parameter by enforcing the mass balance among the groups a diet composition is also required for each consumer group supplemental material s3 tables s3 3 s3 5 ecopath models can also include terms for losses due to fisheries migration and biomass accumulation but these have been excluded in this study eq 1 is used to enforce a mass balance between the fgs within each fg mass balance is described using 2 q i p i r i 1 g s i q i where q i is consumption rate gc m 2 d 1 with q i b i q b i p i is production rate gc m 2 d 1 with p i b i p b i r i is respiration rate gc m 2 d 1 and g s i is the fraction of unassimilated food loss due to feces and directed to detritus q i and p i are calculated from eq 1 and g s i is a model input making r i an output of the model once the food web parameters have been determined the ecopath software can calculate a trophic level tl for each fg lindeman 1942 odum and heald 1975 producers and detritus are assigned a tl of 1 and consumers have a tl of 1 plus the weighted average of the prey s tl christensen et al 2005 2 3 model construction and balancing phytoplankton and zooplankton fgs and their biomasses were largely aggregated and defined based on the major taxa seen in the analysis of biomass data and their role in the ecosystem section 3 1 thus mesozooplankton were divided into 10 fgs ordered by trophic level tl from highest to lowest 1 gelatinous zooplankton 2 chaetognaths 3 amphipods 4 decapods 5 euphausiids 6 large copepods 7 other zooplankton 8 gastropods 9 small medium copepods and 10 appendicularians then in addition to a group of pure autotrophic phytoplankton two mixotrophic microzooplankton fgs were included ciliates and flagellates finally there was a heterotrophic bacteria group and a detritus group detrital biomass was set to a value of 1 gc m 2 although this value does not impact model outputs p b estimates for the photosynthetic groups were calculated using measurements of primary productivity in the sog based on 13c measurements in 2017 2018 other p b and q b estimates were based on values from literature or assumptions and varied seasonally see supplemental material s3 mixotrophic production is modelled in ecopath using the proportion of production from primary production parameter or trophic mode tm the tm ranges between 0 for heterotrophs and 1 for autotrophs tm for ciliates was assumed to be 0 90 year round d alelio et al 2016 flagellate tm was calculated based on the ratio of heterotrophic flagellate production to pigmented flagellate mixotrophic and autotrophic production and the associated b and p b values and varied seasonally section 3 1 a microbial loop was represented by the trophic interactions between the two mixotrophic microzooplankton groups flagellates and ciliates heterotrophic bacteria and detritus only one detritus group was included representing flows from unassimilated food and dead organic matter g s i is typically in the range of 0 2 to 0 4 for plankton christensen et al 2005 heymans et al 2016 so g s i 0 3 was assumed for all groups bacterial biomass was left unknown but an e e of 0 90 was assumed for all seasons diet links between predator and prey were identified in the literature and when not available using knowledge of size classes and feeding strategy e g whether filter feeders or selective hunters the scale of these links were based on feeding strategy and prey biomass there are many subtleties in this determination which are explained in detail in the supplemental material s4 note that cannibalism within a group is allowed and often occurs when fgs aggregate different species imported food i e terrestrial detritus is not considered as it is known to be only a small part of this food web costalago et al 2020 for each model three of the four basic input parameters were provided for each fg usually b p b q b the ecopath software then estimated the missing parameter for each group e e for all but bacteria an ecopath model is considered to be consistent with current pelagic food web functioning under two general conditions first all p q values p q p b q b should be between 0 2 and 0 4 for bacteria and mesozooplankton groups christensen et al 2005 this was checked during the process of defining p b and q b values for the mixotrophic groups p q is greater than 1 because most of the production comes from autotrophic activity second e e should be less than one for all groups that is more of any group is grown than is consumed by other groups a model with this property is considered balanced if after an initial run of the ecopath model some e e s were found to be larger than one unbalanced the diet matrix was adjusted to bring this e e down as diets were judged to be the input parameter with the highest level of uncertainty adjustment was carried out systematically in an iterative process as follows the diet fraction for the predator fg responsible for the greatest consumption of a prey group with the highest unbalanced e e was slightly reduced so more of its food was obtained proportionately from other sources and the model re run if the group s e e was still 1 the process was repeated if after this recalculation a different group had a larger e e the small diet fraction reduction was then applied to this other group the process was repeated until all e e were 1 typically the unbalanced groups were those that were consumed by many other groups small medium copepods fg 9 and other zooplankton fg 7 often initial adjustments were made to amphipod diets as they had high consumption rates q b q b more details explained in supplemental material s4 3 results our food web description developed in four steps first we describe the plankton community composition in the strait of georgia sog in an average year using monthly means second using these results we separate the year into three seasons spring summer and winter and construct mass balanced food web models for each season these food web models thus represent our best knowledge regarding the functioning of this planktonic ecosystem third we aggregate these models in a similar manner as those in npz system models by averaging biomasses and rate parameters finally the simplified model is then inserted into an existing annual average ecopath model that includes higher trophic levels to examine the effects of our improved knowledge 3 1 plankton community composition the monthly mean phytoplankton community fig 3 shows that a spring bloom occurs in march april with a strong dominance of diatoms 85 skeletonema costatum thalassiosira spp chaetoceros spp and a peak phytoplankton biomass of 11 6 gc m 2 summer june to october biomass is lower than the spring average of 3 71 gc m 2 including heterotrophic flagellates and more variable with episodic blooms dominated by flagellates including cryptophytes i e telaulax spp and dictyochophytes i e dinobryon spp raphidophytes heterosigma akashiwo are a harmful algae that bloom occasionally but only in summer a large bloom occurred in summer of 2018 esenkulova et al 2021 but this year is not included in our hplc dataset phytoplankton biomass in winter november to february is low average of 2 44 gc m 2 including heterotrophic flagellates and dominated by small cells i e cryptophytes the heterotrophic flagellate pigmented flagellate ratios are 0 54 0 17 and 0 15 in spring summer and winter respectively this results in an estimated heterotrophic flagellate biomass of 0 70 0 22 and 0 14 g m 2 in spring summer and winter respectively the fraction of heterotrophs is low in winter but this might be underestimated because winter is dominated by small cells 20 Œº m which could be missed by microscope counts however these ratios are similar to the average heterotrophic autotrophic nanoflagellate ratio found in the northeastern pacific of 0 63 in may and 0 25 in february doherty 1995 the primary producer taxa captured by hplc were aggregated into two fgs based on their role in the ecosystem fully autotrophic phytoplankton and mixotrophic flagellates fig 4 fully autotrophic phytoplankton include diatoms prasinophytes haptophytes and cyanobacteria flagellates comprise a large selection of auto mixo and heterotrophs but as prey they are mostly indistinguishable and so were put into a second group which is then mixotrophic in nature this flagellate fg contains cryptophytes dinoflagellates raphidophytes dictyochophytes and heterotrophic flagellates jeong et al 2010 stoecker et al 2017 the community composition within these two fgs varies seasonally fig 4 with e g phytoplankton almost completely composed of diatoms in spring but only about 50 of the biomass in other seasons a third group of primary producers ciliates the mixotroph m rubrum identified through microscope counts was included as an additional mixotrophic fg its biomass is particularly significant in the summer fig 4 but is of more minor importance in other seasons both flagellates and m rubrum are included as separate components in a recent coupled physical biological model of the sog olson et al 2020 and so we do the same here turning to larger zooplankton it is simpler to describe variations after aggregating our data into the functional groups we will use in our model on average total zooplankton biomass peaks in july at 9 49 gc m 2 and is a minimum in winter with a lowest observed value of 2 59 gc m 2 in february fig 5 trends suggest that january values might even lower although no observations are available this biomass is dominated by crustaceans year round primarily small medium copepods e g metridia pacifica calanus pacificus and calanus marshallae making up 30 44 of zooplankton biomass followed by amphipods e g cyphocaris challengeri euphausiids primarily euphausia pacifica and large copepods e g neocalanus plumchrus and eucalanus bungii the relative proportion of most groups is roughly constant year round so that the biomass of each group increases rapidly after the spring bloom and remains high through the summer until declining again through the winter 3 2 seasonal models on the basis of the monthly breakdowns we identified 3 different seasonal community structures a spring march may period with high diatom dominated phytoplankton biomass and intermediate zooplankton biomass a summer june october ecosystem with high zooplankton biomass and an intermediate phytoplankton biomass with a high proportion of ciliates and flagellates and a winter november february ecosystem with low plankton biomass using our seasonally varying biomass data as well as other input parameters like growth rates see supplemental material s3 food web models in the ecopath framework are now set up and adjusted until balanced fig 6 following procedures described in section 2 3 spring has the highest total biomass tb of the three seasons 16 76 gc m 2 fig 6 primarily due to the high phytoplankton biomass 46 of tb this phytoplankton biomass proportion decreases to 16 and 20 of the tb in summer and winter respectively the decrease in phytoplankton dominance after the spring is complemented by a relative increase in mixotrophic biomass fgs 11 12 from 16 in spring to 20 and 22 of tb in summer and winter respectively consistent with the community composition analysis in section 3 1 this leads to a shift in trophic structure as a higher proportion of carbon flow passes through the microbial loop i e between detritus and bacteria before reaching mesozooplankton in contrast mesozooplankton biomass fgs 1 10 is highest in summer 7 76 gc m 2 with small medium copepods fg 9 making up the largest proportion in every season estimated heterotrophic bacteria biomass ranges from 0 36 gc m 2 in winter to 1 46 gc m 2 in summer although this value is determined by our assumed e e of 0 90 for this group assuming a smaller e e would result in proportionately more bacterial biomass without affecting the rest of the system the ecopath analysis indicates that the planktonic component of the food web in the sog spans 3 trophic levels fig 6 the highest trophic levels seen in the models are 3 04 in spring chaetognaths 3 13 in summer gelatinous zooplankton and 3 20 in winter gelatinous zooplankton all mesozooplankton have lower trophic levels in the spring than the other two seasons table 1 indicative of the shift to more herbivorous activity in this season after the spring bloom microzooplankton increase in dominance and zooplankton diets shift to reflect this change in food availability increasing their trophic position flagellates and ciliates are between tls 1 and 2 because of their mixotrophic behaviour flows beginning with primary producers and detritus form the main energy pathways in the system total system flow is defined as the sum of all flows in the system i e consumption respiration and total flows to detritus christensen et al 2005 the proportion of this system flow that originates from detritus as opposed to primary producers accounts for 50 48 and 53 of system flow in spring summer and winter respectively this indicates that system production is highly dependent on the detritus pool year round which highlights the importance of the microbial loop in the system where energy is transferred up the food web through detritus bacteria and microzooplankton total consumption flows tc are highest in summer fig 6 in all three seasons small medium copepods fg 9 and heterotrophic bacteria fg 13 have the highest consumption rates 25 35 of tc each in spring flagellates also account for a large proportion of tc 15 mainly with their consumption of phytoplankton and flagellates of the other mesozooplankton groups large copepods fg 6 amphipods fg 3 and other zooplankton fg 7 have the largest consumption rates zooplankton respiration is also highest in summer at 0 70 gc m 2 d 1 compared with spring and winter values of 0 50 and 0 17 gc m 2 d 1 respectively primary productivity pp ranges from 0 63 in winter to 5 01 in spring gc m 2 d 1 with an annual average of 2 19 gc m 2 d 1 in spring phytoplankton productivity fg 14 contributes 81 of the total pp due primarily to the diatom bloom after spring this dominance of the pp pool declines as mixotrophic microzooplankton groups fgs 11 12 increase in importance in summer 48 of pp comes from fg 14 and 52 comes from fgs 11 12 in winter 51 of pp comes from fg 14 and 49 comes from fgs 11 12 lower trophic level groups i e detritus and primary producers had their highest ecotrophic efficiencies e e s of 0 6 0 8 in summer table 1 a high e e for primary producers means that most of their production is being consumed by higher groups indicating that there is less excess food available low natural mortality in this season the high e e for detritus in summer indicates less material flowing into this pool and more flowing out of it this highlights the importance of these groups as food sources to omnivorous and carnivorous zooplankton on the other hand the low e e s for detritus and primary producers in spring 0 2 indicate that there is a large amount of carbon exported into detritus thus fuelling the detrital food chain the high e e of grazing groups i e small medium copepods gastropods other zooplankton in summer and winter emphasizes their importance as a critical link between primary producers and carnivorous zooplankton some of the zooplankton groups may have artificially low e e s because predation by fish was not explicitly included in the models we return to this later however using these e e s the amount of mesozooplankton production fgs 1 10 unused in the plankton system and therefore theoretically available to higher trophic levels is 54 2 gc m 2 yr 1 which is 43 of total zooplankton production 3 3 group aggregation these seasonal models highlight the complexities of the trophic interactions within the plankton community in the sog however when groups are aggregated and the flows combined one can get a picture of the overall relative structure of the system fig 7 we aggregated the system into six functional groups carnivorous zooplankton cz fgs 1 4 omnivorous zooplankton oz fgs 5 10 mixotrophic microzooplankton mz fgs 11 12 heterotrophic bacteria hb fg 13 phytoplankton ph fg 14 and detritus d fg 15 rate parameters for each group are calculated as a biomass weighted average of the rates for all fgs combined in spring ph are the main energy source for oz who then transfer energy to cz fig 7 in summer and winter mz shift to become the more dominant carbon source for these groups while system biomass and magnitude of carbon flows are much higher in summer than winter the relative structure of the system is very similar this structure could represent the system under limiting conditions where nutrient limitation is occurring in summer and light limitation is occurring in winter interestingly the structure of the microbial loop consisting of d hb and mz is remarkably similar between the three seasons and makes up a large proportion of system carbon flow 30 many food web models aggregate the plankton community in a similar way often simplifying into just a few groups averaged over a year christensen et al 2005 with this in mind we calculated parameters that could be used in a typical year average model with a simplified plankton structure input parameters were calculated by summing the total fluxes over the three seasons for all fgs within each aggregated group with the length of each season accounted for and then dividing by total biomass b tables 2 and 3 and converted to consistent units biomass was converted using a wet weight carbon ratio of 8 33 g g 1 for cz and oz harris et al 2000 6 g g 1 for mz and ph preikshot 2007 and 10 g g 1 for hb romanova and sazhin 2010 p b and q b rates were converted to yearly values these aggregated average parameter estimates are derived from a more quantitative analysis of the plankton community than most sog models to date to evaluate the utility of this approach these aggregated groups and calculated parameters were put into an existing ecopath with ecosim ewe model for the sog preikshot 2007 preikshot et al 2013 replacing their plankton groups the objective of the preikshot 2007 model was to investigate changes in fished species marine mammals and bird populations by running a time dynamic simulation between 1950 and 2002 this preikshot 2007 model represents the sog ecosystem using 53 functional groups 5 of which represent plankton phytoplankton krill herbivorous zooplankton carnivorous zooplankton and jellies using wet weight as a currency our cz group replaced the original carnivorous zooplankton fg 41 and jellies fg 43 groups oz replaced the original herbivorous zooplankton group fg 42 and krill group fg 40 predation of these original groups were summed for the new group parameter values for ph replaced those used in the original phytoplankton group fg 51 mz and hb groups were added we only ran the static ecopath part of the model with these changes to the plankton community the model still nearly balances except the e e of carnivorous zooplankton was 1 01 a minor adjustment to fish consumption of zooplankton would allow the model to balance the original model had higher zooplankton b s but lower p b s compared to our annual average model resulting in comparable productivity p total zooplankton productivity was 1078 t km 2 yr 1 and 967 t km 2 yr 1 in the original and updated models respectively in the updated model 13 of zooplankton productivity is consumed by whales and fish 128 t km 2 yr 1 and 6 is consumed by other non zooplankton groups i e benthic filter feeders 57 t km 2 yr 1 pp from phytoplankton was also similar at 2860 t km 2 yr 1 and 2669 t km 2 yr 1 in the original and updated models respectively however pp from the new mixotrophic group increased total pp substantially by 1521 t km 2 yr 1 the inclusion of the microbial loop also increased the proportion of flow originating from detritus as opposed to primary producers from 20 to 30 trophic levels generally increased due to less strictly herbivorous feeding by zooplankton and the inclusion of the microbial loop the model included fisheries in the sog and the mean trophic level of the catch increased from 3 48 to 3 60 4 discussion with 15 functional groups representing plankton and detritus divided into 3 seasons we have constructed the most complex planktonic system of any existing sog food web model indeed existing models including dalsgaard et al 1998 li et al 2000 martell et al 2002 preikshot 2007 collins et al 2009 li et al 2010 allen and wolfe 2013 pe√±a et al 2016 olson et al 2020 typically have only used two to five groups to represent plankton including seasonality and increased complexity allows us to more closely align the food web with available knowledge about specific taxa and their interactions however in addition to this basic structure food web model construction in the ecopath framework also requires specifying a large number of physiological parameters to ensure that a given structure works in the sense of allowing all groups to have enough food while maintaining a mass balance assumption as usual for ecopath models these parameters were mostly determined from existing literature as well as judgments about both food sources and the feeding strategies of different groups here these judgments were implemented systematically by defining the degree of carnivory herbivory bacterial and detrital consumption supplemental material s3 the initial model runs for each season showed that the general food web structures were mostly internally consistent with the available biomass for most groups supporting ecosystem needs however a small number of functional groups were usually unbalanced on this initial run with more biomass being consumed than was available judging that diet compositions were the least well known parameters in the model a tuning took place in which the fraction of these unbalanced groups in the diet of their major consumer was iteratively reduced without changing the overall feeding strategy until balance was achieved although we carried this out tuning manually the algorithm could be implemented in computer code in the future by including more complexity and seasonality in our models we were able to investigate how the food web varies seasonally and infer how these changes may impact other components of the ecosystem e g nutrient availability for fish we also examined how this added complexity compares to the more common simplified approach however before going further we should evaluate our models by comparing our initial biomass and community composition estimates with others for the sog and also by comparing other parameters such as trophic positions productivities and bacterial biomass estimates with existing but independent knowledge about the sog ecosystem 4 1 seasonal plankton biomass and community composition our analysis of planktonic biomass and community composition in the deep strait of georgia is reasonably consistent with existing analyses of these datasets e g mackas et al 2013 belluz et al 2021 perry et al 2021 based on this analysis we suggest it is reasonable to divide the plankton ecosystem into three periods spring march may summer june october and winter november february the spring period is characterized by high productivity and begins with the spring diatom bloom known to be triggered by increased light levels and surface layer stability stockner et al 1979 collins et al 2009 suchy et al 2022 and the subsequent increase in copepod reproduction harrison et al 1983 on average over the hplc dataset 2015 2020 excluding 2018 phytoplankton biomass peaked in march and was heavily dominated by diatoms 86 of phytoplankton biomass although the spring bloom is known to typically occur between late february to early april collins et al 2009 allen and wolfe 2013 the monthly average biomass in march 11 6 gc m 2 or 7 mgchl a m 3 was within the range of a typical spring bloom based on satellite derived estimates of the sog from 2003 to 2016 6 2 14 1 mgchl a m 3 suchy et al 2022 as well as bottle samples from 2015 to 2018 in the northern sog 7 05 12 4 mgchl a m 3 belluz et al 2021 spring blooms in the sog can reach 15 mgchl a m 3 harrison et al 1983 however these peaks might not be directly reflected in the monthly average as the spring progresses nutrients are depleted and grazing increases causing the diatom bloom to crash biomass over the summer period is lower than in spring and flagellates and ciliates increase in dominance figs 3 4 consistent with known patterns stockner et al 1979 harrison et al 1983 belluz et al 2021 reintroduction of nutrients to the surface layer by wind or tidal events is known to stimulate occasional late summer or early autumn phytoplankton blooms collins et al 2009 pe√±a et al 2016 belluz et al 2021 zooplankton biomass peaks in mid summer on average in july at 9 49 gc m 2 fig 5 largely driven by increased copepod reproduction harrison et al 1983 copepods fgs 6 and 9 make up about 45 of the zooplankton biomass year round followed by amphipods and euphausiids consistent with previous analyses in the sog mackas et al 2013 perry et al 2021 suchy et al 2022 previous studies have determined that zooplankton biomass peaks about one month after maximum chl a biomass e g stockner et al 1979 pe√±a et al 2016 although exact timing and community composition of the zooplankton peak may vary with bloom timing suchy et al 2022 in winter primary production is light limited and phytoplankton and zooplankton biomasses are at a minimum 4 2 trophic positions the weighted average trophic level tl of mesozooplankton was 2 36 2 51 and 2 50 in spring summer and winter respectively the increase in trophic level from spring to summer is consistent with the findings of flores ruiz 2020 where zooplankton in the sog had a mean one standard deviation tl of 2 14 0 09 in april 2 26 0 07 in august and 2 53 0 28 in december based on stable nitrogen isotope analysis it is also consistent with the stable isotope analysis by el sabaawi et al 2010 where copepods had lower trophic positions in the spring due to herbivorous feeding the changes in trophic position from season to season affect the total food chain length and therefore efficiency of energy transfer hairston and hairston 1993 post 2002 the mean path length defined as the average number of groups an inflow or outflow passes through finn 1976 varies seasonally in spring when the system is primarily supported by the phytoplankton group the mean path length is short 2 71 indicating that the system is more resilient to perturbations in this season post 2002 the mean path length was longer in summer 6 22 and winter 4 70 when flagellates and the microbial loop play a larger role in supporting the system increasing the complexity of trophic interactions these longer chains indicate that the system may be less stable than in the spring 4 3 system productivity in the models seasonal conditions were represented by changes in functional group biomass b and p b q b rates which allowed for investigation into productivity p fluctuations throughout a year both primary and secondary productivities can be compared primary productivity pp in the sog has been estimated using a variety of methods table 4 while estimates of gross and net primary productivity new primary production and net community production are not easily comparable they give an indication of ecosystem functioning the pp estimates and seasonal trends from our models are slightly larger than the other known estimates but within reason crustacean productivity ranged from 0 09 winter to 0 42 summer gc m 2 d 1 with a yearly average of 0 27 gc m 2 d 1 these results are supported by estimates of crustacean secondary productivity using the chitobase method i e suchy et al 2016 sastri and dower 2009 and empirical model estimates kwong et al 2020 in suchy et al 2016 crustacean productivity in nearby saanich inlet ranged between 0 01 and 0 65 gc m 2 d 1 the annual average crustacean productivity in the sog measured by sastri and dower 2009 was 0 21 gc m 2 d 1 4 4 bacteria and the microbial loop a novel aspect of our modelling is the attempt to include a microbial loop the role of bacteria in the sog is not well studied yet these models indicate that a substantial proportion about 30 of carbon biomass is cycled through this part of the food web because limited heterotrophic bacterial biomass data were available we allowed the models to estimate bacterial carbon assuming an ecotrophic efficiency of 0 90 bacterial biomass estimates ranged from 0 36 to 1 46 gc m 2 although these estimates can be increased by decreasing the assumed e e without otherwise affecting our models these estimates were within the range 0 04 to 3 gc m 2 measured by seki and kennedy 1969 and the summer range 0 8 to 1 7 gc m 2 reported by bell and albright 1981 from 8 to 17 mgc m 3 assuming depth integration to 100 m the model estimates are also comparable to measurements in other coastal regions bacterial biomass within the upper 50 m of the water column ranges from 0 303 to 0 925 gc m 2 in reloncav√≠fjord chile gonz√°lez et al 2010 in the polar fjord kongsfjorden svalbard bacterial biomass ranged from 0 4 to 2 7 gc m 2 iversen and seuthe 2011 there may be other significant consumers such as benthic filter feeders i e glass sponge reefs kahn et al 2018 which may suggest that bacterial biomass is underestimated in our models indeed glass sponges are abundant in the sog forming reefs covering hundreds of square kilometres conway et al 2005 kahn et al 2018 and removing bacterial carbon at high rates i e 0 96 gc m 2 d 1 over the reefs chu and leys 2010 on the other hand glass sponge reefs only cover a small percentage of the sog s total area 0 2 of 6800 km2 dunham et al 2018 so although effects might be large in some places overall it is likely low detritus and phytoplankton are the two primary sources of organic carbon in the system thus bacteria may form an important alternate food source for filter feeders especially in the winter seki and kennedy 1969 albright 1983 bell and albright 1981 estimated the ratios of bacterial production to phytoplankton production as 0 25 1 in the strait and 0 04 1 during the spring bloom this is consistent with our results of 0 10 0 17 1 in summer and winter and 0 04 1 in spring the higher ratio outside of the spring bloom highlights the increased importance of the detrital carbon pathway as a food source outside of the spring bloom both mixotrophic groups fgs 11 12 play a large role in the transfer of energy from bacteria to the higher trophic levels because mixotrophy is advantageous when the availability of light and or nutrients is low p√•lsson and gran√©li 2004 stoecker et al 2017 leles et al 2018 by consuming these smaller particles including bacteria that are less available to zooplankton due to their small size mixotrophic microzooplankton become an important pathway enhancing carbon flow to mesozooplankton consumers ward and follows 2016 stoecker et al 2017 as demonstrated in the model aggregation section 3 3 this enhancement then translates into an increase in trophic transfer efficiency tte the ratio of production between two consecutive trophic levels landry and calbet 2004 ward and follows 2016 leles et al 2018 when the microbial loop was included in the preikshot 2007 model tte increased from 16 to 25 4 5 nutritional content of zooplankton the plankton community in the strait of georgia is temporally highly variable due to high turnover rates and changing conditions i e temperature nutrients light availability throughout a year as many zooplankton are opportunistic feeders this variability translates to considerable changes in food availability and therefore diet composition for many zooplankton el sabaawi et al 2009b 2010 changes in diet from autotrophic phytoplankton mostly diatoms in spring to flagellates in summer and winter also has implications on the nutritional quality of zooplankton as prey in terms of their fatty acid composition a common indicator of nutritional quality is the dha epa ratio meaning the ratio of the fatty acids fas docosahexaenoic acid dha a marker for flagellates and eicosapentaenoic acid epa a marker for diatoms mayzaud et al 1989 dalsgaard et al 2003 kainz et al 2004 nutritional quality in each season can be estimated using 3 dha epa e s t b d dha d b f dha f b d epa d b f epa f where b d and b f are the biomasses of diatoms d and flagellates f respectively mg d w m 2 dha and epa are the average fa content of each group Œº g fa mg d w 1 from peltomaa et al 2019 because of the shift from diatom dominated production in spring to flagellate dominated production in summer and winter we calculate that the dha epa ratio available is 70 higher in summer when compared to spring this higher nutritional value in summer over spring will transfer to zooplankton indeed costalago et al 2020 measured that zooplankton across the sog had 11 to 44 higher dha epa ratios in the summer compared to spring making them higher quality food and impacting the dynamics growth and survival of their consumers i e juvenile pacific salmon and pacific herring john et al 2001 costalago et al 2020 4 6 the use of simplified community dynamics in numerical models standard applications for food web models include fisheries management questions heymans et al 2014 or investigating biological physical interactions i e collins et al 2009 pe√±a et al 2016 olson et al 2020 due to lack of knowledge or computational resources planktonic ecosystems are often set up in a rather ad hoc manner with rate parameters undergoing some tuning so that results e g timing of blooms magnitude of production are reasonable an alternative approach would be to derive a simpler model of a planktonic ecosystem by explicitly aggregating a more complex and realistic model such as those described here but does this alternative provide any advantages in practice we investigated this question by aggregating the 15 group 3 season system derived here into 6 groups modelled over a year we then replaced the plankton community in an existing sog ecopath model with this aggregate section 3 3 our parameters were defined quantitatively using the relative contributions of individual plankton taxa throughout the year but interestingly this quantitative and more detailed approach did not make a substantial difference to the overall ecosystem fulton et al 2003 while the input parameter values differed i e b p b q b phytoplankton and zooplankton productivity only varied slightly 10 the inclusion of the microbial loop specifically mixotrophy had the biggest impact on our understanding of food web dynamics its inclusion increased pp which then increased the delivery of organic material to higher trophic levels however few food web models include groups representing the microbial loop i e heterotrophic bacteria mixo or heterotrophic flagellates and microzooplankton when considered over an average year aggregating the plankton community had minimal impact on the modelled system for the strait of georgia however taking this more detailed multi taxa approach can answer certain research questions indeed the few ecopath type models that take this approach aim to investigate specific aspects of the plankton community such as characterizing the roles of key species pav√©s et al 2015 estimating hard to measure parameters webber et al 2015 or determining how bloom conditions change the community structure d alelio et al 2016 indeed our detailed models can also investigate some of these questions for the strait of georgia overall the modelling approach should be determined by a careful consideration of the research aims 4 7 model shortcomings and opportunities for expansion construction of any model involves compromises and we have made a number of them first the phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass datasets were collected over different time periods 2015 2017 2019 2020 for phytoplankton via hplc 2003 2005 for cell counts and 2006 2017 for zooplankton fluctuations in oceanographic conditions over these different time periods may impact average community composition and biomass estimates but for the years in which data were available biomass fluctuations have been previously reported as small perry et al 2021 however zooplankton community structure is known to vary over 5 to 10 year periods perry et al 2021 which were not considered in the averaging procedures here the aim of the modelling was to get a baseline understanding of the system which we judged was best achieved using the most amount of data available in the future efforts could be made to stratify the data to periods of these known long term variabilities and give insights into whether the food web structure also varies over those time periods despite the large variations in plankton community composition and biomass between the seasons we assumed quasi steady state conditions within each season net migration and biomass accumulation terms were set to zero since plankton are highly susceptible to physical processes such as currents there will inevitably be some migration into or out of the study area despite the sog being a relatively enclosed basin however pe√±a et al 2016 estimated the total export of plankton from the sog to be 7 of primary production for phytoplankton and 18 of secondary production for zooplankton and losses due to circulation within seasonal time scales have been found to be minimal relative to other terms i e consumption fluxes li et al 2000 suggesting that this is only a minor problem regarding biomass accumulation our monthly average plankton populations remained relatively stable in summer and winter states making a quasi steady state a reasonable assumption this is less true in spring which is highly dynamic with large changes in both phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass however more frequent systematic sampling recently reported in summer also shows evidence of many short term blooms of both major and minor constituents belluz et al 2021 esenkulova et al 2021 despite this the seasonal breakdown still provides more information than a year average the ecopath framework does allow for non steady state conditions through the use of migration and biomass accumulation terms which may be important especially in spring during the bloom accumulation of dissolved oxygen from primary productivity is known to be an important part of the oxygen budget at these times wang et al 2019 and such accumulation may be true for biomass budgets as well further resolving these seasonal dynamics in the modelling may lead to different results although we do not include trophic levels above plankton in these models this will only be a problem if the flow of carbon to these other higher levels is significantly larger than those within the planktonic ecosystem fortunately the updated whole ecosystem model section 3 3 showed that only 19 of zooplankton productivity is consumed by groups not included in our models in the plankton models these losses flow to detritus instead this additional flux to detritus is within the uncertainty of the models and does not impact ecosystem functioning so consideration of the plankton system alone is an acceptable approximation 5 conclusions within the sog the trophic structure of the planktonic food web varies seasonally and we have been able to construct plausible food webs within the systematic framework of ecopath modelling additionally our food web models provide estimates for important ecological parameters where limited field measurements exist including primary and secondary productivity respiration rates trophic transfer efficiency and bacterial biomass these model estimates are generally consistent with field measurements making these models a valuable new resource for future sog studies during spring bloom conditions diatoms are the primary driver of energy flows through the system outside of these bloom conditions however when primary productivity is limited by nutrients or light the microbial loop shifts to serve a more important role despite this importance many components of the microbial loop are not well studied in the sog including the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria and to a lesser degree microzooplankton this is a key gap in the understanding of bottom up controls in the sog as productivity is heavily influenced by environmental forcing understanding the small scale interactions at the bottom of the food web will only become more important as the climate varies mitra et al 2014 additionally there are indications that primary productivity is a key variable in leading to predictable outcomes particularly in time dynamic simulations christensen and walters 2011 the inclusion of mixotrophic plankton in the modelled system allows for a better definition of its impacts over time all modelling exercises are a balance between complexity and effectiveness where the balance point depends on the modelling goal our results indicate that complex models are not always necessary to understand certain fisheries system dynamics such as general fish yields indeed it has been suggested that beyond the most basic model structures predictability decreases as models become more complex fulton et al 2003 and references within however in these simple models many details are lost which may be important for some research interests for instance these intricate details become important when investigating the impacts of small scale processes that may cascade up the food web such as seasonal nutrition availability or contaminant transfer in this study only two modelling approaches were compared dis aggregated seasonal models versus an aggregated year averaged model comparison with other modelling approaches such as the npzd framework i e pe√±a et al 2016 olson et al 2020 may lead to different conclusions overall the modelling approach requires a thoughtful

24173,besides the complex effect of global warming on extreme events spatiotemporal variability of natural phenomena often carries the legacy of anthropogenic activities moreover any feedback induced by these activities on climate brings additional complexity when modelling natural events for extreme values climate or physiographic patterns often induce non stationarity or long term changes in this context parametric models may become inadequate given the complexity of the studied phenomena and their systematic changes through space and time in this paper we assess the use and ensuing efficiency of nonparametric machine learning npml methods to estimate and predict extreme values associated with natural events these npml methods are compared to a commonly used parametric machine learning pml approach the nonstationary frequency analysis model we use a historical database compiling the frequency of harmful algal blooms hab in qu√©bec canada results show that a 19 covariate rfcde model leads to the best mean estimate among the considered models however for low and large quantiles the 4 covariate rcde model provides better agreement between observed and simulated bloom frequencies the models may be used to assess the effects of climate change and anthropogenic developments on the frequency of hab they may also be leveraged to measure the efficiency of mitigation scenarios and to identify priority areas for restoration plan strategies recommendations are finally made regarding the estimation of the conditional density to predict extreme values associated with natural events keywords machine learning conditional density estimation random forest nearest neighbour kernel parametric nonparametric harmful algal blooms data availability https data mendeley com datasets j532t64snd 1 introduction extreme natural events have increased in frequency intensity and duration since the 1950s and this trend is likely to continue over the next decades ipcc 2013 ouranos 2015 unfortunately they represent a threat to human well being sometimes in synergy with other anthropogenic factors a reduction of the availability and quality of surface and ground water resources is one of many possible adverse effects for example global warming has been linked to an increase of frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms hab a trend likely to continue over the coming decades bartosiewicz et al 2019 ho et al 2019 this escalation is also linked to increased phosphorus and nitrogen loads in lakes and rivers induced by agricultural and urban land use in this context the prediction of extreme natural events becomes a daunting task given the complexity of the studied phenomena which may also be non stationary 1 1 definition measurements of natural phenomena through times are often modelled as a random process x1 x2 borrowing the definition of coles et al 2001 a random process is said to be stationary if given any set of integers i 1 i k and any integer m the joint distribution of x i 1 x i k and x i 1 m x i k m are identical water quality is linked to ecosystem and climate characteristics by building a large databases of such characteristics we develop prediction models that have the ability to account for global warming and other anthropologic changes with an evolving climate governments and private interests must now consider a non stationary framework for their management strategies notably to minimize the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to extreme natural events such as habs foulon et al 2020 our prediction model can leverage climate and development scenarios to achieve that health risk management involves the measurement of natural phenomena and their extremes a relevant framework to model such values is the conditional density estimations cde such as non stationary frequency analysis cde typically consists of inferring a conditional probability density p y x based on a set of empirical observations x n y n n 1 n non stationary frequency analysis is often used to establish the relationship between extreme events that may generate a risk and their probability of exceeding or not a certain threshold gilroy and mccuen 2012 klein et al 2016 rousseau et al 2014 the risk may induce adverse effects on the health of water users and ecosystems or monetary losses in recreational and socio economic activities however this approach is typically applied locally chebana and ouarda 2021 oubennaceur et al 2021 rousseau et al 2014 and requires sizable data for each lake or river considered in other words it is applicable only to specific locations where a large amount of data was collected through meteorological or hydrometric stations moreover with a complex phenomenon a non stationary frequency analysis requires subjective decisions which could lead to some biases for example we must decide on an appropriate functionnal form for the non stationary process on which covariates to use and which to assume stationary or not therefore adequate modelling of extreme natural events and associated risks now requires the development of sophisticated mathematical models among extreme natural events the marked increase of hab in freshwater ecosystems is of major interest hab intensity and frequency have been shown to increase in response to climate change bartosiewicz et al 2019 chapra et al 2017 ho et al 2019 moss 2012 wagner and adrian 2009 zhang et al 2012 and to occur earlier in the spring edwards and richardson 2004 winder and sommer 2012 global warming particularly affects cyanobacteria growth since prokaryotes have a higher optimal growth temperature than phytoplankton watkinson et al 2005 increased frequency and sustained presence of hab condition the structure and functioning of aquatic food webs chorus and bartram 1999 limit recreational activities steffensen 2008 and impact drinking water resources zamyadi et al 2012 despite significant social economic and environmental costs various stakeholders remain rather reactive to the phenomenon foulon et al 2020 climatic physiographic and morphological drivers of bloom phenology can create complex spatial patterns in biomass and taxonomic composition that are challenging to predict on one end these patterns are difficult to assess by traditional sampling methods which are limited in space and time and on the other end prediction of bloom phenology requires increasingly complex models accounting for several governing factors to achieve this goal a non stationary frequency analysis model based on a parametric machine learning pml algorithm was developed by ratt√© fortin et al 2022 to estimate the conditional density of hab frequency using remote sensing data of chlorophyll a chl a concentration following calibration and validation this model has the potential to support the management of cyanobacteria blooms providing frequency quantiles based on physiographic and climatic descriptors of the source watershed meanwhile many nonparametric machine learning npml algorithms have been recently developed and applied for water quality management here a nonparametric method refers to one that is not assuming any specific distribution for the outcome nelson et al 2018 used random forest rf algorithms to model cyanobacteria genera as a function of environmental descriptors in a bloom impacted lake in florida united states park et al 2021 tested support vector machine svm and artificial neural network ann for early prediction of cyanobacterial blooms similarly mellios et al 2020 tested several npml methods such as rf svm and k nearest neighbour knn to predict risk levels for human health with the recent successes of deep learning a more complex version of ann developed by a subfield of ml ann algorithms have become very popular there is however already an history of using ann for water quality management and forecasting recknagel et al 2002 used ann algorithms to predict algal abundance on lake kasumigaura japan similarly cho et al 2014 trained an ann to predict algal abundance based on physico chemical climatic and hydrological data on lake juam south korea maier et al 1998 used anns to evaluate the effect of eight physico chemical variables on duration and intensity of algal events in the murray river australia in mathematical terms the goal of these studies has been to provide an estimate Œº x of the conditional mean e y x x of the response variable y given x x in other words most ml methods target classification or regression whose primary goal is to return a point estimate of variable y given observation x when modelling extreme natural events we usually want to estimate the quantiles of the distribution because it provides more complete information about the distribution of y as a function of x than would the conditional mean alone the mean is not an extreme event for extreme events of a continuous variable y we are interested in the conditional distribution function f y x x p y y x x in order to determine quantiles q Œ≥ x the value such that for x x Œ≥ represents the probability of y being smaller than q Œ≥ x cde tools based on ml algorithms are quite recent and to our knowledge no studies have compared the performance between nonparametric and parametric ml methods to estimate the conditional distribution of the response variable y in this case frequency of algal blooms given the recent development of npml approaches for cde the main objective of our study is to test the efficiency of two such methods and a commonly used pml model to estimate the conditional density of algal bloom frequency recommendations are then made for each type of ml models with these ml methods mitigation scenarios to improve water quality could be tested prior to their implementation such as beneficial management practices in a context where changes in climate and land use are anticipated given physiographic and climatic characteristics the ml methods provide opportunities to estimate i the predisposition of a lake to developing blooms based on environmental descriptors ii the probability of a bloom occurrence in a lake where only data on watershed characteristics are available along with little or no data on historical occurrences of blooms iii the predisposition of a lake in developing blooms for lakes that are neither calibrated nor observable using remote sensing because of their size and iv the potential impact on lake ecosystems of climatic projections or anthropogenic variations in the source watershed this work builds on our work ratt√© fortin et al 2020 investigating the potential links between bloom phenology and environmental variables that has allowed us to identify the key descriptors used here 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and environmental data the study area is located in qu√©bec canada precisely between 44 n and 50 n and 67 w and 80 w fig 1 it mainly consists of podzolic soils and is characterized by a humid continental climate in the south and a subarctic climate in the north industrial and agricultural developments are widespread in the southwestern area of the territory while the northern part is much less developed a geo referenced database ratt√© fortin 2022 of bloom frequencies y and 19 environmental descriptors x of 580 lakes was built over a 17 year period 2000 to 2016 bloom frequency data were obtained from a chl a concentration estimator based on the approach of el alem et al 2019 that leverage ensemble methods to extract the information from optically complex inland waters an operational biomass threshold of 10 ¬µg chl a l 1 was chosen to define the onset of an algal bloom and to characterize its frequency in the studied lakes this threshold value corresponds to the lower chl a concentration range associated to the eutrophic lake class 8 25 ¬µg l 1 and to the regulation established by the world health organization 2003 and the government of quebec melcc 2015 it is considered that when level 1 threshold is exceeded and biomass becomes dominated by cyanobacteria there is a risk of minor health effects irritation and allergies environmental descriptors include morphologic characteristics of lakes as well as climatic and physiographic characteristics of the watersheds see supplementary data sd1 among the environmental variables the cyanobacterial degree days dd are key descriptors of bloom frequency followed by settlement agriculture and forest land cover ratt√© fortin et al 2020 dd were calculated using climate data from north american regional reanalyses mesinger et al 2006 spatial resolution of approximately 32 km water temperature was then used to calculate the cumulative degree days by summing the recorded degrees c of each day above 20 c a value that has been considered a threshold for cyanobacterial growth dupuis and hann 2009 neuheimer and taggart 2007 even though the remote sensing approach used here is not specific to cyanobacterial biomass we use it as a climate proxy the boundaries of each lake s watershed was established using the canadian digital elevation model natural resources canada 2015a with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 m land cover forest settlement cropland was then calculated using land use data 40 m resolution provided by natural resources canada 2015b natural resources canada 2016 2 2 conditional density estimation cde methods in this section we briefly describe three cde methods regional nearest neighbour kernel and random forest cde for the three specific methods described in table 1 along with references we consider three different numbers of covariates p 1 4 19 all methods predict bloom frequency y while the one covariate method uses only degree days dd as a predictor the four covariate version uses dd land cover of forest settlement and cropland similarly to ratt√© fortin et al 2020 since we have a total of 19 covariates available the last method uses them all to predict y see sd1 for a complete list of those variables in general using more covariates should increase the potential for better predictions however collecting that information in practice may be hard predictions relying on fewer covariates are easier to implement for new locations the 4 covariate option that we propose leverages information from previous research ratt√© fortin et al 2020 to identify a subset of variables that are likely to be more predictive 2 2 1 rcde the pml model is a regional non stationary frequency model considering bloom frequency y as a random variable represented by a statistical distribution f y œÜ where œÜ are the parameters of the distribution these parameters are defined as functions of covariate s x the model is based on the postulate that spatiotemporal hazard of bloom occurrences carries the mark of environmental descriptors which vary in time and space non stationarity is incorporated by linking the location and scale parameters of the distribution to the covariate s x using a functional form initial exploration of multiple families of distributions based on aic and bic showed that the log normal distribution provided the best fit to our data its density involves two parameters see eq 1 with a linear trend in the location parameter Œº x Œº 0 x Œ≤ and a constant scale parameter œÉ x œÉ 0 see ratt√© fortin et al 2022 and references therein where Œº 0 r and Œ≤ r p are parameters 1 f y Œº œÉ 1 2 œÄ œÉ 2 y e ln y Œº 2 2 œÉ 2 y 0 rcde models are notoriously difficult to fit when the number of covariate increases while we could fit the one and four covariate models using maximum likelihood the 19 covariate model required an approximation we first used a linear regression fit to summarize the contribution of the 19 covariates into a single value the prediction of that regression then we obtained a maximum likelihood fit for the rcde based on that single summary variable as a covariate 2 2 2 nnkcde and rfcde as npml methods we use nearest neighbors kernel conditional density estimation nnkcde and random forest conditional density estimation rfcde both developed by dr ann b lee s team at the department of statistics data science carnegie mellon university dalmasso et al 2020 izbicki and lee 2016 nnkcde and rfcde software are available in python and r we used the python packages available on github for both methods pospisil and dalmasso 2019a 2019b models were initially used to estimate galaxys redshift given their photometric covariates nnkcde is a simple and easily interpretable method that computes a kernel density estimate of y using the k nearest neighbors of the evaluation point x the model has two tuning parameters the number of nearest neighbors k and the bandwidth h of the smoothing kernel in the y space the kernel density estimate of y given x is defined as 2 f y x 1 k i 1 k k h œÅ y y s i x where k h is a normalized kernel with bandwidth h œÅ is a distance metric and s i x is the index of the i th nearest neighbour of x for rfcde a random forest is first fitted then kernel density estimate of y is computed using a weightings w defined by the location of the evaluation point x relative to each data point y i x i and their belonging to given leaves of the random forest 3 f y x 1 i 1 n w i x i 1 n w i x k h y i y among competing rf implementations pospisil and lee 2018 showed that this method achieves a better cde loss for a given computational time 2 3 data splitting the 580 lake dataset consists of 8696 observations of annual bloom frequencies over the 2000 2016 period data were split randomly into subsamples keeping together all observations from the same lake subsampling by lake three subsets were formed a training subset which contained data from 60 of the lakes a validation subset with 20 of the lakes and the remaining 20 as a test subset fig 2 the training subset is used to fit the parameters to the ml models the validation subset is used to tune models hyperparameters and the test subet to evaluate the final models following the guidelines by roberts et al 2017 sampling schemes for validation should be similar to the planned use a typical use for our model would be the assessment of a new lake hence the subsampling by lake to evaluate the predictions on lakes not included in the calibration dataset we optimized the rfcde and nnkcde hyperparameters with the validation subset we used a grid search approach to optimize the bandwidth parameter rfcde and nnkcde the number of trees rfcde and the number of neighbors nnkcde 2 4 performance criteria the different approaches were first assessed using a cde loss function that provides a relative comparison among cdes allowing to choose the best fitting method given an estimate f y x of distribution of interest f y x the cde loss is defined as 4 l f f f y x f y x 2 d y d h x where h x is the marginal distribution of x see izbicki and lee 2016 for a discussion on cde loss because the true density f y x is unknown the cde loss cannot be directly evaluated but can be estimated up to an additive constant determined by the true f using 5 l f f 1 v i v f y x i 2 d y 2 v i v f y i x i where v is the set of indices of the data randomly assigned to the validation set and v is the number of data in that set note that lower values of l p p and l p p are indicative of a better performance but while l p p is always positive the suppression of the additive constant to get l p p means that it may admit negative values a smaller value of l p p is better even if it is larger in absolute value we also examine the probability integral transform pit plot an histogram of pit values which provides a visual appreciation of the overall goodness of fit gof of the conditional density estimators on the observed data pit values are obtained through the cumulative distributive function cdf of f y x i evaluated at y y i 6 p i t x i y i y i f y x i d y for all data in the validation set i v a well calibrated conditional density estimator should yield a set of pit values that follows a uniform distribution u shaped pit histograms indicate overly narrow cdes while an inverse u shape would indicate overly broad cdes dalmasso et al 2020 suggest that since pit plots have limitations e g schmidt et al 2020 show a uniform pit plot generated from a bad estimate of f y x they should be used in conjunction with a loss function such as the cde loss introduced above to evaluate the conditional distributions obtained we also use quantile quantile q q plots that provide a visual assessment of the agreement between any two ditributions by plotting their inverse quantile functions in our experiments we compare f and f evaluated at x i y i for i v the straighter those lines the better fit we have prediction methods are typically assessed on their ability to predict future values rather than their quantiles as a matter of fact we can seldom observe quantiles in practice to validate empirically the performance of the model although it is not the value of prime interest in our setting we also evaluate the methods based on their ability to predict the conditional mean that we can compare to observed data four different performance metrics are considered namely the root mean squared error rmse 7 r m s e i v y i y i 2 v the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash 8 n a s h 1 i v y i y i 2 i v y i y 2 the coefficient of correlation r 9 r i v y i y y i y i v y i y 2 i v y i y 2 and the bias 10 bias i v y i y i where y is the average of observed values y i i v y i are the conditional means based on a given method and y is the average of those conditional means y i i v methods with better fit should yield values of rmse and bias close to zero but nash and r close to one these performance metrics give an idea of the accuracy of the methods for predicting the average of the outcome of interest 3 results 3 1 example of prediction fig 3 presents an example of conditional density estimates obtained for lake charland in 2013 one of the lakes in our validation set three different methods are illustrated each using the 19 covariates describing its climatic physiographic and morphologic characteristics lake charland is a highly forested oligo mesotrophic lake approximately 160 km north of montr√©al in 2013 22 algal blooms were observed y 22 a value marked with a vertical black line in the graphs of fig 3 conditional means medians and 95th quantiles are also presented for this specific lake nnkcde and rfcde methods appear especially accurate to estimate the conditional mean discrepancies are however observed between the three methods for the estimation of the 95th quantile the next section presents an assessment of the overall quality of the cde methods 3 2 methods performance we consider three different methods with different numbers of covariates for a total of nine different modelling strategies the random split for validation is performed once so all methods are assessed on their ability to make predictions for the same lakes whose indices are in the set v table 2 presents the estimated cde loss for the 1 covariate 4 covariate and 19 covariate methods all methods were run on a macbook pro with a tenth generation 2 3 ghz quad core i7 processor with an intel iris plus graphics 1536 mo compute times in terms of cpu time in seconds are reported as well in table 2 we see that the performance of all methods improve as the number of covariates increase the 19 covariate options providing the best performances with 4 or 19 covariates rfcde provides the best performance among methods but it features the heaviest computation requirements it is also the only of the three methods that shows a significant increase in compute time as the number of features grow fig 4 shows the histograms of pit values of each method as produced by the rfcde and nnkcde package a uniform distribution indicates that the conditional density estimates are well calibrated on average all combinations of method and number of covariate seem to be fairly well calibrated with the exception of nnkcde and rcde methods with 19 covariates on average the corresponding histograms exhibit an overrepresentation of the intervals 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 0 7 respectively to illustrate the methods fit fig 5 shows the estimate of the mean for the lakes in the test set as a function of the true observe value as such it provides a measure of the ability of the methods to make predictions for a new lake additional fit statsitics are also displayed the 19 covariate rfcde model shows the best fit by far interestingly the three models show similar performance using 1 covariate although the four statistical metrics r rmse bias and nash are quite similar for the 4 covariate rcde and rfcde models rcde shows a slightly better performance fig 6 displays the q q plots of the different methods using the test datasets an ideal q q plot has all points close to the identity line where the expected and simulated distributions are the same when frequencies f are smaller than 10 days and greater than 30 days the 1 covariate models fail to provide a good fit discrepancies between the three models are greater for high frequency values f 25 days when comparing the expected frequencies to simulated frequencies the 4 covariate models have small differences between them but the rcde model provides a better agreement for bloom frequencies less than 10 days and a slightly better performance up to bloom frequencies of 30 days as expected the best models are those with 19 covariates the rfcde model with 19 covariates provides the best fit for small f 25 days and high frequencies f 25 days the ranking in cde loss also roughly correlates with this gof diagnostic 4 discussion the climatic physiographic and morphological drivers involved in extreme natural events are characterized by complex spatiotemporal patterns making monitoring and forecasting challenging we analysed three methods with different numbers of features to fit an extreme natural event namely harmful algal blooms hab one typical pml model and two npml methods were considered the 1 covariate methods use annual degree days of cyanobacteria growth dd to estimate conditional densities of bloom frequencies the use of one covariate to model algal blooms is easily feasible in a monitoring context the choice of features in the 4 covariate methods is based on a study that determined the best key descriptors of hab frequency ratt√© fortin et al 2020 this type of information is seldom available for other natural events and would require some research the 19 covariate methods require more resources to collect all that information histograms of pit values showed that the methods generally provide an excellent fit except for rcde and nnkcde with 19 covariates that displayed some discrepancies the cde loss function show the ability to discriminate further between the methods the 19 covariate rfcde model has a loss of 0 912 which is much smaller than 0 734 and 0 711 the loss achieved by the 19 covariate rcde and nnkcde models respectively for the 4 covariate and 1 covariate models there is little discrepancy between the loss of the different methods for a given number of covariates in fig 5 estimated mean values are compared to actual bloom frequencies in the test set the 1 covariate methods fail to provide a good fit for high and low frequency values this is expected since the dd covariate alone cannot explain the overall natural spatiotemporal variability of the blooms the dependence of bloom frequency with for instance agricultural land cover is visible in fig 7 where the normalized residuals from the rcde method tend to be more often negative for large values of agriculture land cover this means that lakes with more agricultural activities tend to display more blooms than predicted if agricultural land cover is ignored when examining low frequency bloom estimates f 10 days and performance metrics the 4 covariate rcde model shows a slightly better overall performance than the nnkcde and rfcde methods fig 5 the 19 covariate rfcde model displays a frankly better mean estimate than any other models the q q plots of the models are used to assess how the models perform at different bloom frequencies discrepancies between methods are greater for high frequency values even though the rfcde yields slightly larger cde loss values the 4 covariate rcde model provides better agreement between observed and simulated bloom frequencies associated with low and large quantiles however the 19 covariate rfcde model clearly has a better agreement than the rcde and nnkcde methods extreme natural events such as hydrological phenomena are often studied using frequency analysis techniques chebana and ouarda 2021 marra et al 2019 rousseau et al 2014 when considering climate change and human activities non stationarity of the time series must be taken into account non stationarity caused by global warming is usually incorporated using a time covariate which is parametrically linked often linearly or quadractically to the location scale and or shape parameters of the statistical distribution a frequency analysis relies on a number of assumptions on covariates distributions and functional forms and not all combinations of options can be explored for a given problem the impact of human activities on spatiotemporal variability is also difficult to consider when modelling extreme events especially that parametric models are fairly tricky to fit even with a moderate number of covariates in comparison npml methods behave well and can therefore be quite useful in our study the 19 covariate rfcde method provided the best cde loss that model performance metric was calculated on a test set made of yet unseen lakes to fit the eventual use of the model on the other hand using several input data to predict a phenomenon requires extracting the same data when applying the model to other study sites in other words the more input data we use to train a model the less exportable the model becomes recommendations for the type of algorithms to use when estimating conditional densities depend on different factors extreme value theory evt suggests that extreme events should be modelled with some specific distributions such as the generalized extreme value distribution a more applied approach fosters a selection from a list of parametric families empirically choosing that with the best fit there is no consensus on which approaches to consider more appropriate one key is to assess the limitations around both methodologies to better understand and interpret the results for that purpose the benefits and limitations of parametric and nonparametric ml based modelling are summarized in table 3 conditional density models could be used to support governments and public health agencies in identifying priority areas and strategies for restoration plans for instance ratt√© fortin et al 2022 used an rcde model to conduct different climatic and physiographic scenarios on the watershed of five lakes in the province of qu√©bec canada one of the scenarios involved climate projections of surface air temperature and showed a clear increase in blooms frequency over time scenarios of land cover changes indicated that blooms frequency in highly anthropogenic eutrophic lakes are more sensitive to changes in climate than changes in land cover a conditional density model is thus a promising tool to project the changes in an environmental phenomenon due to changes in climate of land use for instance it may hence be leveraged to evaluate mitigating scenarios based on the response at the regional scale 5 conclusions spatiotemporal variability of natural events can sometimes lead to difficulties in management monitoring and forecasting the underlying reasons lie in the complex spatiotemporal hazards bearing the marks of climate change and human activities making modelling difficult for this reason when estimating conditional densities we should prioritize pml methods if there is strong knowledge about i the distribution function representing the variable of interest ii the functional form used to represent the non stationarity iii the covariates used to represent adequately the spatiotemporal variability of the variable of interest iv a simple relationship between the variable and covariates v a negligible effect of human activities on the variable and vi the need for a physical interpretation of the results meanwhile the use of npml methods should be prioritized if there are i no a priori knowledge of the underlying distribution form ii no a priori knowledge of the underlying nonstationary form and iii readily available environmental and climatic descriptors several or few explaining the spatiotemporal variability of the variable even without a priori knowledge on their predictive power credit authorship contribution statement claudie ratt√©

24173,besides the complex effect of global warming on extreme events spatiotemporal variability of natural phenomena often carries the legacy of anthropogenic activities moreover any feedback induced by these activities on climate brings additional complexity when modelling natural events for extreme values climate or physiographic patterns often induce non stationarity or long term changes in this context parametric models may become inadequate given the complexity of the studied phenomena and their systematic changes through space and time in this paper we assess the use and ensuing efficiency of nonparametric machine learning npml methods to estimate and predict extreme values associated with natural events these npml methods are compared to a commonly used parametric machine learning pml approach the nonstationary frequency analysis model we use a historical database compiling the frequency of harmful algal blooms hab in qu√©bec canada results show that a 19 covariate rfcde model leads to the best mean estimate among the considered models however for low and large quantiles the 4 covariate rcde model provides better agreement between observed and simulated bloom frequencies the models may be used to assess the effects of climate change and anthropogenic developments on the frequency of hab they may also be leveraged to measure the efficiency of mitigation scenarios and to identify priority areas for restoration plan strategies recommendations are finally made regarding the estimation of the conditional density to predict extreme values associated with natural events keywords machine learning conditional density estimation random forest nearest neighbour kernel parametric nonparametric harmful algal blooms data availability https data mendeley com datasets j532t64snd 1 introduction extreme natural events have increased in frequency intensity and duration since the 1950s and this trend is likely to continue over the next decades ipcc 2013 ouranos 2015 unfortunately they represent a threat to human well being sometimes in synergy with other anthropogenic factors a reduction of the availability and quality of surface and ground water resources is one of many possible adverse effects for example global warming has been linked to an increase of frequency and intensity of harmful algal blooms hab a trend likely to continue over the coming decades bartosiewicz et al 2019 ho et al 2019 this escalation is also linked to increased phosphorus and nitrogen loads in lakes and rivers induced by agricultural and urban land use in this context the prediction of extreme natural events becomes a daunting task given the complexity of the studied phenomena which may also be non stationary 1 1 definition measurements of natural phenomena through times are often modelled as a random process x1 x2 borrowing the definition of coles et al 2001 a random process is said to be stationary if given any set of integers i 1 i k and any integer m the joint distribution of x i 1 x i k and x i 1 m x i k m are identical water quality is linked to ecosystem and climate characteristics by building a large databases of such characteristics we develop prediction models that have the ability to account for global warming and other anthropologic changes with an evolving climate governments and private interests must now consider a non stationary framework for their management strategies notably to minimize the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to extreme natural events such as habs foulon et al 2020 our prediction model can leverage climate and development scenarios to achieve that health risk management involves the measurement of natural phenomena and their extremes a relevant framework to model such values is the conditional density estimations cde such as non stationary frequency analysis cde typically consists of inferring a conditional probability density p y x based on a set of empirical observations x n y n n 1 n non stationary frequency analysis is often used to establish the relationship between extreme events that may generate a risk and their probability of exceeding or not a certain threshold gilroy and mccuen 2012 klein et al 2016 rousseau et al 2014 the risk may induce adverse effects on the health of water users and ecosystems or monetary losses in recreational and socio economic activities however this approach is typically applied locally chebana and ouarda 2021 oubennaceur et al 2021 rousseau et al 2014 and requires sizable data for each lake or river considered in other words it is applicable only to specific locations where a large amount of data was collected through meteorological or hydrometric stations moreover with a complex phenomenon a non stationary frequency analysis requires subjective decisions which could lead to some biases for example we must decide on an appropriate functionnal form for the non stationary process on which covariates to use and which to assume stationary or not therefore adequate modelling of extreme natural events and associated risks now requires the development of sophisticated mathematical models among extreme natural events the marked increase of hab in freshwater ecosystems is of major interest hab intensity and frequency have been shown to increase in response to climate change bartosiewicz et al 2019 chapra et al 2017 ho et al 2019 moss 2012 wagner and adrian 2009 zhang et al 2012 and to occur earlier in the spring edwards and richardson 2004 winder and sommer 2012 global warming particularly affects cyanobacteria growth since prokaryotes have a higher optimal growth temperature than phytoplankton watkinson et al 2005 increased frequency and sustained presence of hab condition the structure and functioning of aquatic food webs chorus and bartram 1999 limit recreational activities steffensen 2008 and impact drinking water resources zamyadi et al 2012 despite significant social economic and environmental costs various stakeholders remain rather reactive to the phenomenon foulon et al 2020 climatic physiographic and morphological drivers of bloom phenology can create complex spatial patterns in biomass and taxonomic composition that are challenging to predict on one end these patterns are difficult to assess by traditional sampling methods which are limited in space and time and on the other end prediction of bloom phenology requires increasingly complex models accounting for several governing factors to achieve this goal a non stationary frequency analysis model based on a parametric machine learning pml algorithm was developed by ratt√© fortin et al 2022 to estimate the conditional density of hab frequency using remote sensing data of chlorophyll a chl a concentration following calibration and validation this model has the potential to support the management of cyanobacteria blooms providing frequency quantiles based on physiographic and climatic descriptors of the source watershed meanwhile many nonparametric machine learning npml algorithms have been recently developed and applied for water quality management here a nonparametric method refers to one that is not assuming any specific distribution for the outcome nelson et al 2018 used random forest rf algorithms to model cyanobacteria genera as a function of environmental descriptors in a bloom impacted lake in florida united states park et al 2021 tested support vector machine svm and artificial neural network ann for early prediction of cyanobacterial blooms similarly mellios et al 2020 tested several npml methods such as rf svm and k nearest neighbour knn to predict risk levels for human health with the recent successes of deep learning a more complex version of ann developed by a subfield of ml ann algorithms have become very popular there is however already an history of using ann for water quality management and forecasting recknagel et al 2002 used ann algorithms to predict algal abundance on lake kasumigaura japan similarly cho et al 2014 trained an ann to predict algal abundance based on physico chemical climatic and hydrological data on lake juam south korea maier et al 1998 used anns to evaluate the effect of eight physico chemical variables on duration and intensity of algal events in the murray river australia in mathematical terms the goal of these studies has been to provide an estimate Œº x of the conditional mean e y x x of the response variable y given x x in other words most ml methods target classification or regression whose primary goal is to return a point estimate of variable y given observation x when modelling extreme natural events we usually want to estimate the quantiles of the distribution because it provides more complete information about the distribution of y as a function of x than would the conditional mean alone the mean is not an extreme event for extreme events of a continuous variable y we are interested in the conditional distribution function f y x x p y y x x in order to determine quantiles q Œ≥ x the value such that for x x Œ≥ represents the probability of y being smaller than q Œ≥ x cde tools based on ml algorithms are quite recent and to our knowledge no studies have compared the performance between nonparametric and parametric ml methods to estimate the conditional distribution of the response variable y in this case frequency of algal blooms given the recent development of npml approaches for cde the main objective of our study is to test the efficiency of two such methods and a commonly used pml model to estimate the conditional density of algal bloom frequency recommendations are then made for each type of ml models with these ml methods mitigation scenarios to improve water quality could be tested prior to their implementation such as beneficial management practices in a context where changes in climate and land use are anticipated given physiographic and climatic characteristics the ml methods provide opportunities to estimate i the predisposition of a lake to developing blooms based on environmental descriptors ii the probability of a bloom occurrence in a lake where only data on watershed characteristics are available along with little or no data on historical occurrences of blooms iii the predisposition of a lake in developing blooms for lakes that are neither calibrated nor observable using remote sensing because of their size and iv the potential impact on lake ecosystems of climatic projections or anthropogenic variations in the source watershed this work builds on our work ratt√© fortin et al 2020 investigating the potential links between bloom phenology and environmental variables that has allowed us to identify the key descriptors used here 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and environmental data the study area is located in qu√©bec canada precisely between 44 n and 50 n and 67 w and 80 w fig 1 it mainly consists of podzolic soils and is characterized by a humid continental climate in the south and a subarctic climate in the north industrial and agricultural developments are widespread in the southwestern area of the territory while the northern part is much less developed a geo referenced database ratt√© fortin 2022 of bloom frequencies y and 19 environmental descriptors x of 580 lakes was built over a 17 year period 2000 to 2016 bloom frequency data were obtained from a chl a concentration estimator based on the approach of el alem et al 2019 that leverage ensemble methods to extract the information from optically complex inland waters an operational biomass threshold of 10 ¬µg chl a l 1 was chosen to define the onset of an algal bloom and to characterize its frequency in the studied lakes this threshold value corresponds to the lower chl a concentration range associated to the eutrophic lake class 8 25 ¬µg l 1 and to the regulation established by the world health organization 2003 and the government of quebec melcc 2015 it is considered that when level 1 threshold is exceeded and biomass becomes dominated by cyanobacteria there is a risk of minor health effects irritation and allergies environmental descriptors include morphologic characteristics of lakes as well as climatic and physiographic characteristics of the watersheds see supplementary data sd1 among the environmental variables the cyanobacterial degree days dd are key descriptors of bloom frequency followed by settlement agriculture and forest land cover ratt√© fortin et al 2020 dd were calculated using climate data from north american regional reanalyses mesinger et al 2006 spatial resolution of approximately 32 km water temperature was then used to calculate the cumulative degree days by summing the recorded degrees c of each day above 20 c a value that has been considered a threshold for cyanobacterial growth dupuis and hann 2009 neuheimer and taggart 2007 even though the remote sensing approach used here is not specific to cyanobacterial biomass we use it as a climate proxy the boundaries of each lake s watershed was established using the canadian digital elevation model natural resources canada 2015a with a spatial resolution of approximately 30 m land cover forest settlement cropland was then calculated using land use data 40 m resolution provided by natural resources canada 2015b natural resources canada 2016 2 2 conditional density estimation cde methods in this section we briefly describe three cde methods regional nearest neighbour kernel and random forest cde for the three specific methods described in table 1 along with references we consider three different numbers of covariates p 1 4 19 all methods predict bloom frequency y while the one covariate method uses only degree days dd as a predictor the four covariate version uses dd land cover of forest settlement and cropland similarly to ratt√© fortin et al 2020 since we have a total of 19 covariates available the last method uses them all to predict y see sd1 for a complete list of those variables in general using more covariates should increase the potential for better predictions however collecting that information in practice may be hard predictions relying on fewer covariates are easier to implement for new locations the 4 covariate option that we propose leverages information from previous research ratt√© fortin et al 2020 to identify a subset of variables that are likely to be more predictive 2 2 1 rcde the pml model is a regional non stationary frequency model considering bloom frequency y as a random variable represented by a statistical distribution f y œÜ where œÜ are the parameters of the distribution these parameters are defined as functions of covariate s x the model is based on the postulate that spatiotemporal hazard of bloom occurrences carries the mark of environmental descriptors which vary in time and space non stationarity is incorporated by linking the location and scale parameters of the distribution to the covariate s x using a functional form initial exploration of multiple families of distributions based on aic and bic showed that the log normal distribution provided the best fit to our data its density involves two parameters see eq 1 with a linear trend in the location parameter Œº x Œº 0 x Œ≤ and a constant scale parameter œÉ x œÉ 0 see ratt√© fortin et al 2022 and references therein where Œº 0 r and Œ≤ r p are parameters 1 f y Œº œÉ 1 2 œÄ œÉ 2 y e ln y Œº 2 2 œÉ 2 y 0 rcde models are notoriously difficult to fit when the number of covariate increases while we could fit the one and four covariate models using maximum likelihood the 19 covariate model required an approximation we first used a linear regression fit to summarize the contribution of the 19 covariates into a single value the prediction of that regression then we obtained a maximum likelihood fit for the rcde based on that single summary variable as a covariate 2 2 2 nnkcde and rfcde as npml methods we use nearest neighbors kernel conditional density estimation nnkcde and random forest conditional density estimation rfcde both developed by dr ann b lee s team at the department of statistics data science carnegie mellon university dalmasso et al 2020 izbicki and lee 2016 nnkcde and rfcde software are available in python and r we used the python packages available on github for both methods pospisil and dalmasso 2019a 2019b models were initially used to estimate galaxys redshift given their photometric covariates nnkcde is a simple and easily interpretable method that computes a kernel density estimate of y using the k nearest neighbors of the evaluation point x the model has two tuning parameters the number of nearest neighbors k and the bandwidth h of the smoothing kernel in the y space the kernel density estimate of y given x is defined as 2 f y x 1 k i 1 k k h œÅ y y s i x where k h is a normalized kernel with bandwidth h œÅ is a distance metric and s i x is the index of the i th nearest neighbour of x for rfcde a random forest is first fitted then kernel density estimate of y is computed using a weightings w defined by the location of the evaluation point x relative to each data point y i x i and their belonging to given leaves of the random forest 3 f y x 1 i 1 n w i x i 1 n w i x k h y i y among competing rf implementations pospisil and lee 2018 showed that this method achieves a better cde loss for a given computational time 2 3 data splitting the 580 lake dataset consists of 8696 observations of annual bloom frequencies over the 2000 2016 period data were split randomly into subsamples keeping together all observations from the same lake subsampling by lake three subsets were formed a training subset which contained data from 60 of the lakes a validation subset with 20 of the lakes and the remaining 20 as a test subset fig 2 the training subset is used to fit the parameters to the ml models the validation subset is used to tune models hyperparameters and the test subet to evaluate the final models following the guidelines by roberts et al 2017 sampling schemes for validation should be similar to the planned use a typical use for our model would be the assessment of a new lake hence the subsampling by lake to evaluate the predictions on lakes not included in the calibration dataset we optimized the rfcde and nnkcde hyperparameters with the validation subset we used a grid search approach to optimize the bandwidth parameter rfcde and nnkcde the number of trees rfcde and the number of neighbors nnkcde 2 4 performance criteria the different approaches were first assessed using a cde loss function that provides a relative comparison among cdes allowing to choose the best fitting method given an estimate f y x of distribution of interest f y x the cde loss is defined as 4 l f f f y x f y x 2 d y d h x where h x is the marginal distribution of x see izbicki and lee 2016 for a discussion on cde loss because the true density f y x is unknown the cde loss cannot be directly evaluated but can be estimated up to an additive constant determined by the true f using 5 l f f 1 v i v f y x i 2 d y 2 v i v f y i x i where v is the set of indices of the data randomly assigned to the validation set and v is the number of data in that set note that lower values of l p p and l p p are indicative of a better performance but while l p p is always positive the suppression of the additive constant to get l p p means that it may admit negative values a smaller value of l p p is better even if it is larger in absolute value we also examine the probability integral transform pit plot an histogram of pit values which provides a visual appreciation of the overall goodness of fit gof of the conditional density estimators on the observed data pit values are obtained through the cumulative distributive function cdf of f y x i evaluated at y y i 6 p i t x i y i y i f y x i d y for all data in the validation set i v a well calibrated conditional density estimator should yield a set of pit values that follows a uniform distribution u shaped pit histograms indicate overly narrow cdes while an inverse u shape would indicate overly broad cdes dalmasso et al 2020 suggest that since pit plots have limitations e g schmidt et al 2020 show a uniform pit plot generated from a bad estimate of f y x they should be used in conjunction with a loss function such as the cde loss introduced above to evaluate the conditional distributions obtained we also use quantile quantile q q plots that provide a visual assessment of the agreement between any two ditributions by plotting their inverse quantile functions in our experiments we compare f and f evaluated at x i y i for i v the straighter those lines the better fit we have prediction methods are typically assessed on their ability to predict future values rather than their quantiles as a matter of fact we can seldom observe quantiles in practice to validate empirically the performance of the model although it is not the value of prime interest in our setting we also evaluate the methods based on their ability to predict the conditional mean that we can compare to observed data four different performance metrics are considered namely the root mean squared error rmse 7 r m s e i v y i y i 2 v the nash sutcliffe efficiency nash 8 n a s h 1 i v y i y i 2 i v y i y 2 the coefficient of correlation r 9 r i v y i y y i y i v y i y 2 i v y i y 2 and the bias 10 bias i v y i y i where y is the average of observed values y i i v y i are the conditional means based on a given method and y is the average of those conditional means y i i v methods with better fit should yield values of rmse and bias close to zero but nash and r close to one these performance metrics give an idea of the accuracy of the methods for predicting the average of the outcome of interest 3 results 3 1 example of prediction fig 3 presents an example of conditional density estimates obtained for lake charland in 2013 one of the lakes in our validation set three different methods are illustrated each using the 19 covariates describing its climatic physiographic and morphologic characteristics lake charland is a highly forested oligo mesotrophic lake approximately 160 km north of montr√©al in 2013 22 algal blooms were observed y 22 a value marked with a vertical black line in the graphs of fig 3 conditional means medians and 95th quantiles are also presented for this specific lake nnkcde and rfcde methods appear especially accurate to estimate the conditional mean discrepancies are however observed between the three methods for the estimation of the 95th quantile the next section presents an assessment of the overall quality of the cde methods 3 2 methods performance we consider three different methods with different numbers of covariates for a total of nine different modelling strategies the random split for validation is performed once so all methods are assessed on their ability to make predictions for the same lakes whose indices are in the set v table 2 presents the estimated cde loss for the 1 covariate 4 covariate and 19 covariate methods all methods were run on a macbook pro with a tenth generation 2 3 ghz quad core i7 processor with an intel iris plus graphics 1536 mo compute times in terms of cpu time in seconds are reported as well in table 2 we see that the performance of all methods improve as the number of covariates increase the 19 covariate options providing the best performances with 4 or 19 covariates rfcde provides the best performance among methods but it features the heaviest computation requirements it is also the only of the three methods that shows a significant increase in compute time as the number of features grow fig 4 shows the histograms of pit values of each method as produced by the rfcde and nnkcde package a uniform distribution indicates that the conditional density estimates are well calibrated on average all combinations of method and number of covariate seem to be fairly well calibrated with the exception of nnkcde and rcde methods with 19 covariates on average the corresponding histograms exhibit an overrepresentation of the intervals 0 1 0 2 and 0 4 0 7 respectively to illustrate the methods fit fig 5 shows the estimate of the mean for the lakes in the test set as a function of the true observe value as such it provides a measure of the ability of the methods to make predictions for a new lake additional fit statsitics are also displayed the 19 covariate rfcde model shows the best fit by far interestingly the three models show similar performance using 1 covariate although the four statistical metrics r rmse bias and nash are quite similar for the 4 covariate rcde and rfcde models rcde shows a slightly better performance fig 6 displays the q q plots of the different methods using the test datasets an ideal q q plot has all points close to the identity line where the expected and simulated distributions are the same when frequencies f are smaller than 10 days and greater than 30 days the 1 covariate models fail to provide a good fit discrepancies between the three models are greater for high frequency values f 25 days when comparing the expected frequencies to simulated frequencies the 4 covariate models have small differences between them but the rcde model provides a better agreement for bloom frequencies less than 10 days and a slightly better performance up to bloom frequencies of 30 days as expected the best models are those with 19 covariates the rfcde model with 19 covariates provides the best fit for small f 25 days and high frequencies f 25 days the ranking in cde loss also roughly correlates with this gof diagnostic 4 discussion the climatic physiographic and morphological drivers involved in extreme natural events are characterized by complex spatiotemporal patterns making monitoring and forecasting challenging we analysed three methods with different numbers of features to fit an extreme natural event namely harmful algal blooms hab one typical pml model and two npml methods were considered the 1 covariate methods use annual degree days of cyanobacteria growth dd to estimate conditional densities of bloom frequencies the use of one covariate to model algal blooms is easily feasible in a monitoring context the choice of features in the 4 covariate methods is based on a study that determined the best key descriptors of hab frequency ratt√© fortin et al 2020 this type of information is seldom available for other natural events and would require some research the 19 covariate methods require more resources to collect all that information histograms of pit values showed that the methods generally provide an excellent fit except for rcde and nnkcde with 19 covariates that displayed some discrepancies the cde loss function show the ability to discriminate further between the methods the 19 covariate rfcde model has a loss of 0 912 which is much smaller than 0 734 and 0 711 the loss achieved by the 19 covariate rcde and nnkcde models respectively for the 4 covariate and 1 covariate models there is little discrepancy between the loss of the different methods for a given number of covariates in fig 5 estimated mean values are compared to actual bloom frequencies in the test set the 1 covariate methods fail to provide a good fit for high and low frequency values this is expected since the dd covariate alone cannot explain the overall natural spatiotemporal variability of the blooms the dependence of bloom frequency with for instance agricultural land cover is visible in fig 7 where the normalized residuals from the rcde method tend to be more often negative for large values of agriculture land cover this means that lakes with more agricultural activities tend to display more blooms than predicted if agricultural land cover is ignored when examining low frequency bloom estimates f 10 days and performance metrics the 4 covariate rcde model shows a slightly better overall performance than the nnkcde and rfcde methods fig 5 the 19 covariate rfcde model displays a frankly better mean estimate than any other models the q q plots of the models are used to assess how the models perform at different bloom frequencies discrepancies between methods are greater for high frequency values even though the rfcde yields slightly larger cde loss values the 4 covariate rcde model provides better agreement between observed and simulated bloom frequencies associated with low and large quantiles however the 19 covariate rfcde model clearly has a better agreement than the rcde and nnkcde methods extreme natural events such as hydrological phenomena are often studied using frequency analysis techniques chebana and ouarda 2021 marra et al 2019 rousseau et al 2014 when considering climate change and human activities non stationarity of the time series must be taken into account non stationarity caused by global warming is usually incorporated using a time covariate which is parametrically linked often linearly or quadractically to the location scale and or shape parameters of the statistical distribution a frequency analysis relies on a number of assumptions on covariates distributions and functional forms and not all combinations of options can be explored for a given problem the impact of human activities on spatiotemporal variability is also difficult to consider when modelling extreme events especially that parametric models are fairly tricky to fit even with a moderate number of covariates in comparison npml methods behave well and can therefore be quite useful in our study the 19 covariate rfcde method provided the best cde loss that model performance metric was calculated on a test set made of yet unseen lakes to fit the eventual use of the model on the other hand using several input data to predict a phenomenon requires extracting the same data when applying the model to other study sites in other words the more input data we use to train a model the less exportable the model becomes recommendations for the type of algorithms to use when estimating conditional densities depend on different factors extreme value theory evt suggests that extreme events should be modelled with some specific distributions such as the generalized extreme value distribution a more applied approach fosters a selection from a list of parametric families empirically choosing that with the best fit there is no consensus on which approaches to consider more appropriate one key is to assess the limitations around both methodologies to better understand and interpret the results for that purpose the benefits and limitations of parametric and nonparametric ml based modelling are summarized in table 3 conditional density models could be used to support governments and public health agencies in identifying priority areas and strategies for restoration plans for instance ratt√© fortin et al 2022 used an rcde model to conduct different climatic and physiographic scenarios on the watershed of five lakes in the province of qu√©bec canada one of the scenarios involved climate projections of surface air temperature and showed a clear increase in blooms frequency over time scenarios of land cover changes indicated that blooms frequency in highly anthropogenic eutrophic lakes are more sensitive to changes in climate than changes in land cover a conditional density model is thus a promising tool to project the changes in an environmental phenomenon due to changes in climate of land use for instance it may hence be leveraged to evaluate mitigating scenarios based on the response at the regional scale 5 conclusions spatiotemporal variability of natural events can sometimes lead to difficulties in management monitoring and forecasting the underlying reasons lie in the complex spatiotemporal hazards bearing the marks of climate change and human activities making modelling difficult for this reason when estimating conditional densities we should prioritize pml methods if there is strong knowledge about i the distribution function representing the variable of interest ii the functional form used to represent the non stationarity iii the covariates used to represent adequately the spatiotemporal variability of the variable of interest iv a simple relationship between the variable and covariates v a negligible effect of human activities on the variable and vi the need for a physical interpretation of the results meanwhile the use of npml methods should be prioritized if there are i no a priori knowledge of the underlying distribution form ii no a priori knowledge of the underlying nonstationary form and iii readily available environmental and climatic descriptors several or few explaining the spatiotemporal variability of the variable even without a priori knowledge on their predictive power credit authorship contribution statement claudie ratt√©

24174,understanding mechanisms affecting the renewal of populations is critical for species conservation and living resources management for fish species density dependant mechanisms occurring in young stages are particularly well studied the food limitation hypothesis assumes that the food availability is the main limiting factor for juveniles growth and survival in coastal and estuarine nurseries although some promising modelling methods appeared to test this hypothesis it remains debated because of a lack of a clear signal of food limitation we use a mechanistic approach based on deb dynamic energy budget theory to test the trophic limitation hypothesis from a metabolic point of view the energy intake of individuals is quantified given the experienced temperatures and measures of individuals length at age we reconstruct the food ingested in an inverse deb modelling then we further explore the potential of inverse deb modelling to describe in fine details the energy partitioning between the main metabolic processes i e maintenance maturation and growth of an individual and highlight periods of energy shortage indicating a trophic limitation as a case study we implemented this approach for the juveniles of common sole solea solea settled between 2000 and 2014 in the seine estuarine nursery our approach allowed to i quantify food assimilation and identify ii a decrease in the growth efficiency and iii the occurrence of nutritional stress both the decrease in growth and the periods of nutritional stress coincide with a decrease in individual specific food availability therefore the inverse deb approach is an interesting tool to test the food limitation hypothesis at the individual scale deb theory deepens and structures our knowledge on energy intake and energy use hence suggesting concrete indices of trophic limitation such as periods of non growing and nutritional stress due to starvation i e no food intake work on the parametrization of the deb model is progressing rapidly and our method can already be generalized to other fish species finally mechanistic description of food limitation using bioenergetic modelling helps better understanding the ecology of the species in a dynamic environment this may ultimately help going towards better species conservation and fisheries management keywords deb model energy partitioning estuaries flatfishes nutritional stress data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 the food limitation hypothesis in coastal and estuarine nurseries understanding mechanisms affecting the renewal of populations is critical for species conservation and living resources management for fish species we know that regulation factors occurring at larval and juvenile stages directly affect their recruitment i e when the young fishes reach the adult stock mainly through size selective maturation and size selective survival daewel et al 2011 van der veer et al 1994 the trophic limitation hypothesis assumes that the environment can supply only finite food resources restraining the number of individuals able to correctly develop grow and survive amara et al 2000 nash et al 2007 nunn et al 2012 trophic limitation might cause nutritional stress neill et al 1994 resulting in reduced growth and body condition meyer et al 2012 and ultimately in death many young fish including juvenile flatfishes concentrate in coastal and estuarine c e shallow waters to grow and mature before their recruitment indeed c e areas offer particular conditions e g high food supply protection against predation that allow them to act as nursery grounds for marine juvenile flatfishes often of fisheries interest le pape et al 2003 seitz et al 2014 however global changes affecting c e areas e g coastline modification or pollution may have led in numerous cases to a decline in their nursery function rochette et al 2010 van der veer et al 2022 during the last decade particular attention was drawn towards the hypothesis of trophic limitation for juvenile flatfishes in c e nurseries le pape and bonhommeau 2015 with growth reduction observed for juveniles in several areas across the north west atlantic cardoso et al 2016 freitas et al 2012 poiesz et al 2020 van der veer et al 2010 1 2 existing methods to identify a trophic limitation several approaches were proposed to test the trophic limitation hypothesis for juvenile fishes in c e nurseries leading to contrasting conclusions according to the review of le pape and bonhommeau 2015 when exploring this hypothesis at the individual scale most rejected it e g gilliers et al 2006 selleslagh and amara 2013 however variations in juvenile s condition were observed e g for the plaice ciotti et al 2014 and are likely related to starvation le pape and bonhommeau 2015 explain that in fact size selective mortality and size selective sampling might hide the effect of food limitation 1 small individuals in poor condition are more likely to be dead at the time of sampling and 2 they are likely less captured by the classic fishing gears on the other hand when focusing at the population scale studies mainly support the trophic limitation hypothesis indirect population scaled approaches revealed indicators of food limitation such as i food partitioning e g amara et al 2001 ii link between fishes distribution and energy availability at the individual scale e g nicolas et al 2007 or iii growth and condition reduction in comparison to optimal environments freitas et al 2012 van der veer et al 2010 therefore trophic limitation hypothesis is still discussed because of the lack of an obvious signal of food limitation occurring on surviving juveniles le pape and bonhommeau 2015 during the last years several authors used a direct population scaled approach to test the trophic limitation in c e nurseries at the juvenile fish community level based on the calculation of the exploitation efficiency ee day et al 2021 saulnier et al 2020 tableau et al 2019 this method consists in the assessment of a predation pressure through the calculation of a ratio between the food consumed by predators and the food supplied by prey collie 1987 vinagre and cabral 2008 food and thus energy consumed can be approached by a simple model as proposed by tableau et al 2019 the recent studies using this method support the trophic limitation hypothesis for juvenile flatfishes in the seine estuarine nursery mainly at the end of the growth period i e late summer and autumn day et al 2021 saulnier et al 2020 these latter approaches seem relevant and promising toward community level as they combine data at population and individual levels however they also come with multiple constraints first population scale growth rates distribution or energy consumption datasets are rarely available because of the time consuming field and laboratory works they require saulnier et al 2020 regarding the ee model of tableau et al 2019 it also requires a lot of work because of the need to consider the whole community of prey and predators tableau et al 2016 additionally energy consumption in this model is assumed proportional to growth ignoring energy requirements when growth is null finally the growth efficiency coefficient used to convert observed growth into energy consumption is constant in this model irrespective of environment variations such as temperature yet energy consumption might be very variable depending on the environment the season the size of the individual and the energy required for its maintenance kooijman 2010 therefore although modelling approaches largely improve our knowledge on prey availability for juvenile flatfishes in nursery grounds tableau et al 2019 testing the trophic limitation hypothesis requires new tools to assess individuals food intake and physiological condition in a dynamic environment ciotti et al 2014 1 3 the deb modelling to test the trophic limitation hypothesis dynamic energy budget deb theory is an integrative theory of energy allocation that describes and quantifies the metabolism of an individual over its whole lifecycle in varying environmental conditions i e temperature and food availability kooijman 2010 marques et al 2018 nisbet et al 2000 van der meer 2006 a powerful aspect of models based on deb theory deb models is also the possibility to back calculate energy ingestion based on experienced temperatures and observed growth patterns cardoso et al 2006 freitas et al 2009 2011 kooijman 2010 pecquerie et al 2012 this inverse deb modelling has been used to reconstruct time series of food availability and energy consumption for several bivalves species e g cardoso et al 2006 freitas et al 2009 lavaud et al 2019 also pecquerie et al 2012 used this method in order to study the capacity of otoliths data to provide more detailed information on the growth history of the individual and on the energy it assimilated in the field these studies showed that reconstructing energy ingestion using inverse deb modelling constitutes an original and relevant framework to learn more about fluctuations of resources available for the studied species as well as of their energy intake and use deb modelling might address the difficulties previously referred in the assessment of the trophic limitation in c e nurseries deb model considers that individuals consume energy even when they don t grow for their maintenance and maturation kooijman 2010 thus it allows a more accurate information on fishes energy intake through time than the ee model of tableau et al 2019 that considers a constant linear link between observed growth and energy consumption therefore inverse deb modelling might constitute a relevant tool to test the trophic limitation hypothesis for juvenile fishes in c e nurseries freitas et al 2011 used this approach to test trophic limitation hypothesis for the sand goby over the period of nursery residence their approach consisted in reconstructing the mean scaled food conditions over the lifetime of individuals by comparing the observed asymptotic length with the theoretical maximum one under unlimited food conditions we propose here to i apply the inverse deb modelling approach to a large dataset of growth trajectories of solea solea and ii go further in exploring the potential of deb models to detect nutritional stress periods in fish based on fine description of their energy partitioning we focus on the juveniles of the common sole solea solea in the seine estuarine nursery we first use inverse deb modelling to reconstruct the dynamic of individual specific food conditions in the nursery then we study the energy partitioning that is the distribution of mobilized energy between the different metabolic processes considered by the deb model i e maintenance growth and maturation under the experienced environmental conditions this method allows us to identify indices of trophic limitation such as growth reduction and periods of nutritional stress 2 material and methods 2 1 deb theory 2 1 1 state variables and fluxes deb theory describes and quantifies the metabolism of an individual through four state variables that are linked to mass and metabolic processes see fig 1 kooijman 2010 marques et al 2018 van der meer 2006 the reserve e j translates the available energy for metabolic processes such as growth maintenance development and reproduction in adults the structure v cm3 corresponds to the organism s somatic parts the maturity compartment e h quantifies the cumulated energy invested into development maturation finally the reproduction compartment e r j filled once the puberty starts allows the production of offspring here e r is fixed to zero as the study only concerns juveniles the state variables are supplied in energy at rates j d 1 that depend on environmental conditions i e temperature and food and on the state of the organism kooijman 2010 sousa et al 2010 van der meer 2006 before its birth the individual uses energy stocked into its reserve but does not assimilate energy from the moment it is born i e for fish the beginning of the exotrophic phase of the larvae the organism feeds and starts assimilating energy from its environment at a rate p a this assimilated energy fills the reserve compartment e from which it will be mobilized at a rate p c from the flow of mobilized energy a fraction k p c will be allocated to the growth of structure and the somatic maintenance a primary flow p m goes to the somatic maintenance while the remaining energy will go into growth p g the rest of the mobilized energy 1 Œ∫ p c will be allocated in priority to the maintenance of maturity p j and then to the maturity p r state variables and fluxes considered in the deb model are described in table 1 and fig 1 2 1 2 consideration of the environment in order to account for the effect of temperature on metabolic rates the parameters p a m v p m and k j are corrected by a temperature correction factor tc kooijman 2010 see appendix a for further information in the calculation of p a see table 1 the variable f is the scaled functional response kooijman 2010 and links the food density in the environment with the actual amount of energy ingested by the animal f allows the energy assimilation rate of the individual to be scaled in relation to the maximum one p am therefore it is usually considered between 0 and 1 with f 0 corresponding to a state of starvation i e no food intake and f 1 implying an assimilation rate that is equal to the theoretical maximum specific assimilation rate p am according to freitas et al 2011 f can be used as a proxy of the available food in the environment however the term individual specific here highlights that it translates apparent scaled food conditions for an individual and not to the whole amount of food available in the environment this is important as f is the integration of multiple factor including energy available in the environment but also intra and inter specific competition in other words it is related to the energy that can actually be ingested and then assimilated by an individual 2 1 3 calculating length over time given daily temperatures food availability and the species specific parameters of the model see appendix a deb theory can predict the individual structural length l which corresponds to v 1 3 when nutritional stress occurs energy mobilised is no longer sufficient to cover the somatic maintenance requirements i e Œ∫ p c p m in this case we consider that shrinking of structure is allowed to fulfil these somatic maintenance requirements implying that p g can be negative the mobilized energy is assumed to be equal to 1 Œ∫ g d v d t see table 1 with Œ∫ g the growth efficiency calculated as Œ∫ g d v q v e g mounier 2019 where d v q v and e g are the density energy density and cost per unit of structure see appendix a the physical length l w cm is calculated from the structural length and a shape coefficient Œ¥ assuming isomorphy and no contribution of reserve to physical length l w l Œ¥ shape coefficient Œ¥ is unitless and constant post metamorphosis according to mounier et al al 2020 it is important to note that a different structure to physical length relationship should be considered when shrinking happens however we decided to keep Œ¥ constant whether the individual is under nutritional stress of not as in augustine et al 2011 this allows simplifying our method and we consider that the results will not change significantly 2 2 implementing an inverse deb modelling to reconstruct food ingestion all the modelling steps of this study i e paragraphs 2 2 and 2 3 were implemented in r r core team 2021 and the integrated development environment ide r studio rstudio team 2020 as a first step we back calculated the scaled functional response f to assess the food ingested by individuals given the experienced temperatures and observed individuals length at age age of the fish is estimated in days post fertilization dpf assuming a unique fertilization date to better represent the temporal variability of food ingestion one f value was calculated for each period between two length observations and independently for individuals of each age class i e each cohort a cohort represents the individuals born in the same year thus for each period we estimated f by minimising the mean relative error mre between the observed lengths l and the lengths estimated using the deb model l for each time point i with an observation of the period 1 1 m r e 1 n i m m n l i l i l i 100 the optim function r core team 2021 with the method l bfgs b byrd et al 1995 was used to simplify this optimization step the observed lengths were averaged within each cohort and time point so that an average individual from each cohort is represented through the three years within the nursery fig 2 resumes our methodology for the back calculation of individual specific food conditions during the step of parametrization of the deb model the maximum assimilation rate p a m is determined by experiments or found in the literature in the present study during the optimization process we allowed f to take values greater than 1 while it is not classical in deb studies f values can be greater than 1 as long as f is not considered as an explicit functional response for a given food concentration but only as a proxy for the food in that context this implies that f embeds the uncertainty in both p x and p am considering that i the food quality in the nursery could be better than those used for calibrating the deb model and ii there is a possible genetic variability in p am between populations a f greater than 1 implies an assimilation rate superior to p a m this idea is supported by some observations in natura of growth rates higher than those simulated by the deb model for a f 1 e g for the bivalve macoma balthica in cardoso et al 2006 we therefore allow f to take values above 1 and limited it to a maximum of 2 this choice is supported by preliminary calculations of values of f that i are theoretically allowable and ii are already used for predictions showing satisfying fit of the model to the data for s solea amp solea solea version 2021 11 30 the final distribution of f values is visible in appendix d in order to facilitate the interpolation of f between two observations to get a daily value of f we assumed f constant during the period between two samplings see fig 2 2 3 simulate metabolism under experienced conditions 2 3 1 energy intake over time we simulated the metabolism of an average individual every day for the three years spent in the nursery under experienced temperatures for solea solea p a m is different between males and females see appendix a and therefore daily assimilated energy in a same environment varies between sexes however hereafter we adjusted a value of f from the same observed lengths independently for a male and a female then we averaged all the simulations to present the results for an average individual on the assumption that the observations are half from females and half from males the daily assimilated energy p a see table 1 actually corresponds to the daily consumed energy p x divided by a digestibility coefficient Œ∫ x fixed to generalized animal value mounier et al 2020 see appendix a therefore the daily consumed energy was calculated for an average individual as p x p a Œ∫ x 2 3 2 energy partitioning once the energy intake was calculated we studied the energy partitioning particularly in order to assess individuals growth capacity and to identify potential periods of nutritional stress to do so the absolute fluxes towards growth maturation maturity maintenance and somatic maintenance were calculated in kj day as well as the percentage of mobilized energy allocated to each metabolic process respectively 2 3 3 growth efficiency the variable that links growth with energy consumption is the growth efficiency coefficient k i e the quantity of energy required by the organism to allocate one energy unit into the structure the growth efficiency within deb theory is generally calculated as the ratio between the amount of energy fixed into structure and the amount of ingested energy p a Œ∫ x or p x however p c is used here instead of p a in order to avoid calculation issues due to possible null values of p a therefore the growth efficiency coefficient k is calculated as k p g k g p c k x p g is the quantity of energy daily allocated to growth corrected by Œ∫ g i e growth efficiency in order to consider the energy that is actually fixed into structure p c is the daily quantity of mobilized energy and is divided by Œ∫ x digestibility coefficient see appendix a in order to approximate the daily quantity of consumed energy 2 4 case study the common sole in the seine estuarine nursery 2 4 1 study site to illustrate our proposal we used the case study of the juveniles of common sole solea solea in the seine estuarine nursery the seine estuary is located on the north west french coast and opens up in the english channel fig 3 the seine nursery covers a subtidal shallow area of 360 km¬≤ characterized by a mean depth of 8 2 m and muddy fine sand sediments billen et al 2001 2 4 2 data the common sole is a bentho demersal flatfish of fishery interest found in the muddy and shallow habitats of the atlantic ocean as well as in the black and mediterranean seas within the nursery juveniles mainly live in intertidal and subtidal mudflats where they feed on benthic meiofauna and macrofauna mainly copepods shellfish and polychaetes gibson et al 2014 morat 2011 fish data were provided by the cellule de suivi du littoral normand clsn research projects capes and modhanour from an historic beam trawling survey conducted between 2000 and 2014 in the seine estuary every month or two months juvenile fish were sampled and measured in several stations in the estuary fig 3 the age class to which the individuals belonged i e g0 for the individuals born in the year g1 for the ones born one year before the sampling or g2 for the ones born two years before the sampling was also identified via gaussian fitting on the size spectra and provided by the institut fran√ßais de recherche pour l exploitation de la mer ifremer the birthdate was fixed on february 1st for all juveniles satellite based sst sea surface temperature observations were extracted from pathfinder 1998 2009 ostia 2010 and odyssea 2011 2014 products to construct 1998 2014 time series the observations were re interpolated over a regular grid with 2 5 2 5 km cells and averaged over the outer seine estuary on a daily scale see appendix b for further information on the temperature data concerning the implementation of the deb model for the sole we used the sets of deb parameters calibrated by mounier et al 2020 for males and females see appendix a 3 results 3 1 energy intake over time from the experienced temperatures individual specific food conditions were reconstructed to adjust to observed growth data fig 4 the fit of the reconstructed growth trajectories with the observed growth data for each cohort separately is shown in appendix d we simulated the daily energy consumption of juveniles within the nursery fig 5 the daily energy consumption increases with the age of the average individual in addition a seasonal pattern can be observed with a high decrease of energy consumption at the end of the growth season of the common soles i e late summer autumn the breaks observed in the values of energy consumption are the consequence of keeping a relative food condition constant between each observation i e the average relative food condition for an entire time period between two observations 3 2 dynamic of growth efficiency the growth efficiency coefficient estimated by the deb shows a dynamic pattern dependant of the age and the seasons fig 6 the growth efficiency coefficient is overall decreasing over time with older individuals investing relatively less assimilated energy in growth compared to young individuals in late spring the coefficient increases while in autumn and winter it tends to decrease for all age classes with even negative growth coefficients observed for some cohorts in opposition the growth efficiency coefficient proposed by day et al 2021 for soles based on the model of ee tableau et al 2019 is constant over season and age blue line in fig 6 during the first two years in the nursery approximately between 90 and 730 dpf the deb model predicts a growth efficiency coefficient that is generally higher than the one considered in the model of ee while the opposite is observed during the last year between 730 and 970 3 3 link between growth efficiency and relative food availability the mean scaled functional response i e individual specific food availability shows also a seasonal trend with highest values in summer and lowest in winter even null values fig 7 regarding the link between growth efficiency and the scaled functional response it appears that periods of shrinking i e when the growth efficiency is negative correspond to periods when the scaled functional response is null or very low or days following this period fig 7 3 4 energy partitioning our method allows studying energy partitioning between the main metabolic processes considered by the deb model i e growth maturation and maintenance processes through time independently for each cohort the study of the absolute fluxes kj day towards each metabolic process fig 8 clearly shows the temporal variability of the energetic fluxes with very low total energy budget from late autumn to early spring a decrease in the percentage of energy allocated to the growth during late summer autumn around 250 dpf and around 800 dpf is also observed fig 9 even with some moments with no energy allocated to growth figs 8 9 the decrease in energy allocation to growth is actually due to the increase in the proportion of maintenance processes to the total energy budget mainly the somatic maintenance fig 9 also during the end of summer autumn the cumulative percentage of the energy allocated to the main metabolic processes considered in the deb model exceeds 100 suggesting a period of high nutritional stress for juveniles during some years 4 discussion 4 1 highlights this study applies a bioenergetic approach based on deb theory to i investigate the potential of deb model to highlight nutritional stresses for individuals and ii test the trophic limitation hypothesis for juvenile soles from a metabolic point of view we reconstructed the scaled functional response i e the individual specific food availability from observed growth patterns and the daily temperature experienced by the individuals using inverse deb modelling although f corresponds to the food actually ingested by the individual it takes into account food density but also competition it can be used as a proxy of food conditions available in the environment freitas et al 2011 classic estimations of food availability require extensive samplings of the benthic ecosystem identification of potential prey and hypotheses on their energetic density provided that the model parameters are available and reliable our method is time and cost efficient while accounting for temperature changes over time this approach allows also describing in an accurate and dynamic way the energy assimilation and energy partitioning for an individual over time under the experienced environmental conditions but also in new environments such as those expected in the context of global warming finally our approach allows identifying periods of nutritional stress consequence of trophic limitation altogether our method supports the hypothesis of trophic limitation during autumn in the seine estuary and can help predict energetic needs in marine nurseries and associated ecological consequences 4 2 food ingestion dynamics from observed growth trajectories the energy consumption of organisms is particularly difficult to assess because it depends on several physiological and environmental factors as well as on the life stage of the individual kooijman 2010 the quantitative study of the individual specific food availability allowed at a daily scale by the inverse deb modelling may interestingly complement other feeding approaches stable isotopes and gut contents analyses that can give insights of quantitative contributions of source and prey but not at a fine temporal resolution the back calculation of food ingestion and assimilation from growth patterns has already been used for the bay of biscay anchovies engraulis encrasicolus pecquerie et al 2012 as well as to test trophic limitation hypothesis for the sand goby over the period of nursery residence freitas et al 2011 however pecquerie et al 2012 did not use the temperatures really experienced by the fish reducing the precision of the calculation of the food ingestion in addition the method used in freitas et al 2011 allowed to reconstruct the average individual specific food conditions over the entire lifespan based on maximum sizes of fish we have the capacity with our method to describe fluctuations in the individuals energy consumption the decrease in energy consumption in late summer autumn might be related to the combined effects of i the still high temperatures and ii the decrease in individual specific food availability see fig 7 this first result showing the reconstructed food ingestion is important because energy consumption of individuals is one of the main factors that allow understanding the trophic limitation and deb model directly links energy consumption with individual specific food availability furthermore the quantitative knowledge on feeding history is essential for the study of the energy partitioning made in this study 4 3 studying energy partitioning to understand the trophic limitation from a metabolic point of view 4 3 1 energy allocated to growth deb theory deeply structures our knowledge on energy partitioning particularly between maintenance and growth during fish s entire life cycle including first life stages kooijman 2010 van der meer 2006 a deb model considers that the individual consumes energy even when it does not grow to maintain its organism and to mature the increase with the age of energy requirement for maintenance processes is the consequence of a maintenance proportional to the volume v and maturity of the organism while assimilated energy is proportional to v2 3 see table 1 this leads to a decrease over time of the growth efficiency coefficient this coefficient is also affected by seasonal cycle with a decrease of relative energy allocated towards growth in late summer autumn this decrease coincides with an increase in the proportion of somatic maintenance processes to the total energy budget fig 9 however more work is needed in order to investigate whether this increase of proportion of energy allocated to the somatic maintenance is due to i an increase in the absolute maintenance requirements possibly linked to environmental conditions or ii to the observed decrease in the energy assimilation fig 5 in the latter case the observed seasonal decrease in energy allocated towards growth could be an index of trophic limitation indeed if the individual cannot assimilate enough energy it allocates in priority energy to maintenances rather than growth and this phenomenon is taken into account in deb theory kooijman 2010 4 3 2 nutritional stress the study of energy partitioning over time shows that for multiple years the amount of energy theoretically allocated to the metabolic compartment exceeds periodically the energy the fish can mobilize from its environment fig 9 this result indicates a potential nutritional stress the average individual is not able to mobilize sufficient energy from its food to balance energetic needs for maintenance in this case deb theory allows to mobilize energy from the individual s structure kooijman 2001 this is possible via processes of shrinking observed when k i e growth efficiency coefficient is negative our results show that these periods of shrinking correspond to periods when the f value i e individual specific food availability is very low fig 7 during a few days just after a period of low individual specific food availability k can remain negative even if the mean value of f has risen we interpret this by a little delay time after a nutritional stress before the individual can re allocate energy into growth these periods of nutritional stress can reflect critical trophic limitation periods in late summer autumn this is coherent with the results of previous studies on the seine estuarine nursery that identify this phenomenon at the same period of the year day et al 2021 saulnier et al 2020 4 4 limits and perspectives some authors discuss the use of growth data for estimation of trophic limitation of nursery le pape and bonhommeau 2015 indeed this implies the risk to overestimate the growth hence energy consumption of individuals because of i apparent growth rates of only survival fish and in this case study ii selectivity of the beam trawl or ii omitted immigration and emigration processes bigger fish might migrate to deeper areas however if indices of trophic limitation are visible regarding larger individuals we can assume that this will be even more the case for small individuals another limit of our method could be the fitting of the lengths estimated by the deb model with length at age data obtained with a fixed birthdate it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the birthdate on the results indeed the spawning period and thus the timing of colonization of estuaries by young stages are variable amongst sub populations depending on environmental conditions amara et al 2000 moreover our approach considers two major environmental factors i e temperature and food availability on the individual s metabolism however other environmental factors affected by global change may influence species energetic needs for example oxygen availability gibson 1994 or pollution mounier et al 2020 constitute stressors that might modify fish s metabolism including energy assimilation sadoul and vijayan 2016 this is particularly true in coastal nurseries where organisms are subjected to important environmental gradients and rapid human induced changes mclusky and elliott 2004 we assumed here that the f reconstructed using the method presented in this paper can be used to explore the potential trophic limitation of nursery grounds as it is to some extent representative of the average overall food conditions in the nursery this is all the more relevant that preliminary results in this direction show for instance that there is a significant and positive link between the mean annual values of the scaled functional response all individuals considered and the mean annual values of the scaled functional response for each age class g0 g1 and g2 see appendix e however although we didn t highlight differences between age classes that could be interpreted in terms of competition for instance a more in depth year to year comparison of results of individual specific energy availability and energy partitioning by age class combined with data of environmental conditions i e temperature juveniles abundance leading to competition and prey production will substantially improve our understanding of trophic limitation we carried out this study on an average individual of each cohort as the aim was to investigate the potential of deb models to reconstruct energy ingestion and highlight nutritional stresses for individuals however the use of this method to simulate several individuals will be particularly interesting allowing to i consider inter individual variations e g in p a m and ii to extrapolate our results at the population scale e g by including a probability to die when a nutritional stress occurs which was not done here it would also be interesting to generalize the method to other study sites and to explore how other species belonging to the juvenile fish community can be considered together to conclude our method based on the study of energy intake and energy partitioning at an individual scale responds to some difficulties raised in the concrete identification of signs of a trophic limitation for organisms ciotti et al 2014 le pape and bonhommeau 2015 we showed that it is possible with our method to assess individual s food intake from their observed lengths and results of energy partitioning put forward indices of trophic limitation such as growth reduction and periods of nutritional stress being able to identify periods of non growing and nutritional stress is also interesting in the context of species conservation and fisheries management as it extends our knowledge on underlying processes that affect fish populations renewal hence dynamic all this will give a better insight of the nurseries functioning and its evolution data availability

24174,understanding mechanisms affecting the renewal of populations is critical for species conservation and living resources management for fish species density dependant mechanisms occurring in young stages are particularly well studied the food limitation hypothesis assumes that the food availability is the main limiting factor for juveniles growth and survival in coastal and estuarine nurseries although some promising modelling methods appeared to test this hypothesis it remains debated because of a lack of a clear signal of food limitation we use a mechanistic approach based on deb dynamic energy budget theory to test the trophic limitation hypothesis from a metabolic point of view the energy intake of individuals is quantified given the experienced temperatures and measures of individuals length at age we reconstruct the food ingested in an inverse deb modelling then we further explore the potential of inverse deb modelling to describe in fine details the energy partitioning between the main metabolic processes i e maintenance maturation and growth of an individual and highlight periods of energy shortage indicating a trophic limitation as a case study we implemented this approach for the juveniles of common sole solea solea settled between 2000 and 2014 in the seine estuarine nursery our approach allowed to i quantify food assimilation and identify ii a decrease in the growth efficiency and iii the occurrence of nutritional stress both the decrease in growth and the periods of nutritional stress coincide with a decrease in individual specific food availability therefore the inverse deb approach is an interesting tool to test the food limitation hypothesis at the individual scale deb theory deepens and structures our knowledge on energy intake and energy use hence suggesting concrete indices of trophic limitation such as periods of non growing and nutritional stress due to starvation i e no food intake work on the parametrization of the deb model is progressing rapidly and our method can already be generalized to other fish species finally mechanistic description of food limitation using bioenergetic modelling helps better understanding the ecology of the species in a dynamic environment this may ultimately help going towards better species conservation and fisheries management keywords deb model energy partitioning estuaries flatfishes nutritional stress data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction 1 1 the food limitation hypothesis in coastal and estuarine nurseries understanding mechanisms affecting the renewal of populations is critical for species conservation and living resources management for fish species we know that regulation factors occurring at larval and juvenile stages directly affect their recruitment i e when the young fishes reach the adult stock mainly through size selective maturation and size selective survival daewel et al 2011 van der veer et al 1994 the trophic limitation hypothesis assumes that the environment can supply only finite food resources restraining the number of individuals able to correctly develop grow and survive amara et al 2000 nash et al 2007 nunn et al 2012 trophic limitation might cause nutritional stress neill et al 1994 resulting in reduced growth and body condition meyer et al 2012 and ultimately in death many young fish including juvenile flatfishes concentrate in coastal and estuarine c e shallow waters to grow and mature before their recruitment indeed c e areas offer particular conditions e g high food supply protection against predation that allow them to act as nursery grounds for marine juvenile flatfishes often of fisheries interest le pape et al 2003 seitz et al 2014 however global changes affecting c e areas e g coastline modification or pollution may have led in numerous cases to a decline in their nursery function rochette et al 2010 van der veer et al 2022 during the last decade particular attention was drawn towards the hypothesis of trophic limitation for juvenile flatfishes in c e nurseries le pape and bonhommeau 2015 with growth reduction observed for juveniles in several areas across the north west atlantic cardoso et al 2016 freitas et al 2012 poiesz et al 2020 van der veer et al 2010 1 2 existing methods to identify a trophic limitation several approaches were proposed to test the trophic limitation hypothesis for juvenile fishes in c e nurseries leading to contrasting conclusions according to the review of le pape and bonhommeau 2015 when exploring this hypothesis at the individual scale most rejected it e g gilliers et al 2006 selleslagh and amara 2013 however variations in juvenile s condition were observed e g for the plaice ciotti et al 2014 and are likely related to starvation le pape and bonhommeau 2015 explain that in fact size selective mortality and size selective sampling might hide the effect of food limitation 1 small individuals in poor condition are more likely to be dead at the time of sampling and 2 they are likely less captured by the classic fishing gears on the other hand when focusing at the population scale studies mainly support the trophic limitation hypothesis indirect population scaled approaches revealed indicators of food limitation such as i food partitioning e g amara et al 2001 ii link between fishes distribution and energy availability at the individual scale e g nicolas et al 2007 or iii growth and condition reduction in comparison to optimal environments freitas et al 2012 van der veer et al 2010 therefore trophic limitation hypothesis is still discussed because of the lack of an obvious signal of food limitation occurring on surviving juveniles le pape and bonhommeau 2015 during the last years several authors used a direct population scaled approach to test the trophic limitation in c e nurseries at the juvenile fish community level based on the calculation of the exploitation efficiency ee day et al 2021 saulnier et al 2020 tableau et al 2019 this method consists in the assessment of a predation pressure through the calculation of a ratio between the food consumed by predators and the food supplied by prey collie 1987 vinagre and cabral 2008 food and thus energy consumed can be approached by a simple model as proposed by tableau et al 2019 the recent studies using this method support the trophic limitation hypothesis for juvenile flatfishes in the seine estuarine nursery mainly at the end of the growth period i e late summer and autumn day et al 2021 saulnier et al 2020 these latter approaches seem relevant and promising toward community level as they combine data at population and individual levels however they also come with multiple constraints first population scale growth rates distribution or energy consumption datasets are rarely available because of the time consuming field and laboratory works they require saulnier et al 2020 regarding the ee model of tableau et al 2019 it also requires a lot of work because of the need to consider the whole community of prey and predators tableau et al 2016 additionally energy consumption in this model is assumed proportional to growth ignoring energy requirements when growth is null finally the growth efficiency coefficient used to convert observed growth into energy consumption is constant in this model irrespective of environment variations such as temperature yet energy consumption might be very variable depending on the environment the season the size of the individual and the energy required for its maintenance kooijman 2010 therefore although modelling approaches largely improve our knowledge on prey availability for juvenile flatfishes in nursery grounds tableau et al 2019 testing the trophic limitation hypothesis requires new tools to assess individuals food intake and physiological condition in a dynamic environment ciotti et al 2014 1 3 the deb modelling to test the trophic limitation hypothesis dynamic energy budget deb theory is an integrative theory of energy allocation that describes and quantifies the metabolism of an individual over its whole lifecycle in varying environmental conditions i e temperature and food availability kooijman 2010 marques et al 2018 nisbet et al 2000 van der meer 2006 a powerful aspect of models based on deb theory deb models is also the possibility to back calculate energy ingestion based on experienced temperatures and observed growth patterns cardoso et al 2006 freitas et al 2009 2011 kooijman 2010 pecquerie et al 2012 this inverse deb modelling has been used to reconstruct time series of food availability and energy consumption for several bivalves species e g cardoso et al 2006 freitas et al 2009 lavaud et al 2019 also pecquerie et al 2012 used this method in order to study the capacity of otoliths data to provide more detailed information on the growth history of the individual and on the energy it assimilated in the field these studies showed that reconstructing energy ingestion using inverse deb modelling constitutes an original and relevant framework to learn more about fluctuations of resources available for the studied species as well as of their energy intake and use deb modelling might address the difficulties previously referred in the assessment of the trophic limitation in c e nurseries deb model considers that individuals consume energy even when they don t grow for their maintenance and maturation kooijman 2010 thus it allows a more accurate information on fishes energy intake through time than the ee model of tableau et al 2019 that considers a constant linear link between observed growth and energy consumption therefore inverse deb modelling might constitute a relevant tool to test the trophic limitation hypothesis for juvenile fishes in c e nurseries freitas et al 2011 used this approach to test trophic limitation hypothesis for the sand goby over the period of nursery residence their approach consisted in reconstructing the mean scaled food conditions over the lifetime of individuals by comparing the observed asymptotic length with the theoretical maximum one under unlimited food conditions we propose here to i apply the inverse deb modelling approach to a large dataset of growth trajectories of solea solea and ii go further in exploring the potential of deb models to detect nutritional stress periods in fish based on fine description of their energy partitioning we focus on the juveniles of the common sole solea solea in the seine estuarine nursery we first use inverse deb modelling to reconstruct the dynamic of individual specific food conditions in the nursery then we study the energy partitioning that is the distribution of mobilized energy between the different metabolic processes considered by the deb model i e maintenance growth and maturation under the experienced environmental conditions this method allows us to identify indices of trophic limitation such as growth reduction and periods of nutritional stress 2 material and methods 2 1 deb theory 2 1 1 state variables and fluxes deb theory describes and quantifies the metabolism of an individual through four state variables that are linked to mass and metabolic processes see fig 1 kooijman 2010 marques et al 2018 van der meer 2006 the reserve e j translates the available energy for metabolic processes such as growth maintenance development and reproduction in adults the structure v cm3 corresponds to the organism s somatic parts the maturity compartment e h quantifies the cumulated energy invested into development maturation finally the reproduction compartment e r j filled once the puberty starts allows the production of offspring here e r is fixed to zero as the study only concerns juveniles the state variables are supplied in energy at rates j d 1 that depend on environmental conditions i e temperature and food and on the state of the organism kooijman 2010 sousa et al 2010 van der meer 2006 before its birth the individual uses energy stocked into its reserve but does not assimilate energy from the moment it is born i e for fish the beginning of the exotrophic phase of the larvae the organism feeds and starts assimilating energy from its environment at a rate p a this assimilated energy fills the reserve compartment e from which it will be mobilized at a rate p c from the flow of mobilized energy a fraction k p c will be allocated to the growth of structure and the somatic maintenance a primary flow p m goes to the somatic maintenance while the remaining energy will go into growth p g the rest of the mobilized energy 1 Œ∫ p c will be allocated in priority to the maintenance of maturity p j and then to the maturity p r state variables and fluxes considered in the deb model are described in table 1 and fig 1 2 1 2 consideration of the environment in order to account for the effect of temperature on metabolic rates the parameters p a m v p m and k j are corrected by a temperature correction factor tc kooijman 2010 see appendix a for further information in the calculation of p a see table 1 the variable f is the scaled functional response kooijman 2010 and links the food density in the environment with the actual amount of energy ingested by the animal f allows the energy assimilation rate of the individual to be scaled in relation to the maximum one p am therefore it is usually considered between 0 and 1 with f 0 corresponding to a state of starvation i e no food intake and f 1 implying an assimilation rate that is equal to the theoretical maximum specific assimilation rate p am according to freitas et al 2011 f can be used as a proxy of the available food in the environment however the term individual specific here highlights that it translates apparent scaled food conditions for an individual and not to the whole amount of food available in the environment this is important as f is the integration of multiple factor including energy available in the environment but also intra and inter specific competition in other words it is related to the energy that can actually be ingested and then assimilated by an individual 2 1 3 calculating length over time given daily temperatures food availability and the species specific parameters of the model see appendix a deb theory can predict the individual structural length l which corresponds to v 1 3 when nutritional stress occurs energy mobilised is no longer sufficient to cover the somatic maintenance requirements i e Œ∫ p c p m in this case we consider that shrinking of structure is allowed to fulfil these somatic maintenance requirements implying that p g can be negative the mobilized energy is assumed to be equal to 1 Œ∫ g d v d t see table 1 with Œ∫ g the growth efficiency calculated as Œ∫ g d v q v e g mounier 2019 where d v q v and e g are the density energy density and cost per unit of structure see appendix a the physical length l w cm is calculated from the structural length and a shape coefficient Œ¥ assuming isomorphy and no contribution of reserve to physical length l w l Œ¥ shape coefficient Œ¥ is unitless and constant post metamorphosis according to mounier et al al 2020 it is important to note that a different structure to physical length relationship should be considered when shrinking happens however we decided to keep Œ¥ constant whether the individual is under nutritional stress of not as in augustine et al 2011 this allows simplifying our method and we consider that the results will not change significantly 2 2 implementing an inverse deb modelling to reconstruct food ingestion all the modelling steps of this study i e paragraphs 2 2 and 2 3 were implemented in r r core team 2021 and the integrated development environment ide r studio rstudio team 2020 as a first step we back calculated the scaled functional response f to assess the food ingested by individuals given the experienced temperatures and observed individuals length at age age of the fish is estimated in days post fertilization dpf assuming a unique fertilization date to better represent the temporal variability of food ingestion one f value was calculated for each period between two length observations and independently for individuals of each age class i e each cohort a cohort represents the individuals born in the same year thus for each period we estimated f by minimising the mean relative error mre between the observed lengths l and the lengths estimated using the deb model l for each time point i with an observation of the period 1 1 m r e 1 n i m m n l i l i l i 100 the optim function r core team 2021 with the method l bfgs b byrd et al 1995 was used to simplify this optimization step the observed lengths were averaged within each cohort and time point so that an average individual from each cohort is represented through the three years within the nursery fig 2 resumes our methodology for the back calculation of individual specific food conditions during the step of parametrization of the deb model the maximum assimilation rate p a m is determined by experiments or found in the literature in the present study during the optimization process we allowed f to take values greater than 1 while it is not classical in deb studies f values can be greater than 1 as long as f is not considered as an explicit functional response for a given food concentration but only as a proxy for the food in that context this implies that f embeds the uncertainty in both p x and p am considering that i the food quality in the nursery could be better than those used for calibrating the deb model and ii there is a possible genetic variability in p am between populations a f greater than 1 implies an assimilation rate superior to p a m this idea is supported by some observations in natura of growth rates higher than those simulated by the deb model for a f 1 e g for the bivalve macoma balthica in cardoso et al 2006 we therefore allow f to take values above 1 and limited it to a maximum of 2 this choice is supported by preliminary calculations of values of f that i are theoretically allowable and ii are already used for predictions showing satisfying fit of the model to the data for s solea amp solea solea version 2021 11 30 the final distribution of f values is visible in appendix d in order to facilitate the interpolation of f between two observations to get a daily value of f we assumed f constant during the period between two samplings see fig 2 2 3 simulate metabolism under experienced conditions 2 3 1 energy intake over time we simulated the metabolism of an average individual every day for the three years spent in the nursery under experienced temperatures for solea solea p a m is different between males and females see appendix a and therefore daily assimilated energy in a same environment varies between sexes however hereafter we adjusted a value of f from the same observed lengths independently for a male and a female then we averaged all the simulations to present the results for an average individual on the assumption that the observations are half from females and half from males the daily assimilated energy p a see table 1 actually corresponds to the daily consumed energy p x divided by a digestibility coefficient Œ∫ x fixed to generalized animal value mounier et al 2020 see appendix a therefore the daily consumed energy was calculated for an average individual as p x p a Œ∫ x 2 3 2 energy partitioning once the energy intake was calculated we studied the energy partitioning particularly in order to assess individuals growth capacity and to identify potential periods of nutritional stress to do so the absolute fluxes towards growth maturation maturity maintenance and somatic maintenance were calculated in kj day as well as the percentage of mobilized energy allocated to each metabolic process respectively 2 3 3 growth efficiency the variable that links growth with energy consumption is the growth efficiency coefficient k i e the quantity of energy required by the organism to allocate one energy unit into the structure the growth efficiency within deb theory is generally calculated as the ratio between the amount of energy fixed into structure and the amount of ingested energy p a Œ∫ x or p x however p c is used here instead of p a in order to avoid calculation issues due to possible null values of p a therefore the growth efficiency coefficient k is calculated as k p g k g p c k x p g is the quantity of energy daily allocated to growth corrected by Œ∫ g i e growth efficiency in order to consider the energy that is actually fixed into structure p c is the daily quantity of mobilized energy and is divided by Œ∫ x digestibility coefficient see appendix a in order to approximate the daily quantity of consumed energy 2 4 case study the common sole in the seine estuarine nursery 2 4 1 study site to illustrate our proposal we used the case study of the juveniles of common sole solea solea in the seine estuarine nursery the seine estuary is located on the north west french coast and opens up in the english channel fig 3 the seine nursery covers a subtidal shallow area of 360 km¬≤ characterized by a mean depth of 8 2 m and muddy fine sand sediments billen et al 2001 2 4 2 data the common sole is a bentho demersal flatfish of fishery interest found in the muddy and shallow habitats of the atlantic ocean as well as in the black and mediterranean seas within the nursery juveniles mainly live in intertidal and subtidal mudflats where they feed on benthic meiofauna and macrofauna mainly copepods shellfish and polychaetes gibson et al 2014 morat 2011 fish data were provided by the cellule de suivi du littoral normand clsn research projects capes and modhanour from an historic beam trawling survey conducted between 2000 and 2014 in the seine estuary every month or two months juvenile fish were sampled and measured in several stations in the estuary fig 3 the age class to which the individuals belonged i e g0 for the individuals born in the year g1 for the ones born one year before the sampling or g2 for the ones born two years before the sampling was also identified via gaussian fitting on the size spectra and provided by the institut fran√ßais de recherche pour l exploitation de la mer ifremer the birthdate was fixed on february 1st for all juveniles satellite based sst sea surface temperature observations were extracted from pathfinder 1998 2009 ostia 2010 and odyssea 2011 2014 products to construct 1998 2014 time series the observations were re interpolated over a regular grid with 2 5 2 5 km cells and averaged over the outer seine estuary on a daily scale see appendix b for further information on the temperature data concerning the implementation of the deb model for the sole we used the sets of deb parameters calibrated by mounier et al 2020 for males and females see appendix a 3 results 3 1 energy intake over time from the experienced temperatures individual specific food conditions were reconstructed to adjust to observed growth data fig 4 the fit of the reconstructed growth trajectories with the observed growth data for each cohort separately is shown in appendix d we simulated the daily energy consumption of juveniles within the nursery fig 5 the daily energy consumption increases with the age of the average individual in addition a seasonal pattern can be observed with a high decrease of energy consumption at the end of the growth season of the common soles i e late summer autumn the breaks observed in the values of energy consumption are the consequence of keeping a relative food condition constant between each observation i e the average relative food condition for an entire time period between two observations 3 2 dynamic of growth efficiency the growth efficiency coefficient estimated by the deb shows a dynamic pattern dependant of the age and the seasons fig 6 the growth efficiency coefficient is overall decreasing over time with older individuals investing relatively less assimilated energy in growth compared to young individuals in late spring the coefficient increases while in autumn and winter it tends to decrease for all age classes with even negative growth coefficients observed for some cohorts in opposition the growth efficiency coefficient proposed by day et al 2021 for soles based on the model of ee tableau et al 2019 is constant over season and age blue line in fig 6 during the first two years in the nursery approximately between 90 and 730 dpf the deb model predicts a growth efficiency coefficient that is generally higher than the one considered in the model of ee while the opposite is observed during the last year between 730 and 970 3 3 link between growth efficiency and relative food availability the mean scaled functional response i e individual specific food availability shows also a seasonal trend with highest values in summer and lowest in winter even null values fig 7 regarding the link between growth efficiency and the scaled functional response it appears that periods of shrinking i e when the growth efficiency is negative correspond to periods when the scaled functional response is null or very low or days following this period fig 7 3 4 energy partitioning our method allows studying energy partitioning between the main metabolic processes considered by the deb model i e growth maturation and maintenance processes through time independently for each cohort the study of the absolute fluxes kj day towards each metabolic process fig 8 clearly shows the temporal variability of the energetic fluxes with very low total energy budget from late autumn to early spring a decrease in the percentage of energy allocated to the growth during late summer autumn around 250 dpf and around 800 dpf is also observed fig 9 even with some moments with no energy allocated to growth figs 8 9 the decrease in energy allocation to growth is actually due to the increase in the proportion of maintenance processes to the total energy budget mainly the somatic maintenance fig 9 also during the end of summer autumn the cumulative percentage of the energy allocated to the main metabolic processes considered in the deb model exceeds 100 suggesting a period of high nutritional stress for juveniles during some years 4 discussion 4 1 highlights this study applies a bioenergetic approach based on deb theory to i investigate the potential of deb model to highlight nutritional stresses for individuals and ii test the trophic limitation hypothesis for juvenile soles from a metabolic point of view we reconstructed the scaled functional response i e the individual specific food availability from observed growth patterns and the daily temperature experienced by the individuals using inverse deb modelling although f corresponds to the food actually ingested by the individual it takes into account food density but also competition it can be used as a proxy of food conditions available in the environment freitas et al 2011 classic estimations of food availability require extensive samplings of the benthic ecosystem identification of potential prey and hypotheses on their energetic density provided that the model parameters are available and reliable our method is time and cost efficient while accounting for temperature changes over time this approach allows also describing in an accurate and dynamic way the energy assimilation and energy partitioning for an individual over time under the experienced environmental conditions but also in new environments such as those expected in the context of global warming finally our approach allows identifying periods of nutritional stress consequence of trophic limitation altogether our method supports the hypothesis of trophic limitation during autumn in the seine estuary and can help predict energetic needs in marine nurseries and associated ecological consequences 4 2 food ingestion dynamics from observed growth trajectories the energy consumption of organisms is particularly difficult to assess because it depends on several physiological and environmental factors as well as on the life stage of the individual kooijman 2010 the quantitative study of the individual specific food availability allowed at a daily scale by the inverse deb modelling may interestingly complement other feeding approaches stable isotopes and gut contents analyses that can give insights of quantitative contributions of source and prey but not at a fine temporal resolution the back calculation of food ingestion and assimilation from growth patterns has already been used for the bay of biscay anchovies engraulis encrasicolus pecquerie et al 2012 as well as to test trophic limitation hypothesis for the sand goby over the period of nursery residence freitas et al 2011 however pecquerie et al 2012 did not use the temperatures really experienced by the fish reducing the precision of the calculation of the food ingestion in addition the method used in freitas et al 2011 allowed to reconstruct the average individual specific food conditions over the entire lifespan based on maximum sizes of fish we have the capacity with our method to describe fluctuations in the individuals energy consumption the decrease in energy consumption in late summer autumn might be related to the combined effects of i the still high temperatures and ii the decrease in individual specific food availability see fig 7 this first result showing the reconstructed food ingestion is important because energy consumption of individuals is one of the main factors that allow understanding the trophic limitation and deb model directly links energy consumption with individual specific food availability furthermore the quantitative knowledge on feeding history is essential for the study of the energy partitioning made in this study 4 3 studying energy partitioning to understand the trophic limitation from a metabolic point of view 4 3 1 energy allocated to growth deb theory deeply structures our knowledge on energy partitioning particularly between maintenance and growth during fish s entire life cycle including first life stages kooijman 2010 van der meer 2006 a deb model considers that the individual consumes energy even when it does not grow to maintain its organism and to mature the increase with the age of energy requirement for maintenance processes is the consequence of a maintenance proportional to the volume v and maturity of the organism while assimilated energy is proportional to v2 3 see table 1 this leads to a decrease over time of the growth efficiency coefficient this coefficient is also affected by seasonal cycle with a decrease of relative energy allocated towards growth in late summer autumn this decrease coincides with an increase in the proportion of somatic maintenance processes to the total energy budget fig 9 however more work is needed in order to investigate whether this increase of proportion of energy allocated to the somatic maintenance is due to i an increase in the absolute maintenance requirements possibly linked to environmental conditions or ii to the observed decrease in the energy assimilation fig 5 in the latter case the observed seasonal decrease in energy allocated towards growth could be an index of trophic limitation indeed if the individual cannot assimilate enough energy it allocates in priority energy to maintenances rather than growth and this phenomenon is taken into account in deb theory kooijman 2010 4 3 2 nutritional stress the study of energy partitioning over time shows that for multiple years the amount of energy theoretically allocated to the metabolic compartment exceeds periodically the energy the fish can mobilize from its environment fig 9 this result indicates a potential nutritional stress the average individual is not able to mobilize sufficient energy from its food to balance energetic needs for maintenance in this case deb theory allows to mobilize energy from the individual s structure kooijman 2001 this is possible via processes of shrinking observed when k i e growth efficiency coefficient is negative our results show that these periods of shrinking correspond to periods when the f value i e individual specific food availability is very low fig 7 during a few days just after a period of low individual specific food availability k can remain negative even if the mean value of f has risen we interpret this by a little delay time after a nutritional stress before the individual can re allocate energy into growth these periods of nutritional stress can reflect critical trophic limitation periods in late summer autumn this is coherent with the results of previous studies on the seine estuarine nursery that identify this phenomenon at the same period of the year day et al 2021 saulnier et al 2020 4 4 limits and perspectives some authors discuss the use of growth data for estimation of trophic limitation of nursery le pape and bonhommeau 2015 indeed this implies the risk to overestimate the growth hence energy consumption of individuals because of i apparent growth rates of only survival fish and in this case study ii selectivity of the beam trawl or ii omitted immigration and emigration processes bigger fish might migrate to deeper areas however if indices of trophic limitation are visible regarding larger individuals we can assume that this will be even more the case for small individuals another limit of our method could be the fitting of the lengths estimated by the deb model with length at age data obtained with a fixed birthdate it would be interesting to investigate the effect of the birthdate on the results indeed the spawning period and thus the timing of colonization of estuaries by young stages are variable amongst sub populations depending on environmental conditions amara et al 2000 moreover our approach considers two major environmental factors i e temperature and food availability on the individual s metabolism however other environmental factors affected by global change may influence species energetic needs for example oxygen availability gibson 1994 or pollution mounier et al 2020 constitute stressors that might modify fish s metabolism including energy assimilation sadoul and vijayan 2016 this is particularly true in coastal nurseries where organisms are subjected to important environmental gradients and rapid human induced changes mclusky and elliott 2004 we assumed here that the f reconstructed using the method presented in this paper can be used to explore the potential trophic limitation of nursery grounds as it is to some extent representative of the average overall food conditions in the nursery this is all the more relevant that preliminary results in this direction show for instance that there is a significant and positive link between the mean annual values of the scaled functional response all individuals considered and the mean annual values of the scaled functional response for each age class g0 g1 and g2 see appendix e however although we didn t highlight differences between age classes that could be interpreted in terms of competition for instance a more in depth year to year comparison of results of individual specific energy availability and energy partitioning by age class combined with data of environmental conditions i e temperature juveniles abundance leading to competition and prey production will substantially improve our understanding of trophic limitation we carried out this study on an average individual of each cohort as the aim was to investigate the potential of deb models to reconstruct energy ingestion and highlight nutritional stresses for individuals however the use of this method to simulate several individuals will be particularly interesting allowing to i consider inter individual variations e g in p a m and ii to extrapolate our results at the population scale e g by including a probability to die when a nutritional stress occurs which was not done here it would also be interesting to generalize the method to other study sites and to explore how other species belonging to the juvenile fish community can be considered together to conclude our method based on the study of energy intake and energy partitioning at an individual scale responds to some difficulties raised in the concrete identification of signs of a trophic limitation for organisms ciotti et al 2014 le pape and bonhommeau 2015 we showed that it is possible with our method to assess individual s food intake from their observed lengths and results of energy partitioning put forward indices of trophic limitation such as growth reduction and periods of nutritional stress being able to identify periods of non growing and nutritional stress is also interesting in the context of species conservation and fisheries management as it extends our knowledge on underlying processes that affect fish populations renewal hence dynamic all this will give a better insight of the nurseries functioning and its evolution data availability
