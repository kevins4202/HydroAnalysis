9535,elaborate water and fertilization management to increase soil organic carbon soc accumulation is important in maintaining high agricultural productivity and a sound ecological environment here a field experiment was conducted for eight years to investigate the effects of irrigation regimes and fertilizer types on soc stocks and labile organic carbon concentrations particulate organic carbon poc dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial biomass carbon mbc the irrigation regimes were no irrigation w0 presowing irrigation w1 presowing and jointing irrigation w2 and presowing jointing and anthesis irrigation w3 the fertilizer types were no fertilizer c0 mineral fertilizer only c1 half mineral plus half cattle manure c2 and cattle manure only c3 thus sixteen treatments were created and laid out in a split block design with triplicates both irrigation and manure application distinctly enhanced soc accumulation poc doc and mbc were mainly affected by manure application in surface soil 0 20 cm and by irrigation in deep soil 40 60 cm the interaction between irrigation and fertilization on soc and labile organic carbon concentrations was not significant in the 0 60 cm soil layer the soc stocks and relative soc sequestration rate increased with increasing irrigation and cattle manure inputs there was no significant difference in soc stocks between w2c2 108 15 mg c ha 1 and w3c1 109 05 mg c ha 1 as well as between w1c2 90 25 mg c ha 1 and w2c1 87 07 mg c ha 1 indicating that in w2 and w1 replacing half of the nitrogen with organic manure can result in equal soc stocks caused by increasing irrigation under mineral fertilizer alone this study emphasizes the important role that irrigation plays in soc management and provides theoretical support to improve the soc stock by reducing irrigation and applying cattle manure in the north china plain keywords irrigation regime fertilization and manure soil organic carbon labile soil organic carbon soc sequestration rate 1 introduction the soil is the largest reservoir of organic carbon in the terrestrial biosphere which accounts for approximately two thirds of the terrestrial carbon pool batjes 1996 soil organic carbon soc is an important component of soil and plays a critical role in soil functions and processes duval et al 2013 as it is the substance that maintains suitable soil physical chemical and biological properties smith et al 1999 the dynamics of the soc pool were shown to be dominated by soil management practices ding et al 2012 in particular irrigation amounts and fertilizer types are known to be two important factors that considerably determine soil carbon storage most research has demonstrated that organic manure application significantly improves soc levels chaudhary et al 2017 gai et al 2018 lepsch et al 2019 moreover the different soil water content caused by various irrigation regimes is one of the main abiotic drivers of the variation in soil carbon pools xu et al 2018 ma et al 2020 the different irrigation regimes alter the water stress and affect the transpiration of crops thus impacting the dry matter accumulation and carbon input into the soil sinclair et al 2020 moreover the different irrigation regimes lead to various soil moisture levels which shifts in altering the distribution of inorganic mineral nutrients c n cycling enzyme and microbial activities thus impacting soil soc schmidt et al 2018 bhattacharyya et al 2008 li et al 2016 however in previous studies the effects of irrigation on carbon accumulation were inconsistent in rainfed agroecosystems das et al 2019 reported that soc was the highest under high soil moisture 0 5 g g 1 and soc mineralizability was 25 42 lower than under low field moisture 0 3 g g 1 conditions qiu et al 2018 emphasized the importance of the role that irrigation plays in carbon sequestration and chatterjee et al 2018 indicated that irrigation significantly increased the total organic carbon content a similar result was also supported by giubergia et al 2013 who indicated that complementary irrigation increased the soc stock in 11 years however sun et al 2021 reported that the soc stock was increased through irrigation only under mineral fertilizer application but not under manure application the reason for these contradictory results may be due to the different irrigation management regimes combined with various precipitation levels that lead to the different degrees of water stress on the plants which deserves more attention moreover most of these studies were carried out under specific water conditions for the restrictions of water resources therefore it is important to pay attention to the changes in the soc concentrations when wheat suffers from varying degrees of water stress caused by different irrigation regimes mineral fertilizer is the main way to supplement the output of nutrient elements in fields when harvesting and plays an important role in maintaining crop yield as it can be quickly absorbed by plants however long term mineral fertilizer application can dramatically alter soil properties and bacterial communities sun et al 2015 xun et al 2016 excessive levels of synthetic n fertilization contribute substantially to soil acidification and salinization in the north china plain guo et al 2010 combined with frequent inefficient surface irrigation nitrogen was washed out of the soil into rivers and leached into deep soil layers causing eutrophication and the deterioration of groundwater quality liu and diamond 2005 liu et al 2003 organic fertilizer is a critical method of nutrient management steiner et al 2007 the use of organic fertilizer is limited by certain factors such as high prices inconvenient transportation and insufficient supply nevertheless this fertilizer is still valued for its ability to moderate the dependence on chemical fertilizer and attenuate soil degradation xie et al 2014 cai et al 2019 the substitution of organic fertilizer for mineral fertilizer could significantly increase annual soc sequestration xia et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 studies have reported that manure substitution can improve soil water hydraulic characteristics rasool et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 maintain soil bacterial community diversity chen et al 2017 xie et al 2018 and consequently increase grain yields katyal et al 2001 gai et al 2018 however previous studies mainly focused on the plow soil layer but rarely paid attention to subsurface soil carbon changes affected by fertilization management liang et al 2019 in particular the effects of different irrigation regimes on soc contents under various types of fertilization in both surface and deeper soil remain insufficiently addressed soc usually responds slowly to short term changes in soil management practices while labile organic carbon including particulate organic carbon poc dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial biomass carbon mbc is much more sensitive to changes in the soil environment and can be considered a fine indicator of soil quality haynes 2005 chaudhary et al 2017 labile organic carbon pools are affected by different soil management practices such as tillage soil water conditions and fertilizer applications liu et al 2014 yu et al 2019 li et al 2020 moreover labile organic carbon is highly correlated with soc but their sensitivities to soc changes are conflicting chen et al 2009 therefore the response of labile organic carbon under the different irrigation conditions and whether all kinds of labile organic carbon change consistently with the soc or just some of them are important questions as these questions have rarely been evaluated in previous studies they are the main focus of this research winter wheat is the main food crop cultivated on the north china plain and plays a crucial role in food security in china as the average precipitation in the area is only 150 mm but approximately 450 mm of water is needed during the winter wheat growing period liu et al 2002 sun et al 2006 three irrigation events are usually applied by local farmers to meet the remaining water requirements these events occur at the presowing jointing and heading stages of winter wheat sun et al 2021 irrigation is mainly pumped from underground water which causes a sharp drop in the water table zheng et al 2020 agronomists are trying to take measures to reduce irrigation consumption and make full use of rainwater they explored the possibility of reducing the frequency of irrigation from three times to one or two times to obtain a reasonable and steady crop yield therefore grain yields and water use efficiency were their focus however the change in the soc constitution under various irrigation frequencies as well as the interactive effects of irrigation and fertilization on soil carbon pools were rarely stated or addressed an eight year field experiment including four irrigation levels and four fertilization types was conducted in this study to 1 assess the changes in soil carbon pools after irrigation and fertilization incorporation 2 quantify the responses of the soc stock and the organic carbon sequestration rate to various irrigation and fertilizer applications 3 explore the relationships between irrigation regimes and manure applications on the soc stock we hypothesized that increased irrigation and manure input can promote soc and soil carbon pool poc doc and mbc accumulation and that the soc stock changes caused by reduced irrigation can be offset by applying manure in regions with water shortages 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this experiment was conducted at hengshui agricultural field water saving station 115 47 e 37 44 n altitude 21 m in hengshui city hebei province china the station is affiliated with the dryland farming institute of hebei academy of agriculture and forestry sciences the soil is silty loam with a particle size distribution of 22 5 clay 64 1 silt and 11 4 sand and was classified as ochri aquic cambosols chinese soil taxonomy 1995 the groundwater depth is more than 5 m the chemical properties of the topsoil at a depth of 0 20 cm before the initiation of the experiment were approximately 9 57 g total organic carbon kg 1 1 14 g total nitrogen kg 1 71 90 mg hydrolyzable nitrogen kg 1 22 63 mg olsen phosphorous kg 1 171 61 mg exchangeable potassium kg 1 and 0 89 g soluble salt kg 1 and the bulk densities are listed in table 1 the soil ph was approximately 7 6 the content of calcium carbonate was about 69 27 g kg 1 the analytical methods of total nitrogen hydrolyzable nitrogen olsen phosphorous and exchangeable potassium were from sun et al 2021 the field capacity and wilting point of the soil were 28 g g 1 and 10 g g 1 respectively this area has a temperate continental monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 12 8 c and the annual sunshine duration is 2509 h the annual average precipitation is 500 mm approximately 70 of which occurs during july and september and the potential evapotranspiration is 1785 4 mm the monthly precipitation in 2018 2019 and 2012 2019 is shown in fig 1 in 2018 2019 the total annual precipitation was 295 9 mm and 52 6 mm occurred in the winter wheat growing season from october to may which was lower than the average annual precipitation 362 6 mm and wheat growing period precipitation 76 8 mm in 2012 2019 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment started in 2012 with an annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize which was the same as the previous cropping system winter wheat was seeded on approximately 2 october in rows 15 cm apart at rates of 255 kg ha 1 and harvested on 15 june in the coming year with straw returning to the field after the wheat was harvested summer maize was seeded in all plots in the growing period from june to september and grown for silage the variety of summer maize was zhengdan958 in all seasons while that of winter wheat was h4589 during the 2012 2018 growing seasons and h1401 during the 2018 2019 growing seasons these two varieties of winter wheat were bred by the dryland farming institute and exhibited water saving characteristics the experiment was arranged in a split plot design the main plots were four irrigation regimes and the subplots were four fertilization types with three replicates every plot was 10 m 6 m with a buffer zone of 0 5 m a plastic film was buried in the buffer zone between the different irrigation treatments at 200 cm depth to prevent water infiltration in deep soil the four irrigation regimes were 1 irrigation at the presowing jointing and anthesis stages w3 2 irrigation at the presowing and jointing stages w2 3 irrigation at the presowing stage only w1 and 4 no irrigation w0 the jointing and anthesis stages refer to feeks 5 0 and feeks 10 5 in feeks growth stages respectively the irrigation amounts at the presowing jointing and anthesis stages were 90 mm 75 mm and 75 mm respectively the irrigation method was border irrigation and the water was channeled from outlets near the field through pipes and accurately measured by a water meter the four kinds of fertilizer application included 1 cattle manure only c3 2 half cattle manure and half mineral fertilizer c2 3 mineral fertilizer only c1 and 4 no fertilizer c0 cattle manure was composted for approximately three months by covering it with a plastic film and the nutrient contents were analyzed before application the average manure compost nutrient concentrations were 15 3 g n kg 1 8 7 g p kg 1 and 8 1 g k kg 1 the dose of manure application was determined according to its nitrogen content ensuring that the nitrogen was applied at 270 kg ha 1 the application amount of mineral phosphorus and potassium fertilizer was confirmed according to the counterpart contents in manure thus the same amounts of nitrogen phosphorous and potassium were applied urea superphosphate and potassium sulfate were the mineral sources of nitrogen phosphorous and potassium respectively the average application of p2o5 and k2o for years in c1 was 235 kg ha 1 and 134 kg ha 1 and in c2 it was 117 kg ha 1 and 67 kg ha 1 respectively for winter wheat 40 urea was applied as basal fertilizer and the rest was topdressed at the jointing stage other mineral fertilizers and manure were all basal applications and incorporated into the soil using rotary tillage with a depth of 15 20 cm before sowing wheat the average total c input via manure and returning residues across years are listed in table 2 there was no fertilization for summer maize but 75 mm irrigation was applied for w3 w2 and w1 before sowing maize to ensure germination other management practices were the same among treatments during the experimental period 2 3 soil sampling soil samples were collected from the 0 60 cm soil layer on 15 june 2019 after wheat harvest with an interval of 10 cm a five centimeter diameter probe was used to collect soil samples from five points in the shape of an m and then composited into one sample of the same soil level in each plot after removing the visible organic materials and fine roots sieving was conducted using a 2 mm wide sieve the mixed soil sample was separated into two parts and one part was air dried for analysis of soil chemical properties the other part was conserved as a fresh state in a refrigerator at 4 c and was used for biochemical analysis 2 4 soil analysis soil bulk density bd was measured by using a soil core sampler 100 cm3 volume to obtain natural undisturbed soil samples triplicate samples were obtained with an interval of 10 cm in the 0 20 cm soil layer and an interval of 20 cm in the 20 60 cm layer in each plot these soil samples were put into an oven for 48 h at 105 c to obtain the dry soil weight the walkley and black method walkley and black 1934 was used to measure the soc content as it is considered one of the standard methods for determining the soc content nelson and sommers 1996 especially in china wang et al 2012 this technique is less expensive and more feasible than dry combustion another method to measure the soc content but may lead to high variation in soc recovery de vos et al 2007 lettens et al 2007 five milliliters of concentrated h2so4 was mixed with a soil sample which was then weighed to 0 1 g passed through a 0 53 mm sieve and added to 5 ml 0 5 m k2cr2o7 after that tubes containing the above samples were moved into an oil bath pan maintained at 170 180 c for 5 min finally titration was conducted using feso4 solution this method provides an accurate estimate of soc with 100 recovery for most soil samples in calcareous soils of northwestern china wang et al 2012 particulate organic matter carbon poc was measured using the method described by liu et al 2014 air dried soil samples 20 g were passed through a 2 mm sieve dispersed in 60 ml of na 6 po3 6 5 g l 1 and shaken for 18 h 90 rev min 1 on a reciprocating shaker after shaking a 53 μm screen was used to sieve the soil suspension which was then washed using distilled water until clean water was obtained the residual soil on the screen was washed into an aluminum specimen box and dried at 60 c for 48 h in an oven to obtain dry soil samples the subsequent procedure to measure the carbon content in poc was similar to the method of soc content determination as described above dissolved organic carbon doc was extracted with the method described by liu et al 2014 briefly 10 g of moist soil was added to 50 g of distilled water and shaken for 1 h at 250 rev min 1 at 25 c the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 15 000 rev min 1 to obtain the supernatant then the liquid was filtered through a 0 45 µm filterable membrane and the filtrate was measured by an elementar cn analyzer elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanua germany the microbial biomass nitrogen mbc content was evaluated by using chloroform fumigation extraction presented by vance et al 1987 for each treatment two similar portions of 20 g soil samples were weighed one portion was fumigated with ethanol free chcl3 at 25 c for 24 h and the other portion was not fumigated but analyzed simultaneously after fumigation 60 ml of 0 5 m k2so4 was used to extract the soils before filtering using filter paper 12 5 µm diameter shaking at 200 revs min 1 for 30 min was conducted the organic carbon in the extracts was determined by using dry combustion and the elementar cn analyzer elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanua germany moreover the mbc content was calculated as follows mbc ec kec where ec organic carbon extracted from fumigated soils organic carbon extracted from nonfumigated soils and kec 0 45 brookes et al 1985 2 5 annual carbon input the mean annual c input was calculated by summing all carbon sources including crop straw stubble and root as well as manure addition table 2 the carbon content of manure was confirmed by laboratory tests the straw and stubble of wheat and maize were collected from 2 7 m2 areas in each plot maize was grown for silage in this experiment hence the carbon from maize straw was zero and its residues mainly included root and stubble biomass the root biomass both wheat and maize was assumed using a relative distribution of 43 37 and 20 in grain aboveground straw and stubble residues and belowground mainly roots residues tang et al 2012 the dry weight of straw and stubble samples was weighed after air drying the calculation of c concentrations in dry matter was conducted assuming that the aboveground residues contained 44 carbon and the roots contained 38 tang et al 2012 the contributions of rhizodeposition to soil carbon concentration were ignored in this research 2 6 data calculation and statistical analysis the soc stock tsoc mg c ha 1 in the 0 60 cm soil layer was calculated as follows 1 tsoc i 1 n s o c i b d i d 10 where soci and bdi are the corresponding soil layer soil organic carbon content g c kg 1 and bulk density mg m 3 respectively d is the soil depth 0 1 m n is the maximum number of soil layers from which samples were collected equal to 6 here and 10 is used for adjusting units the relative soc sequestration rate rrseq mg c ha 1 yr 1 was calculated as follows 2 rrseq tsoce tsocr t where tsoce is the experimental treatment tsocr is the reference treatment in the final experiment which had no fertilization but the same irrigation regime as tsoce in this study and t is the interval years between experiment setup and soil samples collected statistical analysis was carried out using spss version 25 0 ibm inc chicago usa one way analysis of variance anova was used to detect the differences between means by using the least significant difference lsd test at a significance level of p 0 05 two way anova was conducted to assess the main effects of irrigation fertilization and their interactions on soc poc doc and mbc before analysis the data were tested to satisfy normal distribution and variance homogeneity correlation relationships among soc poc doc and mbc were evaluated by using pearson s correlation coefficients other data analyses and calculations were accomplished in office 2016 microsoft corporation and figures were generated with origin 2020 3 results 3 1 residual c and fertilizer c inputs the average annual carbon inputs from fertilizer and crop residue biomasses are summarized in table 2 under the same irrigation level conditions the diversity of fertilizer types is the main reason for the difference in c inputs the quantity of c inputs increased with increasing organic manure fertilizer application in the following order c3 c2 c1 c0 moreover the quantity of returning crop residue including straw stubble and roots but not root exudates under the same fertilizer conditions showed differences owing to the different irrigation levels generally the amounts of residual carbon inputs improved with increasing irrigation frequency under the same fertilizer application moreover a numerical similarity between w3 and w2 was observed table 2 3 2 soc concentration soc concentration was affected by fertilizer management under different irrigation regimes fig 2 the soc concentration increased with increasing manure application in the 0 20 cm surface soil layer in the following order c3 c2 c1 c0 in particular c3 possessed the highest soc concentration throughout the 0 60 cm soil layer in w3 and w0 nevertheless the increasing trend of the soc concentration with increasing manure application decreased with increasing soil depth at the 60 cm soil depth no significant differences were observed among the different fertilization treatments under the four irrigation regimes table s1 the irrigation regime showed significant effects on soc concentrations in the 0 60 cm soil profile in different fertilizer groups fig 2 generally the soc concentration increased with increasing irrigation frequency this increasing trend not only occurred in the 0 20 cm surface soil but was also observed in deep soil layers across fertilization treatments however in c0 a similar increasing tendency was not observed in the 40 60 cm soil layer while there were no significant differences between w3 and w2 table s2 3 3 labile organic carbon 3 3 1 poc the distribution of poc concentration in different irrigation regimes and fertilizer types is presented in fig 3 an increase in poc concentration in surface soil 0 30 cm with increasing organic fertilizer application was observed in w3 w2 and w1 however in the deep soil layers 40 60 cm a similar increasing tendency was not observed in w0 the poc concentrations in c3 were significantly higher than those in c2 and c1 in the 0 30 cm soil layer but showed no difference from those in c0 in the deep 20 60 cm soil layer table s3 poc concentrations under different irrigation regimes sharply decreased with increasing soil depth in c3 fig 3 in c2 no significant differences were observed among the different irrigation regimes throughout the 0 60 cm soil layer in c1 and c0 the poc concentrations of w2 were the lowest compared to those of w3 w1 and w0 at the 0 60 cm soil depth moreover w0 possessed the highest values in the 0 30 cm soil but no significant differences were observed between w3 and w1 in the same soil layers table s4 3 3 2 doc in w3 w2 and w1 doc concentrations increased with increasing carbon inputs in the 0 30 cm soil fig 4 however no significant differences among the different fertilized treatments were observed in the deep soil layers 40 60 cm moreover doc concentrations sharply decreased with increasing soil depth in the 0 60 cm soil layer however the same increasing tendency of doc concentrations that increased with increasing carbon input did not occur in w0 there were no significant differences among c3 c2 c1 and c0 in the 20 60 cm soil layers in w0 although the doc concentration of c3 was significantly higher than those of c2 c1 and c0 at the 10 cm soil depth table s5 the distribution of doc concentrations affected by irrigation regime in the 0 20 cm soil layer was similar in c3 and c2 fig 4 the highest value in the 10 cm soil was exhibited in w2 which was significantly higher than those of w3 w1 and w0 by 50 52 78 67 and 117 61 in c3 and by 15 05 40 33 and 108 43 in c2 respectively table s6 in the 20 cm soil in c3 and c2 the highest value occurred in w1 and obeyed the following order w1 w2 w3 w0 however in the 30 60 cm soil layers no significant differences were observed among the different irrigation treatments in c3 and c2 in c1 and c0 doc concentrations showed no differences among w3 w2 w1 and w0 throughout the 0 60 cm soil layers 3 3 3 mbc at the 10 cm soil depth the mbc concentrations increased with increasing organic carbon inputs in w3 w2 and w1 fig 5 in the 20 cm soil the mbc concentration of c3 was the highest followed by c2 and c1 in w2 w1 and w0 however in the soil at depths greater than 20 cm the phenomenon that mbc concentrations increased with increasing carbon inputs was not observed in w3 w2 w1 and w0 moreover only in the 10 cm surface soil layer the mbc concentrations of c0 were the lowest compared with the other fertilization treatments but the same phenomenon was not observed in every deeper soil layer in c3 fig 5 the mbc concentrations in w2 were significantly higher than those in w3 w1 and w0 in the 10 cm soil layer by 51 03 43 91 and 29 70 and in the 20 cm soil layer by 66 33 39 68 and 17 94 respectively table s8 in c2 and c1 the mbc concentrations in w0 were significantly lower than those in w3 w2 and w1 in the 0 20 cm soil layer moreover in c0 there were no significant differences among w3 w2 w1 and w0 throughout the 0 60 cm soil layers 3 4 correlation analyses a positive correlation between soc and its fractions at p 0 01 was observed table 3 of all the fractions of soc poc was the most highly correlated with soc followed by doc and mbc moreover poc doc and mbc were positively and significantly correlated with each other and the highest value of the correlation coefficient was exhibited between doc and mbc fertilization and irrigation showed significant main effects on the soc concentration at the 0 60 cm soil depth table 4 a decreasing tendency of the main effects on the soc concentration from fertilization and irrigation was observed with increasing soil depth in contrast the main effects on soc concentrations from irrigation were more significant than those from fertilization in deep soil 20 60 cm for labile organic carbon fertilization showed significant main effects in the surface soil 0 20 cm while irrigation showed significant main effects in the deep soil 40 60 cm significant p 0 05 interaction effects for soc in 20 40 cm soil and labile organic carbon in 40 60 cm soil were observed and the simple effect analysis and pairwise comparisons are presented in table s9 and table s10 from the two tables an additional simple effect analysis showed that the significant mean differences in soc 20 40 cm poc 40 60 cm doc 40 60 cm and mbc 40 60 cm were mainly found between different irrigation regimes in each fertilization type 3 5 soc stock and rrseq the soc stock was significantly affected by the irrigation regime fig 6 a decreasing tendency with decreasing irrigation frequency was observed in c3 c2 c1 and c0 moreover fertilizer types showed significant effects on the soc stock fig 6 in w3 and w0 the soc stock decreased with decreasing carbon inputs however the soc stocks of c2 were significantly higher than those of c3 c1 and c0 by 8 57 25 80 and 28 58 in w2 and by 3 87 11 54 21 01 in w1 respectively moreover there were no significant differences between w2c2 and w3c1 or between w1c2 and w2c1 which suggests that there was a compensatory effect on the soc stock caused by manure application while concurrently decreasing irrigation the rrseq results affected by irrigation regime and fertilizer type are presented in fig 7 under the same fertilizer application conditions the rrseq improved with increasing irrigation frequency however the magnitude of the increment was different for various carbon inputs and obeyed the order of c3 c2 c1 which indicated that the soc sequestration rate increased with increasing carbon input 4 discussion 4 1 soc and its fractions were affected by organic carbon inputs the soc concentration in topsoil could be significantly improved by adding organic fertilizer and increased with increasing manure application under each irrigation condition fig 2 direct manure application benefits the growth of winter wheat and promotes the yield of crop residues by enhancing soc sequestration accelerating the build up of soil fertility and improving the soil physical properties cai et al 2019 chaudhary et al 2017 pagliai et al 2004 meng et al 2019 a positive residual effect shen et al 2007 of long term manure application on grain yields and the production of crop dry matter was observed in this experiment table 2 which was maintained for several years after ceasing manure application demelash et al 2014 wheat straw return to the field as a direct carbon resource every year after wheat harvesting could continuously improve soil organic matter som therefore in this study the management of organic manure application and returning wheat straw created a virtuous circle of residue production and utilization and benefited the accumulation of som it is easy to conclude that poc concentrations were significantly p 0 05 affected by the use of organic fertilizer and increased with increasing organic fertilizer application fig 3 particulate organic matter pom is primarily composed of plant derived debris gale et al 2000 the application of organic fertilizer and the return of crop residues to the field could substantially improve the pom content in the soil xie et al 2014 reported that long term manure application can induce a 21 and 107 greater increase in neutral sugar concentrations in free and occluded pom as well as more plant derived organic compounds which were enriched in pom moreover pom has been found to act as a nucleus for the formation of water stable aggregates puget et al 2000 bravo garza et al 2010 reported that pom preferentially accumulated in large macroaggregates 2000 µm relative to small macroaggregates 250 2000 µm and microaggregates 53 250 µm crop residue input increased soc mineralization and mbc activity in all three aggregate size classes sarker et al 2018 soil microbial community composition is the main driver of pom chemistry alteration and could adapt to changes in pom composition xiao et al 2017 in this study we also observed that the mbc content increased with increasing manure fertilizer application fig 5 and showed a positive correlation with poc content table 3 which may be because high poc contents provide a favorable breeding environment for microorganisms in manure application treatments mbc accounts for a small proportion of soc averaging a proportion of 2 3 anderson and domsch 2010 that usually does not exceed 4 5 of the soc content anderson 2003 nonetheless microbial biomass plays an integral role in biogeochemical cycles it is an important source of soil carbon and is closely related to the turnover of soil carbon blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2013 classified microorganisms as active potentially active dormant and dead depending on their different physiological states and noted that only active microorganisms drive the biogeochemical process active microorganisms occupied only a small percentage approximately 0 1 2 of the total soil microbial biomass without the input of easily absorbable substrates prosser et al 2007 when an organic substrate is added it leads to priming effects kuzyakov et al 2000 the fraction of potentially active microorganisms accounting for 10 40 of the total microbial biomass blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2013 can quickly switch to an active state from an inactive state within minutes to hours and plays an important reservoir of biodiversity joergensen and wichern 2018 in this study the inputs of organic fertilizer provided exogenous organic carbon to the soil we reasonably speculate that potentially active microbial biomass was rapidly activated and switched to an active state which led to microorganism proliferation in manure application treatments and occupied more biomass relative to those without manure usage fig 5 doc is a very important component of soil dissolved organic matter dom and the turnover of doc in soils has been emphasized as the crucial approach of biogeochemical element cycling kalbitz et al 2000 the leaching of dom is usually regarded as a c source for soil microorganisms hagedorn et al 2015 this may be the reason that doc was positively significantly correlated with mbc table 3 moreover the sorption of doc to the mineral phase can contribute to the long term stabilization of som kaiser and kalbitz 2012 which may explain the positive correlation between soc and doc concentrations table 3 generally dom originates from plant litter leaching root exudates microbial detritus and som solubilization kalbitz et al 2000 sanderman and amundson 2008 in our experiment we observed that treatments with manure applications exhibited significantly p 0 05 higher doc concentrations than those without manure applications fig 4 this result is consistent with those of previous studies that reported manure amendments increased doc contents long et al 2015 therefore we can easily conclude that the application of composted manure favors doc accumulation additionally the doc contents decreased sharply with increasing soil depth as doc was almost concentrated in the near surface soil this phenomenon may be attributed to the different compositions of dom in different soil layers in near surface layers dom is produced from humus and fresh litter material however subsoil dom is composed of highly degraded organic material and seems to be the turnover of decomposition rather than a nutrient source kaiser and kalbitz 2012 little doc derived from the decomposition of fresh surface litter reaches the mineral subsoil hagedorn et al 2012 previous studies also demonstrated that topsoil dom has a near modern radiocarbon signature and thus mainly involves the latest fresh photosynthesis products while subsoil dom is usually depleted in radiocarbon which indicates the existence of compounds incorporating older carbon froberg et al 2009 sanderman et al 2008 4 2 soc and its fractions were affected by irrigation in the experimental period from 2012 to 2019 the average annual precipitation was 362 58 mm but was mainly concentrated in the summer june july and august which accounted for 75 58 of the total precipitation fig 1 during the winter wheat growing season the total precipitation in 2018 2019 59 30 mm was lower than the average precipitation in 2012 2019 88 55 mm in 2018 2019 the precipitation in the early and middle wheat growing months was not over 10 mm which can be recognized as insufficient rainfall moreover the distribution of precipitation was mainly in april but its amount still did not exceed 35 mm similarly during the wheat growing periods in 2012 2019 the precipitation was mainly concentrated in the later growing months of april and may which accounted for over half of all precipitation in the wheat growing seasons therefore the scarcity of precipitation during the early and middle growing periods of winter wheat emphasizes the importance of irrigation for the normal growth of winter wheat in this experiment soc concentrations increased with increasing irrigation frequency under different fertilizer treatments fig 2 this result may be because the increasing irrigation decreased the water deficit and increased crop water transpiration which favors wheat growth and dry matter production in both aboveground and belowground biomass sinclair 2020 roots can regulate the exudation process alone or the recapture of exudates from soil jones et al 2004 living root inputs exhibit more efficiency than litter inputs in forming soc sokol et al 2019 moreover aboveground biomass accumulation showed a positive correlation with irrigation quantity during the wheat growth period table 2 it is easy to observe that the quantity of return crop residue in the higher irrigation level treatments was higher than that in the lower irrigation levels table 2 irrigation showed a more significant main effect on soc than fertilization in deep soil 20 60 cm table 4 one reason for this phenomenon may be that the root growth at the deeper layer in irrigated soils was better than that in nonirrigated soils the soc accumulation in irrigated soils benefited from both root decomposition and living root inputs sokol et al 2019 on the other hand the infiltration of surface water promotes the transport of labile organic substrates into subsoils gross and harrison 2019 in particular the movement of doc with water is recognized as a crucial nutrient translocation mechanism kaiser and kalbitz 2012 and can support a large fraction of microbial activities in a deeper soil layer neff and asner 2001 considering that there was no irrigation and abundant rainfall to promote the movement of doc into deep soil this phenomenon may explain why a similar result happened in w3 w2 and w1 while the increase in doc concentrations with the increase in manure inputs was not observed in w0 fig 4 doc is regarded as a c resource for soil microbial biomass hagedorn et al 2015 whereas microorganisms are not only a c pool but also actively promote the process of c turnover kuzyakov 2010 the responses of microbial biomass to precipitation in previous studies are not always the same however the majority of studies reported that the microbial biomass and bacterial and fungal richness improved in response to increasing precipitation and irrigation zhang et al 2013 bell et al 2014 nielsen and ball 2015 pom is primarily composed of plant derived debris and microbial residues binding clay particles via cation bridging thus preserving som within the aggregates gale et al 2000 irrigation increased above ground productivity by enhancing transpiration sinclair 2020 and promoted the accumulation of photosynthate carbon in the fine pom soil size fraction 53 250 µm carmona et al 2020 the close association with labile organic carbon explains why poc doc and mbc were significantly correlated with each other table 3 and emphasizes the important role that irrigation plays in regulating biochemical processes and soc accumulation in the soil sorensen et al 2013 som can be physically stabilized or protected from degradation through the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates six et al 2000 however the formation of aggregates was affected by irrigation apesteguía et al 2015 supported that the incorporation of maize derived c in small macroaggregates and microaggregates 250 2000 µm and 50 250 µm was only observed under irrigation bravo garza et al 2010 demonstrated that soils with wetting and drying cycles could enhance the number of macroaggregates thus accumulating more c in aggregates than soils with continuous moisture maintained at a field capacity of 0 40 g water g 1 a desirable soil structure and soil compaction repair can be recreated through wet dry soil cycles pillai and mcgarry 1999 in this study a physically protected mechanism owing to the formation of aggregates especially microaggregates may be established in treatments with good irrigation compared to those with poor irrigation which may finally result in the soc contents increasing with increasing amounts of irrigation we will address this possible explanation in our future studies 4 3 effects of irrigation and fertilizer on soc stock and rrseq for arable soil the soc stock is controlled by soil management such as fertilization irrigation tillage and crop rotation liu et al 2014 li et al 2016 cai et al 2019 corresponding to those of previous studies liu et al 2010 li et al 2018 lepsch et al 2019 sun et al 2021 our results showed that adding organic manure can significantly increase the soc stock fig 6 in w3 and w0 the soc stock increased with increasing manure application however in w2 and w1 the highest value of soc stock occurred in c2 this result was most likely due to the high soc content in the deep soil layer fig 2 and the relatively high bd in deep soil for c2 in w2 and w1 table 1 this result corresponds to those of previous studies where manure application increased the soc concentration and mineral fertilizer application increased the bulk density li et al 2018 sarkar et al 2003 on the other hand the substitution of manure for mineral fertilizer increased the nitrogen use efficiency not only for the manure but also for the mineral fertilizer kong et al 2021 webb et al 2013 thus favoring the organic matter accumulation in the soil the soc stock decreased with decreasing irrigation frequency for each fertilizer type in this study fig 6 which can be attributed to the higher soc contents in well irrigated treatments than in those with poor irrigation fig 2 this result indicated that the irrigation regime plays a crucial role in regulating the soc stock both with manure and without manure application in particular the soc stock in w2c2 showed no difference from that in w3c1 and the soc stock in w1c2 was higher but showed no significant difference from that in w2c1 this result suggests a compensatory effect on the soc stock caused by cattle manure application that is similar to the effect of increasing irrigation frequency however there was no significant interaction between irrigation regimes and fertilization types on soc in the 0 60 cm soil layer we think the main reason for this phenomenon is that the extremely significant main effects from irrigation and manure application masked the weak interaction effect in the dryland cropping system irrigation plays a vital role in carbon accumulation while water is the primary limiting factor for crop growth and realizing the positive effects of n fertilizer mueller et al 2012 qiu et al 2018 liang et al 2021 especially in this experimental region the water needs for winter wheat were mainly met by irrigation due to the dry weather conditions the result of our experiment also demonstrated that the carbon accumulation in grain and straw was distinctly increased with increasing irrigation on the other hand we think that the manure application gradient was too low to measure the interaction effects in this experiment manure application can greatly contribute to soc buildup chaudhary et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 but manure was only applied in c2 and c3 and the amount in c3 was twice that in c2 nonetheless between c2 and c3 similar sequestration rates and interaction effects on soc were observed from w2 to w3 although the interaction was not significant fig s1 we suspect that by increasing the number of treatments that contain higher substitution ratios of manure to nitrogen fertilizer the interaction between irrigation and fertilization would be more pronounced further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis rrseq was closely related to soc concentrations and soc stock in the soil the result in this experiment corresponds to those of previous studies suggesting that organic manure inputs can significantly improve soc accumulation and increase the soc sequestration rate li et al 2018 cai et al 2019 the relative soc sequestration rate increased with increasing irrigation frequency remarkably the rate of increase in c2 was close to that in c3 while the amount of manure applied in c2 was half as much as that in c3 this result may be due to the increased carbon accumulation in c2 promoting high nitrogen use efficiency although this hypothesis needs further research regarding the effects of irrigation most research has reported that increasing irrigation could benefit soc sequestration with mineral fertilizer application giubergia et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2018 however when coupled with organic manure the effects of irrigation on soc accumulation were inconsistent and rarely reported in our study the results showed that the soc sequestration rate increased with increasing irrigation regimes under both manure and mineral fertilizer application in contrast sun et al 2021 reported that soc accumulation increased when composted manure was applied following reduced irrigation the different results may be due to the different types of organic manure fertilizer the diverse doses of organic carbon inputs or the different degrees of water stress between the two experiments to the best of our knowledge this is the first field study focused on the effects of various fertilizer types on soc sequestration regulated by multiple gradient irrigation regimes this result will draw increasing attention to irrigation strategies when applying organic manure to improve soil quality in future research 5 conclusion in this study increasing both the irrigation frequency and manure application can promote soc stocks in the 0 60 cm soil layer fertilization mainly affects labile organic carbon in the 0 20 cm soil layer but irrigation mainly affects labile organic carbon in the 40 60 cm soil layer the lack of significant difference in soc stock between w2c2 and w3c1 and between w1c2 and w2c1 indicates that there was a compensatory effect of manure application on soc stock reduction caused by decreasing irrigation frequency furthermore the level of manure application in the c3 and c2 treatments resulted in a similar soc sequestration rate in summary soc stocks can be enhanced by applying manure instead of increasing irrigation in dryland areas and substituting half of the manure for mineral fertilizer is a promising way to increase carbon sequestration the results of this study may provide theoretical support and guidelines for water and fertilizer

9535,elaborate water and fertilization management to increase soil organic carbon soc accumulation is important in maintaining high agricultural productivity and a sound ecological environment here a field experiment was conducted for eight years to investigate the effects of irrigation regimes and fertilizer types on soc stocks and labile organic carbon concentrations particulate organic carbon poc dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial biomass carbon mbc the irrigation regimes were no irrigation w0 presowing irrigation w1 presowing and jointing irrigation w2 and presowing jointing and anthesis irrigation w3 the fertilizer types were no fertilizer c0 mineral fertilizer only c1 half mineral plus half cattle manure c2 and cattle manure only c3 thus sixteen treatments were created and laid out in a split block design with triplicates both irrigation and manure application distinctly enhanced soc accumulation poc doc and mbc were mainly affected by manure application in surface soil 0 20 cm and by irrigation in deep soil 40 60 cm the interaction between irrigation and fertilization on soc and labile organic carbon concentrations was not significant in the 0 60 cm soil layer the soc stocks and relative soc sequestration rate increased with increasing irrigation and cattle manure inputs there was no significant difference in soc stocks between w2c2 108 15 mg c ha 1 and w3c1 109 05 mg c ha 1 as well as between w1c2 90 25 mg c ha 1 and w2c1 87 07 mg c ha 1 indicating that in w2 and w1 replacing half of the nitrogen with organic manure can result in equal soc stocks caused by increasing irrigation under mineral fertilizer alone this study emphasizes the important role that irrigation plays in soc management and provides theoretical support to improve the soc stock by reducing irrigation and applying cattle manure in the north china plain keywords irrigation regime fertilization and manure soil organic carbon labile soil organic carbon soc sequestration rate 1 introduction the soil is the largest reservoir of organic carbon in the terrestrial biosphere which accounts for approximately two thirds of the terrestrial carbon pool batjes 1996 soil organic carbon soc is an important component of soil and plays a critical role in soil functions and processes duval et al 2013 as it is the substance that maintains suitable soil physical chemical and biological properties smith et al 1999 the dynamics of the soc pool were shown to be dominated by soil management practices ding et al 2012 in particular irrigation amounts and fertilizer types are known to be two important factors that considerably determine soil carbon storage most research has demonstrated that organic manure application significantly improves soc levels chaudhary et al 2017 gai et al 2018 lepsch et al 2019 moreover the different soil water content caused by various irrigation regimes is one of the main abiotic drivers of the variation in soil carbon pools xu et al 2018 ma et al 2020 the different irrigation regimes alter the water stress and affect the transpiration of crops thus impacting the dry matter accumulation and carbon input into the soil sinclair et al 2020 moreover the different irrigation regimes lead to various soil moisture levels which shifts in altering the distribution of inorganic mineral nutrients c n cycling enzyme and microbial activities thus impacting soil soc schmidt et al 2018 bhattacharyya et al 2008 li et al 2016 however in previous studies the effects of irrigation on carbon accumulation were inconsistent in rainfed agroecosystems das et al 2019 reported that soc was the highest under high soil moisture 0 5 g g 1 and soc mineralizability was 25 42 lower than under low field moisture 0 3 g g 1 conditions qiu et al 2018 emphasized the importance of the role that irrigation plays in carbon sequestration and chatterjee et al 2018 indicated that irrigation significantly increased the total organic carbon content a similar result was also supported by giubergia et al 2013 who indicated that complementary irrigation increased the soc stock in 11 years however sun et al 2021 reported that the soc stock was increased through irrigation only under mineral fertilizer application but not under manure application the reason for these contradictory results may be due to the different irrigation management regimes combined with various precipitation levels that lead to the different degrees of water stress on the plants which deserves more attention moreover most of these studies were carried out under specific water conditions for the restrictions of water resources therefore it is important to pay attention to the changes in the soc concentrations when wheat suffers from varying degrees of water stress caused by different irrigation regimes mineral fertilizer is the main way to supplement the output of nutrient elements in fields when harvesting and plays an important role in maintaining crop yield as it can be quickly absorbed by plants however long term mineral fertilizer application can dramatically alter soil properties and bacterial communities sun et al 2015 xun et al 2016 excessive levels of synthetic n fertilization contribute substantially to soil acidification and salinization in the north china plain guo et al 2010 combined with frequent inefficient surface irrigation nitrogen was washed out of the soil into rivers and leached into deep soil layers causing eutrophication and the deterioration of groundwater quality liu and diamond 2005 liu et al 2003 organic fertilizer is a critical method of nutrient management steiner et al 2007 the use of organic fertilizer is limited by certain factors such as high prices inconvenient transportation and insufficient supply nevertheless this fertilizer is still valued for its ability to moderate the dependence on chemical fertilizer and attenuate soil degradation xie et al 2014 cai et al 2019 the substitution of organic fertilizer for mineral fertilizer could significantly increase annual soc sequestration xia et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 studies have reported that manure substitution can improve soil water hydraulic characteristics rasool et al 2008 zhang et al 2014 maintain soil bacterial community diversity chen et al 2017 xie et al 2018 and consequently increase grain yields katyal et al 2001 gai et al 2018 however previous studies mainly focused on the plow soil layer but rarely paid attention to subsurface soil carbon changes affected by fertilization management liang et al 2019 in particular the effects of different irrigation regimes on soc contents under various types of fertilization in both surface and deeper soil remain insufficiently addressed soc usually responds slowly to short term changes in soil management practices while labile organic carbon including particulate organic carbon poc dissolved organic carbon doc and microbial biomass carbon mbc is much more sensitive to changes in the soil environment and can be considered a fine indicator of soil quality haynes 2005 chaudhary et al 2017 labile organic carbon pools are affected by different soil management practices such as tillage soil water conditions and fertilizer applications liu et al 2014 yu et al 2019 li et al 2020 moreover labile organic carbon is highly correlated with soc but their sensitivities to soc changes are conflicting chen et al 2009 therefore the response of labile organic carbon under the different irrigation conditions and whether all kinds of labile organic carbon change consistently with the soc or just some of them are important questions as these questions have rarely been evaluated in previous studies they are the main focus of this research winter wheat is the main food crop cultivated on the north china plain and plays a crucial role in food security in china as the average precipitation in the area is only 150 mm but approximately 450 mm of water is needed during the winter wheat growing period liu et al 2002 sun et al 2006 three irrigation events are usually applied by local farmers to meet the remaining water requirements these events occur at the presowing jointing and heading stages of winter wheat sun et al 2021 irrigation is mainly pumped from underground water which causes a sharp drop in the water table zheng et al 2020 agronomists are trying to take measures to reduce irrigation consumption and make full use of rainwater they explored the possibility of reducing the frequency of irrigation from three times to one or two times to obtain a reasonable and steady crop yield therefore grain yields and water use efficiency were their focus however the change in the soc constitution under various irrigation frequencies as well as the interactive effects of irrigation and fertilization on soil carbon pools were rarely stated or addressed an eight year field experiment including four irrigation levels and four fertilization types was conducted in this study to 1 assess the changes in soil carbon pools after irrigation and fertilization incorporation 2 quantify the responses of the soc stock and the organic carbon sequestration rate to various irrigation and fertilizer applications 3 explore the relationships between irrigation regimes and manure applications on the soc stock we hypothesized that increased irrigation and manure input can promote soc and soil carbon pool poc doc and mbc accumulation and that the soc stock changes caused by reduced irrigation can be offset by applying manure in regions with water shortages 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site this experiment was conducted at hengshui agricultural field water saving station 115 47 e 37 44 n altitude 21 m in hengshui city hebei province china the station is affiliated with the dryland farming institute of hebei academy of agriculture and forestry sciences the soil is silty loam with a particle size distribution of 22 5 clay 64 1 silt and 11 4 sand and was classified as ochri aquic cambosols chinese soil taxonomy 1995 the groundwater depth is more than 5 m the chemical properties of the topsoil at a depth of 0 20 cm before the initiation of the experiment were approximately 9 57 g total organic carbon kg 1 1 14 g total nitrogen kg 1 71 90 mg hydrolyzable nitrogen kg 1 22 63 mg olsen phosphorous kg 1 171 61 mg exchangeable potassium kg 1 and 0 89 g soluble salt kg 1 and the bulk densities are listed in table 1 the soil ph was approximately 7 6 the content of calcium carbonate was about 69 27 g kg 1 the analytical methods of total nitrogen hydrolyzable nitrogen olsen phosphorous and exchangeable potassium were from sun et al 2021 the field capacity and wilting point of the soil were 28 g g 1 and 10 g g 1 respectively this area has a temperate continental monsoon climate the average annual temperature is 12 8 c and the annual sunshine duration is 2509 h the annual average precipitation is 500 mm approximately 70 of which occurs during july and september and the potential evapotranspiration is 1785 4 mm the monthly precipitation in 2018 2019 and 2012 2019 is shown in fig 1 in 2018 2019 the total annual precipitation was 295 9 mm and 52 6 mm occurred in the winter wheat growing season from october to may which was lower than the average annual precipitation 362 6 mm and wheat growing period precipitation 76 8 mm in 2012 2019 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment started in 2012 with an annual double cropping system of winter wheat and summer maize which was the same as the previous cropping system winter wheat was seeded on approximately 2 october in rows 15 cm apart at rates of 255 kg ha 1 and harvested on 15 june in the coming year with straw returning to the field after the wheat was harvested summer maize was seeded in all plots in the growing period from june to september and grown for silage the variety of summer maize was zhengdan958 in all seasons while that of winter wheat was h4589 during the 2012 2018 growing seasons and h1401 during the 2018 2019 growing seasons these two varieties of winter wheat were bred by the dryland farming institute and exhibited water saving characteristics the experiment was arranged in a split plot design the main plots were four irrigation regimes and the subplots were four fertilization types with three replicates every plot was 10 m 6 m with a buffer zone of 0 5 m a plastic film was buried in the buffer zone between the different irrigation treatments at 200 cm depth to prevent water infiltration in deep soil the four irrigation regimes were 1 irrigation at the presowing jointing and anthesis stages w3 2 irrigation at the presowing and jointing stages w2 3 irrigation at the presowing stage only w1 and 4 no irrigation w0 the jointing and anthesis stages refer to feeks 5 0 and feeks 10 5 in feeks growth stages respectively the irrigation amounts at the presowing jointing and anthesis stages were 90 mm 75 mm and 75 mm respectively the irrigation method was border irrigation and the water was channeled from outlets near the field through pipes and accurately measured by a water meter the four kinds of fertilizer application included 1 cattle manure only c3 2 half cattle manure and half mineral fertilizer c2 3 mineral fertilizer only c1 and 4 no fertilizer c0 cattle manure was composted for approximately three months by covering it with a plastic film and the nutrient contents were analyzed before application the average manure compost nutrient concentrations were 15 3 g n kg 1 8 7 g p kg 1 and 8 1 g k kg 1 the dose of manure application was determined according to its nitrogen content ensuring that the nitrogen was applied at 270 kg ha 1 the application amount of mineral phosphorus and potassium fertilizer was confirmed according to the counterpart contents in manure thus the same amounts of nitrogen phosphorous and potassium were applied urea superphosphate and potassium sulfate were the mineral sources of nitrogen phosphorous and potassium respectively the average application of p2o5 and k2o for years in c1 was 235 kg ha 1 and 134 kg ha 1 and in c2 it was 117 kg ha 1 and 67 kg ha 1 respectively for winter wheat 40 urea was applied as basal fertilizer and the rest was topdressed at the jointing stage other mineral fertilizers and manure were all basal applications and incorporated into the soil using rotary tillage with a depth of 15 20 cm before sowing wheat the average total c input via manure and returning residues across years are listed in table 2 there was no fertilization for summer maize but 75 mm irrigation was applied for w3 w2 and w1 before sowing maize to ensure germination other management practices were the same among treatments during the experimental period 2 3 soil sampling soil samples were collected from the 0 60 cm soil layer on 15 june 2019 after wheat harvest with an interval of 10 cm a five centimeter diameter probe was used to collect soil samples from five points in the shape of an m and then composited into one sample of the same soil level in each plot after removing the visible organic materials and fine roots sieving was conducted using a 2 mm wide sieve the mixed soil sample was separated into two parts and one part was air dried for analysis of soil chemical properties the other part was conserved as a fresh state in a refrigerator at 4 c and was used for biochemical analysis 2 4 soil analysis soil bulk density bd was measured by using a soil core sampler 100 cm3 volume to obtain natural undisturbed soil samples triplicate samples were obtained with an interval of 10 cm in the 0 20 cm soil layer and an interval of 20 cm in the 20 60 cm layer in each plot these soil samples were put into an oven for 48 h at 105 c to obtain the dry soil weight the walkley and black method walkley and black 1934 was used to measure the soc content as it is considered one of the standard methods for determining the soc content nelson and sommers 1996 especially in china wang et al 2012 this technique is less expensive and more feasible than dry combustion another method to measure the soc content but may lead to high variation in soc recovery de vos et al 2007 lettens et al 2007 five milliliters of concentrated h2so4 was mixed with a soil sample which was then weighed to 0 1 g passed through a 0 53 mm sieve and added to 5 ml 0 5 m k2cr2o7 after that tubes containing the above samples were moved into an oil bath pan maintained at 170 180 c for 5 min finally titration was conducted using feso4 solution this method provides an accurate estimate of soc with 100 recovery for most soil samples in calcareous soils of northwestern china wang et al 2012 particulate organic matter carbon poc was measured using the method described by liu et al 2014 air dried soil samples 20 g were passed through a 2 mm sieve dispersed in 60 ml of na 6 po3 6 5 g l 1 and shaken for 18 h 90 rev min 1 on a reciprocating shaker after shaking a 53 μm screen was used to sieve the soil suspension which was then washed using distilled water until clean water was obtained the residual soil on the screen was washed into an aluminum specimen box and dried at 60 c for 48 h in an oven to obtain dry soil samples the subsequent procedure to measure the carbon content in poc was similar to the method of soc content determination as described above dissolved organic carbon doc was extracted with the method described by liu et al 2014 briefly 10 g of moist soil was added to 50 g of distilled water and shaken for 1 h at 250 rev min 1 at 25 c the mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 15 000 rev min 1 to obtain the supernatant then the liquid was filtered through a 0 45 µm filterable membrane and the filtrate was measured by an elementar cn analyzer elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanua germany the microbial biomass nitrogen mbc content was evaluated by using chloroform fumigation extraction presented by vance et al 1987 for each treatment two similar portions of 20 g soil samples were weighed one portion was fumigated with ethanol free chcl3 at 25 c for 24 h and the other portion was not fumigated but analyzed simultaneously after fumigation 60 ml of 0 5 m k2so4 was used to extract the soils before filtering using filter paper 12 5 µm diameter shaking at 200 revs min 1 for 30 min was conducted the organic carbon in the extracts was determined by using dry combustion and the elementar cn analyzer elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanua germany moreover the mbc content was calculated as follows mbc ec kec where ec organic carbon extracted from fumigated soils organic carbon extracted from nonfumigated soils and kec 0 45 brookes et al 1985 2 5 annual carbon input the mean annual c input was calculated by summing all carbon sources including crop straw stubble and root as well as manure addition table 2 the carbon content of manure was confirmed by laboratory tests the straw and stubble of wheat and maize were collected from 2 7 m2 areas in each plot maize was grown for silage in this experiment hence the carbon from maize straw was zero and its residues mainly included root and stubble biomass the root biomass both wheat and maize was assumed using a relative distribution of 43 37 and 20 in grain aboveground straw and stubble residues and belowground mainly roots residues tang et al 2012 the dry weight of straw and stubble samples was weighed after air drying the calculation of c concentrations in dry matter was conducted assuming that the aboveground residues contained 44 carbon and the roots contained 38 tang et al 2012 the contributions of rhizodeposition to soil carbon concentration were ignored in this research 2 6 data

statistical analysis was carried out using spss version 25 0 ibm inc chicago usa one way analysis of variance anova was used to detect the differences between means by using the least significant difference lsd test at a significance level of p 0 05 two way anova was conducted to assess the main effects of irrigation fertilization and their interactions on soc poc doc and mbc before analysis the data were tested to satisfy normal distribution and variance homogeneity correlation relationships among soc poc doc and mbc were evaluated by using pearson s correlation coefficients other data analyses and calculations were accomplished in office 2016 microsoft corporation and figures were generated with origin 2020 3 results 3 1 residual c and fertilizer c inputs the average annual carbon inputs from fertilizer and crop residue biomasses are summarized in table 2 under the same irrigation level conditions the diversity of fertilizer types is the main reason for the difference in c inputs the quantity of c inputs increased with increasing organic manure fertilizer application in the following order c3 c2 c1 c0 moreover the quantity of returning crop residue including straw stubble and roots but not root exudates under the same fertilizer conditions showed differences owing to the different irrigation levels generally the amounts of residual carbon inputs improved with increasing irrigation frequency under the same fertilizer application moreover a numerical similarity between w3 and w2 was observed table 2 3 2 soc concentration soc concentration was affected by fertilizer management under different irrigation regimes fig 2 the soc concentration increased with increasing manure application in the 0 20 cm surface soil layer in the following order c3 c2 c1 c0 in particular c3 possessed the highest soc concentration throughout the 0 60 cm soil layer in w3 and w0 nevertheless the increasing trend of the soc concentration with increasing manure application decreased with increasing soil depth at the 60 cm soil depth no significant differences were observed among the different fertilization treatments under the four irrigation regimes table s1 the irrigation regime showed significant effects on soc concentrations in the 0 60 cm soil profile in different fertilizer groups fig 2 generally the soc concentration increased with increasing irrigation frequency this increasing trend not only occurred in the 0 20 cm surface soil but was also observed in deep soil layers across fertilization treatments however in c0 a similar increasing tendency was not observed in the 40 60 cm soil layer while there were no significant differences between w3 and w2 table s2 3 3 labile organic carbon 3 3 1 poc the distribution of poc concentration in different irrigation regimes and fertilizer types is presented in fig 3 an increase in poc concentration in surface soil 0 30 cm with increasing organic fertilizer application was observed in w3 w2 and w1 however in the deep soil layers 40 60 cm a similar increasing tendency was not observed in w0 the poc concentrations in c3 were significantly higher than those in c2 and c1 in the 0 30 cm soil layer but showed no difference from those in c0 in the deep 20 60 cm soil layer table s3 poc concentrations under different irrigation regimes sharply decreased with increasing soil depth in c3 fig 3 in c2 no significant differences were observed among the different irrigation regimes throughout the 0 60 cm soil layer in c1 and c0 the poc concentrations of w2 were the lowest compared to those of w3 w1 and w0 at the 0 60 cm soil depth moreover w0 possessed the highest values in the 0 30 cm soil but no significant differences were observed between w3 and w1 in the same soil layers table s4 3 3 2 doc in w3 w2 and w1 doc concentrations increased with increasing carbon inputs in the 0 30 cm soil fig 4 however no significant differences among the different fertilized treatments were observed in the deep soil layers 40 60 cm moreover doc concentrations sharply decreased with increasing soil depth in the 0 60 cm soil layer however the same increasing tendency of doc concentrations that increased with increasing carbon input did not occur in w0 there were no significant differences among c3 c2 c1 and c0 in the 20 60 cm soil layers in w0 although the doc concentration of c3 was significantly higher than those of c2 c1 and c0 at the 10 cm soil depth table s5 the distribution of doc concentrations affected by irrigation regime in the 0 20 cm soil layer was similar in c3 and c2 fig 4 the highest value in the 10 cm soil was exhibited in w2 which was significantly higher than those of w3 w1 and w0 by 50 52 78 67 and 117 61 in c3 and by 15 05 40 33 and 108 43 in c2 respectively table s6 in the 20 cm soil in c3 and c2 the highest value occurred in w1 and obeyed the following order w1 w2 w3 w0 however in the 30 60 cm soil layers no significant differences were observed among the different irrigation treatments in c3 and c2 in c1 and c0 doc concentrations showed no differences among w3 w2 w1 and w0 throughout the 0 60 cm soil layers 3 3 3 mbc at the 10 cm soil depth the mbc concentrations increased with increasing organic carbon inputs in w3 w2 and w1 fig 5 in the 20 cm soil the mbc concentration of c3 was the highest followed by c2 and c1 in w2 w1 and w0 however in the soil at depths greater than 20 cm the phenomenon that mbc concentrations increased with increasing carbon inputs was not observed in w3 w2 w1 and w0 moreover only in the 10 cm surface soil layer the mbc concentrations of c0 were the lowest compared with the other fertilization treatments but the same phenomenon was not observed in every deeper soil layer in c3 fig 5 the mbc concentrations in w2 were significantly higher than those in w3 w1 and w0 in the 10 cm soil layer by 51 03 43 91 and 29 70 and in the 20 cm soil layer by 66 33 39 68 and 17 94 respectively table s8 in c2 and c1 the mbc concentrations in w0 were significantly lower than those in w3 w2 and w1 in the 0 20 cm soil layer moreover in c0 there were no significant differences among w3 w2 w1 and w0 throughout the 0 60 cm soil layers 3 4 correlation analyses a positive correlation between soc and its fractions at p 0 01 was observed table 3 of all the fractions of soc poc was the most highly correlated with soc followed by doc and mbc moreover poc doc and mbc were positively and significantly correlated with each other and the highest value of the correlation coefficient was exhibited between doc and mbc fertilization and irrigation showed significant main effects on the soc concentration at the 0 60 cm soil depth table 4 a decreasing tendency of the main effects on the soc concentration from fertilization and irrigation was observed with increasing soil depth in contrast the main effects on soc concentrations from irrigation were more significant than those from fertilization in deep soil 20 60 cm for labile organic carbon fertilization showed significant main effects in the surface soil 0 20 cm while irrigation showed significant main effects in the deep soil 40 60 cm significant p 0 05 interaction effects for soc in 20 40 cm soil and labile organic carbon in 40 60 cm soil were observed and the simple effect analysis and pairwise comparisons are presented in table s9 and table s10 from the two tables an additional simple effect analysis showed that the significant mean differences in soc 20 40 cm poc 40 60 cm doc 40 60 cm and mbc 40 60 cm were mainly found between different irrigation regimes in each fertilization type 3 5 soc stock and rrseq the soc stock was significantly affected by the irrigation regime fig 6 a decreasing tendency with decreasing irrigation frequency was observed in c3 c2 c1 and c0 moreover fertilizer types showed significant effects on the soc stock fig 6 in w3 and w0 the soc stock decreased with decreasing carbon inputs however the soc stocks of c2 were significantly higher than those of c3 c1 and c0 by 8 57 25 80 and 28 58 in w2 and by 3 87 11 54 21 01 in w1 respectively moreover there were no significant differences between w2c2 and w3c1 or between w1c2 and w2c1 which suggests that there was a compensatory effect on the soc stock caused by manure application while concurrently decreasing irrigation the rrseq results affected by irrigation regime and fertilizer type are presented in fig 7 under the same fertilizer application conditions the rrseq improved with increasing irrigation frequency however the magnitude of the increment was different for various carbon inputs and obeyed the order of c3 c2 c1 which indicated that the soc sequestration rate increased with increasing carbon input 4 discussion 4 1 soc and its fractions were affected by organic carbon inputs the soc concentration in topsoil could be significantly improved by adding organic fertilizer and increased with increasing manure application under each irrigation condition fig 2 direct manure application benefits the growth of winter wheat and promotes the yield of crop residues by enhancing soc sequestration accelerating the build up of soil fertility and improving the soil physical properties cai et al 2019 chaudhary et al 2017 pagliai et al 2004 meng et al 2019 a positive residual effect shen et al 2007 of long term manure application on grain yields and the production of crop dry matter was observed in this experiment table 2 which was maintained for several years after ceasing manure application demelash et al 2014 wheat straw return to the field as a direct carbon resource every year after wheat harvesting could continuously improve soil organic matter som therefore in this study the management of organic manure application and returning wheat straw created a virtuous circle of residue production and utilization and benefited the accumulation of som it is easy to conclude that poc concentrations were significantly p 0 05 affected by the use of organic fertilizer and increased with increasing organic fertilizer application fig 3 particulate organic matter pom is primarily composed of plant derived debris gale et al 2000 the application of organic fertilizer and the return of crop residues to the field could substantially improve the pom content in the soil xie et al 2014 reported that long term manure application can induce a 21 and 107 greater increase in neutral sugar concentrations in free and occluded pom as well as more plant derived organic compounds which were enriched in pom moreover pom has been found to act as a nucleus for the formation of water stable aggregates puget et al 2000 bravo garza et al 2010 reported that pom preferentially accumulated in large macroaggregates 2000 µm relative to small macroaggregates 250 2000 µm and microaggregates 53 250 µm crop residue input increased soc mineralization and mbc activity in all three aggregate size classes sarker et al 2018 soil microbial community composition is the main driver of pom chemistry alteration and could adapt to changes in pom composition xiao et al 2017 in this study we also observed that the mbc content increased with increasing manure fertilizer application fig 5 and showed a positive correlation with poc content table 3 which may be because high poc contents provide a favorable breeding environment for microorganisms in manure application treatments mbc accounts for a small proportion of soc averaging a proportion of 2 3 anderson and domsch 2010 that usually does not exceed 4 5 of the soc content anderson 2003 nonetheless microbial biomass plays an integral role in biogeochemical cycles it is an important source of soil carbon and is closely related to the turnover of soil carbon blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2013 classified microorganisms as active potentially active dormant and dead depending on their different physiological states and noted that only active microorganisms drive the biogeochemical process active microorganisms occupied only a small percentage approximately 0 1 2 of the total soil microbial biomass without the input of easily absorbable substrates prosser et al 2007 when an organic substrate is added it leads to priming effects kuzyakov et al 2000 the fraction of potentially active microorganisms accounting for 10 40 of the total microbial biomass blagodatskaya and kuzyakov 2013 can quickly switch to an active state from an inactive state within minutes to hours and plays an important reservoir of biodiversity joergensen and wichern 2018 in this study the inputs of organic fertilizer provided exogenous organic carbon to the soil we reasonably speculate that potentially active microbial biomass was rapidly activated and switched to an active state which led to microorganism proliferation in manure application treatments and occupied more biomass relative to those without manure usage fig 5 doc is a very important component of soil dissolved organic matter dom and the turnover of doc in soils has been emphasized as the crucial approach of biogeochemical element cycling kalbitz et al 2000 the leaching of dom is usually regarded as a c source for soil microorganisms hagedorn et al 2015 this may be the reason that doc was positively significantly correlated with mbc table 3 moreover the sorption of doc to the mineral phase can contribute to the long term stabilization of som kaiser and kalbitz 2012 which may explain the positive correlation between soc and doc concentrations table 3 generally dom originates from plant litter leaching root exudates microbial detritus and som solubilization kalbitz et al 2000 sanderman and amundson 2008 in our experiment we observed that treatments with manure applications exhibited significantly p 0 05 higher doc concentrations than those without manure applications fig 4 this result is consistent with those of previous studies that reported manure amendments increased doc contents long et al 2015 therefore we can easily conclude that the application of composted manure favors doc accumulation additionally the doc contents decreased sharply with increasing soil depth as doc was almost concentrated in the near surface soil this phenomenon may be attributed to the different compositions of dom in different soil layers in near surface layers dom is produced from humus and fresh litter material however subsoil dom is composed of highly degraded organic material and seems to be the turnover of decomposition rather than a nutrient source kaiser and kalbitz 2012 little doc derived from the decomposition of fresh surface litter reaches the mineral subsoil hagedorn et al 2012 previous studies also demonstrated that topsoil dom has a near modern radiocarbon signature and thus mainly involves the latest fresh photosynthesis products while subsoil dom is usually depleted in radiocarbon which indicates the existence of compounds incorporating older carbon froberg et al 2009 sanderman et al 2008 4 2 soc and its fractions were affected by irrigation in the experimental period from 2012 to 2019 the average annual precipitation was 362 58 mm but was mainly concentrated in the summer june july and august which accounted for 75 58 of the total precipitation fig 1 during the winter wheat growing season the total precipitation in 2018 2019 59 30 mm was lower than the average precipitation in 2012 2019 88 55 mm in 2018 2019 the precipitation in the early and middle wheat growing months was not over 10 mm which can be recognized as insufficient rainfall moreover the distribution of precipitation was mainly in april but its amount still did not exceed 35 mm similarly during the wheat growing periods in 2012 2019 the precipitation was mainly concentrated in the later growing months of april and may which accounted for over half of all precipitation in the wheat growing seasons therefore the scarcity of precipitation during the early and middle growing periods of winter wheat emphasizes the importance of irrigation for the normal growth of winter wheat in this experiment soc concentrations increased with increasing irrigation frequency under different fertilizer treatments fig 2 this result may be because the increasing irrigation decreased the water deficit and increased crop water transpiration which favors wheat growth and dry matter production in both aboveground and belowground biomass sinclair 2020 roots can regulate the exudation process alone or the recapture of exudates from soil jones et al 2004 living root inputs exhibit more efficiency than litter inputs in forming soc sokol et al 2019 moreover aboveground biomass accumulation showed a positive correlation with irrigation quantity during the wheat growth period table 2 it is easy to observe that the quantity of return crop residue in the higher irrigation level treatments was higher than that in the lower irrigation levels table 2 irrigation showed a more significant main effect on soc than fertilization in deep soil 20 60 cm table 4 one reason for this phenomenon may be that the root growth at the deeper layer in irrigated soils was better than that in nonirrigated soils the soc accumulation in irrigated soils benefited from both root decomposition and living root inputs sokol et al 2019 on the other hand the infiltration of surface water promotes the transport of labile organic substrates into subsoils gross and harrison 2019 in particular the movement of doc with water is recognized as a crucial nutrient translocation mechanism kaiser and kalbitz 2012 and can support a large fraction of microbial activities in a deeper soil layer neff and asner 2001 considering that there was no irrigation and abundant rainfall to promote the movement of doc into deep soil this phenomenon may explain why a similar result happened in w3 w2 and w1 while the increase in doc concentrations with the increase in manure inputs was not observed in w0 fig 4 doc is regarded as a c resource for soil microbial biomass hagedorn et al 2015 whereas microorganisms are not only a c pool but also actively promote the process of c turnover kuzyakov 2010 the responses of microbial biomass to precipitation in previous studies are not always the same however the majority of studies reported that the microbial biomass and bacterial and fungal richness improved in response to increasing precipitation and irrigation zhang et al 2013 bell et al 2014 nielsen and ball 2015 pom is primarily composed of plant derived debris and microbial residues binding clay particles via cation bridging thus preserving som within the aggregates gale et al 2000 irrigation increased above ground productivity by enhancing transpiration sinclair 2020 and promoted the accumulation of photosynthate carbon in the fine pom soil size fraction 53 250 µm carmona et al 2020 the close association with labile organic carbon explains why poc doc and mbc were significantly correlated with each other table 3 and emphasizes the important role that irrigation plays in regulating biochemical processes and soc accumulation in the soil sorensen et al 2013 som can be physically stabilized or protected from degradation through the formation of microaggregates within macroaggregates six et al 2000 however the formation of aggregates was affected by irrigation apesteguía et al 2015 supported that the incorporation of maize derived c in small macroaggregates and microaggregates 250 2000 µm and 50 250 µm was only observed under irrigation bravo garza et al 2010 demonstrated that soils with wetting and drying cycles could enhance the number of macroaggregates thus accumulating more c in aggregates than soils with continuous moisture maintained at a field capacity of 0 40 g water g 1 a desirable soil structure and soil compaction repair can be recreated through wet dry soil cycles pillai and mcgarry 1999 in this study a physically protected mechanism owing to the formation of aggregates especially microaggregates may be established in treatments with good irrigation compared to those with poor irrigation which may finally result in the soc contents increasing with increasing amounts of irrigation we will address this possible explanation in our future studies 4 3 effects of irrigation and fertilizer on soc stock and rrseq for arable soil the soc stock is controlled by soil management such as fertilization irrigation tillage and crop rotation liu et al 2014 li et al 2016 cai et al 2019 corresponding to those of previous studies liu et al 2010 li et al 2018 lepsch et al 2019 sun et al 2021 our results showed that adding organic manure can significantly increase the soc stock fig 6 in w3 and w0 the soc stock increased with increasing manure application however in w2 and w1 the highest value of soc stock occurred in c2 this result was most likely due to the high soc content in the deep soil layer fig 2 and the relatively high bd in deep soil for c2 in w2 and w1 table 1 this result corresponds to those of previous studies where manure application increased the soc concentration and mineral fertilizer application increased the bulk density li et al 2018 sarkar et al 2003 on the other hand the substitution of manure for mineral fertilizer increased the nitrogen use efficiency not only for the manure but also for the mineral fertilizer kong et al 2021 webb et al 2013 thus favoring the organic matter accumulation in the soil the soc stock decreased with decreasing irrigation frequency for each fertilizer type in this study fig 6 which can be attributed to the higher soc contents in well irrigated treatments than in those with poor irrigation fig 2 this result indicated that the irrigation regime plays a crucial role in regulating the soc stock both with manure and without manure application in particular the soc stock in w2c2 showed no difference from that in w3c1 and the soc stock in w1c2 was higher but showed no significant difference from that in w2c1 this result suggests a compensatory effect on the soc stock caused by cattle manure application that is similar to the effect of increasing irrigation frequency however there was no significant interaction between irrigation regimes and fertilization types on soc in the 0 60 cm soil layer we think the main reason for this phenomenon is that the extremely significant main effects from irrigation and manure application masked the weak interaction effect in the dryland cropping system irrigation plays a vital role in carbon accumulation while water is the primary limiting factor for crop growth and realizing the positive effects of n fertilizer mueller et al 2012 qiu et al 2018 liang et al 2021 especially in this experimental region the water needs for winter wheat were mainly met by irrigation due to the dry weather conditions the result of our experiment also demonstrated that the carbon accumulation in grain and straw was distinctly increased with increasing irrigation on the other hand we think that the manure application gradient was too low to measure the interaction effects in this experiment manure application can greatly contribute to soc buildup chaudhary et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 but manure was only applied in c2 and c3 and the amount in c3 was twice that in c2 nonetheless between c2 and c3 similar sequestration rates and interaction effects on soc were observed from w2 to w3 although the interaction was not significant fig s1 we suspect that by increasing the number of treatments that contain higher substitution ratios of manure to nitrogen fertilizer the interaction between irrigation and fertilization would be more pronounced further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis rrseq was closely related to soc concentrations and soc stock in the soil the result in this experiment corresponds to those of previous studies suggesting that organic manure inputs can significantly improve soc accumulation and increase the soc sequestration rate li et al 2018 cai et al 2019 the relative soc sequestration rate increased with increasing irrigation frequency remarkably the rate of increase in c2 was close to that in c3 while the amount of manure applied in c2 was half as much as that in c3 this result may be due to the increased carbon accumulation in c2 promoting high nitrogen use efficiency although this hypothesis needs further research regarding the effects of irrigation most research has reported that increasing irrigation could benefit soc sequestration with mineral fertilizer application giubergia et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2018 however when coupled with organic manure the effects of irrigation on soc accumulation were inconsistent and rarely reported in our study the results showed that the soc sequestration rate increased with increasing irrigation regimes under both manure and mineral fertilizer application in contrast sun et al 2021 reported that soc accumulation increased when composted manure was applied following reduced irrigation the different results may be due to the different types of organic manure fertilizer the diverse doses of organic carbon inputs or the different degrees of water stress between the two experiments to the best of our knowledge this is the first field study focused on the effects of various fertilizer types on soc sequestration regulated by multiple gradient irrigation regimes this result will draw increasing attention to irrigation strategies when applying organic manure to improve soil quality in future research 5 conclusion in this study increasing both the irrigation frequency and manure application can promote soc stocks in the 0 60 cm soil layer fertilization mainly affects labile organic carbon in the 0 20 cm soil layer but irrigation mainly affects labile organic carbon in the 40 60 cm soil layer the lack of significant difference in soc stock between w2c2 and w3c1 and between w1c2 and w2c1 indicates that there was a compensatory effect of manure application on soc stock reduction caused by decreasing irrigation frequency furthermore the level of manure application in the c3 and c2 treatments resulted in a similar soc sequestration rate in summary soc stocks can be enhanced by applying manure instead of increasing irrigation in dryland areas and substituting half of the manure for mineral fertilizer is a promising way to increase carbon sequestration the results of this study may provide theoretical support and guidelines for water and fertilizer

9536,the nonuniformity of drip irrigation that is highly dependent on lateral layouts has been a concern for secondary soil salinization in arid regions the effects of spatial variabilities in drip irrigated water and soil properties on soil salt content ssc distribution were therefore evaluated at a typical operational scale of subunits for a drip irrigation system two types of subunits with different lateral layouts one with single end feeding laterals s1 and one with dual end feeding laterals s2 were investigated during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons of mulch drip irrigated cotton under arid environments the distribution of the irrigation amount and ssc at the initial stage prior to the first drip irrigation and during the boll opening stage of cotton and the soil particle size distribution and bulk density in the subunits with different water feeding modes were determined the results revealed that the christianson uniformity coefficients cus of the emitter discharge rate for s2 were 4 7 higher than those for s1 even when the area of s2 was 1 5 times that of s1 the more nonuniformly distributed irrigation water for s1 produced a more dispersed distribution of ssc with cv ranging from 0 23 to 0 82 which was noticeably higher than the range of 0 13 0 34 for s2 the partial least squares analysis results demonstrated that the importance of the factors on the spatial variability of ssc followed an order of initial ssc drip irrigation water soil physical properties for s1 and initial ssc soil physical properties drip irrigation water for s2 the dual end water feeding mode reduced the potential effect of the nonuniformity of irrigation water on ssc due to the improved uniformity on the subunit scale our study suggests that the dual end feeding mode would be promising to avoid local salt harmfulness caused by the nonuniformity of ssc in the drip irrigation system keywords microirrigation salinity soil properties uniformity 1 introduction drip irrigation with high water use efficiency has been widely used in arid and semiarid areas to alleviate water stress li 2020 however salt accumulation in the root zone is still common under drip irrigation in fields with salts that are inherited from the soil parent materials zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 many studies have revealed that a higher drip irrigation level probably allows salt to migrate out of the root zone while salt is liable to accumulate in the root zone with a low drip irrigation level wang et al 2012 aragüés et al 2014 ning et al 2021 nonuniform distribution of drip irrigation water exists as an intrinsic characteristic for drip irrigation systems mainly due to head loss emitter clogging and emitter manufacturing lamm et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 sadeghi et al 2015 the effect of the nonuniform distribution of irrigation water on the distribution of soil salt content ssc has rarely been evaluated in arid and semiarid regions as the basic unit of a drip irrigation system the uniformity of drip irrigation water for subunits has been reported to vary from 60 to 80 in an in situ study wang et al 2021 it remains unclear whether the temporal and spatial variations in ssc would be affected by drip irrigation uniformity on the subunit scale under arid environments the hydraulic design of the subunit is crucially related to the irrigation uniformity on the subunit scale both the initial and management cost per unit area and the irrigation uniformity of a subunit generally decrease with the increasing area of a subunit various studies have contributed to optimizing the drip irrigation network layout in subunits to reduce the cost of irrigation systems while maintaining an acceptable irrigation uniformity chamba et al 2019 ma et al 2019 the location of manifolds was optimized in a traditional single end feeding subunit in which water was fed from one end of lateral kang et al 1996 baiamonte 2018 the dual end feeding subunit in which the water was fed from both ends of the laterals was recommended to reduce the head loss along laterals and improve the drip irrigation system performance relative to the single end feeding subunit waller and yitayew 2016 zhang et al 2020 the aforementioned studies mainly focused on optimizing the hydraulic performance of a subunit further studies are expected to evaluate the potential effect of water feeding mode and drip irrigation uniformity on the temporal and spatial variation of ssc in a subunit as a common natural phenomenon in the field the effects of the spatial variability of soil properties on the distribution of nutrients and salts in soil have attracted the attention of researchers hu et al 2005 found that the risk of groundwater contamination caused by nitrate leaching was underestimated when soil spatial variability was ignored cemek et al 2007 revealed that the soil salt content was negatively related to the distribution of soil hydraulic conductivity ks hu et al 2011 concluded that the surface soil salt content distribution was dominated by the spatial variation in soil texture under drip irrigation in arid regions soil spatial variability might improve the uniformity of soil water and nitrogen content and partly compensate for the yield reduction caused by drip irrigation nonuniformity in semihumid regions wang et al 2013 a recent study demonstrated that soil spatial variability imposed a greater effect on the distribution of ssc than a nonuniform drip irrigation amount for three lateral lengths of 40 80 and 120 m and longer laterals produced stronger spatial variability in ssc along the lateral under arid environments lin et al 2021 on the subunit scale stronger spatial variability of soil properties might exist than those on the lateral scale garten jr et al 2007 it is of great interest to study the interactive effects of soil spatial variability and nonuniform distribution of drip irrigated water on ssc in drip irrigation subunits the objectives of this study were 1 to obtain a full understanding of the distribution of ssc after one irrigation season at a subunit scale in a drip irrigation system 2 to quantify the relative effects of the nonuniform distribution of irrigation and soil properties on the characteristics of ssc under different lateral layouts and 3 to provide recommendations for the design and operation of drip irrigation systems in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field experiments were conducted in an irrigation system at the soil and water conservation monitoring station of the first division of the xinjiang production and construction corps 81 11 43 e 40 37 22 n altitude 1017 m above mean sea level the area experiences a typical extreme arid climate characterized by annual average values of 46 mm for precipitation 2218 mm for evaporation and 11 3 c for air temperature a long frost free period approximately 207 d and high sunshine hours approximately 2950 h create abundant solar and thermal resources that are conducive to extensive cotton cultivation saline soil with an average ssc content of 5 31 g kg 1 at the 0 100 cm depth is widely distributed at the test experimental station the average soil organic matter content at the 0 100 cm depth is approximately 7 2 g kg 1 to monitor air temperature precipitation solar radiation humidity and wind speed a hobo weather station with an rx3000 data logger onset bourne ma usa was installed at the station during the cotton growing season no effective rainfall event 5 mm was detected in 2018 while three effective rainfall events occurred with a total value of 22 6 mm in 2019 drip irrigation was applied for cotton that occupied most of the area of the irrigation system both the single end feeding and dual end feeding modes were extensively used for the drip irrigation network layouts one manifold was installed for water feeding of laterals in the single end subunit while in the dual end feeding subunits two manifolds were installed for water feeding of laterals fig 1 new laterals with a diameter of 16 mm and labyrinth non pressure compensating emitters were installed for drip irrigation under mulch film at cotton sowing in mid april every year groundwater with an approximate salinity of 1 27 g l 1 was the source of drip irrigated water for the irrigation system the water table of the groundwater was located 3 5 m below the surface 2 2 selection of drip irrigation subunits two drip irrigation subunits a single end feeding subunit referred to as s1 and a dual end feeding subunit referred to as s2 in the drip irrigation system were selected for the experiment during cotton gossypium hirsutum l growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 fig 1 prior to the experiment the water feeding modes were continued for each subunit for more than 3 years table 1 summarizes the lengths of manifold and lateral lateral layouts and areas of s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 s2 had a larger area than s1 in both years the irrigation and fertigation regimes and pest and weed controls during the cotton season were applied by local farmers in accordance with the conventional practices in the study area to ensure germination and emergence irrigation water 347 and 332 mm in 2018 and 254 and 212 mm in 2019 for s1 and s2 respectively was applied in mid march of each year through surface irrigation to leach salt out of the root zone for each irrigation event the average operation pressure measured at 15 locations that were uniformly distributed in a subunit by pressure gauges measuring range 0 0 400 mpa accuracy 0 40 was approximately 15 kpa for the s1 and s2 subunits in both years the flow rate of the manifold was determined using a portable ultrasonic flowmeter yoke tuf 2000h the irrigation amount averaged over the entire irrigation subunit was calculated by multiplying the flow rate of the manifold by the irrigation duration for s1 13 drip irrigation events in 2018 and 12 in 2019 were implemented resulting in seasonal irrigation of 549 and 572 mm respectively for s2 12 irrigation events were applied for both years while the irrigation amount summed to 643 and 603 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 2 2 3 field measurements during the cotton growth seasons in 2018 and 2019 five laterals spaced at 1 5 of the manifold length were selected along the manifold fig 1 approximately the first lateral tested was selected at 1 10 of the manifold length from the manifold intake seven sampling locations were determined uniformly along each selected lateral therefore a total of 35 sampling locations were generated for the measurement of emitter discharge rates soil physical properties and ssc the coordinates of the sampling locations were determined by a mobile gps toolbox v 2 6 0 xiaolang information technology co ltd shenzhen china schematic diagrams of lateral layouts and the locations of all measuring points for s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 1 2 3 1 emitter discharge rates at the bud stage june 25 in 2018 and june 25 in 2019 flowering stage july 20 in 2018 and july 20 in 2019 and peak boll setting stage august 15 in 2019 the emitter discharge rates at all sampling locations were measured to estimate the spatial distribution of irrigated water for s1 and s2 a catch can was placed in a hole that was dug in the soil under each sampled emitter emitter discharge rates were determined with a measurement duration of 15 min for each test the corresponding operation pressure of the subunit was obtained by 15 pressure gauges measuring range 0 0 400 mpa accuracy 0 40 installed at the intake middle and end of the five selected laterals the uniformity of the emitter discharge rate for s1 and s2 was characterized by the christianson uniformity coefficient cu of the emitter discharge rates christiansen 1941 the irrigation amount at each sampling location during irrigation events was estimated by multiplying the irrigation amount averaged over the entire irrigation subunit by the ratio of the emitter discharge rate at the specific sampling location to the mean emitter discharge rate of the subunit for the irrigation events without measurement of emitter discharge rate the same ratios of emitter discharge rate to the mean emitter discharge rate at each sampling location were used as those obtained in the most adjacent irrigation event tested 2 3 2 soil physical properties to acquire the spatial distribution of soil particle size soil samples at each sampling location of s1 and s2 were collected using an auger 3 2 cm in diameter at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm the particle size distribution of each soil sample that passed through a 2 mm sieve was measured by a laser method mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk bulk density at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm at each sampling location was measured using a 100 cm3 ring to obtain its spatial distribution 2 3 3 soil salt contents to analyze the discrepancy in the distribution of soil salinity before and after a drip irrigation season soil samples at all sampling locations were collected at the initial stage prior to the first drip irrigation event and at the boll opening stage approximately one month after the irrigation season ceased of cotton using an auger 3 2 cm in diameter at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm to determine the spatial distribution of soil salinity ssc g kg 1 was determined from the electrical conductivity of the 5 1 weight extract ec 5 1 ds m 1 using the empirical relationship established in the same experimental area by lin et al 2021 1 s s c 5 1367 e c 5 1 2 4 statistics and analysis 2 4 1 spatial variability mapping the spatial variability of sscs at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage were mapped with the kriging interpolation method by using arcgis v 10 2 esri inc redlands ca usa standard root mean square error rmsse was used to select the best kriging model johnston et al 2001 the rmsse was calculated by the following equation 2 r m s s e 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i σ x i 2 where z x i and z x i are the measured and predicted kriging variance at position x i respectively with a standard error of σ x i and n is the number of sampling points an rmsse closer to 1 0 illustrated a higher prediction accuracy of the model 2 4 2 partial least squares pls analysis the pls was applied to quantify the impact of the distribution of irrigation amount and spatial variability of soil particle size distribution bulk density and initial ssc on the spatial distribution of ssc during the boll opening stage at depths of 0 60 cm the main root zone and 60 100 cm for the two types of irrigation subunits the determination coefficient r 2 was used to describe the goodness of fit of the pls models the f ratio test was used to prove the predictive capability of independent variables for the dependent variable in pls model fitting and statistical analysis including r 2 calculation and the f ratio test were performed using matlab v r2016b mathworks inc natick cm usa variable importance of projection vip was used to prove the most influential predictor variables for ssc at the boll opening stage larger vip values reveal a greater influence of independent variables on the dependent variable variables having a vip 0 8 were considered important and those with vip 1 2 mkhabela et al 2018 were defined as the most critical factors in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of emitter discharge rates fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the emitter discharge rates of the second measurement for s1 and s2 in 2018 similar results were obtained for the other tests the emitter discharge rates ranged from 0 46 to 1 33 and 0 60 1 32 l h 1 for the s1 and s2 subunits respectively the high value zone of the emitter discharge rate was found adjacent to the water intakes while the low value zone was far from the intakes for both s1 and s2 this could probably be attributed to the decreasing pressure head with increasing distance from the water intake lamm et al 2007 the emitter discharge rate generally decreased along both the manifold and lateral directions for the s1 subunit for the s2 subunit however the emitter discharge rate generally decreased from both ends of lateral to the middle of laterals this indicates that the dual end water feeding mode probably alleviated the pressure head loss along laterals in the subunit which has been reported by waller and yitayew 2016 and zhang et al 2020 more obvious variation in emitter discharge rates was observed for s1 than s2 indicating a positive effect of the dual end water feeding mode on improving the drip irrigation uniformity fig 3 table 2 shows the maximum minimum mean and cu of the emitter discharge rates for s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 the cu of emitter discharge rates decreased with time for both types of subunits during both irrigation seasons this was probably attributed to progressively increasing emitter clogging during the irrigation season wang et al 2021 lower cus were obtained for s1 than for s2 during the cotton growth period in both seasons for instance the cu of 83 for s1 in 2018 in the first test was obviously lower than that for s2 with a cu of 88 this demonstrated a more nonuniformly distributed irrigation water in the subunit with the single end water feeding mode than in the subunit with the dual end water feeding mode 3 2 spatial variation in soil physical properties descriptive statistics of soil physical properties at soil depths of 0 100 cm for s1 and s2 are summarized in table 3 approximately similar soil physical properties were observed for both subunits more than 90 of the soil particle size was occupied by soil sand and silt the soil textures were classified as sandy loam at different soil depths in the 0 100 cm profile agreeing well with the typical soil type which was liable to be salinized in arid regions hu et al 2011 the cvs of the soil sand silt and clay contents in the 0 100 cm soil profile were between 0 10 and 1 00 revealing moderate spatial variability hillel 1980 the cvs of less than 0 10 for soil bulk density demonstrated its low spatial variability similar ranges of cvs of all four soil physical properties were observed for s1 and s2 for example the cvs of the soil silt content in the 0 100 cm profile were 0 20 0 53 and 0 26 0 53 for s1 and s2 respectively no obvious increase in spatial variability was detected with increasing area as s2 had 1 5 times the area of s1 3 3 spatial variations in soil salt contents fig 4 depicts the spatial distribution of ssc at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage in the 0 100 cm profile and the rmsses of the spatial prediction models for s1 and s2 in 2018 a similar distribution of ssc was observed for each subunit in 2019 the acceptability and availability of the spatial prediction models were proven by their rmsses approaching 1 0 ranging from 0 95 to 1 14 demonstrating the accurate description of the spatial variation in soil salinity at the scale of the drip irrigation subunit fig 4 fig 5 illustrates the descriptive statistics of ssc at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage in the 0 100 cm profile for s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 prior to the first irrigation event obvious spatial variabilities in ssc were observed in the 0 100 cm soil profile for both subunits fig 4 a e and k o ssc at the initial stage presented moderate spatial variability with cv ranging from 0 24 to 0 67 and from 0 22 to 0 26 for the s1 and s2 subunits in 2018 respectively fig 5 a and e similar moderate spatial variability in ssc was reported on a field scale in xinjiang china li et al 2009 for both subunits the autocorrelation structure of the spatial distribution of ssc might exist to some extent for example ssc was generally observed to increase from the northeast to the southwest for the s2 subunit fig 4 k o the autocorrelation of ssc at the field scale might mainly originate from the autocorrelation of basic soil properties including the soil particle size distribution and bulk density this agreed well with cemek et al 2007 who found consistency in the spatial variation in soil salinity with basic soil properties for the s1 subunit the randomness of ssc may be higher than s2 especially in the 40 100 cm soil profile in which sharp variation in soil salinity distribution often occurred in the subunit fig 4 c e the results were consistent with higher cvs and interquartile ranges between the first quartile q25 and the third quartile q75 of ssc for s1 than those for s2 in the 0 100 cm profile in both years fig 5 a c e and g since similar spatial variations in basic physical properties were observed for s1 and s2 table 3 this difference might result from the cumulative influence of the higher nonuniformity of irrigation water in s1 with a single end water feeding mode during precedent growing seasons on ssc at the initial stage of the current season no obvious change in the average ssc at a specific depth at the boll opening stage was detected in 2018 and 2019 relative to the initial values for both subunits fig 5 for example the average ssc over the 0 100 cm soil profile in 2018 was 4 35 and 4 36 g kg 1 at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage for the s2 subunit respectively while the corresponding values were 7 10 and 7 03 g kg 1 in 2019 this minute change in the average ssc indicated a rough salt balance during one growing season for both subunits under the typical irrigation regimes with irrigation amounts ranging from approximately 550 to 650 mm despite the difference in the value of ssc during the two seasons compared with the initial stage the distribution of ssc changed significantly for the s1 subunit at several specific soil depths at the boll opening stage the ssc generally increased with the distance from the water intake along the lateral and manifold in the 0 60 cm profile lower ssc values were observed than the initial values in the zones near the water intake in 0 60 cm for s1 the low value zone of ssc for s1 was consistent with the zone with a higher irrigation amount fig 3a this suggests that salt in the soil leached out of the 0 60 cm soil profile due to the higher irrigation amount near the water intake a great effect of the irrigation amount on the leaching of salt in soil has also been observed in many other studies wang et al 2012 2018 ning et al 2021 in zones far from the water intake however a slight increase in ssc was observed in the 0 60 cm profile this was due to the upward migration of salt from the deep soil under strong evapotranspiration and a relatively lower irrigation amount chen et al 2010 yang et al 2019 a more discrete distribution of soil salinity could also be confirmed by the increased difference between the median and mean ssc especially at the 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths for s1 fig 5 a d despite the great effect of the nonuniform distribution of irrigated water on the spatial distribution of ssc the consistency of ssc at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage could also be detected for s1 for example relatively higher sscs were observed in the 0 60 cm soil profile in southwest s1 both at the initial stage and the boll opening stage this demonstrates the possible effects of soil properties and initial ssc on ssc at the boll opening stage for the s2 subunit fewer effects of irrigation on the spatial distribution of ssc at the boll opening stage were observed than those for s1 even though the cumulative irrigation amount of s2 was 94 mm higher than that of s1 in 2018 fig 1 only ssc at the 0 20 cm soil depth was obviously affected by the distribution of irrigated water the relatively higher emitter discharge rates near water intake 2 produced lower ssc 0 78 3 19 g kg 1 while the relatively lower emitter discharge rates at the middle of the laterals produced higher ssc 4 77 6 18 g kg 1 at the 0 20 cm depth fig 4 p at the 20 100 cm soil depth the spatial distribution of ssc was probably affected by the coupling effect of soil spatial variability and irrigation amount distribution for example the obviously lower ssc near the west edge of the s2 subunit at a soil depth of 40 100 cm was probably associated with specific soil properties rather than relatively lower emitter discharge rates fig 4 r t few differences in the interquartile ranges of ssc were observed at the boll opening stage relative to those at the initial stage for s2 fig 5 e h this indicates that the improved irrigation uniformity by the dual end water feeding mode probably avoids increasing the nonuniformity of ssc on the subunit scale 3 4 importance of irrigation amount and soil properties to soil salinity fig 6 illustrates the vip values of the cumulative irrigation amount initial ssc and soil physical properties on ssc at the boll opening stage for the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil depths and the r 2 and the f ratio test statistic of each pls model for s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 the r 2 ranged from 0 13 to 0 60 and the f ratio statistics were so high exceeding the threshold 2 236 that the null hypothesis was rejected for all pls models indicating the validity and acceptability of the models fig 6 for the s1 subunit the spatial distribution of the irrigation amount played a critical with a vip value 1 2 or important role 0 8 vip 1 2 on the ssc averaged over the root zone 0 60 cm and deep soil 60 100 cm at the boll opening stage this was illustrated by the high vip values of the cumulative irrigation amount ia in the root zone 1 36 and 1 16 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and deep soil 0 85 and 1 68 in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 6 this result agreed well with the lower ssc near the water intake and the relatively higher ssc far from the water intake for s1 fig 4 f h for the s2 subunit however relatively lower vip values of ia were observed than those for s1 in both years the vip values of ia were substantially lower than 1 2 in deep soil in 2018 and in the 0 100 cm profile in 2019 fig 6 f h this indicates that the dual end water feeding mode probably reduced the potential effect of the nonuniformity of irrigation water on ssc due to the improved uniformity on the subunit scale the relatively higher vip value of ia in the root zone in 2018 was probably attributed to the higher cumulative irrigation amount of 643 mm than that in 2019 in addition the increasing impact of a higher irrigation amount on the spatial variation in ssc could be confirmed by the higher vip value of ia in deep soil in 2019 572 mm than in 2018 549 mm for s1 for both subunits the spatial variability of the soil particle size distribution soil bulk density and initial ssc imposed a great effect on the distribution of ssc at the boll opening stage in 2018 and 2019 three soil properties including initial ssc soil sand content and soil silt content imposed critical effects with vip values 1 2 on ssc in the root zone for the s1 subunit in 2018 in addition to cumulative irrigation similar higher vip values of soil properties were also observed for the s2 subunit the initial ssc always produced the most important effect on ssc in the root zone at the boll opening stage on the subunit scale while the vip values of the initial ssc at the 0 60 cm depth isc r ranked first for s1 in both years and for s2 in 2019 this result agreed with a previous study conducted on a lateral scale which indicated the great effect of initial salinity on ssc at the boll opening stage lin et al 2021 for the s1 subunit lower vip values were generally observed for the soil particle size distribution and bulk density in the root zone than those for the cumulative irrigation amount fig 6 a c this showed a greater effect of the nonuniform distribution of irrigated water than soil properties in a single end feeding subunit for the s2 subunit however the vip values of the cumulative irrigation amount were lower than those of the soil particle size distribution this indicates that soil physical properties imposed a greater effect on ssc on the field scale with more uniformly distributed irrigated water for both subunits the soil properties in the deep soil could impose a great effect on ssc in the root zone and vice versa this demonstrated a complex migration of soil salt in the soil profile under irrigation and evapotranspiration during the growing season in general the importance of the factors on the spatial distribution of ssc at the boll opening stage followed an order of initial ssc drip irrigation water soil physical properties and initial ssc soil physical properties drip irrigation water for s1 and s2 respectively this indicates that the initial ssc was one dominant factor affecting ssc distribution in subunits with different water feeding modes the results agreed well with li et al 2007 who found a similar spatial structure of soil salinity variability on three sampling dates in one year on the field scale the soil physical properties imposed less effect on ssc distribution in s1 than in s2 with higher irrigation uniformity the application of a dual end feeding mode would help to maintain a relatively uniform distribution of ssc and avoid local salt harmfulness caused by nonuniformity of ssc on the subunit scale in saine farmland in arid regions high soil salinity is likely to impose a negative effect on crop growth and reduce crop yield by affecting root water uptake and the toxic effect of specific salt ions on crops mmolawa and or 2000 ning et al 2021 the potential local salt harmfulness caused by the nonuniform distribution of irrigation might enhance the negative effect of system uniformity on crop yield on the subunit scale to maintain an acceptably low ssc in the root zone a much larger amount of water than crop requirement is usually applied to guarantee salt leaching for the whole subunit this would probably not only waste water resources but also cause obvious nutrient leaching in arid regions in this context the subunit with dual end feeding laterals might have the potential to avoid crop yield loss and low water and fertilizer use efficiency further efforts are needed to optimize technical parameters e g operation pressure lateral length and area of subunit for the application of the dual end feeding mode in arid regions with consideration of the spatial variability of soil properties crop yield and economic benefits of the dual end feeding subunit 4 conclusions field experiments were conducted in a single end feeding subunit s1 and a dual end feeding subunit s2 under arid environments the spatial distribution characteristics of ssc following an irrigation season and its response to the spatial distribution of drip irrigated water initial ssc and soil physical properties on the irrigation subunit scale were evaluated the following conclusions were supported by this study 1 greater variations in emitter discharge rates were observed in s1 than in s2 the cus of the emitter discharge rate for s2 were 4 7 higher than those for s1 while s2 had 1 5 times the area of s1 the relatively higher nonuniformity of drip irrigated water applied for s1 resulted in obvious salt leaching and accumulation regions near and far from the water intake respectively more dispersed soil salinity distribution was produced in a single end feeding subunit than in the dual end feeding subunit 2 the importance of the factors on the spatial variability of ssc after an irrigation season followed the order of initial ssc drip irrigation water soil physical properties and initial ssc soil physical properties drip irrigation water for s1 and s2 respectively the dual end water feeding mode reduced the potential effect of the nonuniformity of irrigation water on ssc due to the improved uniformity on the subunit scale the application of the dual end feeding mode would be promising to avoid local salt harmfulness caused by nonuniformity of ssc in the drip irrigation system declaration of competing interest the

9536,the nonuniformity of drip irrigation that is highly dependent on lateral layouts has been a concern for secondary soil salinization in arid regions the effects of spatial variabilities in drip irrigated water and soil properties on soil salt content ssc distribution were therefore evaluated at a typical operational scale of subunits for a drip irrigation system two types of subunits with different lateral layouts one with single end feeding laterals s1 and one with dual end feeding laterals s2 were investigated during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons of mulch drip irrigated cotton under arid environments the distribution of the irrigation amount and ssc at the initial stage prior to the first drip irrigation and during the boll opening stage of cotton and the soil particle size distribution and bulk density in the subunits with different water feeding modes were determined the results revealed that the christianson uniformity coefficients cus of the emitter discharge rate for s2 were 4 7 higher than those for s1 even when the area of s2 was 1 5 times that of s1 the more nonuniformly distributed irrigation water for s1 produced a more dispersed distribution of ssc with cv ranging from 0 23 to 0 82 which was noticeably higher than the range of 0 13 0 34 for s2 the partial least squares analysis results demonstrated that the importance of the factors on the spatial variability of ssc followed an order of initial ssc drip irrigation water soil physical properties for s1 and initial ssc soil physical properties drip irrigation water for s2 the dual end water feeding mode reduced the potential effect of the nonuniformity of irrigation water on ssc due to the improved uniformity on the subunit scale our study suggests that the dual end feeding mode would be promising to avoid local salt harmfulness caused by the nonuniformity of ssc in the drip irrigation system keywords microirrigation salinity soil properties uniformity 1 introduction drip irrigation with high water use efficiency has been widely used in arid and semiarid areas to alleviate water stress li 2020 however salt accumulation in the root zone is still common under drip irrigation in fields with salts that are inherited from the soil parent materials zhang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 many studies have revealed that a higher drip irrigation level probably allows salt to migrate out of the root zone while salt is liable to accumulate in the root zone with a low drip irrigation level wang et al 2012 aragüés et al 2014 ning et al 2021 nonuniform distribution of drip irrigation water exists as an intrinsic characteristic for drip irrigation systems mainly due to head loss emitter clogging and emitter manufacturing lamm et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 sadeghi et al 2015 the effect of the nonuniform distribution of irrigation water on the distribution of soil salt content ssc has rarely been evaluated in arid and semiarid regions as the basic unit of a drip irrigation system the uniformity of drip irrigation water for subunits has been reported to vary from 60 to 80 in an in situ study wang et al 2021 it remains unclear whether the temporal and spatial variations in ssc would be affected by drip irrigation uniformity on the subunit scale under arid environments the hydraulic design of the subunit is crucially related to the irrigation uniformity on the subunit scale both the initial and management cost per unit area and the irrigation uniformity of a subunit generally decrease with the increasing area of a subunit various studies have contributed to optimizing the drip irrigation network layout in subunits to reduce the cost of irrigation systems while maintaining an acceptable irrigation uniformity chamba et al 2019 ma et al 2019 the location of manifolds was optimized in a traditional single end feeding subunit in which water was fed from one end of lateral kang et al 1996 baiamonte 2018 the dual end feeding subunit in which the water was fed from both ends of the laterals was recommended to reduce the head loss along laterals and improve the drip irrigation system performance relative to the single end feeding subunit waller and yitayew 2016 zhang et al 2020 the aforementioned studies mainly focused on optimizing the hydraulic performance of a subunit further studies are expected to evaluate the potential effect of water feeding mode and drip irrigation uniformity on the temporal and spatial variation of ssc in a subunit as a common natural phenomenon in the field the effects of the spatial variability of soil properties on the distribution of nutrients and salts in soil have attracted the attention of researchers hu et al 2005 found that the risk of groundwater contamination caused by nitrate leaching was underestimated when soil spatial variability was ignored cemek et al 2007 revealed that the soil salt content was negatively related to the distribution of soil hydraulic conductivity ks hu et al 2011 concluded that the surface soil salt content distribution was dominated by the spatial variation in soil texture under drip irrigation in arid regions soil spatial variability might improve the uniformity of soil water and nitrogen content and partly compensate for the yield reduction caused by drip irrigation nonuniformity in semihumid regions wang et al 2013 a recent study demonstrated that soil spatial variability imposed a greater effect on the distribution of ssc than a nonuniform drip irrigation amount for three lateral lengths of 40 80 and 120 m and longer laterals produced stronger spatial variability in ssc along the lateral under arid environments lin et al 2021 on the subunit scale stronger spatial variability of soil properties might exist than those on the lateral scale garten jr et al 2007 it is of great interest to study the interactive effects of soil spatial variability and nonuniform distribution of drip irrigated water on ssc in drip irrigation subunits the objectives of this study were 1 to obtain a full understanding of the distribution of ssc after one irrigation season at a subunit scale in a drip irrigation system 2 to quantify the relative effects of the nonuniform distribution of irrigation and soil properties on the characteristics of ssc under different lateral layouts and 3 to provide recommendations for the design and operation of drip irrigation systems in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area field experiments were conducted in an irrigation system at the soil and water conservation monitoring station of the first division of the xinjiang production and construction corps 81 11 43 e 40 37 22 n altitude 1017 m above mean sea level the area experiences a typical extreme arid climate characterized by annual average values of 46 mm for precipitation 2218 mm for evaporation and 11 3 c for air temperature a long frost free period approximately 207 d and high sunshine hours approximately 2950 h create abundant solar and thermal resources that are conducive to extensive cotton cultivation saline soil with an average ssc content of 5 31 g kg 1 at the 0 100 cm depth is widely distributed at the test experimental station the average soil organic matter content at the 0 100 cm depth is approximately 7 2 g kg 1 to monitor air temperature precipitation solar radiation humidity and wind speed a hobo weather station with an rx3000 data logger onset bourne ma usa was installed at the station during the cotton growing season no effective rainfall event 5 mm was detected in 2018 while three effective rainfall events occurred with a total value of 22 6 mm in 2019 drip irrigation was applied for cotton that occupied most of the area of the irrigation system both the single end feeding and dual end feeding modes were extensively used for the drip irrigation network layouts one manifold was installed for water feeding of laterals in the single end subunit while in the dual end feeding subunits two manifolds were installed for water feeding of laterals fig 1 new laterals with a diameter of 16 mm and labyrinth non pressure compensating emitters were installed for drip irrigation under mulch film at cotton sowing in mid april every year groundwater with an approximate salinity of 1 27 g l 1 was the source of drip irrigated water for the irrigation system the water table of the groundwater was located 3 5 m below the surface 2 2 selection of drip irrigation subunits two drip irrigation subunits a single end feeding subunit referred to as s1 and a dual end feeding subunit referred to as s2 in the drip irrigation system were selected for the experiment during cotton gossypium hirsutum l growing seasons in 2018 and 2019 fig 1 prior to the experiment the water feeding modes were continued for each subunit for more than 3 years table 1 summarizes the lengths of manifold and lateral lateral layouts and areas of s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 s2 had a larger area than s1 in both years the irrigation and fertigation regimes and pest and weed controls during the cotton season were applied by local farmers in accordance with the conventional practices in the study area to ensure germination and emergence irrigation water 347 and 332 mm in 2018 and 254 and 212 mm in 2019 for s1 and s2 respectively was applied in mid march of each year through surface irrigation to leach salt out of the root zone for each irrigation event the average operation pressure measured at 15 locations that were uniformly distributed in a subunit by pressure gauges measuring range 0 0 400 mpa accuracy 0 40 was approximately 15 kpa for the s1 and s2 subunits in both years the flow rate of the manifold was determined using a portable ultrasonic flowmeter yoke tuf 2000h the irrigation amount averaged over the entire irrigation subunit was calculated by multiplying the flow rate of the manifold by the irrigation duration for s1 13 drip irrigation events in 2018 and 12 in 2019 were implemented resulting in seasonal irrigation of 549 and 572 mm respectively for s2 12 irrigation events were applied for both years while the irrigation amount summed to 643 and 603 mm in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 2 2 3 field measurements during the cotton growth seasons in 2018 and 2019 five laterals spaced at 1 5 of the manifold length were selected along the manifold fig 1 approximately the first lateral tested was selected at 1 10 of the manifold length from the manifold intake seven sampling locations were determined uniformly along each selected lateral therefore a total of 35 sampling locations were generated for the measurement of emitter discharge rates soil physical properties and ssc the coordinates of the sampling locations were determined by a mobile gps toolbox v 2 6 0 xiaolang information technology co ltd shenzhen china schematic diagrams of lateral layouts and the locations of all measuring points for s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 are shown in fig 1 2 3 1 emitter discharge rates at the bud stage june 25 in 2018 and june 25 in 2019 flowering stage july 20 in 2018 and july 20 in 2019 and peak boll setting stage august 15 in 2019 the emitter discharge rates at all sampling locations were measured to estimate the spatial distribution of irrigated water for s1 and s2 a catch can was placed in a hole that was dug in the soil under each sampled emitter emitter discharge rates were determined with a measurement duration of 15 min for each test the corresponding operation pressure of the subunit was obtained by 15 pressure gauges measuring range 0 0 400 mpa accuracy 0 40 installed at the intake middle and end of the five selected laterals the uniformity of the emitter discharge rate for s1 and s2 was characterized by the christianson uniformity coefficient cu of the emitter discharge rates christiansen 1941 the irrigation amount at each sampling location during irrigation events was estimated by multiplying the irrigation amount averaged over the entire irrigation subunit by the ratio of the emitter discharge rate at the specific sampling location to the mean emitter discharge rate of the subunit for the irrigation events without measurement of emitter discharge rate the same ratios of emitter discharge rate to the mean emitter discharge rate at each sampling location were used as those obtained in the most adjacent irrigation event tested 2 3 2 soil physical properties to acquire the spatial distribution of soil particle size soil samples at each sampling location of s1 and s2 were collected using an auger 3 2 cm in diameter at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm the particle size distribution of each soil sample that passed through a 2 mm sieve was measured by a laser method mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk bulk density at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm at each sampling location was measured using a 100 cm3 ring to obtain its spatial distribution 2 3 3 soil salt contents to analyze the discrepancy in the distribution of soil salinity before and after a drip irrigation season soil samples at all sampling locations were collected at the initial stage prior to the first drip irrigation event and at the boll opening stage approximately one month after the irrigation season ceased of cotton using an auger 3 2 cm in diameter at depths of 0 20 20 40 40 60 60 80 and 80 100 cm to determine the spatial distribution of soil salinity ssc g kg 1 was determined from the electrical conductivity of the 5 1 weight extract ec 5 1 ds m 1 using the empirical relationship established in the same experimental area by lin et al 2021 1 s s c 5 1367 e c 5 1 2 4 statistics and analysis 2 4 1 spatial variability mapping the spatial variability of sscs at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage were mapped with the kriging interpolation method by using arcgis v 10 2 esri inc redlands ca usa standard root mean square error rmsse was used to select the best kriging model johnston et al 2001 the rmsse was calculated by the following equation 2 r m s s e 1 n i 1 n z x i z x i σ x i 2 where z x i and z x i are the measured and predicted kriging variance at position x i respectively with a standard error of σ x i and n is the number of sampling points an rmsse closer to 1 0 illustrated a higher prediction accuracy of the model 2 4 2 partial least squares pls analysis the pls was applied to quantify the impact of the distribution of irrigation amount and spatial variability of soil particle size distribution bulk density and initial ssc on the spatial distribution of ssc during the boll opening stage at depths of 0 60 cm the main root zone and 60 100 cm for the two types of irrigation subunits the determination coefficient r 2 was used to describe the goodness of fit of the pls models the f ratio test was used to prove the predictive capability of independent variables for the dependent variable in pls model fitting and statistical analysis including r 2 calculation and the f ratio test were performed using matlab v r2016b mathworks inc natick cm usa variable importance of projection vip was used to prove the most influential predictor variables for ssc at the boll opening stage larger vip values reveal a greater influence of independent variables on the dependent variable variables having a vip 0 8 were considered important and those with vip 1 2 mkhabela et al 2018 were defined as the most critical factors in this study 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatial distribution of emitter discharge rates fig 3 shows the spatial distribution of the emitter discharge rates of the second measurement for s1 and s2 in 2018 similar results were obtained for the other tests the emitter discharge rates ranged from 0 46 to 1 33 and 0 60 1 32 l h 1 for the s1 and s2 subunits respectively the high value zone of the emitter discharge rate was found adjacent to the water intakes while the low value zone was far from the intakes for both s1 and s2 this could probably be attributed to the decreasing pressure head with increasing distance from the water intake lamm et al 2007 the emitter discharge rate generally decreased along both the manifold and lateral directions for the s1 subunit for the s2 subunit however the emitter discharge rate generally decreased from both ends of lateral to the middle of laterals this indicates that the dual end water feeding mode probably alleviated the pressure head loss along laterals in the subunit which has been reported by waller and yitayew 2016 and zhang et al 2020 more obvious variation in emitter discharge rates was observed for s1 than s2 indicating a positive effect of the dual end water feeding mode on improving the drip irrigation uniformity fig 3 table 2 shows the maximum minimum mean and cu of the emitter discharge rates for s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 the cu of emitter discharge rates decreased with time for both types of subunits during both irrigation seasons this was probably attributed to progressively increasing emitter clogging during the irrigation season wang et al 2021 lower cus were obtained for s1 than for s2 during the cotton growth period in both seasons for instance the cu of 83 for s1 in 2018 in the first test was obviously lower than that for s2 with a cu of 88 this demonstrated a more nonuniformly distributed irrigation water in the subunit with the single end water feeding mode than in the subunit with the dual end water feeding mode 3 2 spatial variation in soil physical properties descriptive statistics of soil physical properties at soil depths of 0 100 cm for s1 and s2 are summarized in table 3 approximately similar soil physical properties were observed for both subunits more than 90 of the soil particle size was occupied by soil sand and silt the soil textures were classified as sandy loam at different soil depths in the 0 100 cm profile agreeing well with the typical soil type which was liable to be salinized in arid regions hu et al 2011 the cvs of the soil sand silt and clay contents in the 0 100 cm soil profile were between 0 10 and 1 00 revealing moderate spatial variability hillel 1980 the cvs of less than 0 10 for soil bulk density demonstrated its low spatial variability similar ranges of cvs of all four soil physical properties were observed for s1 and s2 for example the cvs of the soil silt content in the 0 100 cm profile were 0 20 0 53 and 0 26 0 53 for s1 and s2 respectively no obvious increase in spatial variability was detected with increasing area as s2 had 1 5 times the area of s1 3 3 spatial variations in soil salt contents fig 4 depicts the spatial distribution of ssc at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage in the 0 100 cm profile and the rmsses of the spatial prediction models for s1 and s2 in 2018 a similar distribution of ssc was observed for each subunit in 2019 the acceptability and availability of the spatial prediction models were proven by their rmsses approaching 1 0 ranging from 0 95 to 1 14 demonstrating the accurate description of the spatial variation in soil salinity at the scale of the drip irrigation subunit fig 4 fig 5 illustrates the descriptive statistics of ssc at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage in the 0 100 cm profile for s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 prior to the first irrigation event obvious spatial variabilities in ssc were observed in the 0 100 cm soil profile for both subunits fig 4 a e and k o ssc at the initial stage presented moderate spatial variability with cv ranging from 0 24 to 0 67 and from 0 22 to 0 26 for the s1 and s2 subunits in 2018 respectively fig 5 a and e similar moderate spatial variability in ssc was reported on a field scale in xinjiang china li et al 2009 for both subunits the autocorrelation structure of the spatial distribution of ssc might exist to some extent for example ssc was generally observed to increase from the northeast to the southwest for the s2 subunit fig 4 k o the autocorrelation of ssc at the field scale might mainly originate from the autocorrelation of basic soil properties including the soil particle size distribution and bulk density this agreed well with cemek et al 2007 who found consistency in the spatial variation in soil salinity with basic soil properties for the s1 subunit the randomness of ssc may be higher than s2 especially in the 40 100 cm soil profile in which sharp variation in soil salinity distribution often occurred in the subunit fig 4 c e the results were consistent with higher cvs and interquartile ranges between the first quartile q25 and the third quartile q75 of ssc for s1 than those for s2 in the 0 100 cm profile in both years fig 5 a c e and g since similar spatial variations in basic physical properties were observed for s1 and s2 table 3 this difference might result from the cumulative influence of the higher nonuniformity of irrigation water in s1 with a single end water feeding mode during precedent growing seasons on ssc at the initial stage of the current season no obvious change in the average ssc at a specific depth at the boll opening stage was detected in 2018 and 2019 relative to the initial values for both subunits fig 5 for example the average ssc over the 0 100 cm soil profile in 2018 was 4 35 and 4 36 g kg 1 at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage for the s2 subunit respectively while the corresponding values were 7 10 and 7 03 g kg 1 in 2019 this minute change in the average ssc indicated a rough salt balance during one growing season for both subunits under the typical irrigation regimes with irrigation amounts ranging from approximately 550 to 650 mm despite the difference in the value of ssc during the two seasons compared with the initial stage the distribution of ssc changed significantly for the s1 subunit at several specific soil depths at the boll opening stage the ssc generally increased with the distance from the water intake along the lateral and manifold in the 0 60 cm profile lower ssc values were observed than the initial values in the zones near the water intake in 0 60 cm for s1 the low value zone of ssc for s1 was consistent with the zone with a higher irrigation amount fig 3a this suggests that salt in the soil leached out of the 0 60 cm soil profile due to the higher irrigation amount near the water intake a great effect of the irrigation amount on the leaching of salt in soil has also been observed in many other studies wang et al 2012 2018 ning et al 2021 in zones far from the water intake however a slight increase in ssc was observed in the 0 60 cm profile this was due to the upward migration of salt from the deep soil under strong evapotranspiration and a relatively lower irrigation amount chen et al 2010 yang et al 2019 a more discrete distribution of soil salinity could also be confirmed by the increased difference between the median and mean ssc especially at the 0 20 and 20 40 cm depths for s1 fig 5 a d despite the great effect of the nonuniform distribution of irrigated water on the spatial distribution of ssc the consistency of ssc at the initial stage and at the boll opening stage could also be detected for s1 for example relatively higher sscs were observed in the 0 60 cm soil profile in southwest s1 both at the initial stage and the boll opening stage this demonstrates the possible effects of soil properties and initial ssc on ssc at the boll opening stage for the s2 subunit fewer effects of irrigation on the spatial distribution of ssc at the boll opening stage were observed than those for s1 even though the cumulative irrigation amount of s2 was 94 mm higher than that of s1 in 2018 fig 1 only ssc at the 0 20 cm soil depth was obviously affected by the distribution of irrigated water the relatively higher emitter discharge rates near water intake 2 produced lower ssc 0 78 3 19 g kg 1 while the relatively lower emitter discharge rates at the middle of the laterals produced higher ssc 4 77 6 18 g kg 1 at the 0 20 cm depth fig 4 p at the 20 100 cm soil depth the spatial distribution of ssc was probably affected by the coupling effect of soil spatial variability and irrigation amount distribution for example the obviously lower ssc near the west edge of the s2 subunit at a soil depth of 40 100 cm was probably associated with specific soil properties rather than relatively lower emitter discharge rates fig 4 r t few differences in the interquartile ranges of ssc were observed at the boll opening stage relative to those at the initial stage for s2 fig 5 e h this indicates that the improved irrigation uniformity by the dual end water feeding mode probably avoids increasing the nonuniformity of ssc on the subunit scale 3 4 importance of irrigation amount and soil properties to soil salinity fig 6 illustrates the vip values of the cumulative irrigation amount initial ssc and soil physical properties on ssc at the boll opening stage for the 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm soil depths and the r 2 and the f ratio test statistic of each pls model for s1 and s2 in 2018 and 2019 the r 2 ranged from 0 13 to 0 60 and the f ratio statistics were so high exceeding the threshold 2 236 that the null hypothesis was rejected for all pls models indicating the validity and acceptability of the models fig 6 for the s1 subunit the spatial distribution of the irrigation amount played a critical with a vip value 1 2 or important role 0 8 vip 1 2 on the ssc averaged over the root zone 0 60 cm and deep soil 60 100 cm at the boll opening stage this was illustrated by the high vip values of the cumulative irrigation amount ia in the root zone 1 36 and 1 16 in 2018 and 2019 respectively and deep soil 0 85 and 1 68 in 2018 and 2019 respectively fig 6 this result agreed well with the lower ssc near the water intake and the relatively higher ssc far from the water intake for s1 fig 4 f h for the s2 subunit however relatively lower vip values of ia were observed than those for s1 in both years the vip values of ia were substantially lower than 1 2 in deep soil in 2018 and in the 0 100 cm profile in 2019 fig 6 f h this indicates that the dual end water feeding mode probably reduced the potential effect of the nonuniformity of irrigation water on ssc due to the improved uniformity on the subunit scale the relatively higher vip value of ia in the root zone in 2018 was probably attributed to the higher cumulative irrigation amount of 643 mm than that in 2019 in addition the increasing impact of a higher irrigation amount on the spatial variation in ssc could be confirmed by the higher vip value of ia in deep soil in 2019 572 mm than in 2018 549 mm for s1 for both subunits the spatial variability of the soil particle size distribution soil bulk density and initial ssc imposed a great effect on the distribution of ssc at the boll opening stage in 2018 and 2019 three soil properties including initial ssc soil sand content and soil silt content imposed critical effects with vip values 1 2 on ssc in the root zone for the s1 subunit in 2018 in addition to cumulative irrigation similar higher vip values of soil properties were also observed for the s2 subunit the initial ssc always produced the most important effect on ssc in the root zone at the boll opening stage on the subunit scale while the vip values of the initial ssc at the 0 60 cm depth isc r ranked first for s1 in both years and for s2 in 2019 this result agreed with a previous study conducted on a lateral scale which indicated the great effect of initial salinity on ssc at the boll opening stage lin et al 2021 for the s1 subunit lower vip values were generally observed for the soil particle size distribution and bulk density in the root zone than those for the cumulative irrigation amount fig 6 a c this showed a greater effect of the nonuniform distribution of irrigated water than soil properties in a single end feeding subunit for the s2 subunit however the vip values of the cumulative irrigation amount were lower than those of the soil particle size distribution this indicates that soil physical properties imposed a greater effect on ssc on the field scale with more uniformly distributed irrigated water for both subunits the soil properties in the deep soil could impose a great effect on ssc in the root zone and vice versa this demonstrated a complex migration of soil salt in the soil profile under irrigation and evapotranspiration during the growing season in general the importance of the factors on the spatial distribution of ssc at the boll opening stage followed an order of initial ssc drip irrigation water soil physical properties and initial ssc soil physical properties drip irrigation water for s1 and s2 respectively this indicates that the initial ssc was one dominant factor affecting ssc distribution in subunits with different water feeding modes the results agreed well with li et al 2007 who found a similar spatial structure of soil salinity variability on three sampling dates in one year on the field scale the soil physical properties imposed less effect on ssc distribution in s1 than in s2 with higher irrigation uniformity the application of a dual end feeding mode would help to maintain a relatively uniform distribution of ssc and avoid local salt harmfulness caused by nonuniformity of ssc on the subunit scale in saine farmland in arid regions high soil salinity is likely to impose a negative effect on crop growth and reduce crop yield by affecting root water uptake and the toxic effect of specific salt ions on crops mmolawa and or 2000 ning et al 2021 the potential local salt harmfulness caused by the nonuniform distribution of irrigation might enhance the negative effect of system uniformity on crop yield on the subunit scale to maintain an acceptably low ssc in the root zone a much larger amount of water than crop requirement is usually applied to guarantee salt leaching for the whole subunit this would probably not only waste water resources but also cause obvious nutrient leaching in arid regions in this context the subunit with dual end feeding laterals might have the potential to avoid crop yield loss and low water and fertilizer use efficiency further efforts are needed to optimize technical parameters e g operation pressure lateral length and area of subunit for the application of the dual end feeding mode in arid regions with consideration of the spatial variability of soil properties crop yield and economic benefits of the dual end feeding subunit 4 conclusions field experiments were conducted in a single end feeding subunit s1 and a dual end feeding subunit s2 under arid environments the spatial distribution characteristics of ssc following an irrigation season and its response to the spatial distribution of drip irrigated water initial ssc and soil physical properties on the irrigation subunit scale were evaluated the following conclusions were supported by this study 1 greater variations in emitter discharge rates were observed in s1 than in s2 the cus of the emitter discharge rate for s2 were 4 7 higher than those for s1 while s2 had 1 5 times the area of s1 the relatively higher nonuniformity of drip irrigated water applied for s1 resulted in obvious salt leaching and accumulation regions near and far from the water intake respectively more dispersed soil salinity distribution was produced in a single end feeding subunit than in the dual end feeding subunit 2 the importance of the factors on the spatial variability of ssc after an irrigation season followed the order of initial ssc drip irrigation water soil physical properties and initial ssc soil physical properties drip irrigation water for s1 and s2 respectively the dual end water feeding mode reduced the potential effect of the nonuniformity of irrigation water on ssc due to the improved uniformity on the subunit scale the application of the dual end feeding mode would be promising to avoid local salt harmfulness caused by nonuniformity of ssc in the drip irrigation system declaration of competing interest the

9537,the need for achieving efficient and sustainable use of water resources is pressing however this often requires better understanding of the potential of water conservation taking into account the impact on return flows and the costs in relation to sectoral benefits using modelling and limited observational data we explore the costs and potential water savings of 24 combinations of water conservation measures in the rufiji basin tanzania we compare these costs with estimates of the value such water savings could generate from water use in three important economic sectors agriculture energy and downstream ecosystems with high tourism potential the cost of water conservation measures median 0 07 usd m 3 is found to be higher than the value of most uses of water for agriculture growing crops in expanded irrigation sites and the median value for hydropower generation from a new mega dam currently under construction and lower than the ecosystem value nevertheless under our modelling assumptions the volume of additional water required to supply planned irrigation expansion in the basin could be reduced by 1 5 bcm using water conservation methods that would be financially viable given the value of competing uses of water water savings of this magnitude would reduce potential trade offs between use of water for hydropower and ecosystem services by allowing peak environmental flow releases even in dry years and without reducing firm energy generation this methodology is transferable and relevant for producing realistic assessments of the financial incentives for long term sustainable water use in agriculture given incentives for other uses with most reservoirs now being built for multiple purposes improved understanding of trade offs between different sectors and functions is needed keywords financial feasibility costs hydropower ecosystem services infrastructure water energy food nexus 1 introduction many river basins in the global south are undergoing rapid development with major implications for the interdependent water energy food environment nexus sectors strong intra and inter annual variability in precipitation amplified through river basin hydrology and uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of ongoing climate change further complicates development planning stretching climate risk profiles for irrigated agriculture hydropower and environmental flow performance indicators kolusu et al 2021 siderius et al 2021b yet development is not always well aligned between sectors pardoe 2018 minimising the impact of distributed upstream development and increased water utilisation on downstream infrastructure such as hydropower plants or on vital ecosystems is a major challenge that arises from this situation many demand side measures are widely proposed as part of adaptive management portfolios to address these concerns such as more efficient irrigation systems gleick 2002 jägermeyr et al 2015 with on farm management practices promoted for their cost effectiveness addams et al 2009 basin scale benefits of these efficiency oriented measures however often turn out lower than anticipated grafton et al 2018 lankford 2012 perry 2007 scott et al 2014 van halsema and vincent 2012 with savings different to what was promoted or expected van der kooij et al 2013 venot et al 2017 upstream increases in efficiencies also tend to reduce the return flows that downstream farmers rely on and in practice farmers may expand or intensify production and as a result consume more water when moving to more efficient types of irrigation like drip or sprinkler thereby reducing rather than increasing downstream supply the un s food and agriculture organization fao therefore makes a distinction between real water savings and apparent water savings van opstal et al 2021 real water savings are any reductions in water consumption and non recoverable return flows water that would otherwise be lost to evaporation rather than reductions in water withdrawn from a river or applied to a field the rufiji river basin in tanzania is experiencing rapid development it produces roughly half of tanzania s river flow supplies water for 4 5 million people and generates 80 of the country s hydropower almost 50 of the total combined national hydro thermal power capacity wrem international 2015b construction of the julius nyerere hydropower project jnhpp is underway started in 2019 located on the main stem of the rufiji fig 1 at 2115 mw potential hydropower capacity the jnhpp is the second largest hydropower plant in africa under construction and will double tanzania s hydropower capacity the rufiji river basin also contains most of an area earmarked for ambitious agricultural expansion the southern agricultural growth corridor of tanzania sagcot fig 1a sagcot comprises several concentrated areas of activity clusters and it aims to attract domestic and foreign investment in agricultural value chains to promote economic growth milder et al 2012 increased agricultural productivity particularly through increased irrigation is part of sagcot initiative and sustainable water resource management is viewed as key to its success however while there is high development potential many decisions involve among other things trade offs between the water energy agriculture and conservation tourism sectors critical among these is the cumulative effect of abstractions to support expansion of irrigation upstream through formal large scale schemes and informal small scale expansion e g the rufiji river basin master plan aims to an increase irrigation from 110 000 ha to approximately 400 000 ha by 2035 wrem international 2015a simulations show that the higher estimates of upstream abstractions would constrain the reliability and amount of hydropower production geressu et al 2020 while such an increase seems unlikely given current low rates of expansion and historic performance in planned large scale irrigation sub sahara africa higginbottom et al 2021 at the same time local irrigation initiatives and farmer led irrigation expansion are widely observed in sub saharan africa though often under reported or under recognised venot et al 2021 an estimated 2 4 billion cubic metres of water bcm is currently abstracted in the rufiji river basin per year primarily for irrigation this is projected to increase more than threefold with the planned expansion of irrigation wrem international 2015b an amount equalling more than 33 of runoff in low flow years rufiji mean annual discharge is 30 bcm over 1981 2010 and as low as 20 bcm in the driest years precipitation in the rufiji river basin is highly seasonal with a mix of uni and bi modal maxima together with a complex hydrology including several major wetland systems siderius et al 2021b currently unlined canals and lack of gates make it difficult to control irrigation water flows and unlevelled fields cause uneven distribution of water mdemu et al 2017 while some of the drainage losses are reused by smallholder farmers surrounding larger irrigation schemes or further downstream a significant but unquantified proportion of water withdrawals is lost to evaporation through various land management and irrigation practices part of these losses might be reduced and some possible nexus sector trade offs e g the impact of the jnhpp reservoir on the rufiji s downstream delta ecosystem could potentially be mitigated geressu et al 2020 a better understanding of their cumulative potential taking into account the impact on return flows and the costs in relation to sectoral benefits that recognise all users is required to understand and quantify trade offs to support greater coordination within the basin kadigi et al 2008 assessments of the value of environmental flows and resulting ecosystem services are often lacking the benefits are diverse and hard to quantify and their translation into volumes constrained by complex relationships between value depreciation and lack of space and time specific environmental flow conditions environmental flows in the rufiji river basin exhibit strong threshold characteristics with ecosystem functioning highly dependent on biennial peak flows that regenerate a coastal delta lake ecosystem with high wildlife densities duvail et al 2014 hamerlynck et al 2011 yet these peak flows are very sensitive to reservoir operations such as those that would result from completion of the jnhpp with most reservoirs today being built for multiple purposes it is important for policymakers to appreciate and plan for growing trade offs between key functions zeng et al 2017 and to recognise the range of water users at different scales in the basin improved understanding of the value of water in its different uses can contribute to informed debate on water management and allocation identifying the basis for making agreeable trade offs we address this goal by exploring the financial costs of different water conservation measures under an ambitious plan for irrigation expansion using an improved application of the cost curve methodology siderius et al 2021a we demonstrate how the methodology can be combined with water accounting and expand its use beyond agriculture by adding a comparison with the value of water for different sectors to show its potential for aiding multi sector decision making we first derive cost curves i e curves showing increasing marginal costs of water savings and then compare them with estimates of the value of water for the agriculture energy and environment sectors to understand the financial feasibility of water conservation within a rapidly developing river basin we also examine the extent to which water conservation can help reduce the sensitivity of ecosystem services to reservoir operations by considering the volume of water savings at which the biennial frequency of peak flows a key environmental flow indicator can be maintained without negatively affecting firm monthly hydropower production assuming full development of ambitious large scale irrigation plans 2 methodology in overview we utilise an established crop hydrology model adjusted to the rufiji river basin siderius et al 2018 with additional validation of local crop production government plans for irrigation expansion and their consequences for water use are used to calculate the potential water savings associated with 24 combinations of water conservation measures hydropower yield from the jnhpp is modelled as a v shaped reservoir siderius et al 2021b to assess how much water conservation can help reduce water energy food environment sector trade offs the cost of measures are compared with estimates of the value of water for agriculture environment and hydropower derived from publicly available literature fig 2 a cost curve combines the marginal costs of measures in the case of water the cost of providing one additional cubic metre of water with the expected total amount of extra water a measure can conserve and ranks these measures from low to high marginal costs cost curves provide a method to identify the most cost effective water conservation measures to improve cost based decision making particularly in situations approaching water scarcity and to illustrate trade offs and consequences of decisions addams et al 2009 siderius et al 2021a 2 1 simulation of crop production hydropower yield and environmental flows to simulate the building blocks for our analysis that is gridded irrigation water withdrawn and applied and return flows and resulting additional crop production we use an adjusted basin specific calibrated version of the lpjml model siderius et al 2018 a model that simulates a coupled hydrology and carbon cycle which makes it a suitable tool to study the interactions between water availability and food production gerten et al 2011 daily irrigation demand for an irrigated crop in a cell is calculated as the minimum amount of water needed to fill the soil to field capacity and the amount needed to fulfil the atmospheric evaporative demand subsequently the withdrawal demand is calculated by accounting for losses during conveyance distribution and application of water depending on the type of irrigation system installed surface sprinkler or drip and the soil type of the irrigated cell jägermeyr et al 2015 the model tracks the proportion of losses that return back to the river system real water savings are derived by correcting the difference in water withdrawn for a change in return flows and thus only represent the change in consumption and non recoverable return flows rain fed and irrigated crop growth for 12 crops including wheat rice cotton and sugarcane is based on daily assimilation of carbon in cases of crop water stress the allocation of carbon to the storage organs is decreased leading to reduced yields crops are harvested when either maturity or the maximum number of growing days is reached bondeau et al 2007 fader et al 2010 yields for the most important food crops and sugarcane and cotton have been calibrated against subnational agricultural statistics government of tanzania 2017a b by adjusting a management factor in the lpjml model that influences maximum leaf area index maximum harvest index and a parameter to scale leaf level biomass production yields differ across the basin due to differences in climatic and soil conditions and access to irrigation for 2035 the national irrigation commission under the framing of the national irrigation masterplan proposes a very ambitious increase in irrigation from 111 000 ha of irrigation in 2010 to 400 000 ha in the basin wrem international 2015a b about a third of this expansion is explicitly defined in the model as four large planned irrigation schemes 23 000 ha of sugarcane in the kilombero sub catchment associated with an existing illovo plantation 18 000 ha for various crops earmarked for expansion in usaid feasibility studies cdm smith 2016 6260 ha rice in the usangu sub catchment and 69 000 ha downstream of the jnhpp the other two thirds of expansion consists mostly of small and medium sized schemes including estimates of informal farmer led irrigation expansion and is spatially allocated using the following rules 1 no expansion in game reserves or national parks 2 prioritising sagcot districts and 3 prioritising cells with existing irrigated area based on mirca2000 a global dataset of cropping patterns of 26 major crop types for the year 2000 portmann et al 2010 and then cells with existing agriculture assuming these to be most suitable due to existing infrastructure and restricting total cropped area to 90 of cell area we exclude the area downstream of the jnhpp from this analysis as we assume it does not directly influence reservoir operation and water availability for other sectors and so our assessment focusses on an expansion of irrigated area to 292 000 ha 75 of the total planned irrigated area in the basin in the rufiji river basin there are three major irrigated crops simulated rice maize and sugarcane a range of other crops such as onions and tomatoes and cassava are irrigated to a lesser extent and we cluster them under an other irrigated crop class using the cassava parameterisation the third most popular food crop in the basin a distinction between dry and wet season specific irrigation expansion was made with rice as the wet season crop and dry season expansion targeted as other crops to calculate hydropower yield the jnhpp was modelled in the programme r https www r project org as a v shaped reservoir using simulated lpjml flows as input with firm energy production the minimum amount of energy that can be produced typically in e g 90 or 95 of all months reflecting hydrological variability a function of head height difference between the water level at intake minus the level at discharge turbine efficiency up to 95 efficiency for large taylor francis turbines commonly used and outflow through the turbines we derived the basic characteristics of the reservoir and hydropower plant from earlier planning reports undp world bank 1984 and national and basin studies that often quote the 2013 planning documents of brazilian construction firm odebrecht and or the power system master plans of the tanzanian ministry of energy and minerals government of tanzania 2012 2016 wrem international 2015a b wwf international 2017 nine turbines are expected to deliver 2100 mw capacity which if run constantly at maximum outflow and head would deliver over 18 000 gw h per year but the jnhpp is expected to operate on a lower capacity on average with detailed information on demand fluctuations and planned operating rules lacking we base our analysis on the flow needed to maintain reported firm energy production 6000 gw h per year hartmann 2019 which would be achieved by running the turbines at a third of total turbine capacity at maximum head energy production decreases linearly with lower head at the lowest reservoir level at dead storage this results in a reduction of approximately 22 at constant outflow hence to maintain firm energy production an increase in flow through the turbines of similar magnitude is required to offset this potential reduction due to lack of information we do not consider hourly or daily to monthly fluctuations in supply to meet peak demands environmental flows downstream of the jnhpp are characterised by the need for regular biennial seasonal peak flow of 2500 m3 s 1 or more to create bank overflows that replenish the interconnected delta lakes and surrounding wetlands duvail et al 2014 the development of the jnhpp threatens to disrupt the biennial peak flows regenerating the lake ecosystem on which much wildlife depends duvail et al 2014 hamerlynck et al 2011 in our model such a monthly flow is released if the reservoir is i at capacity and inflow that month exceeds 2500 m3 s 1 plus evaporative losses from the lake surface ii at capacity in may and with runoff in the previous month above 1500 m3 s 1 indicating the likelihood of a sufficient wet season inflow to fill up the reservoir or iii if there has not been a peak flow of above 2500 m3 s 1 in the previous wet season and months up to may and the reservoir is at least still 2 3rd full with little or no inflow a peak release of 2500 m3 s 1 during a month would require about 25 of the reservoir s capacity leaving just about enough volume to maintain firm energy production until the next rainy season we used a 30 year historic climate data series 1981 2010 derived from the chirps gridded global precipitation dataset funk et al 2015 2 2 water conservation measures the types of water conservation measures that might be appropriate or under consideration in the rufiji river basin relate to the type of irrigation system land management and in situ water harvesting table 1 these measures represent the major pathways through which irrigation water can be conserved and reallocated capture more rainfall to reduce the amount of irrigation required reduce evaporative losses from the soil and reduce evaporative losses from the irrigation supply system for this analysis the parameterisation of field level measures was based on general values used in jägermeyr et al 2016 furthermore in tanzania formal irrigation infrastructure is widely in need of rehabilitation and generally has efficiencies lower than many parts of the world government of tanzania 2018 although in situ observations are sparse to confirm this we therefore assumed that the many unlined canals and older infrastructure in the basin would have a reduced canal conveyance efficiency in the baseline situation by 20 points but added improvement to best practice standards as an option the type of irrigation system strongly determines the efficiency of water use with differences in field application and transport to the field resulting in varying amounts of productive water consumption non productive losses and return flows irmak et al 2011 jägermeyr et al 2015 surface irrigation whereby the field is flooded to a certain depth with each irrigation application with water supplied through open channels is the default system in the rufiji flooding requires an additional amount of water to distribute irrigation water uniformly a distribution uniformity du parameter is used to scale this additional amount of water jägermeyr et al 2015 a value of 1 15 for surface irrigation table 1 means more than a doubling of the irrigation amount needed to replenish the soil sprinkler irrigation applies water closer to the plant and distributes it more evenly leading to lower application losses in drip systems application water is applied right into the rootzone of the plant eliminating leaf interception evaporation losses and further reducing soil evaporation we assumed sprinkler and drip irrigation techniques to be suitable for all irrigated crops including rice and sugarcane while canal conveyance losses for well maintained and managed irrigation systems are estimated between 20 and 30 depending on the soil type they can be almost double this in older systems or those lacking maintenance brouwer et al 1989 canal conveyance losses in the rufiji basin were initially set at 40 50 depending on soil type sprinkler irrigation uses pressurised water transport through pipes with conveyance losses in well designed and operated systems estimated at only 5 brouwer et al 1989 but as high as 25 in some systems battikhi and abu hammad 1994 bos and nugteren 1990 this is not necessarily due to a lack of maintenance losses can occur before the control station or in open storage reservoirs in rehabilitated drip systems in tanzania losses of 14 were reported government of tanzania 2018 to reflect this difference we distinguish in our drip and sprinkler water conservation measures between those with baseline conveyance losses of 25 and an upgraded option with losses at only 5 but against higher costs land management techniques such as mulching covering the soil with crop residues or plastic film reduce non beneficial soil evaporation taking into account current practices in the rufiji where mainly crop residues are used mahoo et al 2007 we have used the low end estimate of jägermeyr et al 2016 which assumes this measure reduces soil evaporation by 25 in situ water harvesting relates to techniques to increase on field infiltration such as pitting and terracing as well as mulching this increases soil water content and reduces the need for additional irrigation water infiltration a non linear process approximately doubles at higher soil moisture contents when applying this type of measure combining these measures leads to a total of 24 unique combinations of water conservation measures on irrigated land we assume that measures like drip or sprinkler have not been implemented to any great extent in the rufiji as such methods are yet to be applied at large scale over 90 of irrigation in tanzania is of the gravity type government of tanzania 2018 minor exceptions we are aware of include the kapunga irrigation scheme great ruaha subcatchment and illovo sugarcane plantation kilombero subcatchment where sprinkler irrigation has been in operation in recent years 2 3 water conservation cost curves estimates for annualised area based costs of various measures were derived from literature table 2 and si costs vary greatly with drip the most expensive method and mulching using locally sourced organic materials the cheapest per ha costs for a combination of measures were derived by adding up each individual cost reported figures mainly concern hardware costs and exclude the cost of training and outreach which can be considerable depending on existing farmer knowledge and capacities of agricultural extension services stirzaker et al 2014 costs expressed per hectare were converted into annualised capital costs and then into volumetric costs using simulated irrigation amounts per hectare as a result while cost per hectare for a particular measure is assumed constant volumetric costs vary spatially and per crop depending on local climate and soil conditions to derive marginal costs we iteratively rank per crop and per cell all combinations of measures from low to high marginal volumetric cost deselecting those options that do not conserve additional water 1 cmarg c i q cr

cost for a farmer to apply a cubic metre of water cm3 in the rufiji basin set at 0 01 usd m 3 based on the electricity costs to create a pressure of head of 50 m with a pump of standard efficiency of 55 required to irrigate via sprinkler or drip we assumed a standard cost of 0 01 usd m 3 would equally cover the continuous maintenance and operation costs that come with surface irrigation farmers would forego these costs in cases where they apply water conservation measures hence the negative sign we correct for impacts on irrigation return flows whereby q is the savings in irrigation water withdrawn minus any reduction in surface runoff soil drainage or canal conveyance return flows which downstream users might rely on not only does this reduce the expected amount of water saved it also increases the volumetric investment costs thereby making measures that reduce return flows less attractive as compared to those that reduce mainly evaporative losses this does not apply to operating costs since the farmer foregoes these costs on the reduced amount applied on their field to account for this in our marginal costs we adjust the volumetric operational costs cm3 by multiplying them with the fraction of applied over real water savings 2 4 valuing water we compare the marginal cost of water conservation measures against the value that water could potentially generate elsewhere in agriculture and in two other sectors hydropower and ecosystem services related to tourism and fisheries the marginal value of irrigation water is determined with the residual value of irrigation in usd m 3 at the margin of what can be produced using rainfed methods the residual value represents the value of a marginal product of a non priced input young 2005 which in the case of irrigation water is derived by subtracting all non water related estimated costs of production from the total value of output and then dividing this residual by the amount of water applied we rely on the same hydrological and crop production simulations that underpin the cost estimates but here use the volume of irrigation applied and the additional amount of crop that is produced with this amount of irrigation water multiplied by the farm gate price annual prices of crop produce for the period 2000 2018 were taken from faostat and corrected for inflation to 2018 price levels national level crop based weighted averages were calculated with weights assigned based on the years before present thereby giving higher importance to more recent price levels while at the same time accounting for historic price fluctuations basin specific sugarcane prices mwasinga 2018 were used as these were unavailable in faostat costs of production were taken from field surveys in the basin table 2 profit margins are low at the mean observed and simulated maize yields which is mainly grown for home consumption below the break even level of productivity sugarcane outgrowers smallholder farmers who sell their produce to the nearby estate that owns a sugar factory achieve much lower yields 27 30 ton ha 1 chanzi 2016 siima et al 2012 than the large estates which dominate the average and apply more irrigation the value of hydropower depends on many direct and indirect benefits to the economy and society some of which may materialise long into the future and are therefore difficult to quantify one alternative is to assume current tariffs represent the value of electricity another approach as used here is to assume that the costs of constructing and operating the infrastructure the levelized cost of electricity lcoe all costs of construction and operation over the lifetime of the infrastructure should at least equal the value that a hydropower project generates to do this we used a kw h cost price of 0 137 usd from tanzania s national energy master plan based on an estimate of marginal cost of supply for production and transport government of tanzania 2016 fixed costs per kw h were converted into a volumetric cost using the simulated reservoir outflow required to maintain firm energy production which is dependent on reservoir levels at daily time steps while valuations of ecosystem services in africa are limited compared to other continents studies on water related ecosystem services form a much higher proportion of all studies in africa pettinotti et al 2018 here we assign an ecosystem value to water using its essential role in wildlife based tourism a major contributor to gdp in tanzania of foreign currency and of employment cunningham et al 2015 world bank group 2015 most tourists visit the national parks in the north of the country the serengeti and kilimanjaro leading to overcrowding in what is called the northern circuit while the potential of the southern parks including two in the rufiji river basin ruaha national park rnp and nyerere national park nnp part of the former selous game reserve fig 2 is still underexploited world bank group 2015 the world bank estimates that attracting more people to these parks could boost annual gdp by almost 300 million usd corrected for inflation to 2018 provided that two water related potential barriers could be overcome water scarcity in the dry season in the rnp and bad connectivity with nearby parks with the nnp situated between the rnp and major urban centres such as dar es salaam considered a vital link world bank group 2015 starting from an expected trade off with prioritisation of firm energy likely to affect flow variability downstream of the jnhpp duvail et al 2014 geressu et al 2020 and thereby the viability of the nnp as a high value tourism destination the annual potential tourism revenues of 300 million usd are attributed to the amount of water conservation needed for the jnhpp to produce both firm energy and maintain biennial peak flows above 2500 m3 s 1 3 results 3 1 potential of water conservation the modelled potential to reduce both irrigation withdrawal and net irrigation after correcting for the impact on irrigation return flows is high in the rufiji basin due to the large volumes of non beneficial consumptive losses both on field and in the distribution system assumed in the baseline simulation conditions of the more than 2000 mm of irrigation water that is withdrawn in the canal fed systems only a small fraction contributes to crop transpiration fig 3a about half is lost in the distribution system of which half represents permanent losses through evaporation while the other half is either returned to the river or reused of the amount of water actually applied 1162 mm 40 is consumed beneficially and non beneficially while the other 60 is unaccounted for and might return back into the river system at some point in time net irrigation withdrawal minus return flows is about 1000 mm a year implementing water conservation measures reduces both consumptive losses and return flows in the most effective simulated condition from a water conservation point of view fig 3b with irrigation provided by sprinkler and with evaporation reduction conveyance losses and soil return flows are almost eliminated net irrigation is only about 400 mm year 1 supplementing rainfall of 907 mm year 1 of which 727 mm falls within the growing period while maintaining transpiration and thus yield real water savings accounting for changes in return flows amount to a difference in net irrigation of about 600 mm year 1 infiltration enhancement has a negligible impact under all three irrigation systems with a small reduction in irrigation applied in order of tens of mm matched by a similar reduction in surface runoff through a combination of various water conservation measures the ratio of non beneficial consumption to total consumption rnc can be reduced from 72 to as lows as 23 table 3 high conveyance efficiencies for improved sprinkler and drip systems with pressurised supply have conveyance efficiencies of close to 100 which combined with efficiencies at field level leads to overall efficiency of up to 60 a strong reduction in withdrawal and net irrigation comparable to some of the sprinkler options is also possible within canal fed irrigation systems when irrigation application to the field is reduced which limits the supply through the canal system and evaporative losses therein improved conveyance can further lower these evaporative losses accounting for changes in return flows preserves the total amount of flow available to downstream uses but flow patterns will be shifted towards more flow retained in the river system and less routed via the canal soil and the drainage system away from the river runoff will be faster with earlier availability to other users lankford 2012 3 2 cost curve for water conservation measures the modelled total real water savings as a result of implementing water conservation measures on a greatly expanded irrigation area is substantial a potential saving of 2 bcm fig 4 could be achieved from the existing and planned irrigation area upstream of the jnhpp this saving is out of a total of 5 9 bcm withdrawn from the river above the reservoir of which 3 4 bcm of irrigation water is applied to the field reduction of evaporation under conventional flood irrigation is achieved against the lowest marginal costs with the first bcm costing below 0 07 usd m 3 fig 3 measures such as a switch to sprinkler irrigation in combination with improvements in conveyance efficiency can reduce consumptive use and net irrigation demand but against increasingly higher marginal cost for water savings over 1 5 bcm costs rise rapidly from more than 0 14 usd m 3 to over 0 5 usd m 3 for the last cubic metres a cost close to that of modern desalination methods 3 3 value of water for irrigation use across the rufiji river basin whether water conservation is worthwhile from a financial point of view depends on the value that alternative uses of water would generate fig 5 shows the residual marginal value of the four irrigated crops for areas where the crop is currently gown either rainfed or irrigated according to the land use dataset rice maize and cassava are grown throughout the basin while sugarcane is concentrated in pockets in the upstream great ruaha ruaha river catchment and further downstream where the kilombero sugar company is situated between various protected areas residual values for irrigation water tend to be below 0 05 usd m 3 with the exception of cassava which represents a cluster of other irrigated crops that can achieve high yields when irrigated residual values are low when overall gross profit of the crop is low when additional irrigation adds relatively little extra yield or both these conditions apply table 2 shows that maize even with irrigated yields is on average only just above break even levels of productivity less optimal growing conditions in e g the southern highlands in the central part of the basin tip the balance towards negative gross margin and thus negative residual value of irrigation water analysis by the uyole agricultural research institute in mbeya indicates that farmers here are not likely to make a profit growing maize under the current cultivation and market conditions wilson and lewis 2015b the capital to develop irrigation infrastructure and the institutions to fund ongoing operations and maintenance often do not warrant the production of staple crops mwamakamba et al 2017 stirzaker et al 2014 the range of calculated values for irrigation water is similar to that reported for case studies in other basins in the world bierkens et al 2019 hellegers and davidson 2010 hellegers et al 2013 qureshi et al 2018 siderius et al 2021a our marginal value of water for ecosystem services is based on the projected 300 million usd tourism revenue gains per year through the preservation of the downstream rufiji delta ecosystem and the npp that relies on it increasing water savings by 0 5 bcm increments and routing these into the jnhpp reservoir we analysed the threshold above which both biennial peak flow releases and firm energy production could be maintained according to our model simulations using historical rainfall for the period 1981 2010 this would require water conservation in the order of magnitude of at least 1 5 bcm fig 6 upstream of the reservoir as a result of these savings biennial peak releases of more than 2500 m3 s 1 would remain possible even during a sequence of drought and low release conditions as in the 2000s without compromising the ability of the reservoir to maintain firm energy output which translates into a value of 0 20 usd m 3 considerable risk remains however for example in 2001 the peak release condition of the reservoir two thirds full is only just reached and with assumed continued releases would lead to a pronounced fall in lake levels furthermore in 2006 the reservoir live storage is almost fully depleted an additional 0 5 bcm of water savings taking the total to 2 bcm would add extra buffer in dry years fig 6 during normal to wet years with the reservoir near capacity a peak environmental flow release leads to merely a temporary dip in lake volume with reservoir volume often able to recover by the end of the wet season an increase of 1 5 bcm in water savings leads to increased hydropower yield not only because of the extra volume of water available but potentially also because the reservoir can be operated at a higher level especially in dry years when energy can be generated more efficiently during the extreme dry period in 2006 the efficiency reduction was kept at 17 rather than 22 due to reservoir storage not falling below 1 4 bcm at higher reservoir levels at which the reservoir is ideally operated this difference is relatively minor due to the non linear level storage relationship moreover in our application assuming peak releases to maintain environmental flows this extra value is completely offset by increased reservoir outflows above the maximum turbine capacity of 2061 m s 1 during peak flow releases or spillage to avoid over topping as a result around 10 of the extra inflow would not contribute to increased energy production at all this level of energy generation results in an average marginal hydropower value just below 0 04 usd m 3 using the kwh value of 0 137 usd section 2 4 fig 7 compares marginal costs against the three sectoral values as described above values of water for agriculture irrigation are based on the residual values in fig 5 generally value is lower than costs of water conservation due to low crop yields and low profitability of current agriculture costs of a third of measures do overlap with the hydropower values suggesting that a significant part of successfully implemented water conservation practices would be cost effective in terms of increased energy nearly all the measures apart from the most expensive ones e g mainly those involving drip irrigation in combination with one of the other measures would be worth exploring to achieve sufficient environmental flow peak releases to maintain the delta lake ecosystem and the tourism potential of the region 4 discussion using modelling and limited observational and secondary data we explored the potential water savings and costs of 24 combinations of water conservation measures and compared these with the value such water savings could generate from water use in three important economic sectors agriculture energy and downstream ecosystems which have a high tourism potential the cost of water conservation measures was found to be higher than the value of most uses of water for growing crops and the median value for hydropower generation and lower than the ecosystem value nevertheless under high end irrigation expansion plans our modelling assumptions and existing rainfall and river flow conditions 1981 2010 upstream water savings of at least 1 5 bcm if implemented effectively would make financial sense by reducing potential trade offs between use of water for hydropower and ecosystem services allowing peak environmental flow releases even in dry years without reducing firm energy generation due to limited data availability we have taken a simple approach to estimating water related ecosystem value by focusing only on aggregate wildlife tourism an important contributor to tanzania s gdp for which an estimated value exists world bank group 2015 environmental flows through the rufiji delta support numerous other functions such as tanzania s commercial shrimp fisheries existing flood recession irrigation mangroves that provide coastal erosion protection and whale shark habitat around mafia island national park hamerlynck et al 2011 conversely we have not included additional costs to make the southern circuit more attractive for tourism such as better connectivity world bank group 2015 although this would be tied to other benefits such as providing market access for agriculture and lowering prevailing high input costs our estimates of water use values should therefore be considered indicative we did not analyse conditions in which energy generation at the jnhpp would be optimised above the firm energy level our simulations suggest there is only limited scope to increase average outflow beyond the approximately 700 m3 s 1 required to maintain firm energy without increasing the risk of failure to meet environmental flows constraints however this could be explored with tools evaluating more advanced operational rules able to handle different combinations of multi sector objectives we based our value of hydropower energy 0 04 usd m 3 on a kwh cost price of 0 137 usd from tanzania s power system master plan 2016 while this value is lower than earlier estimates of 0 06 usd m 3 for hydropower at the upstream mtera reservoir kadigi et al 2008 or a commonly used value in hydro economic optimisation of 0 08 usd m 3 siderius et al 2016 whittington et al 2005 the kwh estimate is higher than that used by hartmann 2019 the current average retail price of electricity world bank group 2018 or the levelised cost of alternative energy options such as gas and solar or hydropower plants in neighbouring countries such as inga3 in congo deshmukh et al 2018 as such our value is likely a high end estimate of the financial benefit of hydropower we exclude the demand of potential new irrigation schemes in the rufiji delta downstream of the jnhpp we expect that this demand could be accommodated by the firm energy release volumes from the jnhpp whether large scale irrigation should be developed here at all remains questionable peak releases to flood the delta lake ecosystem will put considerable demands on intake design raising costs according to hamerlynck et al 2011 earlier exploration of the irrigation potential in the rufiji delta found that in general there is enough rain for two crops a year and that therefore irrigation is not a necessity and can only be successful as a supplement in bad years if the water can be provided at a relatively small cost more generally large scale irrigation plans in many parts of africa are over optimistic with expansion far slower than planned and much smaller when finally established higginbottom et al 2021 mwamakamba et al 2017 it is therefore highly likely that these estimates taken from official documents are at the upper limit of what is actually going to be achieved our results are based primarily on a modelling system that accounts for water budgets on a 8 km by 8 km grid resolution the hydrological model is validated on observed flows but still makes assumptions about wetland systems and ungauged parts of the basin siderius et al 2021a and produces reasonable simulation of crop yields however we note that there are very limited recent observations of actual abstractions applications and return flows for the irrigated areas in the basin and therefore these results should be considered indicative there is no substitute for in situ data on water use and performance of water conservation measures we rely on idealised though restricted conditions in the model without any validation based on observations of the effectiveness and sustainability of the range of water conservation measures in a local context while we correct for the effect on return flows in order to avoid overly optimistic rates of savings these more efficient ways of irrigation application will result in a temporal and spatial redistribution of return flows in existing irrigation systems with more water remaining in the river main stem and tributaries at the expense of delayed flows through the irrigation drainage system whether natural or constructed affecting those who currently abstract return flows closest to the point of initial application lankford 2004 and while our production cost estimates and prices are derived from local basin studies combined with national statistics we acknowledge that averages do not address the often uneven distribution of benefits and costs of water conservation measures between various types of farmers venot et al 2017 there are additional social costs with higher efficiency systems such as managing the shared responsibilities on collectively owned technically complex equipment and their operation and management costs new technology also needs to align with local decision making structures and technical know how however new systems bring employment opportunities so that some costs may be offset by considering the broader community benefits the impact on groundwater which has largely unexplored potential cuthbert et al 2019 and on those who rely on this source of water would also need further scrutiny our basin scale analysis overlooks sub basin scale trade offs that arise at various points across the basin particularly associated with increasing water use for agriculture and environmental flow requirements at key locations with high ecological or tourism value for example long running tensions exist in the great ruaha catchment between smallholder agriculture and pastoralists irrigation expansion land grabbing and conservation kashaigili et al 2005 lankford 2004 walsh 2012 similar issues relating to access and how political power formal and informal is distributed and exercised affect the way in which different actors access and utilise efficiency gains e g lankford 2013 domestic demand not included in our analysis tends to have a higher value than agriculture hydropower or wildlife tourism demand in terms of volume is comparatively small though and trade offs with other sector demand seem minor indirectly however deforestation linked to agricultural expansion could impact water quality affecting suitability for drinking water ashagre et al 2018 cost savings of 4 6 17 6 million usd per year for forest conservation under water treatment work conditions were estimated by ashagre et al 2018 our water conservation measures especially those targeting evapotranspiration reduction and soil infiltration might not fully prevent but could minimise the impact of land conversion we evaluated the possibility of maintaining firm energy and environmental flows for a near present 30 year time period but more severe multi annual droughts have occurred earlier in the 20th century and climate change projections suggest a further increase in variability siderius et al 2021b average flow is currently 30bcm but can be as low as 20bcm in dry years increased variability in rainfall and runoff in combination with ambitious formal irrigation expansion plans alongside expansion through farmer led processes is likely to test the buffering capacity of even the jnhpp reservoir contingency planning for such events needs to be in place with particular attention to the vulnerability and the high added value of the delta ecosystem such planning requires basin wide institutional strengthening that recognises sector interdependencies the multiplicity of water users and how they are impacted by restrictions venot et al 2021 capacity to implement and maintain infrastructure development programmes coupled with a need to focus on factors affecting performance of local water user associations while taking into account the needs of the poorest richards 2019 sokile et al 2003 5 conclusions given completion of the jnhpp and ambitious irrigation expansion plans considerable water savings would be financially viable in the rufiji river basin but only using water conservation measures lying at the lower end of the marginal cost curve upgrades to the conveyance system followed by evaporation reduction and application by sprinkler controlling for the impact on return flows reduces the amount of water each individual measure saves and increases its volumetric cost at a median cost of 0 07 usd m 3 water conservation is too expensive for the majority of agricultural applications higher than hydropower value but well within the estimated ecosystem value if the ambitious formal irrigation expansion plans are realised without water conservation measures trade offs between energy production and downstream environmental flow demands will be harder to negotiate with considerable risk of jeopardising the highest financial value that of the ecosystem in times of drought noting that our financial estimates are illustrative and not total economic value taken together the major ongoing and planned development of hydropower and irrigation in the rufiji river basin will increase basin scale trade offs in the water energy food and environment sectors this analysis demonstrates several steps towards understanding the value of water in its different uses and thus makes a methodological contribution towards assessing and implementing integrated sector decision making along the lines of the water energy food environment nexus agenda the method is applicable to other regions and illustrates how a combination of financial considerations alongside biophysical assessment explains why not all water saving measures will be financially feasible such information could alongside strengthened multi sector and multi stakeholder engagement processes contribute to informed debate on water

9537,the need for achieving efficient and sustainable use of water resources is pressing however this often requires better understanding of the potential of water conservation taking into account the impact on return flows and the costs in relation to sectoral benefits using modelling and limited observational data we explore the costs and potential water savings of 24 combinations of water conservation measures in the rufiji basin tanzania we compare these costs with estimates of the value such water savings could generate from water use in three important economic sectors agriculture energy and downstream ecosystems with high tourism potential the cost of water conservation measures median 0 07 usd m 3 is found to be higher than the value of most uses of water for agriculture growing crops in expanded irrigation sites and the median value for hydropower generation from a new mega dam currently under construction and lower than the ecosystem value nevertheless under our modelling assumptions the volume of additional water required to supply planned irrigation expansion in the basin could be reduced by 1 5 bcm using water conservation methods that would be financially viable given the value of competing uses of water water savings of this magnitude would reduce potential trade offs between use of water for hydropower and ecosystem services by allowing peak environmental flow releases even in dry years and without reducing firm energy generation this methodology is transferable and relevant for producing realistic assessments of the financial incentives for long term sustainable water use in agriculture given incentives for other uses with most reservoirs now being built for multiple purposes improved understanding of trade offs between different sectors and functions is needed keywords financial feasibility costs hydropower ecosystem services infrastructure water energy food nexus 1 introduction many river basins in the global south are undergoing rapid development with major implications for the interdependent water energy food environment nexus sectors strong intra and inter annual variability in precipitation amplified through river basin hydrology and uncertainty about the direction and magnitude of ongoing climate change further complicates development planning stretching climate risk profiles for irrigated agriculture hydropower and environmental flow performance indicators kolusu et al 2021 siderius et al 2021b yet development is not always well aligned between sectors pardoe 2018 minimising the impact of distributed upstream development and increased water utilisation on downstream infrastructure such as hydropower plants or on vital ecosystems is a major challenge that arises from this situation many demand side measures are widely proposed as part of adaptive management portfolios to address these concerns such as more efficient irrigation systems gleick 2002 jägermeyr et al 2015 with on farm management practices promoted for their cost effectiveness addams et al 2009 basin scale benefits of these efficiency oriented measures however often turn out lower than anticipated grafton et al 2018 lankford 2012 perry 2007 scott et al 2014 van halsema and vincent 2012 with savings different to what was promoted or expected van der kooij et al 2013 venot et al 2017 upstream increases in efficiencies also tend to reduce the return flows that downstream farmers rely on and in practice farmers may expand or intensify production and as a result consume more water when moving to more efficient types of irrigation like drip or sprinkler thereby reducing rather than increasing downstream supply the un s food and agriculture organization fao therefore makes a distinction between real water savings and apparent water savings van opstal et al 2021 real water savings are any reductions in water consumption and non recoverable return flows water that would otherwise be lost to evaporation rather than reductions in water withdrawn from a river or applied to a field the rufiji river basin in tanzania is experiencing rapid development it produces roughly half of tanzania s river flow supplies water for 4 5 million people and generates 80 of the country s hydropower almost 50 of the total combined national hydro thermal power capacity wrem international 2015b construction of the julius nyerere hydropower project jnhpp is underway started in 2019 located on the main stem of the rufiji fig 1 at 2115 mw potential hydropower capacity the jnhpp is the second largest hydropower plant in africa under construction and will double tanzania s hydropower capacity the rufiji river basin also contains most of an area earmarked for ambitious agricultural expansion the southern agricultural growth corridor of tanzania sagcot fig 1a sagcot comprises several concentrated areas of activity clusters and it aims to attract domestic and foreign investment in agricultural value chains to promote economic growth milder et al 2012 increased agricultural productivity particularly through increased irrigation is part of sagcot initiative and sustainable water resource management is viewed as key to its success however while there is high development potential many decisions involve among other things trade offs between the water energy agriculture and conservation tourism sectors critical among these is the cumulative effect of abstractions to support expansion of irrigation upstream through formal large scale schemes and informal small scale expansion e g the rufiji river basin master plan aims to an increase irrigation from 110 000 ha to approximately 400 000 ha by 2035 wrem international 2015a simulations show that the higher estimates of upstream abstractions would constrain the reliability and amount of hydropower production geressu et al 2020 while such an increase seems unlikely given current low rates of expansion and historic performance in planned large scale irrigation sub sahara africa higginbottom et al 2021 at the same time local irrigation initiatives and farmer led irrigation expansion are widely observed in sub saharan africa though often under reported or under recognised venot et al 2021 an estimated 2 4 billion cubic metres of water bcm is currently abstracted in the rufiji river basin per year primarily for irrigation this is projected to increase more than threefold with the planned expansion of irrigation wrem international 2015b an amount equalling more than 33 of runoff in low flow years rufiji mean annual discharge is 30 bcm over 1981 2010 and as low as 20 bcm in the driest years precipitation in the rufiji river basin is highly seasonal with a mix of uni and bi modal maxima together with a complex hydrology including several major wetland systems siderius et al 2021b currently unlined canals and lack of gates make it difficult to control irrigation water flows and unlevelled fields cause uneven distribution of water mdemu et al 2017 while some of the drainage losses are reused by smallholder farmers surrounding larger irrigation schemes or further downstream a significant but unquantified proportion of water withdrawals is lost to evaporation through various land management and irrigation practices part of these losses might be reduced and some possible nexus sector trade offs e g the impact of the jnhpp reservoir on the rufiji s downstream delta ecosystem could potentially be mitigated geressu et al 2020 a better understanding of their cumulative potential taking into account the impact on return flows and the costs in relation to sectoral benefits that recognise all users is required to understand and quantify trade offs to support greater coordination within the basin kadigi et al 2008 assessments of the value of environmental flows and resulting ecosystem services are often lacking the benefits are diverse and hard to quantify and their translation into volumes constrained by complex relationships between value depreciation and lack of space and time specific environmental flow conditions environmental flows in the rufiji river basin exhibit strong threshold characteristics with ecosystem functioning highly dependent on biennial peak flows that regenerate a coastal delta lake ecosystem with high wildlife densities duvail et al 2014 hamerlynck et al 2011 yet these peak flows are very sensitive to reservoir operations such as those that would result from completion of the jnhpp with most reservoirs today being built for multiple purposes it is important for policymakers to appreciate and plan for growing trade offs between key functions zeng et al 2017 and to recognise the range of water users at different scales in the basin improved understanding of the value of water in its different uses can contribute to informed debate on water management and allocation identifying the basis for making agreeable trade offs we address this goal by exploring the financial costs of different water conservation measures under an ambitious plan for irrigation expansion using an improved application of the cost curve methodology siderius et al 2021a we demonstrate how the methodology can be combined with water accounting and expand its use beyond agriculture by adding a comparison with the value of water for different sectors to show its potential for aiding multi sector decision making we first derive cost curves i e curves showing increasing marginal costs of water savings and then compare them with estimates of the value of water for the agriculture energy and environment sectors to understand the financial feasibility of water conservation within a rapidly developing river basin we also examine the extent to which water conservation can help reduce the sensitivity of ecosystem services to reservoir operations by considering the volume of water savings at which the biennial frequency of peak flows a key environmental flow indicator can be maintained without negatively affecting firm monthly hydropower production assuming full development of ambitious large scale irrigation plans 2 methodology in overview we utilise an established crop hydrology model adjusted to the rufiji river basin siderius et al 2018 with additional validation of local crop production government plans for irrigation expansion and their consequences for water use are used to calculate the potential water savings associated with 24 combinations of water conservation measures hydropower yield from the jnhpp is modelled as a v shaped reservoir siderius et al 2021b to assess how much water conservation can help reduce water energy food environment sector trade offs the cost of measures are compared with estimates of the value of water for agriculture environment and hydropower derived from publicly available literature fig 2 a cost curve combines the marginal costs of measures in the case of water the cost of providing one additional cubic metre of water with the expected total amount of extra water a measure can conserve and ranks these measures from low to high marginal costs cost curves provide a method to identify the most cost effective water conservation measures to improve cost based decision making particularly in situations approaching water scarcity and to illustrate trade offs and consequences of decisions addams et al 2009 siderius et al 2021a 2 1 simulation of crop production hydropower yield and environmental flows to simulate the building blocks for our analysis that is gridded irrigation water withdrawn and applied and return flows and resulting additional crop production we use an adjusted basin specific calibrated version of the lpjml model siderius et al 2018 a model that simulates a coupled hydrology and carbon cycle which makes it a suitable tool to study the interactions between water availability and food production gerten et al 2011 daily irrigation demand for an irrigated crop in a cell is calculated as the minimum amount of water needed to fill the soil to field capacity and the amount needed to fulfil the atmospheric evaporative demand subsequently the withdrawal demand is calculated by accounting for losses during conveyance distribution and application of water depending on the type of irrigation system installed surface sprinkler or drip and the soil type of the irrigated cell jägermeyr et al 2015 the model tracks the proportion of losses that return back to the river system real water savings are derived by correcting the difference in water withdrawn for a change in return flows and thus only represent the change in consumption and non recoverable return flows rain fed and irrigated crop growth for 12 crops including wheat rice cotton and sugarcane is based on daily assimilation of carbon in cases of crop water stress the allocation of carbon to the storage organs is decreased leading to reduced yields crops are harvested when either maturity or the maximum number of growing days is reached bondeau et al 2007 fader et al 2010 yields for the most important food crops and sugarcane and cotton have been calibrated against subnational agricultural statistics government of tanzania 2017a b by adjusting a management factor in the lpjml model that influences maximum leaf area index maximum harvest index and a parameter to scale leaf level biomass production yields differ across the basin due to differences in climatic and soil conditions and access to irrigation for 2035 the national irrigation commission under the framing of the national irrigation masterplan proposes a very ambitious increase in irrigation from 111 000 ha of irrigation in 2010 to 400 000 ha in the basin wrem international 2015a b about a third of this expansion is explicitly defined in the model as four large planned irrigation schemes 23 000 ha of sugarcane in the kilombero sub catchment associated with an existing illovo plantation 18 000 ha for various crops earmarked for expansion in usaid feasibility studies cdm smith 2016 6260 ha rice in the usangu sub catchment and 69 000 ha downstream of the jnhpp the other two thirds of expansion consists mostly of small and medium sized schemes including estimates of informal farmer led irrigation expansion and is spatially allocated using the following rules 1 no expansion in game reserves or national parks 2 prioritising sagcot districts and 3 prioritising cells with existing irrigated area based on mirca2000 a global dataset of cropping patterns of 26 major crop types for the year 2000 portmann et al 2010 and then cells with existing agriculture assuming these to be most suitable due to existing infrastructure and restricting total cropped area to 90 of cell area we exclude the area downstream of the jnhpp from this analysis as we assume it does not directly influence reservoir operation and water availability for other sectors and so our assessment focusses on an expansion of irrigated area to 292 000 ha 75 of the total planned irrigated area in the basin in the rufiji river basin there are three major irrigated crops simulated rice maize and sugarcane a range of other crops such as onions and tomatoes and cassava are irrigated to a lesser extent and we cluster them under an other irrigated crop class using the cassava parameterisation the third most popular food crop in the basin a distinction between dry and wet season specific irrigation expansion was made with rice as the wet season crop and dry season expansion targeted as other crops to calculate hydropower yield the jnhpp was modelled in the programme r https www r project org as a v shaped reservoir using simulated lpjml flows as input with firm energy production the minimum amount of energy that can be produced typically in e g 90 or 95 of all months reflecting hydrological variability a function of head height difference between the water level at intake minus the level at discharge turbine efficiency up to 95 efficiency for large taylor francis turbines commonly used and outflow through the turbines we derived the basic characteristics of the reservoir and hydropower plant from earlier planning reports undp world bank 1984 and national and basin studies that often quote the 2013 planning documents of brazilian construction firm odebrecht and or the power system master plans of the tanzanian ministry of energy and minerals government of tanzania 2012 2016 wrem international 2015a b wwf international 2017 nine turbines are expected to deliver 2100 mw capacity which if run constantly at maximum outflow and head would deliver over 18 000 gw h per year but the jnhpp is expected to operate on a lower capacity on average with detailed information on demand fluctuations and planned operating rules lacking we base our analysis on the flow needed to maintain reported firm energy production 6000 gw h per year hartmann 2019 which would be achieved by running the turbines at a third of total turbine capacity at maximum head energy production decreases linearly with lower head at the lowest reservoir level at dead storage this results in a reduction of approximately 22 at constant outflow hence to maintain firm energy production an increase in flow through the turbines of similar magnitude is required to offset this potential reduction due to lack of information we do not consider hourly or daily to monthly fluctuations in supply to meet peak demands environmental flows downstream of the jnhpp are characterised by the need for regular biennial seasonal peak flow of 2500 m3 s 1 or more to create bank overflows that replenish the interconnected delta lakes and surrounding wetlands duvail et al 2014 the development of the jnhpp threatens to disrupt the biennial peak flows regenerating the lake ecosystem on which much wildlife depends duvail et al 2014 hamerlynck et al 2011 in our model such a monthly flow is released if the reservoir is i at capacity and inflow that month exceeds 2500 m3 s 1 plus evaporative losses from the lake surface ii at capacity in may and with runoff in the previous month above 1500 m3 s 1 indicating the likelihood of a sufficient wet season inflow to fill up the reservoir or iii if there has not been a peak flow of above 2500 m3 s 1 in the previous wet season and months up to may and the reservoir is at least still 2 3rd full with little or no inflow a peak release of 2500 m3 s 1 during a month would require about 25 of the reservoir s capacity leaving just about enough volume to maintain firm energy production until the next rainy season we used a 30 year historic climate data series 1981 2010 derived from the chirps gridded global precipitation dataset funk et al 2015 2 2 water conservation measures the types of water conservation measures that might be appropriate or under consideration in the rufiji river basin relate to the type of irrigation system land management and in situ water harvesting table 1 these measures represent the major pathways through which irrigation water can be conserved and reallocated capture more rainfall to reduce the amount of irrigation required reduce evaporative losses from the soil and reduce evaporative losses from the irrigation supply system for this analysis the parameterisation of field level measures was based on general values used in jägermeyr et al 2016 furthermore in tanzania formal irrigation infrastructure is widely in need of rehabilitation and generally has efficiencies lower than many parts of the world government of tanzania 2018 although in situ observations are sparse to confirm this we therefore assumed that the many unlined canals and older infrastructure in the basin would have a reduced canal conveyance efficiency in the baseline situation by 20 points but added improvement to best practice standards as an option the type of irrigation system strongly determines the efficiency of water use with differences in field application and transport to the field resulting in varying amounts of productive water consumption non productive losses and return flows irmak et al 2011 jägermeyr et al 2015 surface irrigation whereby the field is flooded to a certain depth with each irrigation application with water supplied through open channels is the default system in the rufiji flooding requires an additional amount of water to distribute irrigation water uniformly a distribution uniformity du parameter is used to scale this additional amount of water jägermeyr et al 2015 a value of 1 15 for surface irrigation table 1 means more than a doubling of the irrigation amount needed to replenish the soil sprinkler irrigation applies water closer to the plant and distributes it more evenly leading to lower application losses in drip systems application water is applied right into the rootzone of the plant eliminating leaf interception evaporation losses and further reducing soil evaporation we assumed sprinkler and drip irrigation techniques to be suitable for all irrigated crops including rice and sugarcane while canal conveyance losses for well maintained and managed irrigation systems are estimated between 20 and 30 depending on the soil type they can be almost double this in older systems or those lacking maintenance brouwer et al 1989 canal conveyance losses in the rufiji basin were initially set at 40 50 depending on soil type sprinkler irrigation uses pressurised water transport through pipes with conveyance losses in well designed and operated systems estimated at only 5 brouwer et al 1989 but as high as 25 in some systems battikhi and abu hammad 1994 bos and nugteren 1990 this is not necessarily due to a lack of maintenance losses can occur before the control station or in open storage reservoirs in rehabilitated drip systems in tanzania losses of 14 were reported government of tanzania 2018 to reflect this difference we distinguish in our drip and sprinkler water conservation measures between those with baseline conveyance losses of 25 and an upgraded option with losses at only 5 but against higher costs land management techniques such as mulching covering the soil with crop residues or plastic film reduce non beneficial soil evaporation taking into account current practices in the rufiji where mainly crop residues are used mahoo et al 2007 we have used the low end estimate of jägermeyr et al 2016 which assumes this measure reduces soil evaporation by 25 in situ water harvesting relates to techniques to increase on field infiltration such as pitting and terracing as well as mulching this increases soil water content and reduces the need for additional irrigation water infiltration a non linear process approximately doubles at higher soil moisture contents when applying this type of measure combining these measures leads to a total of 24 unique combinations of water conservation measures on irrigated land we assume that measures like drip or sprinkler have not been implemented to any great extent in the rufiji as such methods are yet to be applied at large scale over 90 of irrigation in tanzania is of the gravity type government of tanzania 2018 minor exceptions we are aware of include the kapunga irrigation scheme great ruaha subcatchment and illovo sugarcane plantation kilombero subcatchment where sprinkler irrigation has been in operation in recent years 2 3 water conservation cost curves estimates for annualised area based costs of various measures were derived from literature table 2 and si costs vary greatly with drip the most expensive method and mulching using locally sourced organic materials the cheapest per ha costs for a combination of measures were derived by adding up each individual cost reported figures mainly concern hardware costs and exclude the cost of training and outreach which can be considerable depending on existing farmer knowledge and capacities of agricultural extension services stirzaker et al 2014 costs expressed per hectare were converted into annualised capital costs and then into volumetric costs using simulated irrigation amounts per hectare as a result while cost per hectare for a particular measure is assumed constant volumetric costs vary spatially and per crop depending on local climate and soil conditions to derive marginal costs we iteratively rank per crop and per cell all combinations of measures from low to high marginal volumetric cost deselecting those options that do not conserve additional water 1 cmarg c i q cr i 1 c cr i 1 q cr i c cr i q cr i 1 q cr i with c cr i cinv cr i cm 3 qapplied cr i q cr i where cmarg is the marginal costs usd m 3 for crop cr and water conservation option i based on the volumetric

cost for a farmer to apply a cubic metre of water cm3 in the rufiji basin set at 0 01 usd m 3 based on the electricity costs to create a pressure of head of 50 m with a pump of standard efficiency of 55 required to irrigate via sprinkler or drip we assumed a standard cost of 0 01 usd m 3 would equally cover the continuous maintenance and operation costs that come with surface irrigation farmers would forego these costs in cases where they apply water conservation measures hence the negative sign we correct for impacts on irrigation return flows whereby q is the savings in irrigation water withdrawn minus any reduction in surface runoff soil drainage or canal conveyance return flows which downstream users might rely on not only does this reduce the expected amount of water saved it also increases the volumetric investment costs thereby making measures that reduce return flows less attractive as compared to those that reduce mainly evaporative losses this does not apply to operating costs since the farmer foregoes these costs on the reduced amount applied on their field to account for this in our marginal costs we adjust the volumetric operational costs cm3 by multiplying them with the fraction of applied over real water savings 2 4 valuing water we compare the marginal cost of water conservation measures against the value that water could potentially generate elsewhere in agriculture and in two other sectors hydropower and ecosystem services related to tourism and fisheries the marginal value of irrigation water is determined with the residual value of irrigation in usd m 3 at the margin of what can be produced using rainfed methods the residual value represents the value of a marginal product of a non priced input young 2005 which in the case of irrigation water is derived by subtracting all non water related estimated costs of production from the total value of output and then dividing this residual by the amount of water applied we rely on the same hydrological and crop production simulations that underpin the cost estimates but here use the volume of irrigation applied and the additional amount of crop that is produced with this amount of irrigation water multiplied by the farm gate price annual prices of crop produce for the period 2000 2018 were taken from faostat and corrected for inflation to 2018 price levels national level crop based weighted averages were calculated with weights assigned based on the years before present thereby giving higher importance to more recent price levels while at the same time accounting for historic price fluctuations basin specific sugarcane prices mwasinga 2018 were used as these were unavailable in faostat costs of production were taken from field surveys in the basin table 2 profit margins are low at the mean observed and simulated maize yields which is mainly grown for home consumption below the break even level of productivity sugarcane outgrowers smallholder farmers who sell their produce to the nearby estate that owns a sugar factory achieve much lower yields 27 30 ton ha 1 chanzi 2016 siima et al 2012 than the large estates which dominate the average and apply more irrigation the value of hydropower depends on many direct and indirect benefits to the economy and society some of which may materialise long into the future and are therefore difficult to quantify one alternative is to assume current tariffs represent the value of electricity another approach as used here is to assume that the costs of constructing and operating the infrastructure the levelized cost of electricity lcoe all costs of construction and operation over the lifetime of the infrastructure should at least equal the value that a hydropower project generates to do this we used a kw h cost price of 0 137 usd from tanzania s national energy master plan based on an estimate of marginal cost of supply for production and transport government of tanzania 2016 fixed costs per kw h were converted into a volumetric cost using the simulated reservoir outflow required to maintain firm energy production which is dependent on reservoir levels at daily time steps while valuations of ecosystem services in africa are limited compared to other continents studies on water related ecosystem services form a much higher proportion of all studies in africa pettinotti et al 2018 here we assign an ecosystem value to water using its essential role in wildlife based tourism a major contributor to gdp in tanzania of foreign currency and of employment cunningham et al 2015 world bank group 2015 most tourists visit the national parks in the north of the country the serengeti and kilimanjaro leading to overcrowding in what is called the northern circuit while the potential of the southern parks including two in the rufiji river basin ruaha national park rnp and nyerere national park nnp part of the former selous game reserve fig 2 is still underexploited world bank group 2015 the world bank estimates that attracting more people to these parks could boost annual gdp by almost 300 million usd corrected for inflation to 2018 provided that two water related potential barriers could be overcome water scarcity in the dry season in the rnp and bad connectivity with nearby parks with the nnp situated between the rnp and major urban centres such as dar es salaam considered a vital link world bank group 2015 starting from an expected trade off with prioritisation of firm energy likely to affect flow variability downstream of the jnhpp duvail et al 2014 geressu et al 2020 and thereby the viability of the nnp as a high value tourism destination the annual potential tourism revenues of 300 million usd are attributed to the amount of water conservation needed for the jnhpp to produce both firm energy and maintain biennial peak flows above 2500 m3 s 1 3 results 3 1 potential of water conservation the modelled potential to reduce both irrigation withdrawal and net irrigation after correcting for the impact on irrigation return flows is high in the rufiji basin due to the large volumes of non beneficial consumptive losses both on field and in the distribution system assumed in the baseline simulation conditions of the more than 2000 mm of irrigation water that is withdrawn in the canal fed systems only a small fraction contributes to crop transpiration fig 3a about half is lost in the distribution system of which half represents permanent losses through evaporation while the other half is either returned to the river or reused of the amount of water actually applied 1162 mm 40 is consumed beneficially and non beneficially while the other 60 is unaccounted for and might return back into the river system at some point in time net irrigation withdrawal minus return flows is about 1000 mm a year implementing water conservation measures reduces both consumptive losses and return flows in the most effective simulated condition from a water conservation point of view fig 3b with irrigation provided by sprinkler and with evaporation reduction conveyance losses and soil return flows are almost eliminated net irrigation is only about 400 mm year 1 supplementing rainfall of 907 mm year 1 of which 727 mm falls within the growing period while maintaining transpiration and thus yield real water savings accounting for changes in return flows amount to a difference in net irrigation of about 600 mm year 1 infiltration enhancement has a negligible impact under all three irrigation systems with a small reduction in irrigation applied in order of tens of mm matched by a similar reduction in surface runoff through a combination of various water conservation measures the ratio of non beneficial consumption to total consumption rnc can be reduced from 72 to as lows as 23 table 3 high conveyance efficiencies for improved sprinkler and drip systems with pressurised supply have conveyance efficiencies of close to 100 which combined with efficiencies at field level leads to overall efficiency of up to 60 a strong reduction in withdrawal and net irrigation comparable to some of the sprinkler options is also possible within canal fed irrigation systems when irrigation application to the field is reduced which limits the supply through the canal system and evaporative losses therein improved conveyance can further lower these evaporative losses accounting for changes in return flows preserves the total amount of flow available to downstream uses but flow patterns will be shifted towards more flow retained in the river system and less routed via the canal soil and the drainage system away from the river runoff will be faster with earlier availability to other users lankford 2012 3 2 cost curve for water conservation measures the modelled total real water savings as a result of implementing water conservation measures on a greatly expanded irrigation area is substantial a potential saving of 2 bcm fig 4 could be achieved from the existing and planned irrigation area upstream of the jnhpp this saving is out of a total of 5 9 bcm withdrawn from the river above the reservoir of which 3 4 bcm of irrigation water is applied to the field reduction of evaporation under conventional flood irrigation is achieved against the lowest marginal costs with the first bcm costing below 0 07 usd m 3 fig 3 measures such as a switch to sprinkler irrigation in combination with improvements in conveyance efficiency can reduce consumptive use and net irrigation demand but against increasingly higher marginal cost for water savings over 1 5 bcm costs rise rapidly from more than 0 14 usd m 3 to over 0 5 usd m 3 for the last cubic metres a cost close to that of modern desalination methods 3 3 value of water for irrigation use across the rufiji river basin whether water conservation is worthwhile from a financial point of view depends on the value that alternative uses of water would generate fig 5 shows the residual marginal value of the four irrigated crops for areas where the crop is currently gown either rainfed or irrigated according to the land use dataset rice maize and cassava are grown throughout the basin while sugarcane is concentrated in pockets in the upstream great ruaha ruaha river catchment and further downstream where the kilombero sugar company is situated between various protected areas residual values for irrigation water tend to be below 0 05 usd m 3 with the exception of cassava which represents a cluster of other irrigated crops that can achieve high yields when irrigated residual values are low when overall gross profit of the crop is low when additional irrigation adds relatively little extra yield or both these conditions apply table 2 shows that maize even with irrigated yields is on average only just above break even levels of productivity less optimal growing conditions in e g the southern highlands in the central part of the basin tip the balance towards negative gross margin and thus negative residual value of irrigation water analysis by the uyole agricultural research institute in mbeya indicates that farmers here are not likely to make a profit growing maize under the current cultivation and market conditions wilson and lewis 2015b the capital to develop irrigation infrastructure and the institutions to fund ongoing operations and maintenance often do not warrant the production of staple crops mwamakamba et al 2017 stirzaker et al 2014 the range of calculated values for irrigation water is similar to that reported for case studies in other basins in the world bierkens et al 2019 hellegers and davidson 2010 hellegers et al 2013 qureshi et al 2018 siderius et al 2021a our marginal value of water for ecosystem services is based on the projected 300 million usd tourism revenue gains per year through the preservation of the downstream rufiji delta ecosystem and the npp that relies on it increasing water savings by 0 5 bcm increments and routing these into the jnhpp reservoir we analysed the threshold above which both biennial peak flow releases and firm energy production could be maintained according to our model simulations using historical rainfall for the period 1981 2010 this would require water conservation in the order of magnitude of at least 1 5 bcm fig 6 upstream of the reservoir as a result of these savings biennial peak releases of more than 2500 m3 s 1 would remain possible even during a sequence of drought and low release conditions as in the 2000s without compromising the ability of the reservoir to maintain firm energy output which translates into a value of 0 20 usd m 3 considerable risk remains however for example in 2001 the peak release condition of the reservoir two thirds full is only just reached and with assumed continued releases would lead to a pronounced fall in lake levels furthermore in 2006 the reservoir live storage is almost fully depleted an additional 0 5 bcm of water savings taking the total to 2 bcm would add extra buffer in dry years fig 6 during normal to wet years with the reservoir near capacity a peak environmental flow release leads to merely a temporary dip in lake volume with reservoir volume often able to recover by the end of the wet season an increase of 1 5 bcm in water savings leads to increased hydropower yield not only because of the extra volume of water available but potentially also because the reservoir can be operated at a higher level especially in dry years when energy can be generated more efficiently during the extreme dry period in 2006 the efficiency reduction was kept at 17 rather than 22 due to reservoir storage not falling below 1 4 bcm at higher reservoir levels at which the reservoir is ideally operated this difference is relatively minor due to the non linear level storage relationship moreover in our application assuming peak releases to maintain environmental flows this extra value is completely offset by increased reservoir outflows above the maximum turbine capacity of 2061 m s 1 during peak flow releases or spillage to avoid over topping as a result around 10 of the extra inflow would not contribute to increased energy production at all this level of energy generation results in an average marginal hydropower value just below 0 04 usd m 3 using the kwh value of 0 137 usd section 2 4 fig 7 compares marginal costs against the three sectoral values as described above values of water for agriculture irrigation are based on the residual values in fig 5 generally value is lower than costs of water conservation due to low crop yields and low profitability of current agriculture costs of a third of measures do overlap with the hydropower values suggesting that a significant part of successfully implemented water conservation practices would be cost effective in terms of increased energy nearly all the measures apart from the most expensive ones e g mainly those involving drip irrigation in combination with one of the other measures would be worth exploring to achieve sufficient environmental flow peak releases to maintain the delta lake ecosystem and the tourism potential of the region 4 discussion using modelling and limited observational and secondary data we explored the potential water savings and costs of 24 combinations of water conservation measures and compared these with the value such water savings could generate from water use in three important economic sectors agriculture energy and downstream ecosystems which have a high tourism potential the cost of water conservation measures was found to be higher than the value of most uses of water for growing crops and the median value for hydropower generation and lower than the ecosystem value nevertheless under high end irrigation expansion plans our modelling assumptions and existing rainfall and river flow conditions 1981 2010 upstream water savings of at least 1 5 bcm if implemented effectively would make financial sense by reducing potential trade offs between use of water for hydropower and ecosystem services allowing peak environmental flow releases even in dry years without reducing firm energy generation due to limited data availability we have taken a simple approach to estimating water related ecosystem value by focusing only on aggregate wildlife tourism an important contributor to tanzania s gdp for which an estimated value exists world bank group 2015 environmental flows through the rufiji delta support numerous other functions such as tanzania s commercial shrimp fisheries existing flood recession irrigation mangroves that provide coastal erosion protection and whale shark habitat around mafia island national park hamerlynck et al 2011 conversely we have not included additional costs to make the southern circuit more attractive for tourism such as better connectivity world bank group 2015 although this would be tied to other benefits such as providing market access for agriculture and lowering prevailing high input costs our estimates of water use values should therefore be considered indicative we did not analyse conditions in which energy generation at the jnhpp would be optimised above the firm energy level our simulations suggest there is only limited scope to increase average outflow beyond the approximately 700 m3 s 1 required to maintain firm energy without increasing the risk of failure to meet environmental flows constraints however this could be explored with tools evaluating more advanced operational rules able to handle different combinations of multi sector objectives we based our value of hydropower energy 0 04 usd m 3 on a kwh cost price of 0 137 usd from tanzania s power system master plan 2016 while this value is lower than earlier estimates of 0 06 usd m 3 for hydropower at the upstream mtera reservoir kadigi et al 2008 or a commonly used value in hydro economic optimisation of 0 08 usd m 3 siderius et al 2016 whittington et al 2005 the kwh estimate is higher than that used by hartmann 2019 the current average retail price of electricity world bank group 2018 or the levelised cost of alternative energy options such as gas and solar or hydropower plants in neighbouring countries such as inga3 in congo deshmukh et al 2018 as such our value is likely a high end estimate of the financial benefit of hydropower we exclude the demand of potential new irrigation schemes in the rufiji delta downstream of the jnhpp we expect that this demand could be accommodated by the firm energy release volumes from the jnhpp whether large scale irrigation should be developed here at all remains questionable peak releases to flood the delta lake ecosystem will put considerable demands on intake design raising costs according to hamerlynck et al 2011 earlier exploration of the irrigation potential in the rufiji delta found that in general there is enough rain for two crops a year and that therefore irrigation is not a necessity and can only be successful as a supplement in bad years if the water can be provided at a relatively small cost more generally large scale irrigation plans in many parts of africa are over optimistic with expansion far slower than planned and much smaller when finally established higginbottom et al 2021 mwamakamba et al 2017 it is therefore highly likely that these estimates taken from official documents are at the upper limit of what is actually going to be achieved our results are based primarily on a modelling system that accounts for water budgets on a 8 km by 8 km grid resolution the hydrological model is validated on observed flows but still makes assumptions about wetland systems and ungauged parts of the basin siderius et al 2021a and produces reasonable simulation of crop yields however we note that there are very limited recent observations of actual abstractions applications and return flows for the irrigated areas in the basin and therefore these results should be considered indicative there is no substitute for in situ data on water use and performance of water conservation measures we rely on idealised though restricted conditions in the model without any validation based on observations of the effectiveness and sustainability of the range of water conservation measures in a local context while we correct for the effect on return flows in order to avoid overly optimistic rates of savings these more efficient ways of irrigation application will result in a temporal and spatial redistribution of return flows in existing irrigation systems with more water remaining in the river main stem and tributaries at the expense of delayed flows through the irrigation drainage system whether natural or constructed affecting those who currently abstract return flows closest to the point of initial application lankford 2004 and while our production cost estimates and prices are derived from local basin studies combined with national statistics we acknowledge that averages do not address the often uneven distribution of benefits and costs of water conservation measures between various types of farmers venot et al 2017 there are additional social costs with higher efficiency systems such as managing the shared responsibilities on collectively owned technically complex equipment and their operation and management costs new technology also needs to align with local decision making structures and technical know how however new systems bring employment opportunities so that some costs may be offset by considering the broader community benefits the impact on groundwater which has largely unexplored potential cuthbert et al 2019 and on those who rely on this source of water would also need further scrutiny our basin scale analysis overlooks sub basin scale trade offs that arise at various points across the basin particularly associated with increasing water use for agriculture and environmental flow requirements at key locations with high ecological or tourism value for example long running tensions exist in the great ruaha catchment between smallholder agriculture and pastoralists irrigation expansion land grabbing and conservation kashaigili et al 2005 lankford 2004 walsh 2012 similar issues relating to access and how political power formal and informal is distributed and exercised affect the way in which different actors access and utilise efficiency gains e g lankford 2013 domestic demand not included in our analysis tends to have a higher value than agriculture hydropower or wildlife tourism demand in terms of volume is comparatively small though and trade offs with other sector demand seem minor indirectly however deforestation linked to agricultural expansion could impact water quality affecting suitability for drinking water ashagre et al 2018 cost savings of 4 6 17 6 million usd per year for forest conservation under water treatment work conditions were estimated by ashagre et al 2018 our water conservation measures especially those targeting evapotranspiration reduction and soil infiltration might not fully prevent but could minimise the impact of land conversion we evaluated the possibility of maintaining firm energy and environmental flows for a near present 30 year time period but more severe multi annual droughts have occurred earlier in the 20th century and climate change projections suggest a further increase in variability siderius et al 2021b average flow is currently 30bcm but can be as low as 20bcm in dry years increased variability in rainfall and runoff in combination with ambitious formal irrigation expansion plans alongside expansion through farmer led processes is likely to test the buffering capacity of even the jnhpp reservoir contingency planning for such events needs to be in place with particular attention to the vulnerability and the high added value of the delta ecosystem such planning requires basin wide institutional strengthening that recognises sector interdependencies the multiplicity of water users and how they are impacted by restrictions venot et al 2021 capacity to implement and maintain infrastructure development programmes coupled with a need to focus on factors affecting performance of local water user associations while taking into account the needs of the poorest richards 2019 sokile et al 2003 5 conclusions given completion of the jnhpp and ambitious irrigation expansion plans considerable water savings would be financially viable in the rufiji river basin but only using water conservation measures lying at the lower end of the marginal cost curve upgrades to the conveyance system followed by evaporation reduction and application by sprinkler controlling for the impact on return flows reduces the amount of water each individual measure saves and increases its volumetric cost at a median cost of 0 07 usd m 3 water conservation is too expensive for the majority of agricultural applications higher than hydropower value but well within the estimated ecosystem value if the ambitious formal irrigation expansion plans are realised without water conservation measures trade offs between energy production and downstream environmental flow demands will be harder to negotiate with considerable risk of jeopardising the highest financial value that of the ecosystem in times of drought noting that our financial estimates are illustrative and not total economic value taken together the major ongoing and planned development of hydropower and irrigation in the rufiji river basin will increase basin scale trade offs in the water energy food and environment sectors this analysis demonstrates several steps towards understanding the value of water in its different uses and thus makes a methodological contribution towards assessing and implementing integrated sector decision making along the lines of the water energy food environment nexus agenda the method is applicable to other regions and illustrates how a combination of financial considerations alongside biophysical assessment explains why not all water saving measures will be financially feasible such information could alongside strengthened multi sector and multi stakeholder engagement processes contribute to informed debate on water

regression the results showed that 1 the temporal variations of spei and smdi0 10 differed with different timescales months and subregions dssat ceres generally performed well in simulating growth and yields of wheat and maize over 1961 2018 2 for spring wheat the correlations of yield and smdi were highest at 3 month timescale in july at 5 month timescale in july and at 3 month timescale in june in subregions i ii and iv respectively for spring maize in subregion i yield correlated with 1 month spei in june best while yield was correlated largest with 4 month spei in august in subregion iii and iv for summer maize the best correlations occurred in august between yield and 4 month spei therefore different crop had varying key parameters for drought prevention measures 3 the multivariable

introduction drought has been the most threatening natural disaster in the world not only in the history but also today chen and sun 2015 mishra and singh 2010 sánchez et al 2016 drought has wide influence range with high loss rate and large number of victims yao et al 2018 zargar et al 2011 due to the complex climate conditions large population fragile ecosystem and rapid economic development china is also vulnerable to climate change and drought disasters lai et al 2018 as a kind of the extreme weather phenomena drought is one of the main climatic constraints affecting crop yields feng and hao 2020 lesk et al 2016 matiu et al 2017 under drought conditions water deficit has a negative impact on crop growth crops close stomata to limit water evaporation resulting in reduced carbon absorption for photosynthesis and ultimately reduced yields leng and hall 2019 drought hazards have caused serious losses to china s grain production and national economy thus affecting the stable development of the society economy based on the global climate models gcm yao et al 2020a used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to predict the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in different regions of china in the future period before 2100 the results showed that the frequency of drought would increase and the drought level would be more severe in order to meet the increasing food demand under the background of future population growth to ensure the stable development of economy and society and to resist the impact of emergencies to understand the impacts of drought events on crop production are very important a large number of drought indices have been proposed developed and used for monitoring and assess drought severity when applied there are classifications of drought types including meteorological hydrological agricultural and social economical the researchers have proposed and developed a number of meteorological drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index palmer 1968 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 atmospheric water defici purcell et al 2003 which calculated according to the water balance between evaporation and precipitation and spei which takes into account the global warming effects vicente serrano et al 2010 among these indices the spei is calculated by the difference of precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration spei has effectively monitored meteorological drought events in the world javed et al 2020 liu et al 2018b peña gallardo et al 2019 there are also many agricultural drought indices crop moisture index palmer 1968 soil water deficit index martínez fernández et al 2015 soil moisture index sridhar et al 2008 modified soil water deficit index yang et al 2017 soil moisture deficit index smdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 smdi has been used to effectively monitor agricultural drought during crop growth period drought happened with certain frequency and complexity at the global country or regional spatial scales or at different timescales li et al 2012 applied historical period s spei precipitation daily average temperature and other meteorological data to conduct drought assessment and the results showed that the degree of aridity was generally high among which the western northern and northeastern regions have the highest degree of aridity and the trend of drought is obvious in spring and autumn wang et al 2016 studied the effects of five drought indexes including soil water content on winter wheat yield in china and pointed out that the correlation between soil water content in the 50 cm soil depth and winter wheat yield was better than that in 10 cm and 20 cm soil depths from october to december hlavinka et al 2008 analyzed the impact of z index on eight crops including winter wheat and corn they found that drought in the vegetative growth stage of crops a sensitive period of crop yield had a greater impact on crop yield chen et al 2020 studied the influences of drought variations during winter wheat growth period and droughts impacts on wheat yields in partial china they concluded that the 4 month timescale spei and 1 month timescale smdi at the 0 10 cm depth affected the winter wheat yield more during the jointing to milk stages previous researches have provided useful references for understanding the connections between drought and crop yield when drought happened agriculture production would negatively respond the effect of drought events on crop yields has been studied by correlating drought index and yield related factors precipitation p is the main source of soil moisture soil moisture in crop roots is the main source of water for crop growth which is very important for crop growth in previous studies statistical methods such as trend analysis regression analysis etc have been commonly used to study the effects of drought on crop yields li et al 2017 ming et al 2015 established regression models between multi scale spei and maize detrended yield timeseries the results showed that spei changes explained 64 8 45 2 58 6 and 54 6 of annual detrended yield variation rates in beijing henan shandong and hebei respectively the traditional way to study the impact of drought on crop production often requires many years of field experiments which will consume a lot of manpower and financial resources and the research progress is slow in addition the data obtained from the field experiment of the site are not universal they cannot be used to analyze the general laws of the whole region or the whole country in recent years the combination of field experiment and crop growth model simulation has been gradually applied and developed in crop growth management and water and fertilizer optimization asadi and clemente 2001 crop models are useful tool to extend the not long measured yield series which could be further used to study the long term effects of droughts the commonly used crop models include wofost dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 apsim agricultural production systems simulator and stics models the dssat cropping system is a package that comprises over 42 crop simulation models and have updated to version 4 7 dssat is one of the most widely used model systems to provide decision making and countermeasures for developing countries to make rational and effective use of natural resources hoogenboom et al 2019 jones et al 2003 the ceres wheat and ceres maize model in the dssat software is specific for the simulation of wheat and maize growth jones et al 2003 they were embedded in the dssat csm cropping system model platform and was able to call the common modules of soil water nitrogen and carbon balances and the meteorological and soil databases yang et al 2020 used dssat to study the past climate change and its impact on the yield of five main cereal crops barley maize millet sorghum and wheat in ethiopia the results showed that the climate in the past 40 years may be the reason for the increasing trend of corn yield and the decreasing trend of wheat yield the grain yield was positively correlated with solar radiation and temperature in the growing season but negatively correlated with precipitation in the growing season liu et al 2019 used dssat ceres maize model to estimate maize yield and evaluated the sensitivity of maize yield to hydro climatic variables precipitation temperature solar radiation soil moisture the results showed that the simulation performance of dssat ceres maize model were high but they could reflect the annual variation trend of maize yield maize yield was sensitive to soil water use efficiency and precipitation especially in one month before sowing crop models are also useful for prediction or projection of future crop yields for example xiao et al 2020 applied the statistical downscaling method to convert the monthly gcm grid data into the daily data of 61 stations in north china plain under two representative concentration paths rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 and combined with the apsim model to simulate yield and water consumption of spring wheat and summer maize during 2031 2060 and 2071 2100 their results showed that the reproductive growth period of winter wheat would be prolonged and that of summer maize will be shortened under the future climate conditions implying a negative impact of future climate on maize yield but a positive impact on wheat yield although several researches have studied how the drought affected crop growth or yields the key parameters that revealing the inherent relationship between drought events and crop growth such as the better drought index the most sensitive timescale the most important month during crop growth stages that crop growth and yields responded to drought hazards have not been investigated in addition the research on the mechanism of crop yield reduction caused by drought is not deep enough it is necessary to further study the quantitative relationship between the spatiotemporal variation of drought and crop growth and yield reduction rate this study aims to analyze the impacts of meteorological and agricultural droughts on wheat and maize yields from multiple perspectives and to select the key parameters which described the relationship between drought indices and crop growth and yields the spei and smdi time series of spring wheat spring summer maize at different timescales would be calculated to explore the temporal and spatial variation of meteorological and agricultural droughts from 1961 to 2018 based on the measured phenological period yield soil and meteorological data of spring wheat spring and summer maize combining with dssat ceres wheat maize models the genetic coefficients of spring wheat spring summer maize would be calibrated and verified the phenological period yield related factors of spring wheat spring summer maize from 1961 to 2018 would be simulated and their spatiotemporal changes would be analyzed then the quantitative relationships between spei and smdi at different timescales and yield of the crops would be analyzed the key growth period suitable drought index and key time scale of growth and yield changes of spring wheat spring summer maize in response to drought would be determined and the yield reduction mechanism of spring wheat spring and summer maize under drought background would be revealed the results are referable for providing measures for agricultural production under drought 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area sites meteorological and crop data according to china s agricultural industry development report 2020 which was

evapotranspiration index spei in order to identify the meteorological drought during the growth period of wheat and maize the spei values at the 1 9 months of timescales during crop growth period performed at each station and subregion are computed spei is the difference between p and reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 the general procedure of computing spei follows chen et al 2020 yao et al 2020b 1 to estimate et 0 at the monthly timescale using penman monteith equation proposed by food and agriculture organization allen et al 1998 peng et al 2017 xiang et al 2020 2 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation mjm 2day 1 g is the downward surface heat flux mjm 2day 1 δ is the slope of saturated vapor pressure kpa c 1 γ is the humidity

et 0 namely d 3 d p e t 0 3 the 3 parameter log logistic probability distribution has been compared with the other distribution and shown to be the best distribution for most sites and sub regions in china yao et al 2020b therefore the log logistic distribution is used here to standardize the d series 4 f x 1 α x γ β 1 where f x is cumulative probability distribution function of a given timescale α is scale parameter β is shape parameter and γ is origin parameter 4 to calculate the corresponding spei 5 s p e i w c 0 c 1 w c 2 w 2 1 d 1 w d 2 w 2 d 3 w 3 6 w 2 ln p d where c 0 2 515517 c 1 0

widely used to describe agricultural drought kamali et al 2015 yang et al 2017 yirdaw et al 2008 the calculation formulas of smdi are as follows 7 s d i j s w i j m s w j m s w j min s w j 100 s w i j

long term maximum or minimum soil water content mm in the soil profile respectively the dry wet levels according to different ranges of spei and smdi are classified table 1 the typical drought years are selected according to the spei and smdi 2 4 simulation of crop growth and yield related factors 2 4 1 brief introduction of the dssat ceres model the collected crop yield data were only for 2 13 years in order to study the long term effects of drought on wheat and maize yields it is necessary to extend the yield data series using the dssat ceres wheat maize model the preliminary establishment of the model is based on the collection processing and establishment of some input files the input data for certain crop generally contain four modules including meteorology soil field management and crop genetic coefficients meteorological data mainly include solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature rainfall wind speed and sunshine hours the input soil parameters include sat wp fc shc rmc clay content sand content and initial soil water content at the depth ranges of 0 4 5 4 5 9 1 9 1 16 6 16 6 28 9 28 9 49 3 49 3 82 9 82 9 138 3 cm respectively the sowing date fertilizer amount irrigation method and irrigation amount are needed for field management data 2 4 2 calibration and verification of crop genetic parameters before dssat is applied to simulate the meteorological yields under rain fed conditions in the historical period 1961 2019 the genetic coefficients of crop varieties are needed the genetic coefficients of crop are highly related to crop growth and development plant morphology and yield formation therefore it is the first step to calibrate the genetic coefficients of spring wheat spring summer maize using 13 years 2001 2013 of observed anthesis date maturity date and yield data the genetic coefficients of spring wheat were p1v p1d p5 g1 g2 g3 and phint yao et al 2015 for maize the genetic coefficients were p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint respectively in dssat the genetic coefficients of spring wheat spring summer maize are debugged by generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue chen et al 2020 in the glue program the likelihood function is used as the evaluation standard for the estimation of genetic coefficients of varieties the program compares the difference between the simulated value of each model and the corresponding observed value and calculates the likelihood value between them the greater the likelihood value the closer the simulated value is to the observed value and vice versa then the total likelihood values of all relevant simulated and observed values are calculated and the likelihood values of the coefficients set generating the simulated values are calculated by bayesian formula finally the posterior distribution of the model coefficients is constructed by using the likelihood values of the parameter set under the condition of large model uncertainty and observation uncertainty the reliability of the coefficients determined by the likelihood function value is higher the process of debugging crop genetic coefficients contains two rounds 6000 times in each round the aim of the first round is to adjust the phenological coefficients of crops and the growth coefficients of crops are estimated in the second round he 2008 the anthesis date maturity date and yield data of the former 6 years were used to calibrate the genetic coefficients 2001 2006 and the data of the later 7 years are used to validate the genetic coefficients finally the crop s leaf area index lai biomass and meteorological yields from 1961 to 2018 are simulated using the calibrated genetic coefficients at the selected sites 2 4 3 model performance assessment the coefficient of determination r 2 and relative root mean square error rrmse are used to evaluate the performance of the dssat ceres model during calibration validation and simulation processes the computation of r 2 and rrmse are as follows 9 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 10 r r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 o 100 where s i is the ith simulated value i 1 2 13 is the mean value of s i o i is the ith observed value is the mean value of o i and n is the number of samples generally the higher the r 2 values or the lower the rrmse values the better the model performance 2 5 the determination of key variables and quantitative relationship for crop yield related factors the pearson correlation coefficient values between drought indices at different timescales during the crop growth period and crop yield related factors are estimated the growth period of spring wheat from february to october and the timescales of spei and smdi range from 1 to 9 month the growth period of spring maize is from april to october and the timescales of spei and smdi are from 1 to 7 month for summer maize the growth period is from june to october and the timescales for spei and smdi are 1 to 5 month the larger the correlation coefficient the better relationship between crop yield and drought indices then the best timescale of drought index the most appropriate month that crop growth and yield is affected by drought events and the better drought index that reflects impacts of drought events on crop growth and yields are identified in order to comprehensively analyze the effects of precipitation temperature and soil water content on crop growth and yield the multivariable linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the simulated values of crop yield laimax biomass and drought indexes spei and smdi0 10 at the selected key timescale and crop growth period month for the period 1961 2018 2 6 the impacts of drought events on crop yield related factors when the spei or smdi is between 0 5 and 0 5 the year is regarded as a normal year for crop growth and the average yield in the normal years is estimated and using as the reference yield when the spei or smdi is below 0 5 the year is classified as a drought year the annual yield reduction rate is calculated by 10 y ield l nor y i e l d l k 1 y i e l d l k 2 y i e l d l k n n 11 y rr l m y i e l d l n o r y i e l d l m y i e l d l n o r 100 where yield l nor represents the reference yield of the selected site n represents the number of normal years over 1960 2018 yield l k 1 2 n represents the actual production of the nth year yrr l m is the yield reduction rate of the selected site in the mth m 1 2 58 year yield l m m 1 2 58 stands for the actual production in the mth year the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to assess the relationship between the liner slope of yield related factors vs liner slope of drought index larger absolute values of r indicate closer relationships between the two variables and vice versa the technology roadmap of this research is shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 variations of drought indices for different timescales months and subregions 3 1 1 spei the temporal variations of spei at different timescales during the growth period of spring maize from 1961 to 2018 are shown in fig 3 the results showed that 1 the dry and wet successions of meteorological droughts in 3 subregions can be clearly discerned from random variations of spei there were obvious differences of spei among the different subregions in the same region for certain year or month the dry or wet status was generally consistent at the different timescales despite the drought severity level slightly transferred 2 the severe and extreme droughts in spring maize growth period mainly occurred before 1990 s in subregion i while occurred in the late 1990 s in subregions ⅲ and iv 3 taking the year 1963 as an example spring maize growth period was in normal state 0 5 spei 0 5 in subregion i while slightly extremely wet occurred in the entire growth period of spring maize spei 0 5 in subregion ⅲ moreover the moderate extremely drought 1 spei 4 occurred in may and june but normal to wet conditions spei 0 occurred in the other months for subregion iv therefore there were specific dry wet changes according to different timescales of spei different months of crop growth period and different dry wet years 4 in general the spei at 1 to 7 month timescales indicated both similarity at some extent and different degrees of drought in spring maize growth period from april to october there were gradually propagation of drought 3 1 2 smdi the temporal variations of smdi at 0 10 cm depth smdi0 10 for 1 to 7 month timescales in different growth periods of spring maize april to october in 1961 2018 are illustrated in fig 4 the results showed that 1 in subregion i from 1960 to 1975 there was a continuous agricultural drought smdi0 10 0 5 from 1976 to 1997 it became wetter smdi0 10 0 5 from about 1999 2015 more wet events occurred which happened especially obvious in october considering that there were slightly transfer of dry wet conditions from april to october in general subregion i experience wetter trends during crop growth period over 1961 2018 2 the smdi0 10 values at larger timescales were larger than that at smaller timescales indicating more severe drought humidity intensity 3 in subregion ⅲ from 1961 to 1978 there were slightly more wet events from 1979 to 2014 there were slightly more dry events especially during 2010 2014 there was a continuous extreme drought event 4 smdi0 10 2 during growth period of spring maize followed by four consecutive wet years 2 smdi0 10 4 4 in subregion iv continuous slightly moderate drought 0 5 smdi0 10 1 5 occurred in the whole growth period of spring maize from 1996 to 2003 in 2004 the spring maize was in a wet state in every month during its growth period smdi0 10 0 5 5 the dry and wet state of spring maize varied greatly in different months for example from 1982 to 1994 the jointing anthesis period of spring maize was slightly dry while other months were relatively wet or normal from 2010 to 2017 the jointing anthesis period of spring maize was wetter than other months in the growth period 6 in general the agricultural drought indicated by smdi0 10 were regional timescale and month specific spei at different timescales in different month of spring wheat and summer maize growth periods presents similar variation patterns fig s1 the temporal variations of smdi 0 10 for winter wheat and summer maize also fluctuated with different timescales different months of the year and different subregions fig s2 smdi at 10 40 cm depth smdi10 40 fluctuated less intensely than smdi0 10 but still randomly in different subregions data not shown 3 2 crop growth and yield variations 3 2 1 spatial variations of crop phenology the growth period of spring wheat is generally form february to october spring maize is from april to october and for summer maize is from june to october the spatial variation of the average day of the year doy in different growth stages from 1991 to 2013 is plotted in details for 3 different crops in fig 5 the results showed that 1 the sowing date of spring wheat was during march to april the anthesis period was in the mid june the milk period was mostly in late july the crops matured in september 2 the sowing jointing anthesis and maturity periods of spring maize were during late april to early may late june mid july in northeast china it was late july and around the middle of september some stations in northeast china are in late october respectively 3 for summer maize the phenology for sowing jointing anthesis milk and maturity were about the first ten days of june in early july in the last ten days of july in the last ten days of september and the middle ten days of october in turn 3 2 2 spatial distribution of the validated genetic coefficients the performance of the dssat ceres maize and dssat ceres wheat was evaluated by comparing the measured and simulated values of anthesis date maturity date and yield fig 6 the results showed that there were good and significant correlation between the simulated and measured values of phenology and yield of spring wheat and spring summer maize in the calibration and validation stage the performance of the dssat ceres wheat coefficient of determination r 2 0 95 were better than that of dssat ceres maize r 2 0 70 the performance of dssat ceres maize for summer maize were slightly better than that of spring maize in general the dssat performance for simulating the anthesis date maturity date and yields of the three crops were good 0 53 r 2 0 95 and rrmse 0 2 therefore dssat ceres wheat maize could be further used to simulate the critical growth periods and yields of spring wheat spring summer maize over the study period the calibrated and validated crop genetic coefficients at different sites using dssat ceres wheat maize modes are mapped for spring wheat spring summer maize in fig 7 the specific values of genetic coefficients of spring wheat and spring summer maize are shown in tables 2 4 respectively these values are further used for simulation of long term 1961 2018 time series of lai biomass and yield over 1961 2018 for the three crops 3 2 3 temporal variations of the maximum leaf area index laimax biomass and yield among the growth indices the maximum leaf area index laimax in the whole growth period under rain fed conditions is selected as a key crop growth parameter because lai changes with crop growth stages and can t be all used for analysis the annual variations of yield biomass and laimax values of three crops are shown in fig 8 the results showed that 1 the laimax biomass and yield had spatial and temporal variability ranges of laimax of spring wheat spring summer maize were 0 3 3 1 4 7 8 and 2 5 5 9 respectively ranges of biomass of spring wheat spring summer maize were 10 050 34 200 12 270 34 000 9100 21 043 kg ha 1 respectively and ranges of yield of spring wheat spring summer maize were1400 12230 2430 12980 2400 23800 kg ha 1 respectively 2 the annual average laimax of spring wheat was less than 2 the annual average laimax of spring maize was about 20 higher than that of summer maize 3 the annual average biomass of spring summer maize fluctuated around 2000 kg ha 1 and 1500 kg ha 1 respectively 4 the annual average climate yield of spring wheat was relatively stable at about 5000 kg ha 1 while the annual average yield of spring summer maize had a slightly downward trend 3 3 effects of droughts on crop growth and yields 3 3 1 pearson correlations between crop yields and drought indices 3 3 1 1 for spring wheat the r values between spei and spring wheat yield over 1961 2018 are given in table 5 the results showed that 1 for the three regions in the first two months february and march of spring wheat growth period there were negative correlations between spring wheat yield and spei in subregions i and ii there was no obvious correlation between yield and spei in september and october 2 in subregion i the best correlation occurred in july and the r value 0 43 between yield and 9 month spei was the highest 3 in subregion ⅱ the correlations between yield and spei was good in august and the correlations between yield and spei at 1 and 3 month timescales were better r 0 44 4 in subregion iv the relationship between yield and spei was fine from june to october the best correlation was in september the correlation between yield and 4 month spei was the largest in september r 0 45 5 the key parameters of spring wheat responses to the meteorological droughts were not universal and varied with specific conditions of timescale of spei crop growth stages and subregions the r values between spring wheat yield and smdi 0 10 and over 1961 2018 are given in table 6 the result reflected that 1 for subregions i and ii there were good positive correlations between yield and smdi 0 10 at 1 to 6 month timescales in july and the r was the highest at the 3 month timescale r 0 44 and the 5 month timescale r 0 47 respectively 2 however in subregion iv the correlations between yield and smdi 0 10 was the best at the 3 month timescale in june r 0 45 3 the key parameters of spring wheat growth and yield responses to the agricultural droughts also varied with specific conditions of timescale of smdi0 10 crop growth stages and subregions correlations between spring wheat yield and smdi10 40 were also not universal at different conditions in general their relationship was not so good as yield vs smdi0 10 data not shown by comparing tables 5 and 6 the number of timescales with r 0 35 between smdi 0 10 and yield in spring wheat growth period was larger than that of spei therefore smdi 0 10 in spring wheat growth period can better identify the relationship between drought and spring wheat yield than spei 3 3 1 2 for spring and summer maize similar to spring wheat there were significant positive correlations between spei and yield of spring maize table 7 the results showed that 1 the pearson correlation coefficients between spei and yield were the highest at 4 month timescale in august in subregions iii r 0 39 and iv r 0 40 2 in subregion i the correlations between yield and spei were the best at the 1 month timescale in june r 0 38 the r values between spring maize yield and smdi0 10 over 1961 2018 are given in table 8 the results showed that 1 in subregion i the correlation between smdi0 10 and yield was the best in june and the correlation between smdi0 10 and yield was the largest at 3 month timescale r 0 38 2 in subregion iii the significant positive correlations mainly appeared in september and october and the correlation between yield and smdi0 10 at 1 month timescale was the best in october r 0 33 3 in subregion iv there were good positive correlations between spring maize yield and at smdi0 10 at 1 to 7 month timescales from july to october and the r value between spring maize yield and smdi0 10 at 2 month timescale was the largest in august r 0 38 similarly the correlation coefficient values between multi scalar spei smdi vs summer maize yield are presented in table 9 it showed that 1 spei can well identify drought in the growth period of summer maize the significant positive correlation between yield and spei at 4 month timescale was the best in august r 0 41 2 there was a good positive correlation between summer maize yield and smdi0 10 at the sowing anthesis period june to august and the r value of yield and smdi0 10 at 1 month timescale was the highest in june r 0 17 differently the number of sites which had r 0 35 for yield vs spei of spring and summer maize were larger than for yield vs smdi0 10 therefore spei better reflected spring and summer maize growth and yield responses to drought than smdi0 10 3 3 2 the key timescale and growth period for different crops moreover the value of r value between spei smdi0 10 and yield of spring wheat was larger than that of spring summer maize spei smdi0 10 at the timescale with the largest absolute value of r at certain significance were selected as the drought index of each subregions the results are shown in table 10 3 3 3 effect of droughts on yield reduction rate according to the temporal variations of spei and smdi0 10 the years 2001 for spring wheat 2001 for spring maize and 2000 for summer maize were selected as typical drought years respectively the site specific spei smdi0 10 which have been shown to be better drought index for wheat and maize and yield reduction rate in the typical drought years are mapped in fig 9 in the typical drought years the crop yield decreased significantly and crop yield reductions were obvious at all the sites there was high consistence between spei smdi0 10 and yield reduction rate the smaller spei smdi0 10 values the greater the yield reduction rates in particular the yield of spring wheat in most stations of subregions i and ii decreased by more than 20 fig 9 d and the yield reduction rate of spring maize in most sites of region iv was more than 25 fig 9 e for summer maize the yield reduction is relatively small about 15 fig 9 f 3 3 4 relationship between linear slopes of yield related factors and drought indices the linear slopes of laimax aboveground biomass and yield had good positive and significant correlations with the linear slopes of smdi0 10 of spring wheat or spei of spring summer maize figs 10 and 11 which further revealed the relationship between changes of crop growth yield vs drought index the linear slopes of smdi0 10 had the best correlation with the linear slopes of spring wheat yield r 0 67 while the relationship between the linear slopes of smdi0 10 and the linear slopes of spring maize laimax was the smallest r 0 15 the linear slopes of laimax biomass yield vs drought index had positive correlations however with the increase of spei linear slope of spei 0 tended to be wetter laimax biomass and yield showed different changes at some sites of spring wheat and spring maize the wetter the soil was the lower yield related factors were linear slope of laimax biomass yield 0 and vice versa there were closer connections between linear slopes of yield vs spei smdi0 10 than linear slope of laimax and biomass vs spei smdi0 10 the linear slopes of smdi0 10 of spring wheat spring summer maize also had good positive and significant correlations with the linear slopes of laimax aboveground biomass and yield fig 11 overall for spring wheat the linear slopes of yield related factors had closer connections with the linear slopes of smdi0 10 than spei however it was contrary for spring summer maize it implied that for different crops drought prevention measures during crop growth period should be different 4 discussions 4 1 influences of precipitation air temperature and soil water content on crop yields precipitation air temperature and soil water content direct affect crop growth and yields taking the spring wheat as an example there were close relationship between the yields and related agrometeorological variables fig 12 at the site of jinghe in xinjiang china the r2 values between spring wheat yields and growth period precipitation average temperature and mean soil water content at 0 10 cm depth were all above 0 25 among which soil water content at 0 10 cm depth during growth period impacted yield greatest fig 12a c the effects of growth period precipitation average temperature and mean soil water content at 0 10 cm depth during on yield have spatial variability fig 12d f in space the influences of average temperature and mean soil water content at 0 10 cm depth on yield were greater than growth period precipitation in addition there were large r values between yield and growth period precipitation for sites at higher latitude however relationship between yield and mean temperature or mean soil water content at 0 10 cm depth were opposite 4 2 quantitative relationship between crop yields and drought indices the quantitative relationships between crop yields and drought indices changed with crop types month of crop growth timescale or types of drought indices sites or regions and applied crop models when the crop growth and yields data need to be simulated the correlations between smdi10 40 and wheat maize yield were poor compared with smdi0 10 and spei perhaps because the water content of shallow soil varied more abrupt thus has greater impacts on crop yields chen et al 2020 investigated the variations of winter wheat yield simulated by dssat ceres wheat and drought indices spei smdi0 10 over 1981 2015 in china and the correlations between them they compared the results and found yields were better correlated to smdi0 10 than to spei masud et al 2020 studied the quantitative relationship between spring wheat production and spei smdi0 10 the results showed that in the early growth season of spring wheat smdi0 10 had higher correlations with production than spei and crop production was highly sensitive to soil water deficit in this study the quantitative relationships between spring wheat yield and smdi0 10 were better than that of yield vs spei or smdi10 40 former researches consistently manifest better correlations of wheat yield with smdi0 10 than spei this was reasonable since soil water is the main source of crop water however the relationship between maize yield and drought indices were different with that of wheat spei was highly correlated with maize yield reduction in north china plain which can effectively evaluate the effects of drought on maize yield ming et al 2015 kurniasih and impron 2017 studied the effects of drought degree and duration using spi and spei on the variability of maize yield loss in bandung west java of indonesia the results showed that spi had similar performance with spei in quantitative analysis of drought events in addition drought in maize reproductive growth period have caused the greatest yield loss labudová et al 2017 studied the correlations between maize yield and spei spi and obtained higher correlations between maize yield and spei than that with spi there were also other studies which applied spei to analyze the frequency and severity of drought in maize growth period guna et al 2019 guo et al 2019 masupha and moeletsi 2017 their results showed that spei could well identify drought in maize growth period in this research higher correlations between maize yield and spei were found than smdi as an agricultural drought index smdi indicates soil drought severity levels while spei denotes meteorological drought severity level crop yields are both affected by meteorological and agricultural droughts of which the latter affects crop growth and yield more however there may be different results for specific conditions it is still uncertain under what conditions crop yield had better relationships with meteorological and agricultural drought indices 4 3 key parameters for denoting drought effects on crop yields the parameters for denoting drought effects on crop yields include the key months of crop growth and key timescales of drought indices under which crop yield had better correlations with drought indices wang et al 2021 found that wheat yields were easily affected by droughts at key phenological stages drought stress at grain filling stage had the greatest impacts on 1000 grain weight of wheat in spring wheat milk period july and august drought had a greater impact on yield chen et al 2020 compared the effects of drought at different timescales and crop growth periods and concluded that winter wheat yield had better relationships with the 4 month timescale spei and 1 month timescale smdi0 10 than the other conditions in this study spei and smdi0 10 of 1 to 3 month timescales better reflected the effects of drought on spring wheat yields the influences of drought on spring maize yield varied with different drought severity levels and different crop growth periods mild drought had little effect on maize yield while severe drought spei 1 0 significantly reduced the yield of maize especially in the stages after anthesis chen et al 2016 in the reproductive growth period of maize drought led to the most serious reduction of maize production kurniasih and impron 2017 chen et al 2021 tested the influences of moderate and severe drought stress at three critical growth periods jointing tasseling and milk of danyu 405 spring maize the results showed that the starch content of grain was most sensitive to drought in jointing tasseling period which is a period of vegetative and reproductive growth concurrently the most vigorous stage in the whole life of maize dry matter accumulation begins to increase and leaf transpiration increases and a key period of water demand water deficit had a significant effect on grain yield especially before tasseling kefale and ranamukhaarachchi 2004 as to the key timescale of drought indices labudová et al 2017 reported that maize had the highest correlation with 3 month timescale spei in august which representing the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in summer this research showed that the correlation coefficient between spring maize yield and 4 month timescale spei in august was the largest in subregion iii and iv while in subregion i spring maize yield was best correlated to the 1 month timescale spei in june table 4 jointing tasseling period july is the most critical growth period for summer maize the yield responses to the key growth periods or key timescale of drought indices were also variable for example drought had the greatest effect on yield during pre anthesis and post anthesis periods while drought had little effect on yield in early vegetative growth liu 2015 in shaanxi china summer maize yield was more sensitive to spei at the 3 month timescale in august guo et al 2019 drought in vegetative growth period is considered recoverable daryanto et al 2016 in this study we found that the key growth period of summer maize is anthesis period late july the best relationship between summer maize yield and spei was in august the key timescale of spei was at 4 month namely the 4 month timescale spei in august are key in identifying the drought of summer maize during anthesis and jointing period the key crop growth periods or key timescale of drought indices varied with crop types the selected drought indices and subregions to obtain universal key parameters are difficult the uncertainty of the determination of the key parameters between crop yields and drought indices encourage us to do detail and deeper investigations in the related topics 4 4 different responses of wheat and maize to drought the responses of wheat and maize yield to drought was quite different hu et al 2014 used dssat combined with the output of regional climate model studied the effect of drought on wheat and maize yield in wheat maize rotation planting area of north china plain under a1b climate change scenario the results showed that the response of wheat and maize to drought is quite different compared with 1961 1990 under the a1b climate change scenarios the yield of wheat would increase while the yield of maize would decrease moreover drought may lead to a lower decline in the yield of wheat than that of maize daryanto et al 2016 reported that under the condition of about 40 water reduction the yield of wheat decreased 20 6 lower than that of maize 39 3 and maize was more sensitive to drought than wheat especially in the reproductive period xiao et al 2020 reported that under the future climate conditions the growth period of winter wheat will be prolonged while that of summer maize will be shortened this study showed that the responses of wheat and maize yield to drought were quite different 1 the correlations between wheat yield and agricultural drought index smdi0 10 was better while the correlations between maize yield and meteorological drought index spei was better 2 maize yield reduction was larger than wheat yield reduction in drought years 3 maize yield was more sensitive to drought there were greater slope values between linear slopes of drought index and linear slopes of crop yields as to yield and spei spring maize 1603 5 summer maize 710 83 spring wheat 311 4 as to yield and smdi spring maize 1371 7 summer maize 502 85 spring wheat 455 67 figs 9 and 10 maize belongs to c4 grain variety and has higher water use efficiency than wheat which belongs to c3 grain variety when water supply is sufficient however under limited water supply or drought stress conditions the chlorophyll content of maize is lower the leaf mortality is higher and the recovery rate of photosynthetic rate of maize after drought is slower than that of wheat consequently wheat still realize normal grain filling by mobilizing stem reserve daryanto et al 2016 ripley et al 2010 this may explain in part the difference of physiological function between wheat and maize and the differences of determined key parameters that wheat and maize responses to drought 5 conclusions for spring wheat better relationship between yields and smdi0 10 than yields and spei were found drought in june and july had the greatest impacts on yields the correlations of yield and smdi0 10 in subregions i ii and iv were highest at 3 month timescale in july r 0 44 at 5 month timescale in july r 0 47 and at 3 month timescale in june r 0 45 respectively for spring and summer maize there were better relationship between yields and spei than smdi0 10 for spring maize the continuous drought during jointing tasseling period has the greatest influence on the spring maize yield in subregion i the 1 month timescale spei in june r 0 38 had the greatest impact on yield while the correlations between yields and 4 month timescale spei in august was the largest in subregion iii and iv r 0 39 and 0 40 respectively for summer maize drought had the greatest effect on yield during the anthesis period the significant positive correlation between yield and spei at the 4 month timescale in august was the best r 0 41 the results of multiple linear regression functions between crop yield laimax biomass of spring wheat and spring summer maize and drought indexes spei and smdi0 10 using the key timescale and growth period month in table 10 showed that there were good and significant correlations p value 0 1 between yield related factors and drought indexes the r2 values ranged between 0 24 and 0 46 for spring wheat 0 31 0 49 for spring maize and 0 37 0 47 for summer maize respectively in general the multivariable linear equations described yield growth vs drought indices relationship well for different crops the linear slopes of laimax biomass yield and drought indices had consistent variations and there were generally positive correlations between linear slopes values of crop yield related factors laimax biomass yield with drought indices the linear slopes of smdi has greater influence on the linear slopes of yield related factors of spring wheat than that of spei but the opposite was true for maize the key drought

9538,drought is a natural hazard that may decrease agricultural production to investigate crop growth and yield responses to drought conditions are vital for drought prevention during crop growth periods this study aims to analyze the impacts of meteorological and agricultural droughts on wheat maize yields from multiple perspectives and to select the key parameters which describe the best relationship between crop yield and drought indices using standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and soil moisture deficit index smdi at 1 to 9 month timescales the drought characteristics of different crop growth periods at the selected 98 sites in different subregions were analyzed dssat ceres wheat maize models were used to simulate the leaf area index lai biomass and yield of spring wheat spring and summer maize over 1961 2018 the relationships between yield related factors and spei smdi0 10 at different timescales were investigated using pearson correlation the key timescale and growth period which showed the best correlations between crop yield growth and spei smdi were determined and used to obtain the yield growth equations using multivariable linear regression the results showed that 1 the temporal variations of spei and smdi0 10 differed with different timescales months and subregions dssat ceres generally performed well in simulating growth and yields of wheat and maize over 1961 2018 2 for spring wheat the correlations of yield and smdi were highest at 3 month timescale in july at 5 month timescale in july and at 3 month timescale in june in subregions i ii and iv respectively for spring maize in subregion i yield correlated with 1 month spei in june best while yield was correlated largest with 4 month spei in august in subregion iii and iv for summer maize the best correlations occurred in august between yield and 4 month spei therefore different crop had varying key parameters for drought prevention measures 3 the multivariable

introduction drought has been the most threatening natural disaster in the world not only in the history but also today chen and sun 2015 mishra and singh 2010 sánchez et al 2016 drought has wide influence range with high loss rate and large number of victims yao et al 2018 zargar et al 2011 due to the complex climate conditions large population fragile ecosystem and rapid economic development china is also vulnerable to climate change and drought disasters lai et al 2018 as a kind of the extreme weather phenomena drought is one of the main climatic constraints affecting crop yields feng and hao 2020 lesk et al 2016 matiu et al 2017 under drought conditions water deficit has a negative impact on crop growth crops close stomata to limit water evaporation resulting in reduced carbon absorption for photosynthesis and ultimately reduced yields leng and hall 2019 drought hazards have caused serious losses to china s grain production and national economy thus affecting the stable development of the society economy based on the global climate models gcm yao et al 2020a used the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei to predict the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought in different regions of china in the future period before 2100 the results showed that the frequency of drought would increase and the drought level would be more severe in order to meet the increasing food demand under the background of future population growth to ensure the stable development of economy and society and to resist the impact of emergencies to understand the impacts of drought events on crop production are very important a large number of drought indices have been proposed developed and used for monitoring and assess drought severity when applied there are classifications of drought types including meteorological hydrological agricultural and social economical the researchers have proposed and developed a number of meteorological drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index palmer 1968 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 atmospheric water defici purcell et al 2003 which calculated according to the water balance between evaporation and precipitation and spei which takes into account the global warming effects vicente serrano et al 2010 among these indices the spei is calculated by the difference of precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration spei has effectively monitored meteorological drought events in the world javed et al 2020 liu et al 2018b peña gallardo et al 2019 there are also many agricultural drought indices crop moisture index palmer 1968 soil water deficit index martínez fernández et al 2015 soil moisture index sridhar et al 2008 modified soil water deficit index yang et al 2017 soil moisture deficit index smdi narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 smdi has been used to effectively monitor agricultural drought during crop growth period drought happened with certain frequency and complexity at the global country or regional spatial scales or at different timescales li et al 2012 applied historical period s spei precipitation daily average temperature and other meteorological data to conduct drought assessment and the results showed that the degree of aridity was generally high among which the western northern and northeastern regions have the highest degree of aridity and the trend of drought is obvious in spring and autumn wang et al 2016 studied the effects of five drought indexes including soil water content on winter wheat yield in china and pointed out that the correlation between soil water content in the 50 cm soil depth and winter wheat yield was better than that in 10 cm and 20 cm soil depths from october to december hlavinka et al 2008 analyzed the impact of z index on eight crops including winter wheat and corn they found that drought in the vegetative growth stage of crops a sensitive period of crop yield had a greater impact on crop yield chen et al 2020 studied the influences of drought variations during winter wheat growth period and droughts impacts on wheat yields in partial china they concluded that the 4 month timescale spei and 1 month timescale smdi at the 0 10 cm depth affected the winter wheat yield more during the jointing to milk stages previous researches have provided useful references for understanding the connections between drought and crop yield when drought happened agriculture production would negatively respond the effect of drought events on crop yields has been studied by correlating drought index and yield related factors precipitation p is the main source of soil moisture soil moisture in crop roots is the main source of water for crop growth which is very important for crop growth in previous studies statistical methods such as trend analysis regression analysis etc have been commonly used to study the effects of drought on crop yields li et al 2017 ming et al 2015 established regression models between multi scale spei and maize detrended yield timeseries the results showed that spei changes explained 64 8 45 2 58 6 and 54 6 of annual detrended yield variation rates in beijing henan shandong and hebei respectively the traditional way to study the impact of drought on crop production often requires many years of field experiments which will consume a lot of manpower and financial resources and the research progress is slow in addition the data obtained from the field experiment of the site are not universal they cannot be used to analyze the general laws of the whole region or the whole country in recent years the combination of field experiment and crop growth model simulation has been gradually applied and developed in crop growth management and water and fertilizer optimization asadi and clemente 2001 crop models are useful tool to extend the not long measured yield series which could be further used to study the long term effects of droughts the commonly used crop models include wofost dssat decision support system for agrotechnology transfer jones et al 2003 apsim agricultural production systems simulator and stics models the dssat cropping system is a package that comprises over 42 crop simulation models and have updated to version 4 7 dssat is one of the most widely used model systems to provide decision making and countermeasures for developing countries to make rational and effective use of natural resources hoogenboom et al 2019 jones et al 2003 the ceres wheat and ceres maize model in the dssat software is specific for the simulation of wheat and maize growth jones et al 2003 they were embedded in the dssat csm cropping system model platform and was able to call the common modules of soil water nitrogen and carbon balances and the meteorological and soil databases yang et al 2020 used dssat to study the past climate change and its impact on the yield of five main cereal crops barley maize millet sorghum and wheat in ethiopia the results showed that the climate in the past 40 years may be the reason for the increasing trend of corn yield and the decreasing trend of wheat yield the grain yield was positively correlated with solar radiation and temperature in the growing season but negatively correlated with precipitation in the growing season liu et al 2019 used dssat ceres maize model to estimate maize yield and evaluated the sensitivity of maize yield to hydro climatic variables precipitation temperature solar radiation soil moisture the results showed that the simulation performance of dssat ceres maize model were high but they could reflect the annual variation trend of maize yield maize yield was sensitive to soil water use efficiency and precipitation especially in one month before sowing crop models are also useful for prediction or projection of future crop yields for example xiao et al 2020 applied the statistical downscaling method to convert the monthly gcm grid data into the daily data of 61 stations in north china plain under two representative concentration paths rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 in coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 and combined with the apsim model to simulate yield and water consumption of spring wheat and summer maize during 2031 2060 and 2071 2100 their results showed that the reproductive growth period of winter wheat would be prolonged and that of summer maize will be shortened under the future climate conditions implying a negative impact of future climate on maize yield but a positive impact on wheat yield although several researches have studied how the drought affected crop growth or yields the key parameters that revealing the inherent relationship between drought events and crop growth such as the better drought index the most sensitive timescale the most important month during crop growth stages that crop growth and yields responded to drought hazards have not been investigated in addition the research on the mechanism of crop yield reduction caused by drought is not deep enough it is necessary to further study the quantitative relationship between the spatiotemporal variation of drought and crop growth and yield reduction rate this study aims to analyze the impacts of meteorological and agricultural droughts on wheat and maize yields from multiple perspectives and to select the key parameters which described the relationship between drought indices and crop growth and yields the spei and smdi time series of spring wheat spring summer maize at different timescales would be calculated to explore the temporal and spatial variation of meteorological and agricultural droughts from 1961 to 2018 based on the measured phenological period yield soil and meteorological data of spring wheat spring and summer maize combining with dssat ceres wheat maize models the genetic coefficients of spring wheat spring summer maize would be calibrated and verified the phenological period yield related factors of spring wheat spring summer maize from 1961 to 2018 would be simulated and their spatiotemporal changes would be analyzed then the quantitative relationships between spei and smdi at different timescales and yield of the crops would be analyzed the key growth period suitable drought index and key time scale of growth and yield changes of spring wheat spring summer maize in response to drought would be determined and the yield reduction mechanism of spring wheat spring and summer maize under drought background would be revealed the results are referable for providing measures for agricultural production under drought 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area sites meteorological and crop data according to china s agricultural industry development report 2020 which was

widely used to describe agricultural drought kamali et al 2015 yang et al 2017 yirdaw et al 2008 the calculation formulas of smdi are as follows 7 s d i j s w i j m s w j m s w j min s w j 100 s w i j m s w j s w i j m s w j max s w j m s w j 100 s w i j m s w j 8 s m d i i j 0 5 s m d i i j 1 s d i j 50 j 1 s d i j 50 j 1 where sd i j are the soil water deficit in the jth month of the ith year sw i j is the average soil water content mm of the soil profile at the specific time scale msw j is the medium and long term average soil water content mm in the soil profile maxsw j or minsw j are the long term maximum or minimum soil water content mm in the soil profile respectively the dry wet levels according to different ranges of spei and smdi are classified table 1 the typical drought years are selected according to the spei and smdi 2 4 simulation of crop growth and yield related factors 2 4 1 brief introduction of the dssat ceres model the collected crop yield data were only for 2 13 years in order to study the long term effects of drought on wheat and maize yields it is necessary to extend the yield data series using the dssat ceres wheat maize model the preliminary establishment of the model is based on the collection processing and establishment of some input files the input data for certain crop generally contain four modules including meteorology soil field management and crop genetic coefficients meteorological data mainly include solar radiation maximum and minimum temperature rainfall wind speed and sunshine hours the input soil parameters include sat wp fc shc rmc clay content sand content and initial soil water content at the depth ranges of 0 4 5 4 5 9 1 9 1 16 6 16 6 28 9 28 9 49 3 49 3 82 9 82 9 138 3 cm respectively the sowing date fertilizer amount irrigation method and irrigation amount are needed for field management data 2 4 2 calibration and verification of crop genetic parameters before dssat is applied to simulate the meteorological yields under rain fed conditions in the historical period 1961 2019 the genetic coefficients of crop varieties are needed the genetic coefficients of crop are highly related to crop growth and development plant morphology and yield formation therefore it is the first step to calibrate the genetic coefficients of spring wheat spring summer maize using 13 years 2001 2013 of observed anthesis date maturity date and yield data the genetic coefficients of spring wheat were p1v p1d p5 g1 g2 g3 and phint yao et al 2015 for maize the genetic coefficients were p1 p2 p5 g2 g3 and phint respectively in dssat the genetic coefficients of spring wheat spring summer maize are debugged by generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue chen et al 2020 in the glue program the likelihood function is used as the evaluation standard for the estimation of genetic coefficients of varieties the program compares the difference between the simulated value of each model and the corresponding observed value and calculates the likelihood value between them the greater the likelihood value the closer the simulated value is to the observed value and vice versa then the total likelihood values of all relevant simulated and observed values are calculated and the likelihood values of the coefficients set generating the simulated values are calculated by bayesian formula finally the posterior distribution of the model coefficients is constructed by using the likelihood values of the parameter set under the condition of large model uncertainty and observation uncertainty the reliability of the coefficients determined by the likelihood function value is higher the process of debugging crop genetic coefficients contains two rounds 6000 times in each round the aim of the first round is to adjust the phenological coefficients of crops and the growth coefficients of crops are estimated in the second round he 2008 the anthesis date maturity date and yield data of the former 6 years were used to calibrate the genetic coefficients 2001 2006 and the data of the later 7 years are used to validate the genetic coefficients finally the crop s leaf area index lai biomass and meteorological yields from 1961 to 2018 are simulated using the calibrated genetic coefficients at the selected sites 2 4 3 model performance assessment the coefficient of determination r 2 and relative root mean square error rrmse are used to evaluate the performance of the dssat ceres model during calibration validation and simulation processes the computation of r 2 and rrmse are as follows 9 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 10 r r m s e 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 o 100 where s i is the ith simulated value i 1 2 13 is the mean value of s i o i is the ith observed value is the mean value of o i and n is the number of samples generally the higher the r 2 values or the lower the rrmse values the better the model performance 2 5 the determination of key variables and quantitative relationship for crop yield related factors the pearson correlation coefficient values between drought indices at different timescales during the crop growth period and crop yield related factors are estimated the growth period of spring wheat from february to october and the timescales of spei and smdi range from 1 to 9 month the growth period of spring maize is from april to october and the timescales of spei and smdi are from 1 to 7 month for summer maize the growth period is from june to october and the timescales for spei and smdi are 1 to 5 month the larger the correlation coefficient the better relationship between crop yield and drought indices then the best timescale of drought index the most appropriate month that crop growth and yield is affected by drought events and the better drought index that reflects impacts of drought events on crop growth and yields are identified in order to comprehensively analyze the effects of precipitation temperature and soil water content on crop growth and yield the multivariable linear regression was used to analyze the relationship between the simulated values of crop yield laimax biomass and drought indexes spei and smdi0 10 at the selected key timescale and crop growth period month for the period 1961 2018 2 6 the impacts of drought events on crop yield related factors when the spei or smdi is between 0 5 and 0 5 the year is regarded as a normal year for crop growth and the average yield in the normal years is estimated and using as the reference yield when the spei or smdi is below 0 5 the year is classified as a drought year the annual yield reduction rate is calculated by 10 y ield l nor y i e l d l k 1 y i e l d l k 2 y i e l d l k n n 11 y rr l m y i e l d l n o r y i e l d l m y i e l d l n o r 100 where yield l nor represents the reference yield of the selected site n represents the number of normal years over 1960 2018 yield l k 1 2 n represents the actual production of the nth year yrr l m is the yield reduction rate of the selected site in the mth m 1 2 58 year yield l m m 1 2 58 stands for the actual production in the mth year the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to assess the relationship between the liner slope of yield related factors vs liner slope of drought index larger absolute values of r indicate closer relationships between the two variables and vice versa the technology roadmap of this research is shown in fig 2 3 results 3 1 variations of drought indices for different timescales months and subregions 3 1 1 spei the temporal variations of spei at different timescales during the growth period of spring maize from 1961 to 2018 are shown in fig 3 the results showed that 1 the dry and wet successions of meteorological droughts in 3 subregions can be clearly discerned from random variations of spei there were obvious differences of spei among the different subregions in the same region for certain year or month the dry or wet status was generally consistent at the different timescales despite the drought severity level slightly transferred 2 the severe and extreme droughts in spring maize growth period mainly occurred before 1990 s in subregion i while occurred in the late 1990 s in subregions ⅲ and iv 3 taking the year 1963 as an example spring maize growth period was in normal state 0 5 spei 0 5 in subregion i while slightly extremely wet occurred in the entire growth period of spring maize spei 0 5 in subregion ⅲ moreover the moderate extremely drought 1 spei 4 occurred in may and june but normal to wet conditions spei 0 occurred in the other months for subregion iv therefore there were specific dry wet changes according to different timescales of spei different months of crop growth period and different dry wet years 4 in general the spei at 1 to 7 month timescales indicated both similarity at some extent and different degrees of drought in spring maize growth period from april to october there were gradually propagation of drought 3 1 2 smdi the temporal variations of smdi at 0 10 cm depth smdi0 10 for 1 to 7 month timescales in different growth periods of spring maize april to october in 1961 2018 are illustrated in fig 4 the results showed that 1 in subregion i from 1960 to 1975 there was a continuous agricultural drought smdi0 10 0 5 from 1976 to 1997 it became wetter smdi0 10 0 5 from about 1999 2015 more wet events occurred which happened especially obvious in october considering that there were slightly transfer of dry wet conditions from april to october in general subregion i experience wetter trends during crop growth period over 1961 2018 2 the smdi0 10 values at larger timescales were larger than that at smaller timescales indicating more severe drought humidity intensity 3 in subregion ⅲ from 1961 to 1978 there were slightly more wet events from 1979 to 2014 there were slightly more dry events especially during 2010 2014 there was a continuous extreme drought event 4 smdi0 10 2 during growth period of spring maize followed by four consecutive wet years 2 smdi0 10 4 4 in subregion iv continuous slightly moderate drought 0 5 smdi0 10 1 5 occurred in the whole growth period of spring maize from 1996 to 2003 in 2004 the spring maize was in a wet state in every month during its growth period smdi0 10 0 5 5 the dry and wet state of spring maize varied greatly in different months for example from 1982 to 1994 the jointing anthesis period of spring maize was slightly dry while other months were relatively wet or normal from 2010 to 2017 the jointing anthesis period of spring maize was wetter than other months in the growth period 6 in general the agricultural drought indicated by smdi0 10 were regional timescale and month specific spei at different timescales in different month of spring wheat and summer maize growth periods presents similar variation patterns fig s1 the temporal variations of smdi 0 10 for winter wheat and summer maize also fluctuated with different timescales different months of the year and different subregions fig s2 smdi at 10 40 cm depth smdi10 40 fluctuated less intensely than smdi0 10 but still randomly in different subregions data not shown 3 2 crop growth and yield variations 3 2 1 spatial variations of crop phenology the growth period of spring wheat is generally form february to october spring maize is from april to october and for summer maize is from june to october the spatial variation of the average day of the year doy in different growth stages from 1991 to 2013 is plotted in details for 3 different crops in fig 5 the results showed that 1 the sowing date of spring wheat was during march to april the anthesis period was in the mid june the milk period was mostly in late july the crops matured in september 2 the sowing jointing anthesis and maturity periods of spring maize were during late april to early may late june mid july in northeast china it was late july and around the middle of september some stations in northeast china are in late october respectively 3 for summer maize the phenology for sowing jointing anthesis milk and maturity were about the first ten days of june in early july in the last ten days of july in the last ten days of september and the middle ten days of october in turn 3 2 2 spatial distribution of the validated genetic coefficients the performance of the dssat ceres maize and dssat ceres wheat was evaluated by comparing the measured and simulated values of anthesis date maturity date and yield fig 6 the results showed that there were good and significant correlation between the simulated and measured values of phenology and yield of spring wheat and spring summer maize in the calibration and validation stage the performance of the dssat ceres wheat coefficient of determination r 2 0 95 were better than that of dssat ceres maize r 2 0 70 the performance of dssat ceres maize for summer maize were slightly better than that of spring maize in general the dssat performance for simulating the anthesis date maturity date and yields of the three crops were good 0 53 r 2 0 95 and rrmse 0 2 therefore dssat ceres wheat maize could be further used to simulate the critical growth periods and yields of spring wheat spring summer maize over the study period the calibrated and validated crop genetic coefficients at different sites using dssat ceres wheat maize modes are mapped for spring wheat spring summer maize in fig 7 the specific values of genetic coefficients of spring wheat and spring summer maize are shown in tables 2 4 respectively these values are further used for simulation of long term 1961 2018 time series of lai biomass and yield over 1961 2018 for the three crops 3 2 3 temporal variations of the maximum leaf area index laimax biomass and yield among the growth indices the maximum leaf area index laimax in the whole growth period under rain fed conditions is selected as a key crop growth parameter because lai changes with crop growth stages and can t be all used for analysis the annual variations of yield biomass and laimax values of three crops are shown in fig 8 the results showed that 1 the laimax biomass and yield had spatial and temporal variability ranges of laimax of spring wheat spring summer maize were 0 3 3 1 4 7 8 and 2 5 5 9 respectively ranges of biomass of spring wheat spring summer maize were 10 050 34 200 12 270 34 000 9100 21 043 kg ha 1 respectively and ranges of yield of spring wheat spring summer maize were1400 12230 2430 12980 2400 23800 kg ha 1 respectively 2 the annual average laimax of spring wheat was less than 2 the annual average laimax of spring maize was about 20 higher than that of summer maize 3 the annual average biomass of spring summer maize fluctuated around 2000 kg ha 1 and 1500 kg ha 1 respectively 4 the annual average climate yield of spring wheat was relatively stable at about 5000 kg ha 1 while the annual average yield of spring summer maize had a slightly downward trend 3 3 effects of droughts on crop growth and yields 3 3 1 pearson correlations between crop yields and drought indices 3 3 1 1 for spring wheat the r values between spei and spring wheat yield over 1961 2018 are given in table 5 the results showed that 1 for the three regions in the first two months february and march of spring wheat growth period there were negative correlations between spring wheat yield and spei in subregions i and ii there was no obvious correlation between yield and spei in september and october 2 in subregion i the best correlation occurred in july and the r value 0 43 between yield and 9 month spei was the highest 3 in subregion ⅱ the correlations between yield and spei was good in august and the correlations between yield and spei at 1 and 3 month timescales were better r 0 44 4 in subregion iv the relationship between yield and spei was fine from june to october the best correlation was in september the correlation between yield and 4 month spei was the largest in september r 0 45 5 the key parameters of spring wheat responses to the meteorological droughts were not universal and varied with specific conditions of timescale of spei crop growth stages and subregions the r values between spring wheat yield and smdi 0 10 and over 1961 2018 are given in table 6 the result reflected that 1 for subregions i and ii there were good positive correlations between yield and smdi 0 10 at 1 to 6 month timescales in july and the r was the highest at the 3 month timescale r 0 44 and the 5 month timescale r 0 47 respectively 2 however in subregion iv the correlations between yield and smdi 0 10 was the best at the 3 month timescale in june r 0 45 3 the key parameters of spring wheat growth and yield responses to the agricultural droughts also varied with specific conditions of timescale of smdi0 10 crop growth stages and subregions correlations between spring wheat yield and smdi10 40 were also not universal at different conditions in general their relationship was not so good as yield vs smdi0 10 data not shown by comparing tables 5 and 6 the number of timescales with r 0 35 between smdi 0 10 and yield in spring wheat growth period was larger than that of spei therefore smdi 0 10 in spring wheat growth period can better identify the relationship between drought and spring wheat yield than spei 3 3 1 2 for spring and summer maize similar to spring wheat there were significant positive correlations between spei and yield of spring maize table 7 the results showed that 1 the pearson correlation coefficients between spei and yield were the highest at 4 month timescale in august in subregions iii r 0 39 and iv r 0 40 2 in subregion i the correlations between yield and spei were the best at the 1 month timescale in june r 0 38 the r values between spring maize yield and smdi0 10 over 1961 2018 are given in table 8 the results showed that 1 in subregion i the correlation between smdi0 10 and yield was the best in june and the correlation between smdi0 10 and yield was the largest at 3 month timescale r 0 38 2 in subregion iii the significant positive correlations mainly appeared in september and october and the correlation between yield and smdi0 10 at 1 month timescale was the best in october r 0 33 3 in subregion iv there were good positive correlations between spring maize yield and at smdi0 10 at 1 to 7 month timescales from july to october and the r value between spring maize yield and smdi0 10 at 2 month timescale was the largest in august r 0 38 similarly the correlation coefficient values between multi scalar spei smdi vs summer maize yield are presented in table 9 it showed that 1 spei can well identify drought in the growth period of summer maize the significant positive correlation between yield and spei at 4 month timescale was the best in august r 0 41 2 there was a good positive correlation between summer maize yield and smdi0 10 at the sowing anthesis period june to august and the r value of yield and smdi0 10 at 1 month timescale was the highest in june r 0 17 differently the number of sites which had r 0 35 for yield vs spei of spring and summer maize were larger than for yield vs smdi0 10 therefore spei better reflected spring and summer maize growth and yield responses to drought than smdi0 10 3 3 2 the key timescale and growth period for different crops moreover the value of r value between spei smdi0 10 and yield of spring wheat was larger than that of spring summer maize spei smdi0 10 at the timescale with the largest absolute value of r at certain significance were selected as the drought index of each subregions the results are shown in table 10 3 3 3 effect of droughts on yield reduction rate according to the temporal variations of spei and smdi0 10 the years 2001 for spring wheat 2001 for spring maize and 2000 for summer maize were selected as typical drought years respectively the site specific spei smdi0 10 which have been shown to be better drought index for wheat and maize and yield reduction rate in the typical drought years are mapped in fig 9 in the typical drought years the crop yield decreased significantly and crop yield reductions were obvious at all the sites there was high consistence between spei smdi0 10 and yield reduction rate the smaller spei smdi0 10 values the greater the yield reduction rates in particular the yield of spring wheat in most stations of subregions i and ii decreased by more than 20 fig 9 d and the yield reduction rate of spring maize in most sites of region iv was more than 25 fig 9 e for summer maize the yield reduction is relatively small about 15 fig 9 f 3 3 4 relationship between linear slopes of yield related factors and drought indices the linear slopes of laimax aboveground biomass and yield had good positive and significant correlations with the linear slopes of smdi0 10 of spring wheat or spei of spring summer maize figs 10 and 11 which further revealed the relationship between changes of crop growth yield vs drought index the linear slopes of smdi0 10 had the best correlation with the linear slopes of spring wheat yield r 0 67 while the relationship between the linear slopes of smdi0 10 and the linear slopes of spring maize laimax was the smallest r 0 15 the linear slopes of laimax biomass yield vs drought index had positive correlations however with the increase of spei linear slope of spei 0 tended to be wetter laimax biomass and yield showed different changes at some sites of spring wheat and spring maize the wetter the soil was the lower yield related factors were linear slope of laimax biomass yield 0 and vice versa there were closer connections between linear slopes of yield vs spei smdi0 10 than linear slope of laimax and biomass vs spei smdi0 10 the linear slopes of smdi0 10 of spring wheat spring summer maize also had good positive and significant correlations with the linear slopes of laimax aboveground biomass and yield fig 11 overall for spring wheat the linear slopes of yield related factors had closer connections with the linear slopes of smdi0 10 than spei however it was contrary for spring summer maize it implied that for different crops drought prevention measures during crop growth period should be different 4 discussions 4 1 influences of precipitation air temperature and soil water content on crop yields precipitation air temperature and soil water content direct affect crop growth and yields taking the spring wheat as an example there were close relationship between the yields and related agrometeorological variables fig 12 at the site of jinghe in xinjiang china the r2 values between spring wheat yields and growth period precipitation average temperature and mean soil water content at 0 10 cm depth were all above 0 25 among which soil water content at 0 10 cm depth during growth period impacted yield greatest fig 12a c the effects of growth period precipitation average temperature and mean soil water content at 0 10 cm depth during on yield have spatial variability fig 12d f in space the influences of average temperature and mean soil water content at 0 10 cm depth on yield were greater than growth period precipitation in addition there were large r values between yield and growth period precipitation for sites at higher latitude however relationship between yield and mean temperature or mean soil water content at 0 10 cm depth were opposite 4 2 quantitative relationship between crop yields and drought indices the quantitative relationships between crop yields and drought indices changed with crop types month of crop growth timescale or types of drought indices sites or regions and applied crop models when the crop growth and yields data need to be simulated the correlations between smdi10 40 and wheat maize yield were poor compared with smdi0 10 and spei perhaps because the water content of shallow soil varied more abrupt thus has greater impacts on crop yields chen et al 2020 investigated the variations of winter wheat yield simulated by dssat ceres wheat and drought indices spei smdi0 10 over 1981 2015 in china and the correlations between them they compared the results and found yields were better correlated to smdi0 10 than to spei masud et al 2020 studied the quantitative relationship between spring wheat production and spei smdi0 10 the results showed that in the early growth season of spring wheat smdi0 10 had higher correlations with production than spei and crop production was highly sensitive to soil water deficit in this study the quantitative relationships between spring wheat yield and smdi0 10 were better than that of yield vs spei or smdi10 40 former researches consistently manifest better correlations of wheat yield with smdi0 10 than spei this was reasonable since soil water is the main source of crop water however the relationship between maize yield and drought indices were different with that of wheat spei was highly correlated with maize yield reduction in north china plain which can effectively evaluate the effects of drought on maize yield ming et al 2015 kurniasih and impron 2017 studied the effects of drought degree and duration using spi and spei on the variability of maize yield loss in bandung west java of indonesia the results showed that spi had similar performance with spei in quantitative analysis of drought events in addition drought in maize reproductive growth period have caused the greatest yield loss labudová et al 2017 studied the correlations between maize yield and spei spi and obtained higher correlations between maize yield and spei than that with spi there were also other studies which applied spei to analyze the frequency and severity of drought in maize growth period guna et al 2019 guo et al 2019 masupha and moeletsi 2017 their results showed that spei could well identify drought in maize growth period in this research higher correlations between maize yield and spei were found than smdi as an agricultural drought index smdi indicates soil drought severity levels while spei denotes meteorological drought severity level crop yields are both affected by meteorological and agricultural droughts of which the latter affects crop growth and yield more however there may be different results for specific conditions it is still uncertain under what conditions crop yield had better relationships with meteorological and agricultural drought indices 4 3 key parameters for denoting drought effects on crop yields the parameters for denoting drought effects on crop yields include the key months of crop growth and key timescales of drought indices under which crop yield had better correlations with drought indices wang et al 2021 found that wheat yields were easily affected by droughts at key phenological stages drought stress at grain filling stage had the greatest impacts on 1000 grain weight of wheat in spring wheat milk period july and august drought had a greater impact on yield chen et al 2020 compared the effects of drought at different timescales and crop growth periods and concluded that winter wheat yield had better relationships with the 4 month timescale spei and 1 month timescale smdi0 10 than the other conditions in this study spei and smdi0 10 of 1 to 3 month timescales better reflected the effects of drought on spring wheat yields the influences of drought on spring maize yield varied with different drought severity levels and different crop growth periods mild drought had little effect on maize yield while severe drought spei 1 0 significantly reduced the yield of maize especially in the stages after anthesis chen et al 2016 in the reproductive growth period of maize drought led to the most serious reduction of maize production kurniasih and impron 2017 chen et al 2021 tested the influences of moderate and severe drought stress at three critical growth periods jointing tasseling and milk of danyu 405 spring maize the results showed that the starch content of grain was most sensitive to drought in jointing tasseling period which is a period of vegetative and reproductive growth concurrently the most vigorous stage in the whole life of maize dry matter accumulation begins to increase and leaf transpiration increases and a key period of water demand water deficit had a significant effect on grain yield especially before tasseling kefale and ranamukhaarachchi 2004 as to the key timescale of drought indices labudová et al 2017 reported that maize had the highest correlation with 3 month timescale spei in august which representing the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in summer this research showed that the correlation coefficient between spring maize yield and 4 month timescale spei in august was the largest in subregion iii and iv while in subregion i spring maize yield was best correlated to the 1 month timescale spei in june table 4 jointing tasseling period july is the most critical growth period for summer maize the yield responses to the key growth periods or key timescale of drought indices were also variable for example drought had the greatest effect on yield during pre anthesis and post anthesis periods while drought had little effect on yield in early vegetative growth liu 2015 in shaanxi china summer maize yield was more sensitive to spei at the 3 month timescale in august guo et al 2019 drought in vegetative growth period is considered recoverable daryanto et al 2016 in this study we found that the key growth period of summer maize is anthesis period late july the best relationship between summer maize yield and spei was in august the key timescale of spei was at 4 month namely the 4 month timescale spei in august are key in identifying the drought of summer maize during anthesis and jointing period the key crop growth periods or key timescale of drought indices varied with crop types the selected drought indices and subregions to obtain universal key parameters are difficult the uncertainty of the determination of the key parameters between crop yields and drought indices encourage us to do detail and deeper investigations in the related topics 4 4 different responses of wheat and maize to drought the responses of wheat and maize yield to drought was quite different hu et al 2014 used dssat combined with the output of regional climate model studied the effect of drought on wheat and maize yield in wheat maize rotation planting area of north china plain under a1b climate change scenario the results showed that the response of wheat and maize to drought is quite different compared with 1961 1990 under the a1b climate change scenarios the yield of wheat would increase while the yield of maize would decrease moreover drought may lead to a lower decline in the yield of wheat than that of maize daryanto et al 2016 reported that under the condition of about 40 water reduction the yield of wheat decreased 20 6 lower than that of maize 39 3 and maize was more sensitive to drought than wheat especially in the reproductive period xiao et al 2020 reported that under the future climate conditions the growth period of winter wheat will be prolonged while that of summer maize will be shortened this study showed that the responses of wheat and maize yield to drought were quite different 1 the correlations between wheat yield and agricultural drought index smdi0 10 was better while the correlations between maize yield and meteorological drought index spei was better 2 maize yield reduction was larger than wheat yield reduction in drought years 3 maize yield was more sensitive to drought there were greater slope values between linear slopes of drought index and linear slopes of crop yields as to yield and spei spring maize 1603 5 summer maize 710 83 spring wheat 311 4 as to yield and smdi spring maize 1371 7 summer maize 502 85 spring wheat 455 67 figs 9 and 10 maize belongs to c4 grain variety and has higher water use efficiency than wheat which belongs to c3 grain variety when water supply is sufficient however under limited water supply or drought stress conditions the chlorophyll content of maize is lower the leaf mortality is higher and the recovery rate of photosynthetic rate of maize after drought is slower than that of wheat consequently wheat still realize normal grain filling by mobilizing stem reserve daryanto et al 2016 ripley et al 2010 this may explain in part the difference of physiological function between wheat and maize and the differences of determined key parameters that wheat and maize responses to drought 5 conclusions for spring wheat better relationship between yields and smdi0 10 than yields and spei were found drought in june and july had the greatest impacts on yields the correlations of yield and smdi0 10 in subregions i ii and iv were highest at 3 month

9539,accurately partitioning evapotranspiration et remains one of the key research gaps in agro ecosystem water research the interaction of shallow groundwater with winter wheat increased the complexity of et partitioning here we proposed a cutting method to partition et into soil evaporation e and transpiration t field multiple lysimeter experiments under 4 different watertable conditions were conducted at the yucheng experimental station to investigate the partitioning of et for winter wheat under shallow groundwater results showed that the cutting method is applicable and could obtain reasonable ratio of t to et for crop land of winter wheat moreover the t et could be generalized into a curve for representing the ratio of t to et i e k t et at the mid and late season stages of winter wheat the maximum value of generalized t et curve kmax increased with the increase of groundwater table depth dtw and was 0 651 0 768 0 771 and 0 869 for the depth of 0 4 m 0 7 m 1 1 m and 1 5 m respectively the higher transpiration proportion corresponded to the higher yield of winter wheat which indicated that increased groundwater depth was benefit to enhance the groundwater consumption by transpiration and hence yield when watertable depth was within 1 5 m moreover the lower evaporation proportion might lower the soil salinization risk due to less soil evaporation it is important for the understanding of the interaction between evapotranspiration components of crop with shallow groundwater and the sustainable management in the lower reach of the yellow river basin keywords evapotranspiration partitioning shallow groundwater cutting method lower reach of the yellow river winter wheat 1 introduction knowledge of the water fluxes within the agro ecosystem to maximize the productive water loss transpiration and minimize the non productive water loss is crucial to improve water use efficiency and meet the increasing irrigation demands sutanto et al 2012 however partitioning of evapotranspiration et into evaporation e and transpiration t remains a challenge in terrestrial ecosystem kool et al 2014 nelson et al 2020 ngoc et al 2021 continuous measurement of transpiration is still difficult and the effect of vegetation on et partitioning is unclear zhou et al 2016 at a seasonal timescale the variability of t et is small and the ratio converges toward a stable mean state however the variability of t et can result from biotic and abiotic responses to weather and soil moisture dynamics at daily to weekly scales wei et al 2017 crops may also have high ratio of t to et under low lai conditions potentially influenced by the fact that agricultural plants are typically less constrained by environmental stresses wang et al 2014 in agricultural ecosystems the fractions of e and t have been used as indicators of crop water use efficiency which is affected by soil and water management practices hu and lei 2021 because the plant transpiration t process directly correlates with plant growth quantitative estimation of plant transpiration t in the total evapotranspiration t et has long been acknowledged to play a crucial role in yield estimation and water resource management from plot scale to regional scale jasechko et al 2013 kool et al 2014 for example efforts to increase water use efficiency and control evaporative loss in agricultural land requires accurate determination of the consumption of groundwater through plant activities xiao et al 2018 although vastly important and widely studied et partitioning is still subject to great debate nguyen et al 2021 various methods have been developed to partition et at different time and spatial scales the stable isotope technique is a widely used method for partitioning of et lu et al 2017 good et al 2014 nevertheless the method is not suitable for agricultural ecosystems while soil evaporation is small griffis 2013 another comprehensive method for et partitioning is the combined use of eddy covariance and sap flow techniques to estimate et and t simultaneously cammalleri et al 2013 scanlon and kustas 2012 however this technique may result in large discrepancy between the estimated e t and et due to sensitivity of sap flow estimates to the tower footprint zhou et al 2016 wei et al 2018 reported 10 20 t et differences between estimations using isotopes and estimations using a two source et model simulation by using a portable chamber and applying a rapid acting herbicide muhammad et al 2019 developed an in situ method of partitioning e and t components while preserving soil moisture and plant canopy structure conditions nelson et al 2020 compared three widely applicable methods for estimating ecosystem transpiration across 251 fluxnet sites globally at ecosystem scale and remarked that the key limitation of the methods is that the magnitude of t is still left unconstrained more recently wang et al 2021 reported a possible method to separate et into e and t with satisfactory accuracy by using heat pulse sensors and sap flow gauges in a weighing lysimeter some other research also provided novel insights into the seasonal and inter annual variability of et partitioning ma et al 2020 scott et al 2021 however et partitioning is site specific and strongly influenced by the availability of water and energy the difficulty of estimating agro ecosystem t is due to heterogeneities in the physiological properties and processes underlying plant water uptake and ecosystem water cycle nelson et al 2020 shallow groundwater area was widely distributed in the lower reach of the yellow river basin wang et al 2009 fang et al 2010 the water table in these areas were within or slightly below the root zone the crop could uptake water from both a thin unsaturated vadose zone and saturated ground water ayars et al 2009 groundwater moves upward from the saturated zone to the unsaturated zone and finally returns to the atmosphere through two pathways soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t luo et al 2010 the interaction between the plant and ground water increased the complexity of partitioning of et improved understanding of agro hydrological processes lays a foundation for quantification of positive and negative impacts needed to realize the sustainable management of agricultural water in particular the quantification of shallow groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration etg is a significant topic that has been extensively researched nirjhar et al 2007 karimov et al 2014 the effect of shallow groundwater tables on the crop water use was investigated in various size of lysimeters yang et al 2007 huo et al 2012 liu and luo 2011 reported that by conducting lysimeter experiments under rainfed condition the seasonal contribution of groundwater met more than 65 of potential evapotranspiration of winter wheat when the water table depth was within 40 150 cm karimov et al 2014 investigated the effects of the shallow water table on water use of winter wheat by using hydrus 1d simulations the results showed that the contribution of the groundwater to evapotranspiration increases with a rising water table furthermore the increase of evapotranspiration loss eventually causes a buildup of salinity in the crop root zone accurately estimating of et partition not only helps us to better understand water resources in the era of global climate change but also helps us to determine the water demand develop reasonable irrigation strategies and optimize water resource management therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to propose and test the cutting method of et partitioning 2 to investigate the partition of et for crop land of winter wheat and the watertable effect in the lower reach of the yellow river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field experiments were conducted in yucheng comprehensive experimental station yces of chinese academy of sciences at yucheng city shandong province china e116 36 n36 57 20 m a s l which is located in the lower reach of yellow river basin fig 1 the experimental site has the representative climate and agricultural cropping system of this region the annual mean temperature is 13 1ºc and annual mean precipitation is 600 mm with about 70 of total precipitation falls in june august therefore rainfall during the main growing season of winter wheat is far less than crop water requirements liu and luo 2010 in total 9 square lysimeters of each with a cross section area of 1 0 1 0 m and 2 0 m in height were adopted in this study the basic physical properties of the soil in lysimeters were listed in table 1 each lysimeter consisted of two parts the main body soil column which is made of steel and the water supply and drainage system fig 2 the upper edge of the lysimeter was 0 1 m above the ground to prevent water flow running into the lysimeter at the bottom of each lysimeter there is a 0 3 m thick filter layer as a buffer area for water flow in out the lysimeter the water supply and drainage system comprised a mariotte bottle and a water level buffering cup mariotte bottle supplied water automatically to the soil body at a constant water level the depth of water table in each lysimeter was set by adjusting the vertical location of the mariotte bottle and buffering cup water level in mariotte bottle was recorded twice a day at 8 00 am and 8 00 pm respectively and then used to calculate the groundwater consumption in each lysimeter in addition two mobile shelters were set on the experimental site to prevent rainfall entering the lysimeters the shelter was moved manually to cover the lysimeters during the rainfall event however the lysimeters received rainfall for a couple of times during the experimental period because the rainfall occurred at night and the shelter was unable to be put in place in time 2 2 experiment treatments scheme the experimental duration was from oct 2008 to jun 2011 with three growing seasons the experimental setting and management practices were all the same for the three growing seasons except where otherwise specified the planted crop was winter wheat triticum aestivum l of the variety kenong 199 the sowing date was around october 13 at each growing season the planting density was 240 kg ha with a row spacing of 20 cm approx 450 520 plants m2 nitrogen fertilizer was applied along with sowing at a rate of 750 kg ha no irrigation was applied during the experimental periods the evapotranspiration is low due to low air temperature and small leaf area from sowing to re greening stage mid march in next year therefore experimental observation and measurement carried out from march to june harvest at each growing season the experiment treatments were listed in table 2 totally four depths of watertable i e dtw 0 4 0 7 1 1 and 1 5 m were involved in this study there were 3 duplications for treatment dtw 1 5 m while 2 duplications for each of other three watertable treatments for the treatment of cutting the cutting was carried out at mid season of growing stages of winter wheat and cutting date varied among three growing seasons and four watertable treatments the winter wheat in the whole lysimeter was cut just above the soil surface the winter wheat straw remained in the plots to minimize the impact of cutting on soil evaporation fig 3 soil water content along the profile was measured by using the neutron probe campbell hydroprobe 503dr1 5 every seven days and additional measurement was taken on the day prior to cutting the measuring tube was established in the center of each lysimeter soil water content was measured at an interval of 10 cm downwards to the depth of watertable meteorological data were recorded in an automatic weather station in the experimental station which was about 50 m far from the lysimeter facility based on the meteorological data the reference evapotranspiration eto was computed with the penman monteith equation using the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 the yield of winter wheat and root dry weight at each lysimeter was measured after harvest 2 3 the cutting method of et partitioning the soil body in the lysimeter was isolated to the surrounding field therefore each lysimeter was an independent water cycling unit the water balance equation is thus as follow 1 p i et g e t δs r f where et g is groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration p is precipitation i is irrigation e is soil evaporation t is crop transpiration δs is soil water storage change r is surface runoff f is seepage the left side of eq 1 is water input of lysimeter while the right side is water output in this study the items of p and i were zero since no rainfall and irrigation was applied during experimental period as a consequence there was no seepage and runoff occurred f 0 r 0 therefore the above equation could be simplified as 2 et g e t δs where et g is groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration e is soil evaporation t is crop transpiration δs is soil water storage change soil below the watertable is saturated since water was supplied from the bottom of each lysimeter given the shallow watertable and soil texture groundwater could easily move upward and supplement the water consumption within the upper soil in this case the capillary rise flux is greater than root water uptake rate and or potential et flux therefore the change of soil water storage was negligible at daily scale this was also proven by the soil water content distribution which has been presented in the result thus the amount of water supply from the mariotte bottle was equal to the etg the transpiration of winter wheat and the evaporation from soil occurred simultaneously in the field once cutting was applied transpiration via root water uptake of winter wheat ceased in this case the water balance equation further simplified as below 3 for the treatment of control ck et g e t 4 for the treatment of cutting cut et g e by taking lysimeters with same watertable as repetition treatments and assuming that the water supply soil and winter wheat growing condition were all the same for each treatment the crop transpiration ceased right after cutting while the evaporation from soil continued therefore the transpiration and evaporation could be easily partitioned by contrastively analyzing the et g data via eqs 3 and 4 3 results 3 1 testing of the cutting method of et partitioning the et0 calculated via penman monteith equation represents the maximum possible water consumption under the influence of atmospheric evaporation capacity and crop growth status the variation of potential evapotranspiration et0 during three growing seasons from 2009 to 2011 was shown in fig 4 meanwhile the descriptive statistics of calculated et0 for the years of 2009 2011was listed in table 3 by comparing the et0 at three growing seasons we found that the et0 variation trend is very similar both in pattern and range therefore it is reasonable to perform evapotranspiration analysis and comparison among the three growing seasons the experiment treatments with same dtw was considered as duplication since all the setting among them was same the daily et for cutting treatments but before the cutting conducted was used to a statistical analysis firstly the et of pre cutting vs the et of ck were plotted in fig 5 it was showed that under each of the 4 watertable condition most points distributed along and nearby the 1 1 line the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 799 0 789 0 791 and 0 896 for the dtw 0 4 m 0 7 m 1 1 m and 1 5 m respectively which indicated that the et between two duplicated treatments cut and ck was comparable and consistent with each other the variation of soil water content distribution along the profile for dtw 0 4 m and dtw 1 5 m were shown in fig 6 for each cutting treatment the variation of soil water distribution pattern along the profiles was negligible after cutting for example the average changing rate of soil water storage in the entire soil body was only 0 058 cm day and about13 of the corresponding et although there was apparent variation of soil water content in top soil for the treatment with dtw 0 4 m the variation trend was irrelative to the cutting date therefore it was not the cutting induced variation to the contrary the difference of the soil water distribution pattern along the profiles was notable between the treatments of different dtw the variation trend of et of cutting treatment was consistent with that of the control treatment ck before cutting and their values were almost same at most time fig 7 the relative error varied in the range of 15 for the lysimeter with dtw 1 5 m the rmse was 0 706 it indicated a good consistence between the treatments of cut and ck moreover we got similar findings for all the treatments in three growing seasons therefore it is reasonable in treating the cutting and ck lysimeters as two duplicates for the cutting treatment the root water uptake ceased after cutting while the soil evaporation was unaffected the transpiration of winter wheat e g t et was then determined by calculating the difference of daily et between the cutting treatment and ck thus the cutting method is reasonable and applicable for partitioning of et 3 2 the t et for winter wheat and the watertable effect the variation of the daily et of different treatments was shown in fig 7 before cutting the variation of daily et was close to each other which indicated a high consistency no matter in which growing stage the wheat was cut the daily et decreased abruptly just after cutting and then fluctuated at a relatively low level moreover the daily et of two lysimeters which cut at different growing stage was close to each other after cutting both of them were gradually close to that of ck as it entered the mature stage of winter wheat the ratio of t to et in all three years for all the treatments of different watertable depth were calculated and presented in fig 8 totally four depths of groundwater in three growing seasons from the year of 2009 2011 are shown in the figure similar to the basal crop coefficient kcb curves illustrated in liu and luo 2010 we proposed a generalized curve to represent the t et at the mid to late season stages of winter wheat the generalized t et here noted as k is a horizontal line at the mid season of winter wheat then it was decreased linearly at the late season stage of winter wheat the maximum value of generalized t et curve kmax increased with the increase of groundwater table depth dtw and was 0 651 0 768 0 771 and 0 869 for the depth of 0 4 m 0 7 m 1 1 m and 1 5 m respectively the higher transpiration proportion corresponded to the higher water use efficiency wue which indicated that increased groundwater depth was benefit to enhance the groundwater consumption by transpiration when watertable was low 1 5 m the variation of daily soil evaporation with watertable depth at the maturity stage of winter wheat was shown in fig 9 the soil evaporation decreased dramatically as the watertable decreased from 0 4 m to 0 7 m fig 9 then it continually decreased at a lower rate as the watertable further decreased to 1 5 m moreover when the gardner 1958 equation was applied to fit the soil evaporation curve we got the equation as follow 5 e 1 05 e 0 78 d 1 where e is the soil evaporation cm d d is the watertable depth m the coefficient of determination r2 0 955 the equation provided a useful tool for easily calculating of the soil evaporation in the lower reach of the yellow river basin the yield of the winter wheat under each treatment at two years was listed in table 4 it was found that the yield in 2011 is higher than that of 2010 for all the 4 groundwater condition the yield increased as the watertable decreasing in the year of 2010 while the yield of dtw 1 5 m is highest in the year of 2011 although there is no constant increasing trend for yield as the watertable decreasing just as reported in kahlown et al 2005 the yield of winter wheat is mainly dependent on the environment in the root zone root depth and sensitivity of crop for water and oxygen therefore the moisture condition in root zone was appropriate for the root development of winter wheat under a deeper water table condition e g dtw 1 5 m in this study and fully development of the root system contributed to get a higher yield 4 discussion the root water uptake ceased after cutting of the winter wheat therefore the decrement of et between the cutting and ck treatments just after cutting was approximated as the transpiration of winter wheat based on this assumption the cutting method was proposed however just as many other research indicated that the et was influenced by many factors such as meteorological factors watertable depth growing stage of winter wheat and so on xu et al 2021 as wang 2014 stated that growing stage and leaf area index lai collectively explained 43 of the variations in the global t et data set the crop has the highest t et among the many other ecosystem types wei et al 2017 but the range is also wide it could be as low to 62 as reported in zhou et al 2018 or as high to 92 as reported in miralles et al 2011 the t et under different watertable conditions in present study was consistent with findings of many other research work in this study the cutting method was applied in late april or may therefore only the t et at the mid season and late season growing stages of winter wheat was investigated but the crop transpiration is often associated with lai which change rapidly during the period from regreening stage to maturity stage of winter wheat further research was needed on investigating the suitability of the cutting method and the et partition 5 conclusions it is of great significance for partitioning the et into evaporation losses and plant transpiration to better understand the interaction of shallow groundwater with winter wheat in the lower reach of yellow river basin and furthermore to improve the water use efficiency and mitigate the secondary salinization risk in this study field experiments were conducted during three growing seasons of winter wheat from 2008 to 2011 by using 9 square lysimeters totally four watertable depths 0 4 0 7 1 1 and 1 5 m were involved in the experiments the method of cutting of winter wheat for et partitioning was demonstrated to be successful and applicable in the lower reach of yellow river basin this method of cutting provided an in situ determination way to investigate the evaporation and transpiration components of water cycle in an agro ecosystem in addition the rate of t to et varied with watertable depth under no rainfall and non irrigation condition the ratio of t to et decreased as the watertable depth decrease at middle and late growing season highest t et was observed under groundwater level of 1 5 m moreover the lower evaporation proportion might lower the soil salinization risk due to less soil evaporation therefore it is recommended to control groundwater around the depth of 1 5 m in this region for one side it will unlock the potential of shallow groundwater for irrigation and improve the wue on the other hand it can mitigate salinization risk without loss of agricultural productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

cropping system of this region the annual mean temperature is 13 1ºc and annual mean precipitation is 600 mm with about 70 of total precipitation falls in june august therefore rainfall during the main growing season of winter wheat is far less than crop water requirements liu and luo 2010 in total 9 square lysimeters of each with a cross section area of 1 0 1 0 m and 2 0 m in height were

computed with the penman monteith equation using the methodology proposed by allen et al 1998 the yield of winter wheat and root dry weight at each lysimeter was measured after harvest 2 3 the cutting method of et partitioning the soil body in the lysimeter was isolated to the surrounding field therefore each lysimeter was an independent water cycling unit the water balance equation is thus as follow 1 p i et g e t δs r f where et g is groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration p is precipitation i is irrigation e is soil evaporation t is crop transpiration δs is soil water storage change r is surface runoff f is seepage the left side of eq 1 is water input of lysimeter while the right side is water output in this study the items of p and i were zero since no rainfall and irrigation was applied during experimental period as a consequence there was no seepage and runoff occurred f 0 r 0 therefore the above equation could be simplified as 2 et g e t δs where et g is groundwater contribution to evapotranspiration e is soil evaporation t is crop transpiration δs is soil water storage change soil below the watertable is saturated since water was supplied from the bottom of each lysimeter given the shallow watertable and soil texture groundwater could easily move upward and supplement the water consumption within the upper soil in this case the capillary rise flux is greater than root water uptake rate and or potential et flux therefore the change of soil water storage was negligible at daily scale this was also proven by the soil water content distribution which has been presented in the result thus the amount of water supply from the mariotte bottle was equal to the etg the transpiration of winter wheat and the evaporation from soil occurred simultaneously in the field once cutting was applied transpiration via root water uptake of winter wheat ceased in this case the water balance equation further simplified as below 3 for the treatment of control ck et g e t 4 for the treatment of cutting cut et g e by taking lysimeters with same watertable as repetition treatments and assuming that the water supply soil and winter wheat growing condition were all the same for each treatment the crop transpiration ceased right after cutting while the evaporation from soil continued therefore the transpiration and evaporation could be easily partitioned by contrastively analyzing the et g data via eqs 3 and 4 3 results 3 1 testing of the cutting method of et partitioning the et0 calculated via penman monteith equation represents the maximum possible water consumption under the influence of atmospheric evaporation capacity and crop growth status the variation of potential evapotranspiration et0 during three growing seasons from 2009 to 2011 was shown in fig 4 meanwhile the descriptive statistics of calculated et0 for the years of 2009 2011was listed in table 3 by comparing the et0 at three growing seasons we found that the et0 variation trend is very similar both in pattern and range therefore it is reasonable to perform evapotranspiration analysis and comparison among the three growing seasons the experiment treatments with same dtw was considered as duplication since all the setting among them was same the daily et for cutting treatments but before the cutting conducted was used to a statistical analysis firstly the et of pre cutting vs the et of ck were plotted in fig 5 it was showed that under each of the 4 watertable condition most points distributed along and nearby the 1 1 line the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 799 0 789 0 791 and 0 896 for the dtw 0 4 m 0 7 m 1 1 m and 1 5 m respectively which indicated that the et between two duplicated treatments cut and ck was comparable and consistent with each other the variation of soil water content distribution along the profile for dtw 0 4 m and dtw 1 5 m were shown in fig 6 for each cutting treatment the variation of soil water distribution pattern along the profiles was negligible after cutting for example the average changing rate of soil water storage in the entire soil body was only 0 058 cm day and about13 of the corresponding et although there was apparent variation of soil water content in top soil for the treatment with dtw 0 4 m the variation trend was irrelative to the cutting date therefore it was not the cutting induced variation to the contrary the difference of the soil water distribution pattern along the profiles was notable between the treatments of different dtw the variation trend of et of cutting treatment was consistent with that of the control treatment ck before cutting and their values were almost same at most time fig 7 the relative error varied in the range of 15 for the lysimeter with dtw 1 5 m the rmse was 0 706 it indicated a good consistence between the treatments of cut and ck moreover we got similar findings for all the treatments in three growing seasons therefore it is reasonable in treating the cutting and ck lysimeters as two duplicates for the cutting treatment the root water uptake ceased after cutting while the soil evaporation was unaffected the transpiration of winter wheat e g t et was then determined by calculating the difference of daily et between the cutting treatment and ck thus the cutting method is reasonable and applicable for partitioning of et 3 2 the t et for winter wheat and the watertable effect the variation of the daily et of different treatments was shown in fig 7 before cutting the variation of daily et was close to each other which indicated a high consistency no matter in which growing stage the wheat was cut the daily et decreased abruptly just after cutting and then fluctuated at a relatively low level moreover the daily et of two lysimeters which cut at different growing stage was close to each other after cutting both of them were gradually close to that of ck as it entered the mature stage of winter wheat the ratio of t to et in all three years for all the treatments of different watertable depth were calculated and presented in fig 8 totally four depths of groundwater in three growing seasons from the year of 2009 2011 are shown in the figure similar to the basal crop coefficient kcb curves illustrated in liu and luo 2010 we proposed a generalized curve to represent the t et at the mid to late season stages of winter wheat the generalized t et here noted as k is a horizontal line at the mid season of winter wheat then it was decreased linearly at the late season stage of winter wheat the maximum value of generalized t et curve kmax increased with the increase of groundwater table depth dtw and was 0 651 0 768 0 771 and 0 869 for the depth of 0 4 m 0 7 m 1 1 m and 1 5 m respectively the higher transpiration proportion corresponded to the higher water use efficiency wue which indicated that increased groundwater depth was benefit to enhance the groundwater consumption by transpiration when watertable was low 1 5 m the variation of daily soil evaporation with watertable depth at the maturity stage of winter wheat was shown in fig 9 the soil evaporation decreased dramatically as the watertable decreased from 0 4 m to 0 7 m fig 9 then it continually decreased at a lower rate as the watertable further decreased to 1 5 m moreover when the gardner 1958 equation was applied to fit the soil evaporation curve we got the equation as follow 5 e 1 05 e 0 78 d 1 where e is the soil evaporation cm d d is the watertable depth m the coefficient of determination r2 0 955 the equation provided a useful tool for easily calculating of the soil evaporation in the lower reach of the yellow river basin the yield of the winter wheat under each treatment at two years was listed in table 4 it was found that the yield in 2011 is higher than that of 2010 for all the 4 groundwater condition the yield increased as the watertable decreasing in the year of 2010 while the yield of dtw 1 5 m is highest in the year of 2011 although there is no constant increasing trend for yield as the watertable decreasing just as reported in kahlown et al 2005 the yield of winter wheat is mainly dependent on the environment in the root zone root depth and sensitivity of crop for water and oxygen therefore the moisture condition in root zone was appropriate for the root development of winter wheat under a deeper water table condition e g dtw 1 5 m in this study and fully development of the root system contributed to get a higher yield 4 discussion the root water uptake ceased after cutting of the winter wheat therefore the decrement of et between the cutting and ck treatments just after cutting was approximated as the transpiration of winter wheat based on this assumption the cutting method was proposed however just as many other research indicated that the et was influenced by many factors such as meteorological factors watertable depth growing stage of winter wheat and so on xu et al 2021 as wang 2014 stated that growing stage and leaf area index lai collectively explained 43 of the variations in the global t et data set the crop has the highest t et among the many other ecosystem types wei et al 2017 but the range is also wide it could be as low to 62 as reported in zhou et al 2018 or as high to 92 as reported in miralles et al 2011 the t et under different watertable conditions in present study was consistent with findings of many other research work in this study the cutting method was applied in late april or may therefore only the t et at the mid season and late season growing stages of winter wheat was investigated but the crop transpiration is often associated with lai which change rapidly during the period from regreening stage to maturity stage of winter wheat further research was needed on investigating the suitability of the cutting method and the et partition 5 conclusions it is of great significance for partitioning the et into evaporation losses and plant transpiration to better understand the interaction of shallow groundwater with winter wheat in the lower reach of yellow river basin and furthermore to improve the water use efficiency and mitigate the secondary salinization risk in this study field experiments were conducted during three growing seasons of winter wheat from 2008 to 2011 by using 9 square lysimeters totally four watertable depths 0 4 0 7 1 1 and 1 5 m were involved in the experiments the method of cutting of winter wheat for et partitioning was demonstrated to be successful and applicable in the lower reach of yellow river basin this method of cutting provided an in situ determination way to investigate the evaporation and transpiration components of water cycle in an agro ecosystem in addition the rate of t to et varied with watertable depth under no rainfall and non irrigation condition the ratio of t to et decreased as the watertable depth decrease at middle and late growing season highest t et was observed under groundwater level of 1 5 m moreover the lower evaporation proportion might lower the soil salinization risk due to less soil evaporation therefore it is recommended to control groundwater around the depth of 1 5 m in this region for one side it will unlock the potential of shallow groundwater for irrigation and improve the wue on the other hand it can mitigate salinization risk without loss of agricultural productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
