21770,numerous constructed jacket platforms in the persian gulf require continuous monitoring due to aging which poses a significant hazard to the environment the main aim of this study is to sketch a health monitoring system to address the problem of limitations and shortcomings of sensor networks and also to solve the localization problem in order to achieve this goal experimental modal analysis ema is performed on a physical model of an offshore jacket platform to develop a numerically updated finite element model both traditional and improved cross model cross mode cmcm iteration algorithms are employed for this purpose and different model order reduction methods are compared in terms of their effects on the structural dynamic behavior of the case study spd8 jacket platform a new formulation is also proposed for the first time to compare the results of damage scenarios using both iteration algorithms the effectiveness of the methodology in practical cases is also assessed by considering various numbers of sensors according to the results the improved iteration technique eliminates the detrimental impacts of the model reduction procedure on the proposed methodology and

operate in a hostile environment not only these structures are constantly exposed to dynamic forces by waves currents winds and earthquakes but also the platforms members are exposed to corrosion and fatigue damage wang and li 2012 lotfollahi yaghin et al 2011 du et al 2015 all these factors can lead to relentless damage to the jacket platform during its serviceable lifetime to prevent any catastrophe that could harm the environment and the lives of operators not only structural behavior improvement procedure can be performed through small or large modifications such as using various kinds of dampers hokmabady et al 2019a but also the inspection of joints and members of the jacket required to be scheduled at regular intervals every 5 years on average hagen and dnv 1996 however many adverse conditions can also eliminate the effectiveness of the inspection both economically and technically since non destructive damage detection nddd is capable of determining the location and severity of damage in the short term the importance of using these methods has grown dramatically kim and stubbs 1995 thus the structural health monitoring shm has gained global attention in recent decades and is widely used in some applications such as global non destructive nd inspection methods which are typically used to explore critically important changes in structural members to foresee an unanticipated failure in these methods damage can be quantified and localized by measuring vibration parameters using on line damage assessment techniques mojtahedi et al 2012 such as modal based shm basically modal parameters such as frequency damping and mode shapes depend on physical parameters of the structure e g mass damping and stiffness therefore as the structural members are damaged depending on the location of the members and the severity of the damage the modal parameters of the structure would change zhu and au 2020 on the other hand the finite element fe modeling is used widely to simulate the structure numerically to acquire modal parameters new and highly sophisticated fe methods have recently been available for structural analysis however there are two main challenges in experimental damage detection associated with fe models firstly the practical application often shows a substantial discrepancy between analytical prediction and experimental results because they depend on prior mathematical models that are often significantly uncertain and not validated with experimental data secondly the development of computer models to validate experimental evidence requires a theoretical foundation numerical modeling and experimental data all of which come with their associated errors hokmabady et al 2019b therefore a large amount of computation is still necessary to update and validate the model feizi et al 2015 then the updated model prior to damage can be used as a benchmark for damage detection various model updating approaches have been used in recent years to gain the more precise dynamic response of the structure rezaniaiee aqdam et al 2018 jha et al 2016 mishra and chakraborty 2016 mojtahedi et al 2012 developed a robust damage diagnosis system that was less sensitive to both the measurements and the modeling uncertainties a modal flexibility based method considering fe model updating approach for damage detection purposes was proposed by liu et al 2018a sotoudehnia et al 2019 introduced a new damage identification formulation for damage detection of a specified fluid structure system another challenge in using modal based shm is the higher degrees of freedom dofs of the fe model it is infeasible to measure all dofs of the physical model due to difficulties in measuring rotational dofs and the limitation in the number of sensors within an experimental environment li and hong 2011 yi 2016 on the other hand increment in the number of sensors incurs more environmental noises and dissimilar dynamics characteristics and increase the prediction errors to overcome such uncertain effects hybrid modal assurance criteria method could be offered as a fast zone diagnostics procedure based on practical considerations to address this problem reduction methods are introduced by applying fewer dofs to an fe model the original and the reduced dofs are connected by a transformation matrix one of the simplest methods of reduction is the static reduction provided by guyan 1965 o callahan 1989 introduced the improved reduced system irs method which had somewhat eliminated the limitations of the guyan methodology flodén et al 2014 friswell proposed an iterated irs reduction method friswell et al 1998 that is similar to the irs method with some application differences succession level approximate reduction sar method is another term for an iterative irs method zhang and li 1995 while the sar is quite different from the irs a brief review of reduction methods and experimental investigation on model updating of an offshore jacket platform can be found in li and ding 2010 the main challenge in practical modal based damage detection is the required number of vibrational modes in this regard the cross model cross mode cmcm method has been introduced hu et al 2007 the cmcm is a physical property adjustment approach for model updating and damage detection which requires only a few modes of the damaged structure and does not need the analytical modes to be paired or scaled li et al 2008 experiments on cmcm model updating method were conducted on 2015 by a group of researcher wang et al 2015 they considered surrounding water of offshore jacket platform as added mass and performed an experimental test in air and water liu et al 2018b improved the form of coefficient matrix and added more independent equations on the basis of the cmcm method however there is still some practical issues in using cmcm method since the fe models contain many dofs assessing numerous frequencies and modes is a time consuming process in such cases the complete solution of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is not essential for the appropriate approximation of the dynamic responses and only the natural frequencies of the structure near the resonance frequency can be considered in this method there is no need to locate the damage with a few millimeters of precision in global damage detection methods due to the required extensive costs damage zone detection is helpful in such conditions when the jacket platforms are monitored in practice local detection methods can then help detect the exact location furthermore the key point for the proposed method of this study is sketching a monitoring system to address the problem of limitations shortcomings of sensor network and solving the localization problem when there are limited and incomplete mode shapes the related assumption is based on a principle from philosophy of science known as the ockham s razor principle schaffer 2015 it is a problem solving principle that states entities should not be multiplied without necessity and believes that the simplest solution is most likely the right one it says that if several explanations are existed for an occurrence then the one that requires the least constraints and assumptions is usually correct for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon there may be an extremely large perhaps even incomprehensible number of possible and more complex alternatives baker 2004 this research is an experimental study on a laboratory model of a jacket platform to develop a refined and simplified fe model for the detection of damage one of the features of the study is using the experimental modal analysis ema on a physical model for evaluating the fe model and acquiring dynamic properties of the damaged structure since the fe models of structures are usually very complex including numerous dofs and a simple replacement is used only in the traditional iterative method a huge amount of iterations and computing time are needed to gain the ideal results to expedite convergence a new improved iterative method associated with the cmcm has been introduced to detect damage with limited number of modes and incomplete mode shapes a correction term is added to the traditional iterative method to eliminate the detrimental effects of model reduction process on the model updating and the damage detection procedures more details about the methodology of the study is presented in section 2 1 to compare the results of both traditional and improved damage detection scenarios a new formulation is proposed for the first time based on the results the introduced formulation is capable enough in assessment of the damage detection results also according to the results the negative impacts of the model reduction procedure are limited significantly employing the improved iteration method based on the experimental damage detection results the length type and location of a member plays a significant role in success of the damage scenario 2 methodology and mathematical background 2 1 overview in this manuscript the cmcm method with both traditional and improved iteration algorithms is performed for model updating and damage identification for this purpose a three dimensional model of an offshore jacket platform is built and an experimental test is implemented to develop an updated fe model for damage detection in this regard the sensitivity analysis is performed to find out the most sensitive and crucial members after updating the numerical model based on experimental modal analysis damage detection method is performed by creating six simple and complex damage scenarios to investigate the capability of the proposed algorithm in identifying the location and the severity of the damage to assess the methodology success a modal assurance criterion mac index is used and a new formulation is proposed to investigate the success of scenarios with false damage predictions the efficiency of the methodology in practical cases is also assessed by considering different number of sensors the methodology of the study is presented in fig 1 2 2 damage detection traditional cmcm method the mainframe of the damage detection algorithm being used in this study is based on the so called cmcm method hu et al 2007 so in this section this method is briefly introduced first the equation of motion for a multi dof of an intact dynamic system is given by eq 1 in which 0 m and k are a zero vector mass matrix and stiffness matrix respectively 1 m v kv 0 in addition v and v denote the vectors of the displacement and acceleration respectively the eigen solution of the target system consists of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors the ith eigenvalue and eigenvector associated with k and m are expressed as 2 k φ i λ i m φ i where m and k is the mass matrix and stiffness matrix for the base line intact model λ i and φ i are the ith eigenvalue and eigenvector respectively associated with k and m in the development of the cmcm method it is assumed that the stiffness and mass matrices of the structure are obtained from a base line fe model the jth eigenvalue and eigenvector associated with k and m can be obtained as follow 3 k φ j λ j m φ j 4 φ i t k φ j λ i φ i t m φ j 5 φ i t k φ j λ j φ i t m φ j where t is transpose operator the relationship between the structural stiffness matrix of intact and damaged structures is assumed as follows 6 k k n 1 ne α n k n where kn is the component of the total stiffness matrix corresponding to the nth members ne is the number of members and α n are unknown correction factors to be determined herein for simplicity in presentation it is assumed that each member involves a parameter to be updated such as young s modulus of each member also changes in the mass are negligible m m subtraction eq 4 from eq 5 and substituting eq 6 into them yields 7 n 1 ne α n φ i φ i t k n φ j λ j λ i φ i t m φ j by replacing r instead of i and j the eq 7 can be written as follow 8 n 1 ne α n c r n f r where 9 c r n φ i t k n φ j 10 f r λ j λ i φ i t m φ j when ni modes are taken from the baseline fe model and nj modes are measured from the damaged structure totally n r ni nj equations can be formed from eq 8 equations formed based on eq 8 are named cmcm equations because they involve two modes of two models rewriting eq 8 in a matrix form one shows 11 c n r n e α n e 1 f n r 1 where n r is greater than 2ne a least squares technique can be taken to calculate α as follow hu et al 2007 12 α c t c 1 c t f therefore in the present method the correction factor α can be used for model updating and damage detection 2 3 damage detection reduction method guyan reduction method partitions the mass and stiffness matrices and the displacement vector into a set of master and slave dofs hutton 2004 neglecting the inertia terms for the second set of equations the guyan transformation matrix and the reduced mass and stiffness matrices are presented as follows 13 m m m m m s m s m m s s v m v s k m m k m s k s m k s s v m v s 0 0 here the subscripts m and s relate to master and slave coordinates respectively 14 k sm v m k ss v s t s v m which may be used to eliminate the slave dofs so that 15 v m v s i k ss 1 k sm v m t s v m 16 t s i k ss 1 k sm ts is guyan or static transformation matrix and i is an identity matrix the reduced mass and stiffness matrices are then given by 17 m guyan t s t m t s 18 k guyan t s t k t s in irs reduction method the transformation matrix ti is used to reduce mass and stiffness matrices as follows flodén et al 2014 19 t i t s smt s m guyan 1 k guyan here mguyan and kguyan are the guyan s mass and stiffness reduction matrices respectively also have 20 s 0 0 0 k ss 1 the reduced mass and stiffness matrices are then given by 21 m irs t irs t m t irs 22 k irs t irs t k t irs in the iterated irs reduction

then desirable t is found to reduce the mass and stiffness matrices 24 m irs 1 t i r s 1 t m t i r s 1 25 k irs 1 t i r s 1 t k t i r s 1 in sar reduction method the first iteration stage illustrates the guyan reduction method the second iteration indicating the irs method and the third iteration illustrates the iterative irs method the sar transformation matrix and the reduced mass and stiffness

equations the index l represents each iteration l 1 represents the first iteration guyan l 2 represents the second iteration irs and l 3 third iteration iterative irs 2 4 damage detection traditional iteration method supposing φ s j is the jth mode shape of the damaged platform measured only at the master dofs and φ s i is the ith mode shape of the reduced fe model respectively the relationship between modes of the intact and damaged platform can be written as 31 φ i t i n t a c t φ s i 32 φ j t d a m a g e d φ s j where t intact and t damaged are transformation matrices of intact and damaged platform respectively after substituting eqs 31 and 32 into eq 7 a reduced cmcm method for damage detection can be written as 33 n 1 ne α n φ s i t t i n t a c t t k n t d a m a g e d φ s j λ s j λ s i φ s i t m s φ s j 34 m s t i n t a c t t mt i n t a c t where λ s i is i th modes of the reduced intact platform λ s j is j th modes of reduced damaged platform and m s is mass matrix of

platform is built in accordance with a 1 100 scaled model of the spd8 jacket installed in the persian gulf in 65 m of water depth it is built utilizing the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs hollow tubes to approach the scaled model the dimensionless froude number is chosen based on the required scaling factors density elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the experimental model material are taken as 10 24 k g m 3 3 10 9 p a and 0 3 respectively some details of the scaled model and the prototype are presented in table 1 a scheme of the experimental and the fe model is shown in fig 2 4 numerical and experimental modal analysis 4 1 fe modeling and theoretical modal analysis the jacket platform is modeled numerically using both ansys and matlab software packages the equation of motion for a multi degree of freedom undamped system can be obtained from eq 1 the solution of the eq 1 using suitable initial conditions provides the natural frequencies corresponding to the dofs of the system in this work the undamped natural frequencies are considered as the desired extracted features this means that the standard eigen problem must be solved 45 det k m λ 2 0 the modal analysis is performed in ansys to obtain modal parameters of the numerical model then the jacket platform is modeled in matlab and the acquired results are compared with ansys in order to validate the identified frequencies and mode shapes of fe coded model for the implementation of the proposed method the mass and stiffness matrices are extracted by ansys software the results of the numerical modal analysis are shown in fig 3 a comparison between modal results of fem coding and ansys are presented in table 2 as it is seen in table 2 there are no significant differences between the first four natural frequencies of the matlab code and ansys results consequently the developed code which is used in this study is valid enough to be used within the calculation more discussion about the proposed mode shapes for damage detection are presented in sec 6 4 2 experimental modal analysis ema modal testing is an experimental method used to obtain the modal parameters of a model of a linear time invariant vibration system the theoretical basis of the method is secured by establishing the relationship between the vibration response at one location and excitation at the same or another location depending on the excitation frequency in brief ema consists of three component phases test preparation measurement of frequency responses and detection of modal parameters the preparation involves selection of a structures support type of excitation force s location s hardware to measure force s and responses designation of a structural geometry model which consist of points of response to be measured and detection of mechanisms which could lead to inaccurate measurement however it is unrealistic to expect such a fe model to be fully representative of faith due to the complexity and uncertainty of the structure a fundamental approach is to take a measurement of the structure derive its modal model and use it to correlate with the existing fe model in order to update it in this manuscript the experimental modal tests are implemented on the scaled model using the shaker tests in modal analysis laboratory of the university of tabriz the measured responses are obtained from the shaker tests the instrument including two light uni axial accelerometers in both the x and y directions are attached on each joint of the model for response measurement see fig 4 the frequency sampling of the test setup is chosen as 16 3 khz and the frequency range is taken 0 800 hz the recorded data is post processed by the me scope ves software to obtain the modal parameters the results of the experimental model are used for numerical model updating as described in section 5 the result of the ema for the investigated model is presented in the form of frequency response functions frf in fig 5 the first four identified mode shapes and their related frequencies are presented in fig 6 for the experimental model the modal parameters are gained by the me scope ves software as explained in section 3 5 sensitivity analysis and model updating process in this study the sensitivity analysis is performed by completely removing the jacket members for this purpose the elasticity modulus in the fe model is taken as zero for the desired member and the percentage of changes in the first five natural frequencies of the structure is calculated to achieve a robust monitoring system the mutability of the structural dynamic properties which is the basis for the evaluation algorithms is thoroughly realized and then the most sensitive and crucial ones are selected to update the initial fe model it is necessary to minimize the numerical model error according to the experimental signatures the concepts of the modal assurance criterion mac method can be applied for this purpose as follows 46 w w 1 w 2 47 w 1 λ a λ e i w 2 m a c i a n d m a c i φ e t φ e 2 φ e t φ e φ i t φ a i where λ i and φ i are the ith eigenvalue and eigenvector respectively and the subscripts a and e denote the analytical and corresponding experimental values by utilizing the first order taylor series the following equation can be gained 48 w e w a s δ x ε where w e w a s x δ x and ε are the experimental and the analytical function vectors the design sensitivity matrix of w a the changes in x for the least squares minimization and the residual vector respectively the least squares solution for δ x to minimize ε t ε can be considered as follows 49 δ x s t s 1 s t 1 w a where the design sensitivity matrix modal functions of the eigenvalue and the eigenvector are defined as 50 s w 1 a x w 2 a x w a w e x m a c x and the mac equation can be rearranged as follows 51 m a c i φ e t φ e 2 φ e t φ e φ i t φ a i τ β i where τ i φ e t φ e 2 and β i φ e t φ e φ i t φ a in this study the main procedure for model updating is based on cmcm method for this purpose eq 33 can be written as li and hong 2011 52 n 1 ne α n φ s i t t i n t a c t t k n t i n t a c t k φ s j λ s j λ s i φ s i t m s φ s j where t i n t a c t k is transfer matrix of intact structure in kth iteration 6 results and discussion it is time consuming to apply all considered damage scenarios experimentally therefore a numerical model might be used as a baseline model in this study an updated numerical model is used for damage detection to show high potential of the proposed methodology the percentage of changes in the jacket platform s first five vibrational modes is studied through sensitivity analysis which is performed by complete member removal procedure the location and labels of the members are presented in fig 7 the sensitivity between the stiffness of different bracing m30 m43 leg m10 and horizontal m83 members are reported in fig 8 according to fig 8 two main leg and bracing members have the highest effects on the first five vibrational modes natural frequencies while the horizontal member includes the lowest impact on modes however as expected the fifth natural frequency of the jacket is affected insignificantly in sensitivity analysis which is might be because of its least influence on capturing the main energy of the system although both bracing members m30 and m43 affect the frequencies significantly m30 has higher sensitivity to damage for this reason member m30 is chosen to be used in the damage detection scenarios various reduction methods are considered based on different l values as presented in table 3 as it is seen in table 3 despite the first four natural frequencies there is a significant difference between the fifth natural frequency of the numerical and experimental model however this difference might be because of the fact that the first four frequencies capture the main system energy although the natural frequency of the first five mode shapes is presented in table 3 only the first four main mode shapes and their related natural frequencies are used in damage detection procedure according to table 3 by increasing the number of iterations the natural frequencies of the reduced numerical model are getting closer to the natural frequencies of the numerical model in the twentieth iteration the first three vibrational modes natural frequencies are fit to the frequencies of the numerical model in order to increase the accuracy of the results by taking the optimal time into account the third step of the iteration sar l 3 is considered as of the reduction method in the current study the first four natural frequencies of the updated model are presented in tables 4 and 5 using the classical and the improved iteration methods respectively it can be obviously seen that the improved method performed significantly better in updating the model 6 1 damage detection results the capability of the proposed methodology is assessed considering different damage scenarios on the baseline model for this purpose six distinct scenarios are defined more details about the proposed scenarios are presented in table 6 for the first three scenarios a single member is specified and for the second three scenarios two members are defined simultaneously in the first three scenarios reduction in stiffness of the leg member m10 the bracing member m30 and the horizontal member m83 is considered the stiffness is reduced in all first three scenarios to 75 percent and the damage is determined using the classical and improved cmcm methods based on the first vibrational mode of the model the result of the classical cmcm with one mode of the damaged platform is presented in fig 9 for the first three scenarios due to the higher number of members just a range of the results around the damaged members are presented in each scenario in fig 9 the term preset is referred to the preset damage in the specified member in fig 9 based on fig 9 by implementing the classical cmcm method in both non iterative and iterative algorithms none of the damaged members are identified correctly also the convergence is not achieved in the results in higher iterations the algorithm accuracy is also increased for identifying the damage location and severity by increasing the iteration value however some other closer members are also identified wrongly through the process the results of the improved cmcm method are shown in fig 10 for the first three scenarios by considering different iteration values because of the higher number of members just a range of the results around the damaged members are presented in fig 10 according to the improved cmcm method s result which is shown in fig 10 in the non iterative mode the method is not capable enough to correctly identify the damage location and severity the damage identification process is performed more efficient as the iteration value is increased although the method is unable to identify the location and severity of the damage accurately the improved method performed much better in comparison to the classical one the performance of the method is significantly better in higher iterations in the first and the second scenarios which is for the leg and the bracing member however based on the results of figs 9 and 10 the main performance of the algorithm in accurate determination of the damage is not yet comparable on the other hand it is not clear enough whether the first or the second scenario is more successful for this reason in this manuscript a new formulation is introduced to assess the accuracy of the algorithm in predicting the exact damage location and severity the new proposed formulation can be also used to compare damage detection results which include some false predictions the formulation is defined based on the number and the value of the wrong damage predictions which are considered as errors due to the importance of the number of errors in comparison with the error value some weighted coefficients are specified in this formulation also based on detrimental impact of the errors with higher values on the final result the weighted coefficient is considered as a range for such wrong damage detections the proposed formulation is defined as follows 53 s i v 1 2 n e r n e r 0 w e v e v i 100 2 t n e n p r where s i v is the success index si value n e r is the number of errors e v i is each error value considered as a percent in the formulation w e v is the weighted coefficient specified in a range of 1 3 based on the value of the error on the other hand w e v is taken as 1 for the error value less than 25 percent and 3 for the error value higher than 75 percent t n e and n p r are the total number of the members and the total number of the preset members respectively to study the efficiency of the proposed formulation of success index the results of the fourth and fifth scenarios are compared in the fourth and fifth scenarios two distinct members are defined in which a leg member with 50 percent of damage and a horizontal member with 75 percent of damage are considered for the fourth scenario and a leg member with 50 percent of damage and also a bracing member with 75 percent of damage are specified for the fifth scenario the members are considered as member 10 for the leg m10 member 30 for the bracing m30 and member 83 m83 for the horizontal member the damage identification process is performed by taking all three modes of the damaged jacket platform s mode shapes into account the results of si value are presented in figs 13 and 14 for both fourth and fifth scenarios using the classical and the improved cmcm methods as it is shown in fig 11 by considering a leg and a horizontal member as of the damaged members of the fourth scenario the higher the number of iterations the more the si value although increment in number of iterations increases the algorithm performance the most optimum value of iteration can be considered as 50 due to insignificant increment in the si value among 50 and 100 iterations through all presented classical and improved cmcm methods the highest si value is gained as the improved method is taken into account however the classical method performed better in higher iterations in fact due to better performance of the improved method in lower iterations it can be concluded that using the improved method for damage detection not only gives better results but also takes less calculation time which is significantly important for a practical case according to the results of the fifth scenario in fig 12 as it is expected increasing the iteration can improve the si value however the performance of the improved method even with taking one mode shape into account is similar to the performance of the classical method with three mode shapes in lower iterations obviously the higher value of si in the fifth scenario is due to selected leg and bracing members in comparison to the fifth scenario due to presence of a horizontal member among the damaged members in the fourth scenario the value of si is almost lower which is because of difficulties in detection of damage in horizontal members more details about figs 11 and 14 are listed in table 7 for the classical and improved methods with three mode shapes and 50 iterations as it is presented in table 7 in the fourth scenario with the classical method 11 members n e r are identified incorrectly in which 6 members include damage severity under 25 percent 3 members with severity between 25 and 50 percent and 2 members with severity between 50 and 75 percent the value of w e v is taken as 1 1 75 and 2 5 for the mentioned 6 3 and 2 members respectively on the other hand for the improved method in the fourth scenario 8 false members are identified in which 6 members include damage severity under 25 percent and 2 members with severity between 25 and 50 percent as of the final step a more complex scenario is proposed in which all investigated members are defined for this purpose a leg member m10 with 75 percent a bracing member m30 with 50 percent and a horizontal member m83 with 25 percent of damage is specified the si value is presented in fig 13 for the sixth scenario using the classical and improved cmcm methods based on fig 13 although the classical and improved methods with one mode shape and the classical method with three mode shapes perform almost the same without iteration the improved method by three mode shapes performed much better the capability of all methods are improved as the number of iterations are increased however among all the improved method with three mode shapes can be taken as of the best method for the complex scenario also it can be seen that higher number of iterations can improve the method performance in the complex damage scenario in comparison to simple one or two damaged members scenarios nevertheless for the improved method with 50 iterations it takes almost 40 5s to obtain the results but in the classical one the results are gained in 91 6s which indicates the higher efficiency of the improved method for practical purposes more details about fig 13 are listed in table 8 for the classical and improved methods with three mode shapes and 50 iterations according to table 8 in the sixth scenario with the classical method 18 members are identified incorrectly in which 8 members include damage severity under 25 percent 6 members with severity between 25 and 50 percent 3 members involve damage severity between 50 and 75 percent and 1 member with severity higher than 75 percent the value of w e v is taken as 1 1 75 2 5 and 3 for the mentioned members on the other hand for the improved method 12 false members are identified in which 8 members include damage severity under 25 percent 3 members with damage severity between 25 and 50 percent and only 1 member include damage severity between 50 and 75 percent as a conclusion it should be noted that the proposed formulation is significantly effective in determining the most successful damage detection method based on the results in all damage scenarios the improved method performed considerably better in comparison to the traditional one 6 2 damage detection based on number of sensors basically considering any possible number of damage detection sensors in a practical case is irrational due to presence of financial and maintenance issues lower number of sensors is more reasonable to save costs eliminating some of the translational dofs of the numerical analysis can be specified as of the main purpose of this section in first three scenarios the first vibrational mode of the damaged structure is used which mainly vibrates horizontally on the other hand the values in the vertical direction are small in comparison to the horizontal ones in such cases it is possible to limit all sensors in the vertical direction the same procedure can be considered as higher mode shapes are included within the analytical process higher mode shapes of the damaged structure can be proposed as higher amount of sensors moreover the most sections and connections of an offshore jacket platform are under water which can be specified as inaccessible parts that attaching a sensor is almost impossible or is possible through high maintenance costs for this purpose it is more reasonable to consider sensors in higher levels of the jacket which are above the still water level in normal sea conditions to assess the possibility of removing under water sensors two distinct sensor configurations are proposed based on the members of the sixth scenario in the first configuration a group of three sensors that measure horizontal vertical and rotational movement are considered at each four nodes of two top levels of the jacket which are supposed to be above the water level in the second configuration all nodes of the jacket both above and under water are supposed to involve sensors with only the vertical and horizontal movement measuring capability thus 24 master dofs for the first configuration and 40 master dofs for the second configuration are defined the resulting damage detection is illustrated in fig 14 with the non iterative method as it is presented in fig 14 although considering higher number of dofs can improve the accuracy of damage detection using only 24 master dofs together with the proposed improved cmcm reduction method can result in a reasonably accurate damage detection result on the other hand to take all aspects of a practical case such as cost maintenance and result accuracy into account considering lower number of dofs sensors in higher structural levels of such complex systems is highly recommended 6 3 damage detection on the experimental model in this manuscript three damage detection scenarios are defined experimentally three bracing and horizontal members of two distinct structural levels are considered for this purpose the bracing members are taken as member 30 m30 43 m43 and 46 m46 the horizontal member is taken as member 83 m83 see fig 7 for simplicity only experimental test of the third scenario is presented in fig 15 before and after member s removal the test is carried out by removing each member separately the results of the experimental scenarios are presented in table 9 based on the results of table 9 damage detection procedure is more successful in the bracing members in comparison to the horizontal members as expected in fact this is due to higher effects of the bracing members on the stiffness of the structure that influences the dynamic properties of the system in the first three scenarios various bracing members are defined in which their length and location are different among two first scenarios removing m30 scenario 1 is successful not only because of the length of the member but also due to its key role in structural frame stability and the main system stiffness although damage identification is unsuccessful in short bracing member m43 scenario 2 it is successful as another bracing member m46 is removed along with member m43 scenario 3 in the last scenario a horizontal member m83 is considered and the scenario is unsuccessful which is due to its insignificant effect on the modal parameters of the primary system this proves that physical parameters such as length type and location of a member play a significant role in success of a damage detection scenario 7 conclusion this paper presents an approach to overcome the problem of required large number of sensors in a monitoring system the concepts of various model order reduction methods applicability are also presented and compared in terms of their efficiency on the structural dynamic behavior for this purpose an experimental study is performed for damage detection of a scaled physical model of a real case study spd8 jacket platform the proposed approach is a global non destructive damage detection method which uses vibration measurements the method is limited to identify the structural damage that produces measurable changes in the structural dynamic characteristics the methodology of this study depends only on the measured vibration responses of the structure and does not require any knowledge of the magnitude of the exciting force however the output response must be considered more carefully a new formulation is also defined for the first time to assess the efficiency of the specified damage scenarios the mentioned formulation is determined based on the number of wrong detected damaged members and their values a range of non physical coefficients are also specified according to the magnitude of the detected damage which has a key role in the success of a method the results indicate that the improved cmcm method is more accurate in detecting the damage in comparison to the classical method in both simple and complex damage scenarios with consideration of capability of the methodology for the structures whose natural frequency is far removed from the exciting frequency it can be concluded that the method is particularly suitable for an on line health monitoring system of the offshore jackets to address the problem of sensor limitation in practice after updating the numerical model the traditional cross model cross modal methods with both traditional and improved iteration algorithms are performed in which the succession level approximate reduction method is chosen as of the best approach the improved iteration method eliminates the detrimental impacts of the model reduction procedure on the new damage detection process the key point for the proposed method is related to an assumption that can be authenticated based on a problem solving principle which indicates that the simplest solution is most likely the right one in this view the simpler explanations are preferable to more complex ones because of their testability feature the approach does not require expensive instruments and only a few sensors are to be located at pre specified strategic locations the data gained from the sensors can be analyzed in correlated with the results of the numerical analysis to identify the damage based on the results by taking all aspects of a practical case such as cost maintenance and result accuracy into account considering lower number of dofs sensors in only higher structural levels of a complex system is highly recommended finally the capability of empirical investigation of the damage detection method is considered for this purpose various damage scenarios are defined by completely removing the certain members of the physical model the observations indicate that the proposed technique is efficient for diagnosing the damage presence however it had varying degrees of success in detecting damage in members depending on the length type and location of the member the method is more successful in diagnosing the lack of the bracing members except for recognition of damage occurrence in horizontal members it may be in connection with the fact that the related modal characteristics are more sensitive to the changes in the stiffness of the diagonal members than the horizontal ones credit authorship contribution statement alireza mojtahedi

21770,numerous constructed jacket platforms in the persian gulf require continuous monitoring due to aging which poses a significant hazard to the environment the main aim of this study is to sketch a health monitoring system to address the problem of limitations and shortcomings of sensor networks and also to solve the localization problem in order to achieve this goal experimental modal analysis ema is performed on a physical model of an offshore jacket platform to develop a numerically updated finite element model both traditional and improved cross model cross mode cmcm iteration algorithms

operate in a hostile environment not only these structures are constantly exposed to dynamic forces by waves currents winds and earthquakes but also the platforms members are exposed to corrosion and fatigue damage wang and li 2012 lotfollahi yaghin et al 2011 du et al 2015 all these factors can lead to relentless damage to the jacket platform during its serviceable lifetime to prevent any catastrophe that could harm the environment and the lives of operators not only structural behavior improvement procedure can be performed through small or large modifications such as using various kinds of dampers hokmabady et al 2019a but also the inspection of joints and members of the jacket required to be scheduled at regular intervals every 5 years on average hagen and dnv 1996 however many adverse conditions can also eliminate the effectiveness of the inspection both economically and technically since non destructive damage detection nddd is capable of determining the location and severity of damage in the short term the importance of using these methods has grown dramatically kim and stubbs 1995 thus the structural health monitoring shm has gained global attention in recent decades and is widely used in some applications such as global non destructive nd inspection methods which are typically used to explore critically important changes in structural members to foresee an unanticipated failure in these methods damage can be quantified and localized by measuring vibration parameters using on line damage assessment techniques mojtahedi et al 2012 such as modal based shm basically modal parameters such as frequency damping and mode shapes depend on physical parameters of the structure e g mass damping and stiffness therefore as the structural members are damaged depending on the location of the members and the severity of the damage the modal parameters of the structure would change zhu and au 2020 on the other hand the finite element fe modeling is used widely to simulate the structure numerically to acquire modal parameters new and highly sophisticated fe methods have recently been available for structural analysis however there are two main challenges in experimental damage detection associated with fe models firstly the practical application often shows a substantial discrepancy between analytical prediction and experimental results because they depend on prior mathematical models that are often significantly uncertain and not validated with experimental data secondly the development of computer models to validate experimental evidence requires a theoretical foundation numerical modeling and experimental data all of which come with their associated errors hokmabady et al 2019b therefore a large amount of computation is still necessary to update and validate the model feizi et al 2015 then the updated model prior to damage can be used as a benchmark for damage detection various model updating approaches have been used in recent years to gain the more precise dynamic response of the structure rezaniaiee aqdam et al 2018 jha et al 2016 mishra and chakraborty 2016 mojtahedi et al 2012 developed a robust damage diagnosis system that was less sensitive to both the measurements and the modeling uncertainties a modal flexibility based method considering fe model updating approach for damage detection purposes was proposed by liu et al 2018a sotoudehnia et al 2019 introduced a new damage identification formulation for damage detection of a specified fluid structure system another challenge in using modal based shm is the higher degrees of freedom dofs of the fe model it is infeasible to measure all dofs of the physical model due to difficulties in measuring rotational dofs and the limitation in the number of sensors within an experimental environment li and hong 2011 yi 2016 on the other hand increment in the number of sensors incurs more environmental noises and dissimilar dynamics characteristics and increase the prediction errors to overcome such uncertain effects hybrid modal assurance criteria method could be offered as a fast zone diagnostics procedure based on practical considerations to address this problem reduction methods are introduced by applying fewer dofs to an fe model the original and the reduced dofs are connected by a transformation matrix one of the simplest methods of reduction is the static reduction provided by guyan 1965 o callahan 1989 introduced the improved reduced system irs method which had somewhat eliminated the limitations of the guyan methodology flodén et al 2014 friswell proposed an iterated irs reduction method friswell et al 1998 that is similar to the irs method with some application differences succession level approximate reduction sar method is another term for an iterative irs method zhang and li 1995 while the sar is quite different from the irs a brief review of reduction methods and experimental investigation on model updating of an offshore jacket platform can be found in li and ding 2010 the main challenge in practical modal based damage detection is the required number of vibrational modes in this regard the cross model cross mode cmcm method has been introduced hu et al 2007 the cmcm is a physical property adjustment approach for model updating and damage detection which requires only a few modes of the damaged structure and does not need the analytical modes to be paired or scaled li et al 2008 experiments on cmcm model updating method were conducted on 2015 by a group of researcher wang et al 2015 they considered surrounding water of offshore jacket platform as added mass and performed an experimental test in air and water liu et al 2018b improved the form of coefficient matrix and added more independent equations on the basis of the cmcm method however there is still some practical issues in using cmcm method since the fe models contain many dofs assessing numerous frequencies and modes is a time consuming process in such cases the complete solution of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is not essential for the appropriate approximation of the dynamic responses and only the natural frequencies of the structure near the resonance frequency can be considered in this method there is no need to locate the damage with a few millimeters of precision in global damage detection methods due to the required extensive costs damage zone detection is helpful in such conditions when the jacket platforms are monitored in practice local detection methods can then help detect the exact location furthermore the key point for the proposed method of this study is sketching a monitoring system to address the problem of limitations shortcomings of sensor network and solving the localization problem when there are limited and incomplete mode shapes the related assumption is based on a principle from philosophy of science known as the ockham s razor principle schaffer 2015 it is a problem solving principle that states entities should not be multiplied without necessity and believes that the simplest solution is most likely the right one it says that if several explanations are existed for an occurrence then the one that requires the least constraints and assumptions is usually correct for each accepted explanation of a phenomenon there may be an extremely large perhaps even incomprehensible number of possible and more complex alternatives baker 2004 this research is an experimental study on a laboratory model of a jacket platform to develop a refined and simplified fe model for the detection of damage one of the features of the study is using the experimental modal analysis ema on a physical model for evaluating the fe model and acquiring dynamic properties of the damaged structure since the fe models of structures are usually very complex including numerous dofs and a simple replacement is used only in the traditional iterative method a huge amount of iterations and computing time are needed to gain the ideal results to expedite convergence a new improved iterative method associated with the cmcm has been introduced to detect damage with limited number of modes and incomplete mode shapes a correction term is added to the traditional iterative method to eliminate the detrimental effects of model reduction process on the model updating and the damage detection procedures more details about the methodology of the study is presented in section 2 1 to compare the results of both traditional and improved damage detection scenarios a new formulation is proposed for the first time based on the results the introduced formulation is capable enough in assessment of the damage detection results also according to the results the negative impacts of the model reduction procedure are limited significantly employing the improved iteration method based on the experimental damage detection results the length type and location of a member plays a significant role in success of the damage scenario 2 methodology and mathematical background 2 1 overview in this manuscript the cmcm method with both traditional and improved iteration algorithms is performed for model updating and damage identification for this purpose a three dimensional model of an offshore jacket platform is built and an experimental test is implemented to develop an updated fe model for damage detection in this regard the sensitivity analysis is performed to find out the most sensitive and crucial members after updating the numerical model based on experimental modal analysis damage detection method is performed by creating six simple and complex damage scenarios to investigate the capability of the proposed algorithm in identifying the location and the severity of the damage to assess the methodology success a modal assurance criterion mac index is used and a new formulation is proposed to investigate the success of scenarios with false damage predictions the efficiency of the methodology in practical cases is also assessed by considering different number of sensors the methodology of the study is presented in fig 1 2 2 damage detection traditional cmcm method the mainframe of the damage detection algorithm being used in this study is based on the so called cmcm method hu et al 2007 so in this section this method is briefly introduced first the equation of motion for a multi dof of an intact dynamic system is given by eq 1 in which 0 m and k are a zero vector mass matrix and stiffness matrix respectively 1 m v kv 0 in addition v and v denote the vectors of the displacement and acceleration respectively the eigen solution of the target system consists of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors the ith eigenvalue and eigenvector associated with k and m are expressed as 2 k φ i λ i m φ i where m and k is the mass matrix and stiffness matrix for the base line intact model λ i and φ i are the ith eigenvalue and eigenvector respectively associated with k and m in the development of the cmcm method it is assumed that the stiffness and mass matrices of the structure are obtained from a base line fe model the jth eigenvalue and eigenvector associated with k and m can be obtained as follow 3 k φ j λ j m φ j 4 φ i t k φ j λ i φ i t m φ j 5 φ i t k φ j λ j φ i t m φ j where t is transpose operator the relationship between the structural stiffness matrix of intact and damaged structures is assumed as follows 6 k k n 1 ne α n k n where kn is the component of the total stiffness matrix corresponding to the nth members ne is the number of members and α n are unknown correction factors to be determined herein for simplicity in presentation it is assumed that each member involves a parameter to be updated such as young s modulus of each member also changes in the mass are negligible m m subtraction eq 4 from eq 5 and substituting eq 6 into them yields 7 n 1 ne α n φ i φ i t k n φ j λ j λ i φ i t m φ j by replacing r instead of i and j the eq 7 can be written as follow 8 n 1 ne α n c r n f r where 9 c r n φ i t k n φ j 10 f r λ j λ i φ i t m φ j when ni modes are taken from the baseline fe model and nj modes are measured from the damaged structure totally n r ni nj equations can be formed from eq 8 equations formed based on eq 8 are named cmcm equations because they involve two modes of two models rewriting eq 8 in a matrix form one shows 11 c n r n e α n e 1 f n r 1 where n r is greater than 2ne a least squares technique can be taken to calculate α as follow hu et al 2007 12 α c t c 1 c t f therefore in the present method the correction factor α can be used for model updating and damage detection 2 3 damage detection reduction method guyan reduction method partitions the mass and stiffness matrices and the displacement vector into a set of master and slave dofs hutton 2004 neglecting the inertia terms for the second set of equations the guyan transformation matrix and the reduced mass and stiffness matrices are presented as follows 13 m m m m m s m s m m s s v m v s k m m k m s k s m k s s v m v s 0 0 here the subscripts m and s relate to master and slave coordinates respectively 14 k sm v m k ss v s t s v m which may be used to eliminate the slave dofs so that 15 v m v s i k ss 1 k sm v m t s v m 16 t s i k ss 1 k sm ts is guyan or static transformation matrix and i is an identity matrix the reduced mass and stiffness matrices are then given by 17 m guyan t s t m t s 18 k guyan t s t k t s in irs reduction method the transformation matrix ti is used to reduce mass and stiffness matrices as follows flodén et al 2014 19 t i t s smt s m guyan 1 k guyan here mguyan and kguyan are the guyan s mass and stiffness reduction matrices respectively also have 20 s 0 0 0 k ss 1 the reduced mass and stiffness matrices are then given by 21 m irs t irs t m t irs 22 k irs t irs t k t irs in the iterated irs reduction

the guyan reduction method the second iteration indicating the irs method and the third iteration illustrates the iterative irs method the sar transformation matrix and the reduced mass and stiffness

equations the index l represents each iteration l 1 represents the first iteration guyan l 2 represents the second iteration irs and l 3 third iteration iterative irs 2 4 damage detection traditional iteration method supposing φ s j is the jth mode shape of the damaged platform measured only at the master dofs and φ s i is the ith mode shape of the reduced fe model respectively the relationship between modes of the intact and damaged platform can be written as 31 φ i t i n t a c t φ s i 32 φ j t d a m a g e d φ s j where t intact and t damaged are transformation matrices of intact and damaged platform respectively after substituting eqs 31 and 32 into eq 7 a reduced cmcm method for damage detection can be written as 33 n 1 ne α n φ s i t t i n t a c t t k n t d a m a g e d φ s j λ

platform is built in accordance with a 1 100 scaled model of the spd8 jacket installed in the persian gulf in 65 m of water depth it is built utilizing the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs hollow tubes to approach the scaled model the dimensionless froude number is chosen based on the required scaling factors density elastic modulus and poisson s ratio of the experimental model material are taken as 10 24 k g m 3 3 10 9 p a and 0 3 respectively some details of the scaled model and the prototype are presented in table 1 a scheme of the experimental and the fe model is shown in fig 2 4 numerical and experimental modal analysis 4 1 fe modeling and theoretical modal analysis the jacket platform is modeled numerically using both ansys and matlab software packages the equation of motion for a multi degree of freedom undamped system can be obtained from eq 1 the solution of the eq 1 using suitable initial conditions provides the natural frequencies corresponding to the dofs of the system in this work the undamped natural frequencies are considered as the desired extracted features this means that the standard eigen problem must be solved 45 det k m λ 2 0 the modal analysis is performed in ansys to obtain modal parameters of the numerical model then the jacket platform is modeled in matlab and the acquired results are compared with ansys in order to validate the identified frequencies and mode shapes of fe coded model for the implementation of the proposed method the mass and stiffness matrices are extracted by ansys software the results of the numerical modal analysis are shown in fig 3 a comparison between modal results of fem coding and ansys are presented in table 2 as it is seen in table 2 there are no significant differences between the first four natural frequencies of the matlab code and ansys results consequently the developed code which is used in this study is valid enough to be used within the calculation more discussion about the proposed mode shapes for damage detection are presented in sec 6 4 2 experimental modal analysis ema modal testing is an experimental method used to obtain the modal parameters of a model of a linear time invariant vibration system the theoretical basis of the method is secured by establishing the relationship between the vibration response at one location and excitation at the same or another location depending on the excitation frequency in brief ema consists of three component phases test preparation measurement of frequency responses and detection of modal parameters the preparation involves selection of a structures support type of excitation force s location s hardware to measure force s and responses designation of a structural geometry model which consist of points of response to be measured and detection of mechanisms which could lead to inaccurate measurement however it is unrealistic to expect such a fe model to be fully representative of faith due to the complexity and uncertainty of the structure a fundamental approach is to take a measurement of the structure derive its modal model and use it to correlate with the existing fe model in order to update it in this manuscript the experimental modal tests are implemented on the scaled model using the shaker tests in modal analysis laboratory of the university of tabriz the measured responses are obtained from the shaker tests the instrument including two light uni axial accelerometers in both the x and y directions are attached on each joint of the model for response measurement see fig 4 the frequency sampling of the test setup is chosen as 16 3 khz and the frequency range is taken 0 800 hz the recorded data is post processed by the me scope ves software to obtain the modal parameters the results of the experimental model are used for numerical model updating as described in section 5 the result of the ema for the investigated model is presented in the form of frequency response functions frf in fig 5 the first four identified mode shapes and their related frequencies are presented in fig 6 for the experimental model the modal parameters are gained by the me scope ves software as explained in section 3 5 sensitivity analysis and model updating process in this study the sensitivity analysis is performed by completely removing the jacket members for this purpose the elasticity modulus in the fe model is taken as zero for the desired member and the percentage of changes in the first five natural frequencies of the structure is calculated to achieve a robust monitoring system the mutability of the structural dynamic properties which is the basis for the evaluation algorithms is thoroughly realized and then the most sensitive and crucial ones are selected to update the initial fe model it is necessary to minimize the numerical model error according to the experimental signatures the concepts of the modal assurance criterion mac method can be applied for this purpose as follows 46 w w 1 w 2 47 w 1 λ a λ e i w 2 m a c i a n d m a c i φ e t φ e 2 φ e t φ e φ i t φ a i where λ i and φ i are the ith eigenvalue and eigenvector respectively and the subscripts a and e denote the analytical and corresponding experimental values by utilizing the first order taylor series the following equation can be gained 48 w e w a s δ x ε where w e w a s x δ x and ε are the experimental and the analytical function vectors the design sensitivity matrix of w a the changes in x for the least squares minimization and the residual vector respectively the least squares solution for δ x to minimize ε t ε can be considered as follows 49 δ x s t s 1 s t 1 w a where the design sensitivity matrix modal functions of the eigenvalue and the eigenvector are defined as 50 s w 1 a x w 2 a x w a w e x m a c x and the mac equation can be rearranged as follows 51 m a c i φ e t φ e 2 φ e t φ e φ i t φ a i τ β i where τ i φ e t φ e 2 and β i φ e t φ e φ i t φ a in this study the main procedure for model updating is based on cmcm method for this purpose eq 33 can be written as li and hong 2011 52 n 1 ne α n φ s i t t i n t a c t t k n t i n t a c t k φ s j λ s j λ s i φ s i t m s φ s j where t i n t a c t k is transfer matrix of intact structure in kth iteration 6 results and discussion it is time consuming to apply all considered damage scenarios experimentally therefore a numerical model might be used as a baseline model in this study an updated numerical model is used for damage detection to show high potential of the proposed methodology the percentage of changes in the jacket platform s first five vibrational modes is studied through sensitivity analysis which is performed by complete member removal procedure the location and labels of the members are presented in fig 7 the sensitivity between the stiffness of different bracing m30 m43 leg m10 and horizontal m83 members are reported in fig 8 according to fig 8 two main leg and bracing members have the highest effects on the first five vibrational modes natural frequencies while the horizontal member includes the lowest impact on modes however as expected the fifth natural frequency of the jacket is affected insignificantly in sensitivity analysis which is might be because of its least influence on capturing the main energy of the system although both bracing members m30 and m43 affect the frequencies significantly m30 has higher sensitivity to damage for this reason member m30 is chosen to be used in the damage detection scenarios various reduction methods are considered based on different l values as presented in table 3 as it is seen in table 3 despite the first four natural frequencies there is a significant difference between the fifth natural frequency of the numerical and experimental model however this difference might be because of the fact that the first four frequencies capture the main system energy although the natural frequency of the first five mode shapes is presented in table 3 only the first four main mode shapes and their related natural frequencies are used in damage detection procedure according to table 3 by increasing the number of iterations the natural frequencies of the reduced numerical model are getting closer to the natural frequencies of the numerical model in the twentieth iteration the first three vibrational modes natural frequencies are fit to the frequencies of the numerical model in order to increase the accuracy of the results by taking the optimal time into account the third step of the iteration sar l 3 is considered as of the reduction method in the current study the first four natural frequencies of the updated model are presented in tables 4 and 5 using the classical and the improved iteration methods respectively it can be obviously seen that the improved method performed significantly better in updating the model 6 1 damage detection results the capability of the proposed methodology is assessed considering different damage scenarios on the baseline model for this purpose six distinct scenarios are defined more details about the proposed scenarios are presented in table 6 for the first three scenarios a single member is specified and for the second three scenarios two members are defined simultaneously in the first three scenarios reduction in stiffness of the leg member m10 the bracing member m30 and the horizontal member m83 is considered the stiffness is reduced in all first three scenarios to 75 percent and the damage is determined using the classical and improved cmcm methods based on the first vibrational mode of the model the result of the classical cmcm with one mode of the damaged platform is presented in fig 9 for the first three scenarios due to the higher number of members just a range of the results around the damaged members are presented in each scenario in fig 9 the term preset is referred to the preset damage in the specified member in fig 9 based on fig 9 by implementing the classical cmcm method in both non iterative and iterative algorithms none of the damaged members are identified correctly also the convergence is not achieved in the results in higher iterations the algorithm accuracy is also increased for identifying the damage location and severity by increasing the iteration value however some other closer members are also identified wrongly through the process the results of the improved cmcm method are shown in fig 10 for the first three scenarios by considering different iteration values because of the higher number of members just a range of the results around the damaged members are presented in fig 10 according to the improved cmcm method s result which is shown in fig 10 in the non iterative mode the method is not capable enough to correctly identify the damage location and severity the damage identification process is performed more efficient as the iteration value is increased although the method is unable to identify the location and severity of the damage accurately the improved method performed much better in comparison to the classical one the performance of the method is significantly better in higher iterations in the first and the second scenarios which is for the leg and the bracing member however based on the results of figs 9 and 10 the main performance of the algorithm in accurate determination of the damage is not yet comparable on the other hand it is not clear enough whether the first or the second scenario is more successful for this reason in this manuscript a new formulation is introduced to assess the accuracy of the algorithm in predicting the exact damage location and severity the new proposed formulation can be also used to compare damage detection results which include some false predictions the formulation is defined based on the number and the value of the wrong damage predictions which are considered as errors due to the importance of the number of errors in comparison with the error value some weighted coefficients are specified in this formulation also based on detrimental impact of the errors with higher values on the final result the weighted coefficient is considered as a range for such wrong damage detections the proposed formulation is defined as follows 53 s i v 1 2 n e r n e r 0 w e v e v i 100 2 t n e n p r where s i v is the success index si value n e r is the number of errors e v i is each error value considered as a percent in the formulation w e v is the weighted coefficient specified in a range of 1 3 based on the value of the error on the other hand w e v is taken as 1 for the error value less than 25 percent and 3 for the error value higher than 75 percent t n e and n p r are the total number of the members and the total number of the preset members respectively to study the efficiency of the proposed formulation of success index the results of the fourth and fifth scenarios are compared in the fourth and fifth scenarios two distinct members are defined in which a leg member with 50 percent of damage and a horizontal member with 75 percent of damage are considered for the fourth scenario and a leg member with 50 percent of damage and also a bracing member with 75 percent of damage are specified for the fifth scenario the members are considered as member 10 for the leg m10 member 30 for the bracing m30 and member 83 m83 for the horizontal member the damage identification process is performed by taking all three modes of the damaged jacket platform s mode shapes into account the results of si value are presented in figs 13 and 14 for both fourth and fifth scenarios using the classical and the improved cmcm methods as it is shown in fig 11 by considering a leg and a horizontal member as of the damaged members of the fourth scenario the higher the number of iterations the more the si value although increment in number of iterations increases the algorithm performance the most optimum value of iteration can be considered as 50 due to insignificant increment in the si value among 50 and 100 iterations through all presented classical and improved cmcm methods the highest si value is gained as the improved method is taken into account however the classical method performed better in higher iterations in fact due to better performance of the improved method in lower iterations it can be concluded that using the improved method for damage detection not only gives better results but also takes less calculation time which is significantly important for a practical case according to the results of the fifth scenario in fig 12 as it is expected increasing the iteration can improve the si value however the performance of the improved method even with taking one mode shape into account is similar to the performance of the classical method with three mode shapes in lower iterations obviously the higher value of si in the fifth scenario is due to selected leg and bracing members in comparison to the fifth scenario due to presence of a horizontal member among the damaged members in the fourth scenario the value of si is almost lower which is because of difficulties in detection of damage in horizontal members more details about figs 11 and 14 are listed in table 7 for the classical and improved methods with three mode shapes and 50 iterations as it is presented in table 7 in the fourth scenario with the classical method 11 members n e r are identified incorrectly in which 6 members include damage severity under 25 percent 3 members with severity between 25 and 50 percent and 2 members with severity between 50 and 75 percent the value of w e v is taken as 1 1 75 and 2 5 for the mentioned 6 3 and 2 members respectively on the other hand for the improved method in the fourth scenario 8 false members are identified in which 6 members include damage severity under 25 percent and 2 members with severity between 25 and 50 percent as of the final step a more complex scenario is proposed in which all investigated members are defined for this purpose a leg member m10 with 75 percent a bracing member m30 with 50 percent and a horizontal member m83 with 25 percent of damage is specified the si value is presented in fig 13 for the sixth scenario using the classical and improved cmcm methods based on fig 13 although the classical and improved methods with one mode shape and the classical method with three mode shapes perform almost the same without iteration the improved method by three mode shapes performed much better the capability of all methods are improved as the number of iterations are increased however among all the improved method with three mode shapes can be taken as of the best method for the complex scenario also it can be seen that higher number of iterations can improve the method performance in the complex damage scenario in comparison to simple one or two damaged members scenarios nevertheless for the improved method with 50 iterations it takes almost 40 5s to obtain the results but in the classical one the results are gained in 91 6s which indicates the higher efficiency of the improved method for practical purposes more details about fig 13 are listed in table 8 for the classical and improved methods with three mode shapes and 50 iterations according to table 8 in the sixth scenario with the classical method 18 members are identified incorrectly in which 8 members include damage severity under 25 percent 6 members with severity between 25 and 50 percent 3 members involve damage severity between 50 and 75 percent and 1 member with severity higher than 75 percent the value of w e v is taken as 1 1 75 2 5 and 3 for the mentioned members on the other hand for the improved method 12 false members are identified in which 8 members include damage severity under 25 percent 3 members with damage severity between 25 and 50 percent and only 1 member include damage severity between 50 and 75 percent as a conclusion it should be noted that the proposed formulation is significantly effective in determining the most successful damage detection method based on the results in all damage scenarios the improved method performed considerably better in comparison to the traditional one 6 2 damage detection based on number of sensors basically considering any possible number of damage detection sensors in a practical case is irrational due to presence of financial and maintenance issues lower number of sensors is more reasonable to save costs eliminating some of the translational dofs of the numerical analysis can be specified as of the main purpose of this section in first three scenarios the first vibrational mode of the damaged structure is used which mainly vibrates horizontally on the other hand the values in the vertical direction are small in comparison to the horizontal ones in such cases it is possible to limit all sensors in the vertical direction the same procedure can be considered as higher mode shapes are included within the analytical process higher mode shapes of the damaged structure can be proposed as higher amount of sensors moreover the most sections and connections of an offshore jacket platform are under water which can be specified as inaccessible parts that attaching a sensor is almost impossible or is possible through high maintenance costs for this purpose it is more reasonable to consider sensors in higher levels of the jacket which are above the still water level in normal sea conditions to assess the possibility of removing under water sensors two distinct sensor configurations are proposed based on the members of the sixth scenario in the first configuration a group of three sensors that measure horizontal vertical and rotational movement are considered at each four nodes of two top levels of the jacket which are supposed to be above the water level in the second configuration all nodes of the jacket both above and under water are supposed to involve sensors with only the vertical and horizontal movement measuring capability thus 24 master dofs for the first configuration and 40 master dofs for the second configuration are defined the resulting damage detection is illustrated in fig 14 with the non iterative method as it is presented in fig 14 although considering higher number of dofs can improve the accuracy of damage detection using only 24 master dofs together with the proposed improved cmcm reduction method can result in a reasonably accurate damage detection result on the other hand to take all aspects of a practical case such as cost maintenance and result accuracy into account considering lower number of dofs sensors in higher structural levels of such complex systems is highly recommended 6 3 damage detection on the experimental model in this manuscript three damage detection scenarios are defined experimentally three bracing and horizontal members of two distinct structural levels are considered for this purpose the bracing members are taken as member 30 m30 43 m43 and 46 m46 the horizontal member is taken as member 83 m83 see fig 7 for simplicity only experimental test of the third scenario is presented in fig 15 before and after member s removal the test is carried out by removing each member separately the results of the experimental scenarios are presented in table 9 based on the results of table 9 damage detection procedure is more successful in the bracing members in comparison to the horizontal members as expected in fact this is due to higher effects of the bracing members on the stiffness of the structure that influences the dynamic properties of the system in the first three scenarios various bracing members are defined in which their length and location are different among two first scenarios removing m30 scenario 1 is successful not only because of the length of the member but also due to its key role in structural frame stability and the main system stiffness although damage identification is unsuccessful in short bracing member m43 scenario 2 it is successful as another bracing member m46 is removed along with member m43 scenario 3 in the last scenario a horizontal member m83 is considered and the scenario is unsuccessful which is due to its insignificant effect on the modal parameters of the primary system this proves that physical parameters such as length type and location of a member play a significant role in success of a damage detection scenario 7 conclusion this paper presents an approach to overcome the problem of required large number of sensors in a monitoring system the concepts of various model order reduction methods applicability are also presented and compared in terms of their efficiency on the structural dynamic behavior for this purpose an experimental study is performed for damage detection of a scaled physical model of a real case study spd8 jacket platform the proposed approach is a global non destructive damage detection method which uses vibration measurements the method is limited to identify the structural damage that produces measurable changes in the structural dynamic characteristics the methodology of this study depends only on the measured vibration responses of the structure and does not require any knowledge of the magnitude of the exciting force however the output response must be considered more carefully a new formulation is also defined for the first time to assess the efficiency of the specified damage scenarios the mentioned formulation is determined based on the number of wrong detected damaged members and their values a range of non physical coefficients are also specified according to the magnitude of the detected damage which has a key role in the success of a method the results indicate that the improved cmcm method is more accurate in detecting the damage in comparison to the classical method in both simple and complex damage scenarios with consideration of capability of the methodology for the structures whose natural frequency is far removed from the exciting frequency it can be concluded that the method is particularly suitable for an on line health monitoring system of the offshore jackets to address the problem of sensor limitation in practice after updating the numerical model the traditional cross model cross modal methods with both traditional and improved iteration algorithms are performed in which the succession level approximate reduction method is chosen as of the best approach the improved iteration method eliminates the detrimental impacts of the model reduction procedure on the new damage detection process the key point for the proposed method is related to an assumption that can be authenticated based on a problem solving principle which indicates that the simplest solution is most likely the right one in this view the simpler explanations are preferable to more complex ones because of their testability feature the approach does not require expensive instruments and only a few sensors are to be located at pre specified strategic locations the data gained from the sensors can be analyzed in correlated with the results of the numerical analysis to identify the damage based on the results by taking all aspects of a practical case such as cost maintenance and result accuracy into account considering lower number of dofs sensors in only higher structural levels of a complex system is highly recommended finally the capability of empirical investigation of the damage detection method is considered for this purpose various damage scenarios are defined by completely removing the certain members of the physical model the observations indicate that the proposed technique is efficient for diagnosing the damage presence however it had varying degrees of success in detecting damage in members depending on the length type and location of the member the method is more successful in diagnosing the lack of the bracing members except for recognition of damage occurrence in horizontal members it may be in connection with the fact that the related modal characteristics are more sensitive to the changes in the stiffness of the diagonal members than the horizontal ones credit authorship contribution statement alireza mojtahedi

21771,in order to reduce assembly time and improve the computational efficiency under ship fires a surrogate based optimization technique is proposed to estimate the optimal time of the issuance of evacuation orders which determines the passenger response times the legendre polynomial chaos expansion technique is employed to construct the surrogate model of passenger assembly time with response time parameters and validated with the original computer evacuation model the genetic algorithm ga is subsequently applied to find the optimal response time combination a 3 storey passenger ship is presented and four different fire scenarios that involve typical fire locations are considered to address the validity of this proposed method the results suggest that this proposed method can be used to determine the optimal and the worst response time parameters with a significantly reduced number of evaluation samples the relative error of assembly time from the surrogate model follows the normal distribution for evacuation zone with the longest average travel distance passengers should be informed of the immediate evacuation for evacuation zones with short average travel distances the optimal response time may be larger than the worst solution this work provides a new method to make a reasonable evacuation planning in ship fires keywords ship fires assembly time response time optimization surrogate model evacuation orders 1 introduction with the rapid development of cruise tourism more and more passenger ships has been constructed in recent years such as luxury cruise ships in passenger ships there is a large amount of combustible materials for decoration e g accommodation rooms the fire has been considered as a typical disaster for passenger ships for example a fire broke out on march 23 2006 on the star princess cruise ship causing 1 death and 9 injuries meanwhile 150 cabin rooms are seriously damaged in the middle of this ship as shown in fig 1 the duration from the initial notification of the fire to all passengers escaping to assembly stations is called as assembly time imo 2016 to ensure the safety of passengers passengers should evacuate quickly to one assembly stations under ship fires the time from the initial notification of the fire to the passenger beginning to move is called as response time imo 2016 which depends on the issuance of evacuation orders to efficiently evacuate the crowd phased evacuation strategy has been adopted in high rise buildings gravit et al 2018 similarly the optimization of the time of the issuance of evacuation orders is also of great importance to the improvement of evacuation efficiency under ship fires the international maritime organization imo has issued a series of evacuation analysis guidelines for passenger ships such as msc circ 909 imo 1999 msc circ 1033 imo 2002 msc 1 circ 1238 imo 2007 and msc 1 circ 1533 imo 2016 considering the effects of uncertain factors ping et al 2018 adopted a correction factor 1 25 to calculate crew evacuation time in an offshore platform xie et al 2020 adopted the polynomial chaos expansion method with nested sampling to quantify the uncertainty of passenger travel time under ship fires in recent decades a large amount of research has been conducted to investigate response time data galea et al 2011 2013 2014a 2014b and brown et al 2012 carried out full scale evacuation experiments in passenger ships passenger response times were collected and analyzed statistically which indicated that response times follow lognormal distributions in passenger ships lovreglio et al 2019 collected pre evacuation time data from 9 fire incidents and 103 evacuation drills in 16 countries and estimated the response time distributions in different occupancies moreover the relevant studies has been conducted and a large amount of pre movement time data were collected to develop the database of response time of building fires fahy and proulx 2001 gwynne et al 2003 shi et al 2009 brown et al 2012 besides deere et al 2006 suggested that the distribution of response time has a significant effect on evacuation time for passenger ships additionally phark et al 2018 adopted machine learning algorithm to analyze the issuance of emergency evacuation orders for chemical accidents and yi et al 2017 proposed a bi level programming model to optimize the issuance of evacuation orders under evolving hurricane conditions however the reasonable passenger response times by optimizing the time of the issuance of evacuation orders has not been addressed for passenger evacuation under ship fires what s more various mature numerical optimization methods have been proposed during the past decades which can be classified as deterministic and stochastic methods li and zheng 2017 genetic algorithm ga davis 1991 and particle swarm optimization pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 are two more common stochastic optimization algorithms however a great number of evaluation samples are required to find the optimal solution of the objective as a result it is computationally prohibitive to implement the optimization of passenger response time parameters by combining the time consuming computer evacuation model and traditional numerical optimization techniques in order to improve the computational efficiency of optimization analysis the surrogate model based optimization techniques have been developed during the recent decades such as the kriging based optimization model lee et al 2016 and radial basis function based optimization model zhang et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 polynomial chaos expansion was developed by wiener 1938 and has aroused much attention with respect to uncertainty quantification hadigol and doostan 2018 guo et al 2019 xie et al 2020 sensitivity analysis palar et al 2018 and prediction yaseen et al 2019 due to the efficient construction of the surrogate model as mentioned above the previous studies focused on the experimental collection of response time data and its effect on evacuation time to date only a handful of studies have investigated emergency evacuation orders yi et al 2017 phark et al 2018 while these findings cannot be directly applied in the optimization of passenger response time parameters polynomial chaos expansion is a widely used surrogate modelling method with a less evaluation samples thus to develop a reasonable emergency evacuation plan a polynomial chaos expansion based optimization method is proposed to search the optimal passenger response time combination under ship fires in this paper to deepen the understanding of the optimization of passenger evacuation orders under ship fires the surrogate model of passenger assembly time regarding response time parameters is firstly constructed using the legendre polynomial chaos expansion based on this surrogate model the optimal solution of passenger response time parameters can be calculated by the ga this work attempts to provide to a quantitative analysis method to optimize passenger response time parameters under ship fires which can facilitate to make an efficient evacuation plan of passengers the structure of the present study is presented as follows section 2 is devoted to an optimization method for passenger response time parameters under ship fires by combining the legendre polynomial chaos expansion and ga in section 3 the optimization of response time parameters is conducted and discussed in three different evacuation zones of a real ship finally some conclusions of the present work are summarized in section 4 2 optimization model on passenger response time parameters under ship fires a great amount of heat smoke toxic and irritant gases can be produced by the fire which may have significant effects on passenger evacuation under ship fires passengers may be subjected to skin and respiratory tract burns by the high temperature smoke and the passenger s evacuation ability may be impaired due to the presence of toxic gases salem 2016 besides visibility can be severely reduced by smoke particles which may result in the significant reduction of passenger speed thus in order to protect passengers from fire and smoke passengers are required to evacuate rapidly to assembly stations and then queue up for ships life saving appliances moreover based on a two zone fire model consolidated fire and smoke transport cfast salem 2016 adopted the fractional effective dose fed and fractional effective concentration fec methods to quantify the effects of fire products in ships on passenger evacuation the required safe assembly time without the quantitative effects of fire products is a critical parameter in the performance based fire safety design and assessment of passenger ships hence in this paper the effects of fire products on passengers are not analyzed quantitatively additionally passengers in fire zones are more vulnerable to being subjected to the potential harm of fire products thus priority should be given to the passengers in fire zones we assume that passengers in the fire zone evacuate immediately when the fire alarm device activates and passengers in non fire zones follow the instruction of evacuation orders without the effects of fire products moreover individual response times in each evacuation zone are assumed to be equal due to the issuance of evacuation orders meanwhile the simulation of a large scale crowd is more time consuming using complex and refined computer evacuation models to reduce the number of computationally intensive evacuation simulations in optimization analysis a surrogate based optimization method is proposed in this work the legendre expansion modelling is adopted to construct the surrogate model of assembly time with the response time parameters and then the conventional numerical optimization technique ga is used to find the optimal solution of response time parameters the detailed flowchart of passenger response time optimization method is presented in fig 2 2 1 determination of objective function and design space of response time parameters when a fire occurs in the ships all passengers on aboard should quickly evacuate to assembly stations therefore in this paper our objective function is assembly time and assembly time is affected by the passenger response time parameters which are regarded as design variables considering the issuance of evacuation orders individual response times in each evacuation zone are assumed to be equal passenger assembly time affected by response time parameters can be expressed as follows 1 t s f r 1 r 2 r n where t s is assembly time r 1 r 2 r n are passenger response time parameters for n different evacuation zones of passenger ships without the issuance of evacuation orders response time of each passenger is random which follows lognormal distributions in previous studies lovreglio et al 2019 for the night case individual response time is distributed in the range of 400 700 s and it is 0 300 s for the day case imo 2016 it can be found that the difference between the maximum and minimum value of individual response time are both 300 s for day and night cases therefore it can be assumed that for the issuance of evacuation orders the passenger response times in each evacuation zone are equal and distributed in the range of 0 300 s our aim is to minimize the objective function f r 1 r 2 r n subjected to the constraints of r 1 r 2 r n in the following equation 2 min r 1 r 2 r n f r 1 r 2 r n subjected to 3 0 r 1 r 2 r n 300 2 2 legendre polynomial chaos expansion of passenger assembly time according to the wiener chaos theory any stochastic variable with a finite second moment can be represented by a series expansion in orthogonal polynomials wiener 1938 the orthogonal polynomial set is dependent on the distribution of input stochastic variable for common stochastic variables the corresponding orthogonal polynomial functions are presented in table 1 for the optimization problem design variables are assumed to be uniformly distributed in their respective variation ranges according to table 1 legendre polynomial chaos expansion method is used to construct the surrogate model of assembly time with response time parameters as shown in equation 4 4 t s α 0 ψ 0 i 1 1 n α i 1 ψ 1 r i 1 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 α i 1 i 2 ψ 2 r i 1 r i 2 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 i 3 1 i 2 α i 1 i 2 i 3 ψ 3 r i 1 r i 2 r i 3 where α 0 α i 1 are polynomial chaos expansion coefficients r 1 r 2 r n are mutually independent response time variables which follow the uniform distribution in the range of 0 300 s ψ 0 ψ 1 are the multi dimensional legendre orthogonal polynomials of degrees 0 1 due to the independence of r 1 r 2 r n the multi dimensional legendre orthogonal polynomials can be obtained by the product of multiple one dimensional legendre polynomials for example ψ k r i 1 r i 2 r i k can be expressed by 5 ψ k r i 1 r i 2 r i k ψ m 1 r i 1 ψ m 2 r i 2 ψ m n r i k m 1 m 2 m k k 1 i 1 i 2 i k n where ψ m 1 ψ m 2 ψ m n are respectively the one dimensional legendre polynomials of degrees m 1 m 2 m n the classical legendre polynomials are orthogonal with regard to the interval 1 1 with the weighting function 1 0 and there is a recurrence formula for one dimensional legendre polynomials with a stochastic variable x i in the interval 1 1 arfken et al 2013 which can be expressed as 6 m 1 ψ m 1 x i 2 m 1 x i ψ m x i m ψ m 1 x i where 7 ψ 0 x i 1 ψ 1 x i x i given the total probability of each stochastic variable of 1 0 the shifted legendre polynomials are adopted herein which is orthogonal over an integration interval 0 1 with the weighting function 1 0 and the transformation formula of x i is as follows 8 t i x i 1 2 x i 1 1 thus 9 ψ m x i ψ m 2 t i 1 meanwhile the shifted legendre polynomials satisfy arfken et al 2013 10 0 1 ψ j t i ψ k t i d t i 1 2 k 1 δ j k δ j k 1 j k 0 j k where δ j k is the kronecker delta kundu et al 2016 in order to use equations 9 and 10 r 1 r 2 r n should be transformed by 11 t i r i 300 i 1 2 n thus equation 4 can be rewritten as 12 t s β 0 ψ 0 i 1 1 n β i 1 ψ 1 t i 1 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 β i 1 i 2 ψ 2 t i 1 t i 2 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 i 3 1 i 2 β i 1 i 2 i 3 ψ 3 t i 1 t i 2 t i 3 in order to calculate t s the expansion of equation 12 should be truncated to a certain degree for the d th degree polynomial chaos expansion the degree for each additive term of equation 12 should be less than or equal to d and t s can be expressed as 13 t s β 0 ψ 0 i 1 1 n β i 1 ψ 1 t i 1 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 β i 1 i 2 ψ 2 t i 1 t i 2 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 i d 1 i d 1 β i 1 i 2 i d ψ d t i 1 t i 2 t i 3 t i d moreover the number of additive terms of equation 13 is 14 p n d n d where p is the number of additive terms 2 3 estimation of polynomial chaos expansion coefficients the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients β 0 β i 1 β i 1 i 2 β i 1 i 2 i d in equation 13 can be solved by the orthogonality of shifted legendre polynomials which is called as the projection method sudret 2008 according to the projection method β i 1 i 2 i k can be calculated as 15 β i 1 i 2 i k 0 1 0 1 0 1 t s ψ k t i 1 t i 2 t i k d t i 1 d t i 2 d t i k 0 1 0 1 0 1 ψ k t i 1 t i 2 t i k 2 d t i 1 d t i 2 d t i k due to the known form of shifted legendre polynomials and independent stochastic variables the denominator of equation 15 can be solved analytically based on equation 10 the numerator of equation 15 can be computed by the monte carlo simulation however due to its slower convergent rate a great number of evaluation samples are required which is computationally prohibitive for large scale passenger evacuation simulations under ship fires gauss quadrature is one of the most common numerical integration methods which can be adopted to approximate the values of integrals for shifted legendre polynomials by using less quadrature points for the univariate integral n g gauss points can exactly estimate the values of integrals for polynomials of degrees up to 2n g 1 fernandes and atchley 2006 the gauss legendre points at the quadrature level l are the roots of the legendre orthogonal polynomial of degree l and their weights can be obtained by the following equation bourquin 2015 16 ψ 0 t 1 ψ 0 t 2 ψ 0 t l ψ 1 t 1 ψ 1 t 2 ψ 1 t l ψ l 1 t 1 ψ l 1 t 2 ψ l 1 t l w 1 w 2 w l 0 1 ψ 0 t d t 0 1 ψ 1 t d t 0 1 ψ l 1 t d t where t 1 t 2 t l are gauss legendre points w 1 w 2 w l are the weights of t 1 t 2 t l however the gauss legendre quadrature points are unnested and evaluation samples are wasted for higher quadrature levels in order to solve this problem the nested quadrature schemes has been developed such as the kronrod patterson rule patterson 1968 for a uniformly distributed input variable according to the kronrod patterson rule the sequence of the numbers of nested quadrature points is given as follows 17 n k p 1 3 2 i 1 2 9 1 k p 1 2 i 9 where n kp is the sequence of the numbers of nested quadrature points using the kronrod patterson rule kp is the term number for nested quadrature points according to equation 17 it can be seen that the number of quadrature points increases fast with the term number thus petras 2003 proposed a delayed sequence i e quadrature points can be repeatedly used for some quadrature levels based on the work of petras 2003 for one uniformly distributed stochastic variable the number of delayed kronrod patterson quadrature points is 18 n d e l 1 3 3 7 7 7 15 15 15 15 15 15 d e l 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 where n del is the sequence of the numbers of delayed and nested quadrature points by the delayed kronrod patterson quadrature rule del is the term number for delayed and nested quadrature points for the delayed kronrod patterson quadrature rule the quadrature points and corresponding weights can also be available at http www sparse grids de moreover for the multiple dimensional quadratures the set of quadrature points is the combination of multiple univariate quadrature points i e full tensor product quadrature rule the number of quadrature points will show exponential growth with the number of dimensions thus the computational burden may be unaffordable for high or ultrahigh dimensional quadratures called as the curse of dimensionality eldred and burkardt 2009 for multi dimensional quadratures smolyak 1963 proposed a sparse grid technique to reduce the number of quadrature points from the full tensor product quadrature rule and the corresponding smolyak quadrature points are determined as follows ahlfeld et al 2016 19 q n l l 1 j l n q 1 j 1 q 2 j 2 q n j n j j 1 j 2 j n where q n l is the set of quadrature points for n dimensional stochastic variable t 1 t 2 t n at the quadrature level l q 1 j 1 q 2 j 2 q n j n are respectively the sets of quadrature points for t 1 t 2 t n at the quadrature levels j 1 j 2 j n the weights of smolyak quadrature points for multi dimensional integration can be calculated based on the weight of each univariate quadrature point which can be expressed as 20 w n l l 1 j l n l 1 l n j n 1 l n j k 1 n w k j k where w n l is the corresponding weight set for q n l w k j k is the weight set for q k i k thus the numerator of equation 15 can be rewritten by 21 0 1 0 1 0 1 t s ψ k t i 1 t i 2 t i k d t i 1 d t i 2 d t i k i 1 n d e l n l t s q i n l ψ k q i n l w i n l where n d e l n l is the number of n dimensional quadrature points at the quadrature level l t s q i n l is the exact value of assembly time at q i n l from the original computer evacuation model 2 4 the validation method of surrogate model once the legendre polynomial chaos expansion of assembly time is constructed its accuracy should be validated by the original evacuation model pathfinder is an agent based computer evacuation model thornton et al 2011 which is widely used for the crowd evacuation simulation thus assembly time from the simulation of pathfinder is used as the exact value and assembly time from the legendre polynomial chaos expansion is regarded as the estimated value afterwards the relative error of assembly time can be calculated obviously the validation sample set of assembly time should be reasonably selected latin hypercube sampling lhs is an efficient stratified sampling method which divides the distribution of each input variable into many non overlapping portions with equal probability mckay et al 1979 and then every portion is randomly sampled which makes that the samples can cover evenly its distribution thus assembly times from the simulations of the computer evacuation model pathfinder with the lhs input samples are used as validation set the root mean squared relative error rmsre and maximum absolute relative error mare can be respectively used to measure the overall and local accuracy of the model hence the rmsre and mare of assembly time are used to assess the error of the surrogate model which are respectively calculated by wang and shan 2007 22 rmsre 1 n i 1 n t s i t ˆ s i t s i 2 1 2 23 mare max t s i t ˆ s i t s i i 1 2 n where n is the number of validation samples t s i is the i th exact value of assembly time from the computer evacuation simulation t ˆ s i is the i th estimated value of assembly time from the surrogate model when the rmsre and mare of assembly time approach zero the surrogate model can provide near perfect estimation and close agreement with the original computer evacuation simulation generally if the absolute value of relative error of this surrogate model is less than 5 10 or 15 its accuracy can be considered to be acceptable for engineering applications cuesta et al 2016 in this paper the accuracy of surrogate model is acceptable when the mare and rmsre of assembly time are respectively smaller than 15 and 10 2 5 the ga based optimization method in this paper the surrogate model of assembly time is a linear combination of multi dimensional legendre polynomials with response time parameters thus based on the constructed surrogate model it is computationally inexpensive to adopt numerical optimization methods to determine the minimum value of assembly time and the corresponding optimal solution of response time parameters the ga is one of the popular stochastic optimization methods and its advantage is more likely to find the global optimal solution and avoid to be stuck in the local optimization lee et al 2016 therefore ga is adopted here to obtain the optimal response time solution due to the randomness of the ga optimal solutions may be different for repeated optimization process thus it is necessary to perform repeatedly the ga for many times to obtain a more reliable optimal design point in order to determine the optimal solution of passenger response time parameters the first optimal candidate solution can be obtained by performing the ga with the initial design point of passenger response time variables and then the first optimal candidate solution is used as the initial solution for the second optimization process and perform the second optimization process with the ga the iterative optimization process above is repeated at least 10 times until the optimal candidate solution is convergent the steps for the optimization of response time parameters with the aim of minimizing assembly time are presented in fig 3 3 case study and analysis 3 1 case description in order to illustrate how to use this proposed approach a real 3 storey passenger ship is presented in fig 4 there are 10 stairs 4 assembly stations and 6 kinds of different functional zones including seating zone general area bar zone locker zone restaurant zone and retail zone fig 4 presents that retail zone on deck 1 and restaurant zone on deck 2 are directly connected to assembly stations a and d which are less affected by the passengers in the other zones of this ship thus evacuation analysis of the passengers in restaurant and retail zones are not considered in this paper moreover general area on deck 1 is directly connected to assembly station b and locker zone on deck 1 is directly connected to assembly station c seating zone and general area on deck 2 are connected to assembly station d therefore the passengers in general area and locker zone on deck 1 as well as seating zone and general zone on deck 2 should evacuate immediately to relieve crowd congestion when the fire occurs in this ship i e passenger response times in these zones should be taken as 0 s moreover individual response times in each evacuation zone are assumed to be equal due to issuance of evacuation orders in this case optimized parameters are the passenger response times in bar zone on deck 1 bar zone on deck 2 and seating zone on deck 3 which are respectively denoted as r 1 r 2 and r 3 four different fire scenarios that involve typical fire source locations are considered here considering the hazard of fire products the passenger response time parameter in the fire zone is set to be 0 s and for non fire zones passenger response time parameters are set to be in the ranges of 0 300 s four fire scenarios with different design spaces are shown in table 2 according to the regulation on passenger load capacity from the imo imo 2015 passenger density of public zones is set to be 0 5 persons m2 and the number of passengers in seating zone is taken as the number of seats in this ship 3 2 results and discussion 3 2 1 construction and validation of the surrogate model passenger response time parameters r 1 r 2 r 3 are in the ranges of 0 300 s and the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th degree legendre polynomial chaos expansion of assembly time are constructed to obtain its surrogate model regarding r 1 r 2 and r 3 the number of evaluation samples from the computer evacuation model pathfinder are respectively 7 19 39 87 and 135 by this proposed method as shown in fig 5 in order to validate the accuracy of the legendre expansions for assembly time validation set of assembly time is generated by running the computer evacuation model pathfinder with 100 lhs input samples of r 1 r 2 and r 3 and the variation ranges of r 1 r 2 and r 3 are 0 300 s afterwards the relative errors of assembly time from different degrees of legendre expansion are obtained as a result the characteristic parameters of the relative error of assembly time including the mean standard deviation the minimum and maximum value mare and rmsre are summarized in table 3 from table 3 it can be seen that the relative error of assembly time may be positive or negative therefore the mean value of relative error cannot fully represent the overall error of the model in table 3 the mare and rmsre of assembly time decrease with the increase of expansion degree which indicates that the accuracy of the legendre expansion model will increase with the increase of the expansion degree for the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th degree legendre expansion the mares of assembly time are larger than 0 15 and the rmsres of assembly time are larger than 0 10 thus the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th degree legendre expansion of assembly time cannot be used as the surrogate models besides the mare and rmsre of assembly time from the 5th degree polynomial chaos expansion are 0 13102 and 0 0588 smaller than 0 15 and 0 10 thus it can be seen that the 5th degree polynomial chaos expansion of assembly can be used as the surrogate model in this case fig 6 presents the frequency distribution histograms of the relative errors of assembly time from the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th polynomial chaos expansion fig 6 indicates that the variation range of the relative error of assembly time decreases with the increase of the expansion degree normal distribution is one of the most common distribution types thus a normal fit is adopted for the relative error data of assembly time the adjusted r 2 r 2 adj is used here to measure how well the normal distribution fit the data of the relative error of assembly time and the normal distribution fit perfectly the data when the value of r 2 adj is 1 0 according to the value of r 2 adj shown in fig 6 it can be found that the relative errors of assembly time follow approximately normal distributions especially for the 5th degree polynomial chaos expansion 3 2 2 optimization analysis of passenger response time parameters based on the 5th degree legendre expansion of assembly time the numerical optimization method ga is adopted to find the optimal and worst solutions of r 1 r 2 and r 3 the optimization results of r 1 r 2 and r 3 for s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 are presented in fig 7 fig 7 presents that r 3 are respectively 0 s and 300 s for the optimal and worst solutions which suggests that r 3 has a dominated effect on assembly time this can be accounted for that some passengers in seating zone on deck 3 evacuate to the assembly station on deck 1 whose average travel distance is the longest the optimal value of r 2 is obviously smaller than the worst value of r 2 due to a longer average travel distance required for passengers in bar zone on deck 2 evacuating to the assembly station on deck 1 passengers in bar zone on deck 1 are near to the assembly stations on deck 1 however the optimal value of r 1 does not approach to 0 s regardless of a smaller average evacuation distance the optimal and worst values of r 1 are more complex and the optimal value of r 1 may be larger than the worst value such as for s 1 and s 4 this can be explained that passengers in general area and locker zone on deck 1 are directly connected to the assembly stations on deck 1 and their passenger response time parameters are both set to be 0 s thus in order to relieve crowd congestions passengers in bar zone on deck 1 should evacuate in a certain delay time besides some passengers on decks 2 and 3 go through the bar zone on deck 1 to reach the assembly stations on deck 1 hence if the passenger response times in bar zone on deck 1 are not suitable passenger evacuation efficiency will be reduced rapidly in order to assess the accuracy of optimization results the corresponding assembly times are obtained by the 5th degree polynomial chaos expansion and the original computer evacuation simulation pathfinder and their relative errors are also calculated as shown in fig 8 from fig 8 a it can be seen that the absolute relative errors for the optimal and worst assembly times in s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 are smaller than 5 hence the optimization solutions of r 1 r 2 and r 3 can be regarded to be acceptable for s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 the relative errors of the optimal assembly time are negative for s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 and the estimated optimal assembly time should be increased about 5 in ship fire safety design the relative errors of the worst assembly time are positive for s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 which indicates that the predicted worst assembly time is larger than the exact value from the computer evacuation simulation thus the estimated worst assembly time in this case can be used directly in ship fire safety design meanwhile the optimal and worst assembly times for s 1 s 2 and s 3 are very similar and the worst assembly time for s 4 is obviously different from that for s 1 s 2 and s 3 this demonstrates that r 1 and r 2 have less effects on the optimization results of assembly time compared with r 3 optimization results on the response time parameters and the corresponding assembly times are summarized in the following tables 4 and 5 4 conclusions in order to devise an efficient issuance of passenger evacuation orders under ship fires a surrogate based optimization method combining the legendre polynomial chaos expansion and genetic algorithm has been developed to optimize passenger response time parameters at a reduced computational cost in this paper the maximum absolute relative error and root mean squared relative error are used to measure the accuracy of the surrogate model the proposed method is applied to evacuation analysis in a 3 storey passenger ship and optimization results are obtained for four different fire scenarios that involve typical fire source locations the following conclusions can be given 1 the legendre polynomial chaos expansion based optimization technique can be used to optimize passenger response time parameters whose computational efficiency is greatly improved compared with conventional numerical optimization methods meanwhile the accuracy of this method can satisfy the general requirement of engineering applications 2 the accuracy of the legendre polynomial chaos modelling of assembly time increases with the increase of the expansion degree and the relative error of assembly time follows the normal distribution the estimated assembly time corresponding to the optimal solution may be smaller which should be increased by about 5 in fire safety design of ships 3 for evacuation zone with the longest average travel distance passenger response time has a dominated role to the optimization results of assembly time which should be informed of the immediate evacuation however for evacuation zone with a short average travel distance passenger response times may have more complex effects on assembly time and the optimal passenger response time may be larger than the worst solution there are still some limitations in our work the effects of ship fire products on passenger evacuation have not been addressed quantitatively in addition there may be many response time parameters to be optimized especially for large cruise ships thus a high dimensional surrogate based optimization technique is required in the future work subsequently a higher demand for the sampling method and construction strategy of the surrogate model should be satisfied as well credit authorship contribution statement qimiao xie conceptualization methodology

21771,in order to reduce assembly time and improve the computational efficiency under ship fires a surrogate based optimization technique is proposed to estimate the optimal time of the issuance of evacuation orders which determines the passenger response times the legendre polynomial chaos expansion technique is employed to construct the surrogate model of passenger assembly time with response time parameters and validated with the original computer evacuation model the genetic algorithm ga is subsequently applied to find the optimal response time combination a 3 storey passenger ship is presented and four different fire scenarios that involve typical fire locations are considered to address the validity of this proposed method the results suggest that this proposed method can be used to determine the optimal and the worst response time parameters with a significantly reduced number of evaluation samples the relative error of assembly time from the surrogate model follows the normal distribution for evacuation zone with the longest average travel distance passengers should be informed of the immediate evacuation for evacuation zones with short average travel distances the optimal response time may be larger than the worst solution this work provides a new method to make a reasonable evacuation planning in ship fires keywords ship fires assembly time response time optimization surrogate model evacuation orders 1 introduction with the rapid development of cruise tourism more and more passenger ships has been constructed in recent years such as luxury cruise ships in passenger ships there is a large amount of combustible materials for decoration e g accommodation rooms the fire has been considered as a typical disaster for passenger ships for example a fire broke out on march 23 2006 on the star princess cruise ship causing 1 death and 9 injuries meanwhile 150 cabin rooms are seriously damaged in the middle of this ship as shown in fig 1 the duration from the initial notification of the fire to all passengers escaping to assembly stations is called as assembly time imo 2016 to ensure the safety of passengers passengers should evacuate quickly to one assembly stations under ship fires the time from the initial notification of the fire to the passenger beginning to move is called as response time imo 2016 which depends on the issuance of evacuation orders to efficiently evacuate the crowd phased evacuation strategy has been adopted in high rise buildings gravit et al 2018 similarly the optimization of the time of the issuance of evacuation orders is also of great importance to the improvement of evacuation efficiency under ship fires the international maritime organization imo has issued a series of evacuation analysis guidelines for passenger ships such as msc circ 909 imo 1999 msc circ 1033 imo 2002 msc 1 circ 1238 imo 2007 and msc 1 circ 1533 imo 2016 considering the effects of uncertain factors ping et al 2018 adopted a correction factor 1 25 to calculate crew evacuation time in an offshore platform xie et al 2020 adopted the polynomial chaos expansion method with nested sampling to quantify the uncertainty of passenger travel time under ship fires in recent decades a large amount of research has been conducted to investigate response time data galea et al 2011 2013 2014a 2014b and brown et al 2012 carried out full scale evacuation experiments in passenger ships passenger response times were collected and analyzed statistically which indicated that response times follow lognormal distributions in passenger ships lovreglio et al 2019 collected pre evacuation time data from 9 fire incidents and 103 evacuation drills in 16 countries and estimated the response time distributions in different occupancies moreover the relevant studies has been conducted and a large amount of pre movement time data were collected to develop the database of response time of building fires fahy and proulx 2001 gwynne et al 2003 shi et al 2009 brown et al 2012 besides deere et al 2006 suggested that the distribution of response time has a significant effect on evacuation time for passenger ships additionally phark et al 2018 adopted machine learning algorithm to analyze the issuance of emergency evacuation orders for chemical accidents and yi et al 2017 proposed a bi level programming model to optimize the issuance of evacuation orders under evolving hurricane conditions however the reasonable passenger response times by optimizing the time of the issuance of evacuation orders has not been addressed for passenger evacuation under ship fires what s more various mature numerical optimization methods have been proposed during the past decades which can be classified as deterministic and stochastic methods li and zheng 2017 genetic algorithm ga davis 1991 and particle swarm optimization pso eberhart and kennedy 1995 are two more common stochastic optimization algorithms however a great number of evaluation samples are required to find the optimal solution of the objective as a result it is computationally prohibitive to implement the optimization of passenger response time parameters by combining the time consuming computer evacuation model and traditional numerical optimization techniques in order to improve the computational efficiency of optimization analysis the surrogate model based optimization techniques have been developed during the recent decades such as the kriging based optimization model lee et al 2016 and radial basis function based optimization model zhang et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 polynomial chaos expansion was developed by wiener 1938 and has aroused much attention with respect to uncertainty quantification hadigol and doostan 2018 guo et al 2019 xie et al 2020 sensitivity analysis palar et al 2018 and prediction yaseen et al 2019 due to the efficient construction of the surrogate model as mentioned above the previous studies focused on the experimental collection of response time data and its effect on evacuation time to date only a handful of studies have investigated emergency evacuation orders yi et al 2017 phark et al 2018 while these findings cannot be directly applied in the optimization of passenger response time parameters polynomial chaos expansion is a widely used surrogate modelling method with a less evaluation samples thus to develop a reasonable emergency evacuation plan a polynomial chaos expansion based optimization method is proposed to search the optimal passenger response time combination under ship fires in this paper to deepen the understanding of the optimization of passenger evacuation orders under ship fires the surrogate model of passenger assembly time regarding response time parameters is firstly constructed using the legendre polynomial chaos expansion based on this surrogate model the optimal solution of passenger response time parameters can be calculated by the ga this work attempts to provide to a quantitative analysis method to optimize passenger response time parameters under ship fires which can facilitate to make an efficient evacuation plan of passengers the structure of the present study is presented as follows section 2 is devoted to an optimization method for passenger response time parameters under ship fires by combining the legendre polynomial chaos expansion and ga in section 3 the optimization of response time parameters is conducted and discussed in three different evacuation zones of a real ship finally some conclusions of the present work are summarized in section 4 2 optimization model on passenger response time parameters under ship fires a great amount of heat smoke toxic and irritant gases can be produced by the fire which may have significant effects on passenger evacuation under ship fires passengers may be subjected to skin and respiratory tract burns by the high temperature smoke and the passenger s evacuation ability may be impaired due to the presence of toxic gases salem 2016 besides visibility can be severely reduced by smoke particles which may result in the significant reduction of passenger speed thus in order to protect passengers from fire and smoke passengers are required to evacuate rapidly to assembly stations and then queue up for ships life saving appliances moreover based on a two zone fire model consolidated fire and smoke transport cfast salem 2016 adopted the fractional effective dose fed and fractional effective concentration fec methods to quantify the effects of fire products in ships on passenger evacuation the required safe assembly time without the quantitative effects of fire products is a critical parameter in the performance based fire safety design and assessment of passenger ships hence in this paper the effects of fire products on passengers are not analyzed quantitatively additionally passengers in fire zones are more vulnerable to being subjected to the potential harm of fire products thus priority should be given to the passengers in fire zones we assume that passengers in the fire zone evacuate immediately when the fire alarm device activates and passengers in non fire zones follow the instruction of evacuation orders without the effects of fire products moreover individual response times in each evacuation zone are assumed to be equal due to the issuance of evacuation orders meanwhile the simulation of a large scale crowd is more time consuming using complex and refined computer evacuation models to reduce the number of computationally intensive evacuation simulations in optimization analysis a surrogate based optimization method is proposed in this work the legendre expansion modelling is adopted to construct the surrogate model of assembly time with the response time parameters and then the conventional numerical optimization technique ga is used to find the optimal solution of response time parameters the detailed flowchart of passenger response time optimization method is presented in fig 2 2 1 determination of objective function and design space of response time parameters when a fire occurs in the ships all passengers on aboard should quickly evacuate to assembly stations therefore in this paper our objective function is assembly time and assembly time is affected by the passenger response time parameters which are regarded as design variables considering the issuance of evacuation orders individual response times in each evacuation zone are assumed to be equal passenger assembly time affected by response time parameters can be expressed as follows 1 t s f r 1 r 2 r n where t s is assembly time r 1 r 2 r n are passenger response time parameters for n different evacuation zones of passenger ships without the issuance of evacuation orders response time of each passenger is random which follows lognormal distributions in previous studies lovreglio et al 2019 for the night case individual response time is distributed in the range of 400 700 s and it is 0 300 s for the day case imo 2016 it can be found that the difference between the maximum and minimum value of individual response time are both 300 s for day and night cases therefore it can be assumed that for the issuance of evacuation orders the passenger response times in each evacuation zone are equal and distributed in the range of 0 300 s our aim is to minimize the objective function f r 1 r 2 r n subjected to the constraints of r 1 r 2 r n in the following equation 2 min r 1 r 2 r n f r 1 r 2 r n subjected to 3 0 r 1 r 2 r n 300 2 2 legendre polynomial chaos expansion of passenger assembly time according to the wiener chaos theory any stochastic variable with a finite second moment can be represented by a series expansion in orthogonal polynomials wiener 1938 the orthogonal polynomial set is dependent on the distribution of input stochastic variable for common stochastic variables the corresponding orthogonal polynomial functions are presented in table 1 for the optimization problem design variables are assumed to be uniformly distributed in their respective variation ranges according to table 1 legendre polynomial chaos expansion method is used to construct the surrogate model of assembly time with response time parameters as shown in equation 4 4 t s α 0 ψ 0 i 1 1 n α i 1 ψ 1 r i 1 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 α i 1 i 2 ψ 2 r i 1 r i 2 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 i 3 1 i 2 α i 1 i 2 i 3 ψ 3 r i 1 r i 2 r i 3 where α 0 α i 1 are polynomial chaos expansion coefficients r 1 r 2 r n are mutually independent response time variables which follow the uniform distribution in the range of 0 300 s ψ 0 ψ 1 are the multi dimensional legendre orthogonal polynomials of degrees 0 1 due to the independence of r 1 r 2 r n the multi dimensional legendre orthogonal polynomials can be obtained by the product of multiple one dimensional legendre polynomials for example ψ k r i 1 r i 2 r i k can be expressed by 5 ψ k r i 1 r i 2 r i k ψ m 1 r i 1 ψ m 2 r i 2 ψ m n r i k m 1 m 2 m k k 1 i 1 i 2 i k n where ψ m 1 ψ m 2 ψ m n are respectively the one dimensional legendre polynomials of degrees m 1 m 2 m n the classical legendre polynomials are orthogonal with regard to the interval 1 1 with the weighting function 1 0 and there is a recurrence formula for one dimensional legendre polynomials with a stochastic variable x i in the interval 1 1 arfken et al 2013 which can be expressed as 6 m 1 ψ m 1 x i 2 m 1 x i ψ m x i m ψ m 1 x i where 7 ψ 0 x i 1 ψ 1 x i x i given the total probability of each stochastic variable of 1 0 the shifted legendre polynomials are adopted herein which is orthogonal over an integration interval 0 1 with the weighting function 1 0 and the transformation formula of x i is as follows 8 t i x i 1 2 x i 1 1 thus 9 ψ m x i ψ m 2 t i 1 meanwhile the shifted legendre polynomials satisfy arfken et al 2013 10 0 1 ψ j t i ψ k t i d t i 1 2 k 1 δ j k δ j k 1 j k 0 j k where δ j k is the kronecker delta kundu et al 2016 in order to use equations 9 and 10 r 1 r 2 r n should be transformed by 11 t i r i 300 i 1 2 n thus equation 4 can be rewritten as 12 t s β 0 ψ 0 i 1 1 n β i 1 ψ 1 t i 1 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 β i 1 i 2 ψ 2 t i 1 t i 2 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 i 3 1 i 2 β i 1 i 2 i 3 ψ 3 t i 1 t i 2 t i 3 in order to calculate t s the expansion of equation 12 should be truncated to a certain degree for the d th degree polynomial chaos expansion the degree for each additive term of equation 12 should be less than or equal to d and t s can be expressed as 13 t s β 0 ψ 0 i 1 1 n β i 1 ψ 1 t i 1 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 β i 1 i 2 ψ 2 t i 1 t i 2 i 1 1 n i 2 1 i 1 i d 1 i d 1 β i 1 i 2 i d ψ d t i 1 t i 2 t i 3 t i d moreover the number of additive terms of equation 13 is 14 p n d n d where p is the number of additive terms 2 3 estimation of polynomial chaos expansion coefficients the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients β 0 β i 1 β i 1 i 2 β i 1 i 2 i d in equation 13 can be solved by the orthogonality of shifted legendre polynomials which is called as the projection method sudret 2008 according to the projection method β i 1 i 2 i k can be calculated as 15 β i 1 i 2 i k 0 1 0 1 0 1 t s ψ k t i 1 t i 2 t i k d t i 1 d t i 2 d t i k 0 1 0 1 0 1 ψ k t i 1 t i 2 t i k 2 d t i 1 d t i 2 d t i k due to the known form of shifted legendre polynomials and independent stochastic variables the denominator of equation 15 can be solved analytically based on equation 10 the numerator of equation 15 can be computed by the monte carlo simulation however due to its slower convergent rate a great number of evaluation samples are required which is computationally prohibitive for large scale passenger evacuation simulations under ship fires gauss quadrature is one of the most common numerical integration methods which can be adopted to approximate the values of integrals for shifted legendre polynomials by using less quadrature points for the univariate integral n g gauss points can exactly estimate the values of integrals for polynomials of degrees up to 2n g 1 fernandes and atchley 2006 the gauss legendre points at the quadrature level l are the roots of the legendre orthogonal polynomial of degree l and their weights can be obtained by the following equation bourquin 2015 16 ψ 0 t 1 ψ 0 t 2 ψ 0 t l ψ 1 t 1 ψ 1 t 2 ψ 1 t l ψ l 1 t 1 ψ l 1 t 2 ψ l 1 t l w 1 w 2 w l 0 1 ψ 0 t d t 0 1 ψ 1 t d t 0 1 ψ l 1 t d t where t 1 t 2 t l are gauss legendre points w 1 w 2 w l are the weights of t 1 t 2 t l however the gauss legendre quadrature points are unnested and evaluation samples are wasted for higher quadrature levels in order to solve this problem the nested quadrature schemes has been developed such as the kronrod patterson rule patterson 1968 for a uniformly distributed input variable according to the kronrod patterson rule the sequence of the numbers of nested quadrature points is given as follows 17 n k p 1 3 2 i 1 2 9 1 k p 1 2 i 9 where n kp is the sequence of the numbers of nested quadrature points using the kronrod patterson rule kp is the term number for nested quadrature points according to equation 17 it can be seen that the number of quadrature points increases fast with the term number thus petras 2003 proposed a delayed sequence i e quadrature points can be repeatedly used for some quadrature levels based on the work of petras 2003 for one uniformly distributed stochastic variable the number of delayed kronrod patterson quadrature points is 18 n d e l 1 3 3 7 7 7 15 15 15 15 15 15 d e l 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 where n del is the sequence of the numbers of delayed and nested quadrature points by the delayed kronrod patterson quadrature rule del is the term number for delayed and nested quadrature points for the delayed kronrod patterson quadrature rule the quadrature points and corresponding weights can also be available at http www sparse grids de moreover for the multiple dimensional quadratures the set of quadrature points is the combination of multiple univariate quadrature points i e full tensor product quadrature rule the number of quadrature points will show exponential growth with the number of dimensions thus the computational burden may be unaffordable for high or ultrahigh dimensional quadratures called as the curse of dimensionality eldred and burkardt 2009 for multi dimensional quadratures smolyak 1963 proposed a sparse grid technique to reduce the number of quadrature points from the full tensor product quadrature rule and the corresponding smolyak quadrature points are determined as follows ahlfeld et al 2016 19 q n l l 1 j l n q 1 j 1 q 2 j 2 q n j n j j 1 j 2 j n where q n l is the set of quadrature points for n dimensional stochastic variable t 1 t 2 t n at the quadrature level l q 1 j 1 q 2 j 2 q n j n are respectively the sets of quadrature points for t 1 t 2 t n at the quadrature levels j 1 j 2 j n the weights of smolyak quadrature points for multi dimensional integration can be calculated based on the weight of each univariate quadrature point which can be expressed as 20 w n l l 1 j l n l 1 l n j n 1 l n j k 1 n w k j k where w n l is the corresponding weight set for q n l w k j k is the weight set for q k i k thus the numerator of equation 15 can be rewritten by 21 0 1 0 1 0 1 t s ψ k t i 1 t i 2 t i k d t i 1 d t i 2 d t i k i 1 n d e l n l t s q i n l ψ k q i n l w i n l where n d e l n l is the number of n dimensional quadrature points at the quadrature level l t s q i n l is the exact value of assembly time at q i n l from the original computer evacuation model 2 4 the validation method of surrogate model once the legendre polynomial chaos expansion of assembly time is constructed its accuracy should be validated by the original evacuation model pathfinder is an agent based computer evacuation model thornton et al 2011 which is widely used for the crowd evacuation simulation thus assembly time from the simulation of pathfinder is used as the exact value and assembly time from the legendre polynomial chaos expansion is regarded as the estimated value afterwards the relative error of assembly time can be calculated obviously the validation sample set of assembly time should be reasonably selected latin hypercube sampling lhs is an efficient stratified sampling method which divides the distribution of each input variable into many non overlapping portions with equal probability mckay et al 1979 and then every portion is randomly sampled which makes that the samples can cover evenly its distribution thus assembly times from the simulations of the computer evacuation model pathfinder with the lhs input samples are used as validation set the root mean squared relative error rmsre and maximum absolute relative error mare can be respectively used to measure the overall and local accuracy of the model hence the rmsre and mare of assembly time are used to assess the error of the surrogate model which are respectively calculated by wang and shan 2007 22 rmsre 1 n i 1 n t s i t ˆ s i t s i 2 1 2 23 mare max t s i t ˆ s i t s i i 1 2 n where n is the number of validation samples t s i is the i th exact value of assembly time from the computer evacuation simulation t ˆ s i is the i th estimated value of assembly time from the surrogate model when the rmsre and mare of assembly time approach zero the surrogate model can provide near perfect estimation and close agreement with the original computer evacuation simulation generally if the absolute value of relative error of this surrogate model is less than 5 10 or 15 its accuracy can be considered to be acceptable for engineering applications cuesta et al 2016 in this paper the accuracy of surrogate model is acceptable when the mare and rmsre of assembly time are respectively smaller than 15 and 10 2 5 the ga based optimization method in this paper the surrogate model of assembly time is a linear combination of multi dimensional legendre polynomials with response time parameters thus based on the constructed surrogate model it is computationally inexpensive to adopt numerical optimization methods to determine the minimum value of assembly time and the corresponding optimal solution of response time parameters the ga is one of the popular stochastic optimization methods and its advantage is more likely to find the global optimal solution and avoid to be stuck in the local optimization lee et al 2016 therefore ga is adopted here to obtain the optimal response time solution due to the randomness of the ga optimal solutions may be different for repeated optimization process thus it is necessary to perform repeatedly the ga for many times to obtain a more reliable optimal design point in order to determine the optimal solution of passenger response time parameters the first optimal candidate solution can be obtained by performing the ga with the initial design point of passenger response time variables and then the first optimal candidate solution is used as the initial solution for the second optimization process and perform the second optimization process with the ga the iterative optimization process above is repeated at least 10 times until the optimal candidate solution is convergent the steps for the optimization of response time parameters with the aim of minimizing assembly time are presented in fig 3 3 case study and analysis 3 1 case description in order to illustrate how to use this proposed approach a real 3 storey passenger ship is presented in fig 4 there are 10 stairs 4 assembly stations and 6 kinds of different functional zones including seating zone general area bar zone locker zone restaurant zone and retail zone fig 4 presents that retail zone on deck 1 and restaurant zone on deck 2 are directly connected to assembly stations a and d which are less affected by the passengers in the other zones of this ship thus evacuation analysis of the passengers in restaurant and retail zones are not considered in this paper moreover general area on deck 1 is directly connected to assembly station b and locker zone on deck 1 is directly connected to assembly station c seating zone and general area on deck 2 are connected to assembly station d therefore the passengers in general area and locker zone on deck 1 as well as seating zone and general zone on deck 2 should evacuate immediately to relieve crowd congestion when the fire occurs in this ship i e passenger response times in these zones should be taken as 0 s moreover individual response times in each evacuation zone are assumed to be equal due to issuance of evacuation orders in this case optimized parameters are the passenger response times in bar zone on deck 1 bar zone on deck 2 and seating zone on deck 3 which are respectively denoted as r 1 r 2 and r 3 four different fire scenarios that involve typical fire source locations are considered here considering the hazard of fire products the passenger response time parameter in the fire zone is set to be 0 s and for non fire zones passenger response time parameters are set to be in the ranges of 0 300 s four fire scenarios with different design spaces are shown in table 2 according to the regulation on passenger load capacity from the imo imo 2015 passenger density of public zones is set to be 0 5 persons m2 and the number of passengers in seating zone is taken as the number of seats in this ship 3 2 results and discussion 3 2 1 construction and validation of the surrogate model passenger response time parameters r 1 r 2 r 3 are in the ranges of 0 300 s and the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th degree legendre polynomial chaos expansion of assembly time are constructed to obtain its surrogate model regarding r 1 r 2 and r 3 the number of evaluation samples from the computer evacuation model pathfinder are respectively 7 19 39 87 and 135 by this proposed method as shown in fig 5 in order to validate the accuracy of the legendre expansions for assembly time validation set of assembly time is generated by running the computer evacuation model pathfinder with 100 lhs input samples of r 1 r 2 and r 3 and the variation ranges of r 1 r 2 and r 3 are 0 300 s afterwards the relative errors of assembly time from different degrees of legendre expansion are obtained as a result the characteristic parameters of the relative error of assembly time including the mean standard deviation the minimum and maximum value mare and rmsre are summarized in table 3 from table 3 it can be seen that the relative error of assembly time may be positive or negative therefore the mean value of relative error cannot fully represent the overall error of the model in table 3 the mare and rmsre of assembly time decrease with the increase of expansion degree which indicates that the accuracy of the legendre expansion model will increase with the increase of the expansion degree for the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th degree legendre expansion the mares of assembly time are larger than 0 15 and the rmsres of assembly time are larger than 0 10 thus the 1st 2nd 3rd and 4th degree legendre expansion of assembly time cannot be used as the surrogate models besides the mare and rmsre of assembly time from the 5th degree polynomial chaos expansion are 0 13102 and 0 0588 smaller than 0 15 and 0 10 thus it can be seen that the 5th degree polynomial chaos expansion of assembly can be used as the surrogate model in this case fig 6 presents the frequency distribution histograms of the relative errors of assembly time from the 1st 2nd 3rd 4th and 5th polynomial chaos expansion fig 6 indicates that the variation range of the relative error of assembly time decreases with the increase of the expansion degree normal distribution is one of the most common distribution types thus a normal fit is adopted for the relative error data of assembly time the adjusted r 2 r 2 adj is used here to measure how well the normal distribution fit the data of the relative error of assembly time and the normal distribution fit perfectly the data when the value of r 2 adj is 1 0 according to the value of r 2 adj shown in fig 6 it can be found that the relative errors of assembly time follow approximately normal distributions especially for the 5th degree polynomial chaos expansion 3 2 2 optimization analysis of passenger response time parameters based on the 5th degree legendre expansion of assembly time the numerical optimization method ga is adopted to find the optimal and worst solutions of r 1 r 2 and r 3 the optimization results of r 1 r 2 and r 3 for s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 are presented in fig 7 fig 7 presents that r 3 are respectively 0 s and 300 s for the optimal and worst solutions which suggests that r 3 has a dominated effect on assembly time this can be accounted for that some passengers in seating zone on deck 3 evacuate to the assembly station on deck 1 whose average travel distance is the longest the optimal value of r 2 is obviously smaller than the worst value of r 2 due to a longer average travel distance required for passengers in bar zone on deck 2 evacuating to the assembly station on deck 1 passengers in bar zone on deck 1 are near to the assembly stations on deck 1 however the optimal value of r 1 does not approach to 0 s regardless of a smaller average evacuation distance the optimal and worst values of r 1 are more complex and the optimal value of r 1 may be larger than the worst value such as for s 1 and s 4 this can be explained that passengers in general area and locker zone on deck 1 are directly connected to the assembly stations on deck 1 and their passenger response time parameters are both set to be 0 s thus in order to relieve crowd congestions passengers in bar zone on deck 1 should evacuate in a certain delay time besides some passengers on decks 2 and 3 go through the bar zone on deck 1 to reach the assembly stations on deck 1 hence if the passenger response times in bar zone on deck 1 are not suitable passenger evacuation efficiency will be reduced rapidly in order to assess the accuracy of optimization results the corresponding assembly times are obtained by the 5th degree polynomial chaos expansion and the original computer evacuation simulation pathfinder and their relative errors are also calculated as shown in fig 8 from fig 8 a it can be seen that the absolute relative errors for the optimal and worst assembly times in s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 are smaller than 5 hence the optimization solutions of r 1 r 2 and r 3 can be regarded to be acceptable for s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 the relative errors of the optimal assembly time are negative for s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 and the estimated optimal assembly time should be increased about 5 in ship fire safety design the relative errors of the worst assembly time are positive for s 1 s 2 s 3 and s 4 which indicates that the predicted worst assembly time is larger than the exact value from the computer evacuation simulation thus the estimated worst assembly time in this case can be used directly in ship fire safety design meanwhile the optimal and worst assembly times for s 1 s 2 and s 3 are very similar and the worst assembly time for s 4 is obviously different from that for s 1 s 2 and s 3 this demonstrates that r 1 and r 2 have less effects on the optimization results of assembly time compared with r 3 optimization results on the response time parameters and the corresponding assembly times are summarized in the following tables 4 and 5 4 conclusions in order to devise an efficient issuance of passenger evacuation orders under ship fires a surrogate based optimization method combining the legendre polynomial chaos expansion and genetic algorithm has been developed to optimize passenger response time parameters at a reduced computational cost in this paper the maximum absolute relative error and root mean squared relative error are used to measure the accuracy of the surrogate model the proposed method is applied to evacuation analysis in a 3 storey passenger ship and optimization results are obtained for four different fire scenarios that involve typical fire source locations the following conclusions can be given 1 the legendre polynomial chaos expansion based optimization technique can be used to optimize passenger response time parameters whose computational efficiency is greatly improved compared with conventional numerical optimization methods meanwhile the accuracy of this method can satisfy the general requirement of engineering applications 2 the accuracy of the legendre polynomial chaos modelling of assembly time increases with the increase of the expansion degree and the relative error of assembly time follows the normal distribution the estimated assembly time corresponding to the optimal solution may be smaller which should be increased by about 5 in fire safety design of ships 3 for evacuation zone with the longest average travel distance passenger response time has a dominated role to the optimization results of assembly time which should be informed of the immediate evacuation however for evacuation zone with a short average travel distance passenger response times may have more complex effects on assembly time and the optimal passenger response time may be larger than the worst solution there are still some limitations in our work the effects of ship fire products on passenger evacuation have not been addressed quantitatively in addition there may be many response time parameters to be optimized especially for large cruise ships thus a high dimensional surrogate based optimization technique is required in the future work subsequently a higher demand for the sampling method and construction strategy of the surrogate model should be satisfied as well credit authorship contribution statement qimiao xie conceptualization methodology

21772,the interaction between cnoidal waves and a concentric cylindrical structure with an arc shaped outer wall has been investigated theoretically using eigenfunction expansion approach the arc shaped outer cylinder is permeable and thin protecting the porous dual cylinder structure three cylinders are surface piercing and rigidly installed on the flat bottom of an ocean analytical solutions were obtained based on the first approximation to cnoidal waves a series of linear equations pertaining to unknown coefficients were solved using matching boundary conditions hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders and the diffracted wave faces around the cylinders were evaluated and the effects of water depth annular spacing angle of incidence and structure configuration including the porosity parameter of the cylinders and the opening angle are illustrated via numerical results the numerical results obtained for limiting cases agreed well with published results for a solid cylinder the results indicated that the wave forces on the inner structure did not change significantly when the opening angle was greater than 2 π 3 the hydrodynamic loads on the inner cylinder of the concentric cylindrical structure were significantly lower than the wave force on a single cylinder moreover the value of wave force on the inner cylinder of a concentric dual cylinder structure with an arc shaped outer wall was similar to that on the inner cylinder of a concentric two cylinder system keywords cnoidal wave eigenfunction expansion approach wave forces wave diffraction arc shaped cylinder 1 introduction the hydrodynamic performance of linear water waves with a single vertical cylinder or groups of cylinders has been investigated for decades owing to engineering design requirements such as offshore platforms and coastline protection with further theoretical and experimental research many scholars have realised the importance of permeability for marine structures consequently buildings with permeable structures have been widely used in ocean engineering havelock 1940 initially studied the problem of plane water wave diffraction by an obstacle with vertical sides maccamy and fuchs 1954 investigated the same problem in an ideal fluid using diffraction theory spring and monkmeyer 1975 extended the study of maccamy and fuchs 1954 and presented an analytical solution for linear water waves acting on groups of vertical cylinders using eigenfunction expansion approach chwang 1983 proposed a porous wavemaker theory and discussed the importance of dimensionless porous and wave effect parameter subsequently chwang and li 1983 further developed the piston type porous wavemaker theory in a semi infinitely channel of still water depth based on a wide spacing assumption and using plane waves to replace scattered diverging waves mciver and evans 1984 presented an approximate method to estimate hydrodynamic loads on cylinder arrays this popular approach has been used by many researchers mciver 1984 abul azm and williams 1989 williams and rangappa 1994 darwiche et al 1994 williams and li 1998 based on the potential theory wang and ren 1994 performed theoretical investigations into the phenomenon where small amplitude waves passed through a concentric porous dual cylinder system they discovered that owing to the outer porous cylinder the hydrodynamic loads on the inner cylinder reduced significantly compared with those on single cylinder by a direct wave impact williams and li 2000 investigated linear water wave acting on an array of bottom mounted surface piercing porous cylinders and calculated the hydrodynamic loads on cylinders via eigenfunction expansion approach sankarbabu et al 2007 extended the studies of wang and ren 1994 and williams and li 2000 to study the interaction of linear water waves with an array of dual porous circular cylinders they discussed the effects of wave and structure parameters on wave loads and wave run ups based on small amplitude wave theory and structural response mandal et al 2013 performed the hydroelastic analysis between gravity waves and a concentric porous flexible cylinder system based on the linearised velocity potential and image theories zheng and zhang 2015 analysed the three dimensional wave diffraction of a linear water wave by a floating cylinder with a vertical wall in a finite water depth liu et al 2016 proposed an approach to study the problem of the linear water wave diffraction using a vertical cylinder of an arbitrary cross section subsequently disibuyuk et al 2017 presented an asymptotic method to investigate regular water waves acting on the same structure and the asymptotic results showed a good coherence with published numerical and experimental results qiao et al 2017 studied the scattering focusing hydrodynamics of linear waves propagating through a rectangular structure with floating cylinders and two vertical porous walls using analytical and experimental methods liu et al 2018 derived the velocity potential for regular waves interacting with a concentric porous cylinder of an arbitrary smooth section although a profound study regarding a cylinder of an arbitrary cross section has been conducted recently cylindrical and arc shaped structures are still primarily used in engineering building traditional type large resistant wave structures are expensive in actual ocean engineering therefore designing a cost effective structure for attenuating wave heights and dissipating wave energy is necessary miao et al 2005 developed an analytical method to study the interaction of linear water wave with a rigid thin impermeable and vertical arc shaped breakwater using eigenfunction expansion approach cheng et al 2007 extended the study of miao et al 2005 to investigate water waves propagating over an arc shaped porous breakwater via the same method they discovered that the porous effect parameter significantly affected the diffracted field duan et al 2012 analysed the sheltering effect of arc shaped floating porous breakwater and calculated the wave amplitude around the breakwater which was an extension of the study by cheng et al 2007 liu et al 2012 investigated the interaction between short crested waves and a combined cylinder system with dual arc shaped porous outer cylinders using the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem they examined the effects of the wave parameter and structural configuration on the wave loads liu and lin 2013 described wave diffraction using a concentric cylindrical structure with an arc shaped porous wall using the sbfem which was an extension of the study by tao et al 2009 based on the sbfem equation derived through a variation principle manner liu and lin 2012 extended their previous study to analyse wave diffractions from a concentric cylindrical system with two layered arc shaped porous walls on a sea bed based on linear wave theory chu et al 2014 analysed the problem of water waves acting on an arc shaped bottom mounted breakwater they calculated the wave surge pressure and wave amplitude with different model parameters the structure with an outer arc shaped cylinder can not only protect the inner body but also reduce construction costs therefore it should be further developed owing to its wide application prospect in offshore engineering however research on the interaction between shallow water waves and arc shaped structures is extremely limited many marine structures are located in shallow water areas therefore it is more appropriate to describe the interaction using cnoidal waves or solitary wave models based on numerous studies a better understanding and awareness of the interaction between shallow waves and cylinders or breakwater can be obtained as a pioneer in deriving analytical solutions isaacson 1977 1978 investigated cnoidal wave diffractions from a large vertical cylinder he calculated the hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder and wave run up around the cylinder subsequently isaacson 1983 studied solitary waves passing through a solid cylinder using a fourier integral transform for a first approximation henceforth high order nonlinear waves acting on a vertical cylinder have been discussed ohyama 1991 chian and ertekin 1992 yang and ertekin 1992 basmat and ziegler 1998 jiang and wang 1995 described the diffraction of shallow water waves by a vertical cylinder based on the generalised boussinesq numerical model subsequently wang and ren 1998 extended the study of jiang and wang 1995 to study the three dimensionless scattering of shallow waves by groups of cylinders they presented the temporal and spatial evolutions of cnoidal waves acting on a cylinder following the studies of isaacson 1983 wang and ren 1994 and zhong and wang 2006 analysed the effect of solitary waves on a concentric dual cylinder system using eigenfunction expansion approach song and tao 2007 employed a scaled boundary finite element model to study the short crested wave diffraction using a concentric cylindrical structure and obtained an analytical solution more recently weng et al 2016 solved the problem of cnoidal waves train by groups of vertical concentric porous cylinders using the finite element method to solve the boussinesq equation zhang and teng 2017 studied the problem of cnoidal wave run ups around a single cylinder neill and ertekin 2018 analysed the interaction between solitary waves and multiple in line surfacing bottom vertical cylinders they calculated the solitary waves hydrodynamic forces via the nonlinear green naghdi equation and the boussinesq equation xu et al 2019 reported a wave flume experiment for investigating the performance of solitary waves acting on a row of closely spaced large piles although the interaction between shallow waves and cylinder or cylinders arrays has been intensively studied the interaction between shallow waves and a cylinder system with an arc shaped cylinder has received limited attention herein the diffraction of cnoidal waves acting on a concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped wall is investigated theoretically using eigenfunction expansion and sub fluid region matching approach the hydrodynamic forces and diffraction wave free surface on the concentric cylindrical structure were calculated the effects of the opening angle structural porosity spacing between outer and inner cylinders and wave incidence angle on the hydrodynamic forces were considered meanwhile considering the wide application of the two cylinder structure the surface diffraction of different type water waves interacting with a concentric double cylinder system was analysed 2 formulation and solutions the idealised geometric layout of the two dimensional problem is shown in fig 1 a concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped cylinder was fixed in the water of finite depth d the outer cylinder and the middle cylinder were permeable and thin in thickness while the inner cylinder is a solid cylinder the radii of the outer arc shaped cylinder the middle cylinder and inner cylinder were a b and c respectively a cartesian coordinate system x y z was defined with the origin at the seabed and the z axis was directed vertically upwards through the inner cylindrical centre the plane z 0 was the sea bottom and z d the still water level the x axis was defined such that the outer arc shaped cylinder was located between θ α and θ 2 π α subsequently the corresponding open angle of the outer arc shaped cylinder was γ 2 π 2 α the concentric cylindrical system was subjected to a train of first order cnoidal waves with wave height h and frequency ω which propagated at an angle β to the positive x axis where β 0 represents normal wave incidence according to the structure of the cylinders the fluid domain was divided into three subregions see fig 1 ω 1 is the outer infinite region ω 2 is annular region between the outer and the middle cylinders ω 3 is annular region between the middle and the inner cylinders assume that the fluid in the ocean is inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational and affected by gravity therefore the flow can be described in terms of the velocity potential φ r θ z t suppose that the total wave potential φ φ i φ s r e ϕ r e ϕ i ϕ s where φ i the velocity potential of the incident wave φ s the velocity potential of the diffracted wave ϕ i is the spatial velocity potential of the incident wave and ϕ s the spatial velocity potential of the diffracted wave all the spatial velocity potentials must satisfy the laplace equation as follows 1 2 ϕ 2 ϕ i 2 ϕ s 0 the spatial velocity potentials must satisfy the boundary condition on the bottom of the sea meanwhile the spatial velocity potential ϕ must satisfy the boundary condition on the flat sea bottom yields 2 ϕ z ϕ i z ϕ s z 0 o n z 0 the spatial velocity potential must satisfy the kinematic and dynamic boundaries on the free

β 0 1 and β m 2 i m for m 1 j m is the bessel function of the first kind of order m k κ is the first kind of complete elliptic integrals κ is the modulus of the elliptic function and κ 2 1 κ 2 the modulus of κ can be determined by the following equation 6 κ 2 k 2 κ 3 π 2 h 4 k 2 d 3 when the incident angle is β the angle with a positive x direction the incident wave potential can be expressed

harmonic potential of the incident wave ω n n ω is the wave frequency and k n n k is the wave number furthermore ϕ i n is required to satisfy the relation ϕ i n x i k n ϕ i n 0 similarly based on first order diffraction theory the series ϕ s 0 n 1 ϕ s n 0 is used where ϕ s n 0 is assumed to be the n t h harmonic potential of the scattered wave the potential of the scattered wave away from the outer arc shaped cylinder must satisfy the radiation boundary condition as follows 8 lim r r 1 2 ϕ s n 0 r i k n ϕ s n 0 0 where the radial coordinate is r x 2 y 2 it is assumed that the total velocity potential is φ j φ i φ s j r e ϕ j in the corresponding fluid domain φ j j 1 2 3 based on eq 5 and applying eigenfunction expansion the following can be obtained as 9 ϕ 1 h g d k d n 1 a n i

of the present method to verify the derived analytical solution and detect the effects of structure parameters on the diffraction of cnoidal waves by the concentric cylindrical structure a computer program was developed using fortran the maximum wave force exerted on the outer cylinder the middle cylinder and the inner arc shaped cylinder are denoted by f 1 m a x f 2 m a x and f 3 m a x which were normalised by ρ g h a d ρ g h b d and ρ g h c d respectively in addition the wave parameter λ 4 κ 2 k κ 3 π 2 h k 2 d 3 is introduced to illustrate the possible effects of nonlinear characteristics caused by relative changes in wave eigenvalues and depths on the wave the results show that using the truncated numbers m 50 and n 50 in eqs 12 13 21 22 26 27 31 and 32 the calculated correlation coefficients can yield sufficient precision duan et al 2012 the present structure was transformed into a solid cylinder when parameters of γ 2 π g 1 0 a b c or γ 0 g 2 0 b c were used subsequently used the same parameters the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic forces on a vertical impermeable cylinder can be calculated as investigated by isaacson 1977 fig 2 shows that the present method is reliable based on comparison with published results of isaacson 1977 although this paper gives the mathematical formula of the interaction between waves and a concentric three cylinder structure considering the concentric two cylinder structures are prevalently used in coastal and ocean engineering for instance the dual cylindrical breakwater successful application in the nagashima port japan the ekofisk gravity offshore structure successful application in the north sea song and tao 2007 thus this paper mainly uses the following parameters to study the interaction between shallow water waves and the concentric structure i e g 1 1 g 2 1 b a 1 2 d a 1 5 c 0 β 0 γ 2 π 3 λ 10 the current three cylinder structure becomes a concentric two cylinder system with an arc shaped cylinder when c 0 4 numerical results and discussion 4 1 effect of incident angle the variation in the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic forces f 1 m a x ρ g h a d f 2 m a x ρ g h b d on the arc shaped outer cylinder and inner cylinder versus angle of the incident wave β is shown in figs 3 and 4 in the figures the wave forces are plotted as a function of the dimensionless wavenumber k a the wave force on the outer cylinder and inner cylinder increases first and then decreases as k a increases it is evident that the hydrodynamic force on the structure reaches a maximum at a low value of ka approximately 0 55 as β increases the wave load on the outer arc shaped cylinder decreases while the force on the inner cylinder increases which is similar to the observation of liu and lin 2013 the wave force on the cylinders experiences relatively small changes when β increases from 0 to π 6 however the wave force on the arc shaped outer cylinder and inner cylinder shows a more obvious decline and ascend when β increases from π 6 to π 3 this is primarily attributed to changes in the wave action range which results in the change in wave force on the outer arc shaped cylinder and inner cylinder the normal incidence β 0 corresponded to the largest and smallest wave forces on the outer arc shaped cylinder and inner cylinder therefore setting the incident angle β 0 as a characteristic parameters in the calculation is safer than using other incident angles in terms of engineering design 4 2 effect of opening angle of arc shaped cylinder in figs 5 and 6 the hydrodynamic forces f 1 m a x ρ g h a d f 2 m a x ρ g h b d for the arc shaped outer cylinder and the inner cylinder are plotted against the opening angle of the arc shaped cylinder γ for various values of β corresponding to k a 1 when γ π as the incident angle β increases the hydrodynamic force on the outer arc shaped cylinder decreases while the hydrodynamic force on the inner cylinder increases as γ increases the hydrodynamic force on the arc shaped cylinder increases until it reaches the maximum value while the load on the inner cylinder decreases until it reaches the minimum value it is note worthy that limiting value of the wave force occurs near γ 2 π 3 this observation is similar to the results of chu et al 2014 therefore applying γ 2 π 3 to investigate waves acting on the concentric cylindrical structure may be more appropriate than using other opening angles meanwhile when γ increases from 2 π 3 to 2 π the wave force oscillated slightly this is because water gushing occurs between the outer arc shaped cylinder and the inner cylinder when the opening angle γ 2 π 3 in fact the phenomenon of water gushing in the present structure is similar to that of a concentric cylinder system liu et al 2012 4 3 effect of porosity parameter figs 7 and 8 present the effects of porous coefficients g 1 and g 2 of the present structure on the maximum dimensionless wave forces f 1 m a x ρ g h a d f 2 m a x ρ g h b d as shown in fig 7 for a porous structure with g 1 g 2 1 as k a increases the wave forces on the outer cylinder first increase and then maintain a constant value at k a approximately is equal to 0 6 or higher the hydrodynamic forces on the outer cylinder decreases rapidly when the porous coefficients g 1 increases from 0 to 1 when g 2 rises from 0 to 1 the hydrodynamic forces show a similar trend for the inner cylinder in fig 8 as the porous coefficients g 1 g 2 increase from 1 to 3 the wave force on the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder changes in small amplitudes this is similar to the study of waves produced by a concentric two cylinder system conducted by zhong and wang 2006 and liu and lin 2013 it is worth noting that when g 1 g 2 0 the wave loads on the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder have sharp peaks at different values of k a which is mainly caused by resonance however the oscillations can be avoided by adapting the permeable structure with the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder such as g 1 g 2 1 2 or 3 additionally the safety factor and stability of the permeable structure decrease as the porous coefficient increases yueh et al 2018 therefore an appropriated porous coefficient must be put into consideration for engineering design 4 4 effect of spacing between the inner and outer cylinders figs 9 and 10 present the variation in the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic forces f 1 m a x ρ g h a d f 2 m a x ρ g h b d on the structure for the dimensionless wavenumber k a as shown the wave force on the outer and inner cylinders increases first and then decreases with the increase in k a as the radii ratio b a increased or the annular spacing decreased the wave force on the arc shaped outer cylinder did not change significantly this illustrated that the change in the radii ratio b a had a limited impact on the outer cylinder however the hydrodynamic force acting on the inner cylinder decreased significantly with the increase in k a when k a 0 8 this was also observed in short crested waves passing over a concentric cylindrical structure as reported by song and tao 2007 meanwhile the peak of the hydrodynamic force on the inner cylinder moved towards the left as b a increased additionally for the radii ratio b a 3 4 the wave force decreased rapidly when k a 2 3 this was due to the oscillatory nature of the wave force acting on the cylinders liu and lin 2012 in fact oscillating water waves in an annular space cause a slow destruction of the co axes of a two cylinder system therefore it is crucial to select a suitable distance between the inner and outer cylinders for safety in engineering 4 5 effect of wave parameter figs 11 13 present the variation of the dimensionless wave force on the outer middle and inner cylinders with the scattering parameter ka for different wave parameter λ with c b 1 2 it is shown that the wave force on the three cylinders increases with λ when ka is in the range from 0 to 0 6 as k a increases the wave force on the outer arc shaped cylinder initially increases and subsequently approaches a relatively stable value when λ 1 however when λ 1 the wave force on the outer arc shaped cylinder firstly increases until it reaches a maximum and then decreases gradually for the middle cylinder the wave force reaches a peak value at a smaller k a and the k a corresponding to the peak decreases with the increase in λ moreover the hydrodynamic load on the middle cylinder shows an apparent increase when λ increases from 1 to 5 while the wave force on the middle cylinder does not change much when λ rises from 5 to 10 another distinct observation is that the minimum wave force acting on the middle cylinder occurs around k a 2 6 when λ 1 when k a 1 5 the hydrodynamic loads on the inner cylinder increase gradually and shows an obvious oscillation as λ increases this is attributed to that the shallow water effect becomes more obvious as λ increases or water depth decreases 4 6 comparison with the case of a single solid cylinder and a concentric cylindrical system with the same centre and radius b a single solid cylinder or the inner cylinder of the concentric cylindrical system was placed at the same position as that of the inner cylinder of the concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped outer cylinder for the same relative parameters of g 1 1 and g 2 0 the comparison of wave forces f 2 m a x ρ g h b d is shown in fig 14 the results show that the dimensionless hydrodynamic wave force on the inner cylinder of the concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped porous outer cylinder is significantly less than that on a single solid cylinder and slightly larger than that on the inner cylinder of a concentric two cylinder system therefore setting an arc shaped porous outer cylinder in front of a single solid cylinder can effectively reduce the maximum dimensionless wave force acting on the latter and offers a close protective effect as that of the two cylinder system this means that engineering costs can be reduced significantly by adopting the current structure for a concentric cylindrical system the outer cylinder is regarded as a protective structure effective for reducing hydrodynamic forces acting on the main inner structure song and tao 2007 considering the importance of protecting marine facilities it is viable to use a concentric cylindrical system comprising of an inner cylinder and an arc shaped porous outer cylinder in engineering 4 7 surface elevation and corresponding profile it is interesting to study the changes in wave surface elevation in the vicinity of the concentric cylindrical system for varying porous coefficients g 1 and g 2 fig 15 presents the wave amplitude resulting from cnoidal waves acting on the structure at k a 1 to examine the effect of the porosities of the outer arc shaped cylinder and inner cylinder four cases were chosen a both the arc shaped outer cylinder and inner cylinder were impermeable g 1 0 g 2 0 b the arc shaped outer was impermeable while the inner cylinder was permeable g 1 0 g 2 1 c the arc shaped outer was permeable while the inner cylinder was impermeable g 1 1 g 2 0 d both the arc shaped outer cylinder and inner cylinder were permeable g 1 1 g 2 1 when the concentric cylindrical system was impermeable g 1 0 g 2 0 the diffracted wave surface was much more complex than the other cases when the concentric cylindrical system was permeable g 1 1 g 2 1 the amplitude of wave elevation in the front of the system was the lowest this was because the porous walls enabled part of the waves to penetrate duan et al 2012 as one would expect for g 1 1 g 2 1 the wave around the two cylinder system was lower compared to that of the solid two cylinder structure which was safer and more conducive for water circulation in both the outer and inner cylinders in addition comparing fig 15 b with c the areas protected by the outer porous cylinder were approximately 70 of outer impermeable cylinder s total area this can also be observed from the interaction between a linear water wave and a vertical arc shaped breakwater chu et al 2014 a series of analytical solutions of wave interactions with a concentric two cylinder system has been derived it is worth studying the interaction between different types of waves and a concentric cylindrical structure with impermeable or permeable inner cylinders when the opening angle of the arc shaped outer cylinder γ 2 π the present structure transforms into a concentric cylindrical system not only the numerical results of cnoidal wave surface distribution but also the results of small amplitude waves wang and ren 1994 and solitary waves zhong and wang 2006 are also shown in fig 16 under the same configuration parameters in this case g 1 1 g 2 0 and k a 1 compared with the structure with a porous inner cylinder the wave surface distribution is more complex when the inner is an impermeable cylinder for the three different incident waves moreover the elevation of the cnoidal wave is larger than that of the linear wave wang and ren 1994 and slightly smaller than that of the solitary wave zhong and wang 2006 meanwhile the corresponding free surface profiles along the centreline of the two cylinder system are shown in figs 17 and 18 in this case g 1 1 g 2 0 k a 1 and y 0 the amplitudes shown in figs 17 and 18 are dimensionless i e η h η and h represent the free surface elevation and the amplitude of the incident wave respectively the elevation of the cnoidal wave is approximately 50 larger than that of the linear wave and approximately 15 smaller than that of the solitary wave in the front wall of the outer cylinder however the elevation of the cnoidal wave is only approximately 10 larger than that of linear wave and approximately 30 smaller than that of the solitary wave in the back wall of the outer cylinder this means that considering the effects of solitary waves on the structure in the limiting case is more reliable than considering those of cnoidal wave and linear wave in marine engineering design in addition the damping decrease in the free surface elevation was slower and the value was lower when the inner cylinder was permeable g 2 1 thereby providing a more stable water surface for engineering works 5 conclusion herein the cnoidal wave diffraction around a concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped outer cylinder was analysed analytically using eigenfunction expansion and subfluid region matching method velocity potentials and unknown coefficients were determined meanwhile the maximum dimensionless wave forces and diffraction wave surface distribution were calculated the presented analytical solution was validated by comparing the hydrodynamic force with the published results for the case of a single cylinder the result indicated that the wave forces did not change significantly when the opening angle γ 2 π 3 for the normal incidence wave the arc shaped outer cylinder could effectively reduce the wave force and wave height around the inner cylinder compared with a single cylinder the wave height of the wave surface distribution damped more slowly when the outer and inner cylinders were permeable which was helpful for improving the safety and stability of the structure in addition the wave interaction with a concentric porous two cylinder system when γ 2 π was investigated by comparing the maximum dimensionless surface distribution elevation and corresponding profiles of the linear cnoidal and solitary waves the elevation of the cnoidal wave was larger than that of the linear wave and slightly lower than that of the solitary wave the present study provides useful insights for

21772,the interaction between cnoidal waves and a concentric cylindrical structure with an arc shaped outer wall has been investigated theoretically using eigenfunction expansion approach the arc shaped outer cylinder is permeable and thin protecting the porous dual cylinder structure three cylinders are surface piercing and rigidly installed on the flat bottom of an ocean analytical solutions were obtained based on the first approximation to cnoidal waves a series of linear equations pertaining to unknown coefficients were solved using matching boundary conditions hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders and the diffracted wave faces around the cylinders were evaluated and the effects of water depth annular spacing angle of incidence and structure configuration including the porosity parameter of the cylinders and the opening angle are illustrated via numerical results the numerical results obtained for limiting cases agreed well with published results for a solid cylinder the results indicated that the wave forces on the inner structure did not change significantly when the opening angle was greater than 2 π 3 the hydrodynamic loads on the inner cylinder of the concentric cylindrical structure were significantly lower than the wave force on a single cylinder moreover the value of wave force on the inner cylinder of a concentric dual cylinder structure with an arc shaped outer wall was similar to that on the inner cylinder of a concentric two cylinder system keywords cnoidal wave eigenfunction expansion approach wave forces wave diffraction arc shaped cylinder 1 introduction the hydrodynamic performance of linear water waves with a single vertical cylinder or groups of cylinders has been investigated for decades owing to engineering design requirements such as offshore platforms and coastline protection with further theoretical and experimental research many scholars have realised the importance of permeability for marine structures consequently buildings with permeable structures have been widely used in ocean engineering havelock 1940 initially studied the problem of plane water wave diffraction by an obstacle with vertical sides maccamy and fuchs 1954 investigated the same problem in an ideal fluid using diffraction theory spring and monkmeyer 1975 extended the study of maccamy and fuchs 1954 and presented an analytical solution for linear water waves acting on groups of vertical cylinders using eigenfunction expansion approach chwang 1983 proposed a porous wavemaker theory and discussed the importance of dimensionless porous and wave effect parameter subsequently chwang and li 1983 further developed the piston type porous wavemaker theory in a semi infinitely channel of still water depth based on a wide spacing assumption and using plane waves to replace scattered diverging waves mciver and evans 1984 presented an approximate method to estimate hydrodynamic loads on cylinder arrays this popular approach has been used by many researchers mciver 1984 abul azm and williams 1989 williams and rangappa 1994 darwiche et al 1994 williams and li 1998 based on the potential theory wang and ren 1994 performed theoretical investigations into the phenomenon where small amplitude waves passed through a concentric porous dual cylinder system they discovered that owing to the outer porous cylinder the hydrodynamic loads on the inner cylinder reduced significantly compared with those on single cylinder by a direct wave impact williams and li 2000 investigated linear water wave acting on an array of bottom mounted surface piercing porous cylinders and calculated the hydrodynamic loads on cylinders via eigenfunction expansion approach sankarbabu et al 2007 extended the studies of wang and ren 1994 and williams and li 2000 to study the interaction of linear water waves with an array of dual porous circular cylinders they discussed the effects of wave and structure parameters on wave loads and wave run ups based on small amplitude wave theory and structural response mandal et al 2013 performed the hydroelastic analysis between gravity waves and a concentric porous flexible cylinder system based on the linearised velocity potential and image theories zheng and zhang 2015 analysed the three dimensional wave diffraction of a linear water wave by a floating cylinder with a vertical wall in a finite water depth liu et al 2016 proposed an approach to study the problem of the linear water wave diffraction using a vertical cylinder of an arbitrary cross section subsequently disibuyuk et al 2017 presented an asymptotic method to investigate regular water waves acting on the same structure and the asymptotic results showed a good coherence with published numerical and experimental results qiao et al 2017 studied the scattering focusing hydrodynamics of linear waves propagating through a rectangular structure with floating cylinders and two vertical porous walls using analytical and experimental methods liu et al 2018 derived the velocity potential for regular waves interacting with a concentric porous cylinder of an arbitrary smooth section although a profound study regarding a cylinder of an arbitrary cross section has been conducted recently cylindrical and arc shaped structures are still primarily used in engineering building traditional type large resistant wave structures are expensive in actual ocean engineering therefore designing a cost effective structure for attenuating wave heights and dissipating wave energy is necessary miao et al 2005 developed an analytical method to study the interaction of linear water wave with a rigid thin impermeable and vertical arc shaped breakwater using eigenfunction expansion approach cheng et al 2007 extended the study of miao et al 2005 to investigate water waves propagating over an arc shaped porous breakwater via the same method they discovered that the porous effect parameter significantly affected the diffracted field duan et al 2012 analysed the sheltering effect of arc shaped floating porous breakwater and calculated the wave amplitude around the breakwater which was an extension of the study by cheng et al 2007 liu et al 2012 investigated the interaction between short crested waves and a combined cylinder system with dual arc shaped porous outer cylinders using the scaled boundary finite element method sbfem they examined the effects of the wave parameter and structural configuration on the wave loads liu and lin 2013 described wave diffraction using a concentric cylindrical structure with an arc shaped porous wall using the sbfem which was an extension of the study by tao et al 2009 based on the sbfem equation derived through a variation principle manner liu and lin 2012 extended their previous study to analyse wave diffractions from a concentric cylindrical system with two layered arc shaped porous walls on a sea bed based on linear wave theory chu et al 2014 analysed the problem of water waves acting on an arc shaped bottom mounted breakwater they calculated the wave surge pressure and wave amplitude with different model parameters the structure with an outer arc shaped cylinder can not only protect the inner body but also reduce construction costs therefore it should be further developed owing to its wide application prospect in offshore engineering however research on the interaction between shallow water waves and arc shaped structures is extremely limited many marine structures are located in shallow water areas therefore it is more appropriate to describe the interaction using cnoidal waves or solitary wave models based on numerous studies a better understanding and awareness of the interaction between shallow waves and cylinders or breakwater can be obtained as a pioneer in deriving analytical solutions isaacson 1977 1978 investigated cnoidal wave diffractions from a large vertical cylinder he calculated the hydrodynamic forces on a cylinder and wave run up around the cylinder subsequently isaacson 1983 studied solitary waves passing through a solid cylinder using a fourier integral transform for a first approximation henceforth high order nonlinear waves acting on a vertical cylinder have been discussed ohyama 1991 chian and ertekin 1992 yang and ertekin 1992 basmat and ziegler 1998 jiang and wang 1995 described the diffraction of shallow water waves by a vertical cylinder based on the generalised boussinesq numerical model subsequently wang and ren 1998 extended the study of jiang and wang 1995 to study the three dimensionless scattering of shallow waves by groups of cylinders they presented the temporal and spatial evolutions of cnoidal waves acting on a cylinder following the studies of isaacson 1983 wang and ren 1994 and zhong and wang 2006 analysed the effect of solitary waves on a concentric dual cylinder system using eigenfunction expansion approach song and tao 2007 employed a scaled boundary finite element model to study the short crested wave diffraction using a concentric cylindrical structure and obtained an analytical solution more recently weng et al 2016 solved the problem of cnoidal waves train by groups of vertical concentric porous cylinders using the finite element method to solve the boussinesq equation zhang and teng 2017 studied the problem of cnoidal wave run ups around a single cylinder neill and ertekin 2018 analysed the interaction between solitary waves and multiple in line surfacing bottom vertical cylinders they calculated the solitary waves hydrodynamic forces via the nonlinear green naghdi equation and the boussinesq equation xu et al 2019 reported a wave flume experiment for investigating the performance of solitary waves acting on a row of closely spaced large piles although the interaction between shallow waves and cylinder or cylinders arrays has been intensively studied the interaction between shallow waves and a cylinder system with an arc shaped cylinder has received limited attention herein the diffraction of cnoidal waves acting on a concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped wall is investigated theoretically using eigenfunction expansion and sub fluid region matching approach the hydrodynamic forces and diffraction wave free surface on the concentric cylindrical structure were calculated the effects of the opening angle structural porosity spacing between outer and inner cylinders and wave incidence angle on the hydrodynamic forces were considered meanwhile considering the wide application of the two cylinder structure the surface diffraction of different type water waves interacting with a concentric double cylinder system was analysed 2 formulation and solutions the idealised geometric layout of the two dimensional problem is shown in fig 1 a concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped cylinder was fixed in the water of finite depth d the outer cylinder and the middle cylinder were permeable and thin in thickness while the inner cylinder is a solid cylinder the radii of the outer arc shaped cylinder the middle cylinder and inner cylinder were a b and c respectively a cartesian coordinate system x y z was defined with the origin at the seabed and the z axis was directed vertically upwards through the inner cylindrical centre the plane z 0 was the sea bottom and z d the still water level the x axis was defined such that the outer arc shaped cylinder was located between θ α and θ 2 π α subsequently the corresponding open angle of the outer arc shaped cylinder was γ 2 π 2 α the concentric cylindrical system was subjected to a train of first order cnoidal waves with wave height h and frequency ω which propagated at an angle β to the positive x axis where β 0 represents normal wave incidence according to the structure of the cylinders the fluid domain was divided into three subregions see fig 1 ω 1 is the outer infinite region ω 2 is annular region between the outer and the middle cylinders ω 3 is annular region between the middle and the inner cylinders assume that the fluid in the ocean is inviscid and incompressible and the flow is irrotational and affected by gravity therefore the flow can be described in terms of the velocity potential φ r θ z t suppose that the total wave potential φ φ i φ s r e ϕ r e ϕ i ϕ s where φ i the velocity potential of the incident wave φ s the velocity potential of the diffracted wave ϕ i is the spatial velocity potential of the incident wave and ϕ s the spatial velocity potential of the diffracted wave all the spatial velocity potentials must satisfy the laplace equation as follows 1 2 ϕ 2 ϕ i 2 ϕ s 0 the spatial velocity potentials must satisfy the boundary condition on the bottom of the sea meanwhile the spatial velocity potential ϕ must satisfy the boundary condition on the flat sea bottom yields 2 ϕ z ϕ i z ϕ s z 0 o n z 0 the spatial velocity potential must satisfy the kinematic and dynamic boundaries on the free

of the present method to verify the derived analytical solution and detect the effects of structure parameters on the diffraction of cnoidal waves by the concentric cylindrical structure a computer program was developed using fortran the maximum wave force exerted on the outer cylinder the middle cylinder and the inner arc shaped cylinder are denoted by f 1 m a x f 2 m a x and f 3 m a x which were normalised by ρ g h a d ρ g h b d and ρ g h c d respectively in addition the wave parameter λ 4 κ 2 k κ 3 π 2 h k 2 d 3 is introduced to illustrate the possible effects of nonlinear characteristics caused by relative changes in wave eigenvalues and depths on the wave the results show that using the truncated numbers m 50 and n 50 in eqs 12 13 21 22 26 27 31 and 32 the calculated correlation coefficients can yield sufficient precision duan et al 2012 the present structure was transformed into a solid cylinder when parameters of γ 2 π g 1 0 a b c or γ 0 g 2 0 b c were used subsequently used the same parameters the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic forces on a vertical impermeable cylinder can be calculated as investigated by isaacson 1977 fig 2 shows that the present method is reliable based on comparison with published results of isaacson 1977 although this paper gives the mathematical formula of the interaction between waves and a concentric three cylinder structure considering the concentric two cylinder structures are prevalently used in coastal and ocean engineering for instance the dual cylindrical breakwater successful application in the nagashima port japan the ekofisk gravity offshore structure successful application in the north sea song and tao 2007 thus this paper mainly uses the following parameters to study the interaction between shallow water waves and the concentric structure i e g 1 1 g 2 1 b a 1 2 d a 1 5 c 0 β 0 γ 2 π 3 λ 10 the current three cylinder structure becomes a concentric two cylinder system with an arc shaped cylinder when c 0 4 numerical results and discussion 4 1 effect of incident angle the variation in the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic forces f 1 m a x ρ g h a d f 2 m a x ρ g h b d on the arc shaped outer cylinder and inner cylinder versus angle of the incident wave β is shown in figs 3 and 4 in the figures the wave forces are plotted as a function of the dimensionless wavenumber k a the wave force on the outer cylinder and inner cylinder increases first and then decreases as k a increases it is evident that the hydrodynamic force on the structure reaches a maximum at a low value of ka approximately 0 55 as β increases the wave load on the outer arc shaped cylinder decreases while the force on the inner cylinder increases which is similar to the observation of liu and lin 2013 the wave force on the cylinders experiences relatively small changes when β increases from 0 to π 6 however the wave force on the arc shaped outer cylinder and inner cylinder shows a more obvious decline and ascend when β increases from π 6 to π 3 this is primarily attributed to changes in the wave action range which results in the change in wave force on the outer arc shaped cylinder and inner cylinder the normal incidence β 0 corresponded to the largest and smallest wave forces on the outer arc shaped cylinder and inner cylinder therefore setting the incident angle β 0 as a characteristic parameters in the calculation is safer than using other incident angles in terms of engineering design 4 2 effect of opening angle of arc shaped cylinder in figs 5 and 6 the hydrodynamic forces f 1 m a x ρ g h a d f 2 m a x ρ g h b d for the arc shaped outer cylinder and the inner cylinder are plotted against the opening angle of the arc shaped cylinder γ for various values of β corresponding to k a 1 when γ π as the incident angle β increases the hydrodynamic force on the outer arc shaped cylinder decreases while the hydrodynamic force on the inner cylinder increases as γ increases the hydrodynamic force on the arc shaped cylinder increases until it reaches the maximum value while the load on the inner cylinder decreases until it reaches the minimum value it is note worthy that limiting value of the wave force occurs near γ 2 π 3 this observation is similar to the results of chu et al 2014 therefore applying γ 2 π 3 to investigate waves acting on the concentric cylindrical structure may be more appropriate than using other opening angles meanwhile when γ increases from 2 π 3 to 2 π the wave force oscillated slightly this is because water gushing occurs between the outer arc shaped cylinder and the inner cylinder when the opening angle γ 2 π 3 in fact the phenomenon of water gushing in the present structure is similar to that of a concentric cylinder system liu et al 2012 4 3 effect of porosity parameter figs 7 and 8 present the effects of porous coefficients g 1 and g 2 of the present structure on the maximum dimensionless wave forces f 1 m a x ρ g h a d f 2 m a x ρ g h b d as shown in fig 7 for a porous structure with g 1 g 2 1 as k a increases the wave forces on the outer cylinder first increase and then maintain a constant value at k a approximately is equal to 0 6 or higher the hydrodynamic forces on the outer cylinder decreases rapidly when the porous coefficients g 1 increases from 0 to 1 when g 2 rises from 0 to 1 the hydrodynamic forces show a similar trend for the inner cylinder in fig 8 as the porous coefficients g 1 g 2 increase from 1 to 3 the wave force on the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder changes in small amplitudes this is similar to the study of waves produced by a concentric two cylinder system conducted by zhong and wang 2006 and liu and lin 2013 it is worth noting that when g 1 g 2 0 the wave loads on the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder have sharp peaks at different values of k a which is mainly caused by resonance however the oscillations can be avoided by adapting the permeable structure with the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder such as g 1 g 2 1 2 or 3 additionally the safety factor and stability of the permeable structure decrease as the porous coefficient increases yueh et al 2018 therefore an appropriated porous coefficient must be put into consideration for engineering design 4 4 effect of spacing between the inner and outer cylinders figs 9 and 10 present the variation in the maximum dimensionless hydrodynamic forces f 1 m a x ρ g h a d f 2 m a x ρ g h b d on the structure for the dimensionless wavenumber k a as shown the wave force on the outer and inner cylinders increases first and then decreases with the increase in k a as the radii ratio b a increased or the annular spacing decreased the wave force on the arc shaped outer cylinder did not change significantly this illustrated that the change in the radii ratio b a had a limited impact on the outer cylinder however the hydrodynamic force acting on the inner cylinder decreased significantly with the increase in k a when k a 0 8 this was also observed in short crested waves passing over a concentric cylindrical structure as reported by song and tao 2007 meanwhile the peak of the hydrodynamic force on the inner cylinder moved towards the left as b a increased additionally for the radii ratio b a 3 4 the wave force decreased rapidly when k a 2 3 this was due to the oscillatory nature of the wave force acting on the cylinders liu and lin 2012 in fact oscillating water waves in an annular space cause a slow destruction of the co axes of a two cylinder system therefore it is crucial to select a suitable distance between the inner and outer cylinders for safety in engineering 4 5 effect of wave parameter figs 11 13 present the variation of the dimensionless wave force on the outer middle and inner cylinders with the scattering parameter ka for different wave parameter λ with c b 1 2 it is shown that the wave force on the three cylinders increases with λ when ka is in the range from 0 to 0 6 as k a increases the wave force on the outer arc shaped cylinder initially increases and subsequently approaches a relatively stable value when λ 1 however when λ 1 the wave force on the outer arc shaped cylinder firstly increases until it reaches a maximum and then decreases gradually for the middle cylinder the wave force reaches a peak value at a smaller k a and the k a corresponding to the peak decreases with the increase in λ moreover the hydrodynamic load on the middle cylinder shows an apparent increase when λ increases from 1 to 5 while the wave force on the middle cylinder does not change much when λ rises from 5 to 10 another distinct observation is that the minimum wave force acting on the middle cylinder occurs around k a 2 6 when λ 1 when k a 1 5 the hydrodynamic loads on the inner cylinder increase gradually and shows an obvious oscillation as λ increases this is attributed to that the shallow water effect becomes more obvious as λ increases or water depth decreases 4 6 comparison with the case of a single solid cylinder and a concentric cylindrical system with the same centre and radius b a single solid cylinder or the inner cylinder of the concentric cylindrical system was placed at the same position as that of the inner cylinder of the concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped outer cylinder for the same relative parameters of g 1 1 and g 2 0 the comparison of wave forces f 2 m a x ρ g h b d is shown in fig 14 the results show that the dimensionless hydrodynamic wave force on the inner cylinder of the concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped porous outer cylinder is significantly less than that on a single solid cylinder and slightly larger than that on the inner cylinder of a concentric two cylinder system therefore setting an arc shaped porous outer cylinder in front of a single solid cylinder can effectively reduce the maximum dimensionless wave force acting on the latter and offers a close protective effect as that of the two cylinder system this means that engineering costs can be reduced significantly by adopting the current structure for a concentric cylindrical system the outer cylinder is regarded as a protective structure effective for reducing hydrodynamic forces acting on the main inner structure song and tao 2007 considering the importance of protecting marine facilities it is viable to use a concentric cylindrical system comprising of an inner cylinder and an arc shaped porous outer cylinder in engineering 4 7 surface elevation and corresponding profile it is interesting to study the changes in wave surface elevation in the vicinity of the concentric cylindrical system for varying porous coefficients g 1 and g 2 fig 15 presents the wave amplitude resulting from cnoidal waves acting on the structure at k a 1 to examine the effect of the porosities of the outer arc shaped cylinder and inner cylinder four cases were chosen a both the arc shaped outer cylinder and inner cylinder were impermeable g 1 0 g 2 0 b the arc shaped outer was impermeable while the inner cylinder was permeable g 1 0 g 2 1 c the arc shaped outer was permeable while the inner cylinder was impermeable g 1 1 g 2 0 d both the arc shaped outer cylinder and inner cylinder were permeable g 1 1 g 2 1 when the concentric cylindrical system was impermeable g 1 0 g 2 0 the diffracted wave surface was much more complex than the other cases when the concentric cylindrical system was permeable g 1 1 g 2 1 the amplitude of wave elevation in the front of the system was the lowest this was because the porous walls enabled part of the waves to penetrate duan et al 2012 as one would expect for g 1 1 g 2 1 the wave around the two cylinder system was lower compared to that of the solid two cylinder structure which was safer and more conducive for water circulation in both the outer and inner cylinders in addition comparing fig 15 b with c the areas protected by the outer porous cylinder were approximately 70 of outer impermeable cylinder s total area this can also be observed from the interaction between a linear water wave and a vertical arc shaped breakwater chu et al 2014 a series of analytical solutions of wave interactions with a concentric two cylinder system has been derived it is worth studying the interaction between different types of waves and a concentric cylindrical structure with impermeable or permeable inner cylinders when the opening angle of the arc shaped outer cylinder γ 2 π the present structure transforms into a concentric cylindrical system not only the numerical results of cnoidal wave surface distribution but also the results of small amplitude waves wang and ren 1994 and solitary waves zhong and wang 2006 are also shown in fig 16 under the same configuration parameters in this case g 1 1 g 2 0 and k a 1 compared with the structure with a porous inner cylinder the wave surface distribution is more complex when the inner is an impermeable cylinder for the three different incident waves moreover the elevation of the cnoidal wave is larger than that of the linear wave wang and ren 1994 and slightly smaller than that of the solitary wave zhong and wang 2006 meanwhile the corresponding free surface profiles along the centreline of the two cylinder system are shown in figs 17 and 18 in this case g 1 1 g 2 0 k a 1 and y 0 the amplitudes shown in figs 17 and 18 are dimensionless i e η h η and h represent the free surface elevation and the amplitude of the incident wave respectively the elevation of the cnoidal wave is approximately 50 larger than that of the linear wave and approximately 15 smaller than that of the solitary wave in the front wall of the outer cylinder however the elevation of the cnoidal wave is only approximately 10 larger than that of linear wave and approximately 30 smaller than that of the solitary wave in the back wall of the outer cylinder this means that considering the effects of solitary waves on the structure in the limiting case is more reliable than considering those of cnoidal wave and linear wave in marine engineering design in addition the damping decrease in the free surface elevation was slower and the value was lower when the inner cylinder was permeable g 2 1 thereby providing a more stable water surface for engineering works 5 conclusion herein the cnoidal wave diffraction around a concentric cylindrical system with an arc shaped outer cylinder was analysed analytically using eigenfunction expansion and subfluid region matching method velocity potentials and unknown coefficients were determined meanwhile the maximum dimensionless wave forces and diffraction wave surface distribution were calculated the presented analytical solution was validated by comparing the hydrodynamic force with the published results for the case of a single cylinder the result indicated that the wave forces did not change significantly when the opening angle γ 2 π 3 for the normal incidence wave the arc shaped outer cylinder could effectively reduce the wave force and wave height around the inner cylinder compared with a single cylinder the wave height of the wave surface distribution damped more slowly when the outer and inner cylinders were permeable which was helpful for improving the safety and stability of the structure in addition the wave interaction with a concentric porous two cylinder system when γ 2 π was investigated by comparing the maximum dimensionless surface distribution elevation and corresponding profiles of the linear cnoidal and solitary waves the elevation of the cnoidal wave was larger than that of the linear wave and slightly lower than that of the solitary wave the present study provides useful insights for estimating the wave characteristics around a concentric cylindrical system and a theoretical basis for engineering design credit authorship contribution statement zhenfeng zhai validation formal

modeled and the effects of the geometry parameters on wave attenuation performances of the breakwaters are clarified the numerical results show that the performances of the breakwaters are greatly sensitive to the immersion depth in general the larger and lighter the breakwaters the better the performances will be meanwhile the dual rectangular breakwater performs the best in wave attenuations and its motions and forces are smaller than single breakwaters importantly combining the optimized parameters in each separated testing group is found to be effective to optimize the floating breakwaters keywords floating submerged box type breakwater wave structure interaction numerical simulation sph 1 introduction in the past few years many marine energy exploration structures e g offshore wind turbines and oil wells have been installed unfortunately these structures may be damaged by the violent waves floating breakwaters are therefore proposed to protect offshore structures with natural merits of construction economic and aesthetic in particular they are competitive in terrible seas with deep water depths large tidal ranges and poor seabed consequently they can be considered as alternatives to the traditional bottom mounted breakwaters floating breakwaters can be categorized into seven types based on their shapes respectively named as box type pontoon type frame type mat type tethered floating type horizontal plate type and the others dai et al 2018 among them the box type floating breakwaters have been extensively examined owing to their simple geometries e g macagno 1953 tay et al 2009 koutandos et al 2010 wang et al 2010 peng et al 2013 ren et al 2017 however the performances of box type floating breakwaters are meanwhile extremely restricted by their simple geometries to enhance the wave attenuation performances this type of breakwaters has to be produced of large sizes subsequently some researchers e g gesraha 2006 xia et al 2008 tang et al 2011 uzaki et al 2011 chen et al 2012 koraim and rageh 2013 huang et al 2014 behera and sahoo 2015 he et al 2017 yang et al 2018 qin et al 2019 have proposed several novel breakwaters to substitute box type breakwaters by changing the shapes of the breakwaters adding appending structures such as protruding plates mesh cages and trusses coupling breakwaters and wave energy converters and filling water into the breakwaters though these types of breakwaters perform better than the original box type breakwaters their geometries get more complex and the cost for productions and constructions becomes much more expensive resulting in limitations of real sea state applications as a result several researchers considered separating the box type floating breakwaters into pairs of identical parts which was more efficient than the original single box type ones with acceptable increase in production and construction cost williams and abul azm 1997 and williams et al 2000 analyzed a pontoon type floating breakwater consisting of a pair of floating cylinders connected by a rigid deck and the deck would stop the water flows subsequently hong et al 2002 studied the hydro elastic responses of a pontoon type breakwater which allowed water flows through its opening at the bottom of the structure then a numerical model developed by rahman et al 2006 based on the volume of fluid method was adopted to investigate the non linear dynamics of a pontoon type moored breakwater under waves similar to the work of williams and abul azm 1997 weng and chou 2007 also studied the behavior of a breakwater consisting of two pontoons connected by a rigid framework and moored on the seabed interestingly experiments on a single box type breakwater a dual box type breakwater and a board net type breakwater under regular waves with or without currents were carried out by dong et al 2008 in which they compared the transmitted wave coefficients of each type of breakwater most recently ji et al 2016 2017 investigated the performance of a novel cylindrical floating breakwater system by experiments which consisted of 10 cylindrical floating breakwater units and 10 mesh cages with balls in them connected by 18 connectors meanwhile ning et al 2017 studied a dual pontoon type floating breakwater numerically though there have been many papers on pontoon type or dual box type breakwaters systematic parametric studies and optimizations of these breakwaters have seldom been conducted and the differences between dual and single box type breakwaters with different shapes are also not clear in the above mentioned research potential flow theory and computational fluid dynamics cfd methods were adopted for numerical investigations of the floating breakwaters however potential flow theory could only deal with the irrotational fluids in addition the breakwaters are required to be fixed or with small motions in the potential flow theory which limits the utilizations in investigating floating breakwaters with complex geometries and violent motions compared with mesh based methods mesh free methods such as smoothed particles hydrodynamics sph with lagrangian perspective have nature merits of easily treating violent free surface flows large hydrodynamic loads and complex boundary conditions especially the fluid floating boundaries therefore in the past several years sph has been extensively adopted in ocean engineering and coastal engineering problems such as dam breaking crespo et al 2008 2015 yang et al 2016 sun et al 2019b wang et al 2019 wave slamming gao et al 2012 gotoh and khayyer 2016 wave structure interaction liu et al 2013 khayyer et al 2018a 2018c verbrugghe et al 2018 wen et al 2018d 2019 wave flume with porous media ren et al 2016 khayyer et al 2018b wen et al 2018c tsuruta et al 2019 wedge entry gong et al 2016 and breakwaters ren et al 2014a b wen et al 2016 ren et al 2017 liu et al 2019 liu and wang 2020 in the work of gotoh and khayyer 2018 the state of the art of particle methods as well as the latest advancements corresponding to stability accuracy and boundary conditions are reviewed for instance molteni and colagrossi 2009 proposed a diffusive term for continuity equation of sph however it doesn t keep the mass conservation during the simulations which has been affirmed and overcome by antuono et al 2012 and wen et al 2018b when using dynamic boundary conditions crespo et al 2007 to model the interfaces between fluid and solid structures unphysical gaps would occur between them which can be countered by using the semi analytical wall boundary condition ferrand et al 2013 2017 or improved dynamic boundary condition ren et al 2014a b furthermore the particle shifting algorithm pst sun et al 2019a dissipation properties of δ sph meringolo et al 2019 extension of δ sph for simulating vortex induced vibration sun et al 2019c are respectively introduced recently in this study sph especially dualsphysics crespo et al 2015 will be adopted which is a well known hardware accelerated software package for modeling free surface flows and in order to simulate the moored floating breakwaters the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn hall and goupee 2015 a solver for mooring system kinematics will also be implemented dominguez et al 2019 have first introduced the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn however it is seldom implemented and used to study floating breakwaters in summary even the single box type and dual box type floating breakwaters have been studied extensively the examinations of the differences between the floating breakwaters with different cross sections e g rectangle and circle and different numbers of boxes are still very limited systematic parametric studies and optimizations of those breakwaters are seldom carried out meanwhile whether it is possible to optimize the floating breakwaters by combining the optimized parameters in separated testing groups is still unclear therefore in this study four different typical submerged box type breakwaters are studied including a dual rectangular breakwater single rectangular breakwater dual circular breakwater and single circular breakwater as shown in fig 1 in which a and r d are width and radius of one part of dual rectangular and circular breakwaters respectively l indicates the spacing between the two parts b means the immersion depth h is the height of rectangular breakwaters r represents the radius of circular breakwaters and ρ is the density those breakwaters are moored onto the seabed with tension leg mooring systems the effects of the above listed geometry parameters on wave attenuation performances motions fluid forces and mooring tensions are systematically studied through 88 sph simulations a sphm model is developed by coupling dualsphysics and moordyn for those simulations the reflected wave coefficient k r transmitted wave coefficient k t and dissipated wave coefficient k d are adopted to evaluate the efficiencies of the breakwaters besides the motions of the breakwaters are quantitatively described using response amplitude operator rao and fast fourier transform fft is used to handle the time series of fluid forces and mooring tensions interestingly the velocity fields surrounding the breakwaters are also visualized for clarifying the mechanisms of them finally breakwaters with optimized parameters in each testing group are simulated to check whether those cases are more efficient and can reach better performances than the best ones in each group 2 numerical methods the coupling between dualsphysics crespo et al 2015 and moordyn hall and goupee 2015 is implemented in this study obtaining coupled sphm model which will be validated against existed experiments in section 3 and is used to examine the wave attenuation performance and hydrodynamics of the four breakwaters in section 4 technically discretized n s equations are utilized to describe the dynamics of the fluid with a state equation used to enforce the water flows to be incompressible the diffusive term for the continuity equation proposed by molteni and colagrossi 2009 is applied to reduce the density fluctuations resulted by the stiff density field and the natural disordering of the lagrangian perspective in addition to counter the anisotropic particle spacing in sph a particle shifting algorithm proposed by xu et al 2009 and first created for incompressible sph by vacondio et al 2013 is also used dynamic boundary conditions crespo et al 2007 are utilized to describe the interfaces between the fluids and boundaries when dealing with fluid driven moored floating bodies the fluid forces acting on the breakwater are evaluated by summing up the interaction forces of each boundary particle exerted by the neighboring fluid particles the reaction forces of the mooring system are calculated using lumped mass approach and then the motions of the moored breakwaters can be determined using the newton s second law the wave maker can be modeled as moving boundaries with predefined motions and active wave absorptions in dualsphysics damping zone is implemented to eliminate the effects of the reflected waves the details of the sph method and the additional technologies i e particle shifting algorithm fluid driven floating body and the diffusive term for the continuity equation can be found in the paper of crespo et al 2015 and the major formulations of sph and implementation of coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn are presented in the following subsections 2 1 sph governing equations in sph fluid is discretized into a set of independent material particles with original physical properties of density and mass maintained the discretized n s equations are locally integrated at the locations of each particle meanwhile the motions of the fluid particles are governed by a momentum equation and mass continuity equation as follows crespo et al 2015 1 d v i d t j m j p j p i ρ j ρ i π i j i w i j g 2 d ρ i d t j m j v i j i w i j where v represents the velocity of the particles ρ is the density p denotes the water pressure g means the gravitational acceleration m indicates the mass of the particles and in the above equations the subscript i denotes the target particle while j represents the neighboring particles within the support domain of the target particle fig 2 sketches the target particle neighboring particle and support domain w is the smoothed kernel function and a quantic kernel suggested by wendland 1995 is adopted in this study and π denotes the artificial viscosity which is used to substitute the real viscosity of fluid providing shear viscosities for the water flows and meanwhile ensuring the numerical integration stability the w and π can be expressed as 3 w r r α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 w h e n 0 q 2 4 π i j α c i j μ i j ρ i j w h e n v i j r i j 0 0 w h e n v i j r i j 0 in which q r r is the non dimensional distances between the target particle and the neighboring ones with r and r as the real distance and the smoothed length respectively α d 7 4 π r 2 when the simulation is two dimensional as shown in fig 2 kr is the radius of support domain in which k 2 meanwhile c i j 0 5 c i c j in eq 4 is the mean speed of sound μ i j r v i j r i j r i j 2 η 2 in which η 2 0 01 r 2 v i j v i v j and r i j r i r j with v k and r k as the position and velocity of the particle k respectively and α 0 01 is adopted altomare et al 2015 to enforce the water flows to be closely incompressible it is required that small changes in density would result in large changes in pressure thus a state equation batchelor 1974 monaghan et al 1999 is added to describe the relationship between pressure and density as follow 5 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ in which γ 7 and ρ 0 1000 k g m 3 is the reference density as well c 0 denotes the speed of sound and can be calculated using the following expression 6 c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 where c 0 should be at least ten times faster than the maximum fluid velocity to keep the density variations theoretically less than 1 and to force the water flows to be incompressible 2 2 dynamic boundary condition and wave making the dynamic boundary condition dbc proposed by crespo et al 2007 is utilized to describe the interfaces between fluid and solid boundaries the boundary particles are governed by the same equations as those of the fluid ones which are impervious owing to the limitations of eq 5 however they would not move according to the quantities calculated instead they will remain their fixed positions i e fixed boundaries or move according to a predefined motion i e moving boundaries on the basis of dbc wave maker can be modeled as moving boundaries whose motions are predefined according to the second order wave generation theory madsen 1971 first the wave maker stroke s 0 can be determined by 7 h s 0 2 s i n h 2 k d s i n h k d c o s h k d k d where h denotes the wave height d means the water depth and k 2π l is the wave number in which l is the wave length subsequently the time series e 0 t of the wave maker motions can be expressed as 8 e 0 t s 0 2 s i n ω t δ h 2 32 d 3 c o s h k d s i n h 3 k d 2 m 1 s i n 2 ω t 2 δ in which ω 2π t with t as the wave period δ is the initial phase and m 1 h s 0 besides active wave absorption techniques provided by dualsphysics have been utilized then the wave maker position at t dt is corrected using the following expression 9 e 0 t d t e 0 t u c t d t u c t d t 2 where u c is the corrected wave maker velocity and can be computed as u c t d t u i t u r t with u i and u r respectively as the theoretical velocity and the velocity correction to absorb the reflected waves u i t ω s 0 2 c o s ω t δ and u r t η s p h t η i t g d η s p h and η i are respectively the measured wave elevation in front of the wave maker and the target incident wave elevation besides there are also new active techniques such as relaxation zone altomare et al 2018 and non reflective wave makers ren et al 2014a b wen and ren 2018 2 3 passive wave absorption damping zone is implemented as passive wave absorption system to reduce the effects of the reflected waves within which the velocity of the fluid particles reduces at each time step according to their locations in the zone with quadratic decay then the velocity is modified by 10 v v 0 1 δ t β r x x 0 x 1 x 0 2 where v 0 is the initial velocity of the particles at the entry of the zone v is the final velocity δ t denotes the time step in sph x means the locations of the particles with x 0 and x 1 as the initial and final positions of the damping zone respectively the reduction coefficient β r controls the modifications on the particle velocity at each time step and 10 is adopted in this study which is recommended by dualsphysics 2 4 lumped mass approach the floating breakwaters are moored by chains with two ends named as anchor and fairlead as shown in fig 3 a the cable dynamics illustrated in fig 3 b and c are resolved using lumped mass approach hall and goupee 2015 technically the mooring chains or cables are first divided into n m evenly sized line segments connecting n m 1 nodes as indicated in fig 3 b the index starts from the anchor with the node numbered as 0 and ends at the fairlead with the node numbered as n m the cable segment between nodes i and i 1 is numbered as i 1 2 meanwhile the forces on the cable contain internal axial tension damping force weight buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces determined by morison s equation as exhibited in fig 3 c the forces from the contact with the seabed are neglected for the tension leg mooring systems after that the accelerations of each node can be calculated by solving the force equilibrium equation finally the resultant forces and torques of the mooring systems acting on floating breakwaters can be calculated as f m and t m respectively 2 5 coupled sphm model the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn is implemented in this study the sph program mainly consists of three main parts which are the generation of the neighbor lists whose sizes are the same with the radius of support domain calculation of continuum and momentum equations for each particle and updating of the physical quantities at the next time step the mooring system solver is compiled to be a dynamically linked library dll and is called by sph program the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn follows a loose coupling arrangement for details in each time step of sph the fluid forces on the floating breakwater are calculated by summing up the interaction forces of each surrounding fluid particle after that sph program transmits the position and velocity of floating breakwater into the mooring model followed by the solution of the kinematics of mooring system and mooring line motions subsequently the reaction forces by the mooring system exerting on the breakwaters are transmitted back to the sph program and added with the fluid forces obtaining the total external forces of the breakwaters finally the motions of the floating breakwaters can be calculated by using the newton s second law of motion innovatively it was found that numerical oscillations would occur for the calculated quantities of the particles at the beginning of the simulation which resulted in numerical oscillations of the computed velocity and acceleration of the floating breakwater those were extremely larger than the real ones and passing them into moordyn would cause termination of the calculation owing to that the floating breakwater moved out of the computational field under the distorted predicted mooring forces consequently a time interval between starting the sph simulation and importing moordyn was recommended which was 1 0 s of sph simulation in this study other implementation of coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn can be found in the paper of dominguez et al 2019 fig 4 illustrates the whole flow chart of sphm model in this study 3 validation of the sphm model 3 1 experiment description the sphm model is validated against the experiments conducted by peng et al 2013 which deal with the interactions between regular waves and moored submerged box type floating breakwaters the experiments were performed in a 2d water flume with length l flume 30 m width of 0 7 m and depth of 0 9 m as indicated in fig 5 a piston type wave maker was located at left side of the water flume and at the right side a rubble mound made wave absorber was set up to reduce the effects of reflected waves a submerged box type floating breakwater of width 2a 0 40 m height h 0 15 m and density ρ 700 kg m 3 was located at a distance of l w 18 5 m far away from the wave maker there was only 2 cm gap left between the floating breakwater and lateral walls of the water flume ensuring that these experiments can be simulated in 2d mode peng et al 2013 the mass and moment of inertia of the breakwater were 28 6 kg and 0 435 kg m2 respectively the tension leg mooring system consisted of four mooring chains which were carefully arranged to ensure a good symmetry along with x and y directions where the mooring cables were anchored to the seabed with a 60 inclination at the initial moment the immersion depth of the top deck b was 0 102 m two wave conditions were examined i e t 0 8 s h 0 030 m and t 1 0 s h 0 046 m resulting in wave lengths l 0 998 m and 1 538 m respectively gauges 1 4 were four measuring points used for water elevation recording and the arrangements are displayed in fig 5 subsequently the numerical geometry in sphm model is adjusted as indicated in fig 5 the water flume length l flume changes to 7 2 m and the distance between the wave maker and breakwater l w 2 95 m with the other parameters remain the same as those in the experiment as well the length of the damping zone is 2 3 m assuming that the center of mass of the breakwater is the origin the x positive and z positive respectively rightwards and upwards subsequently the fairleads of the mooring chains 1 and 2 are respectively located at 0 20 m 0 075 m and 0 20 m 0 075 m and the anchors of the mooring chains 1 and 2 are respectively located at 0 40 m 0 423 m and 0 40 m 0 423 m the lengths of the mooring chains are 0 40 m ensuring that the equilibrium position of the breakwater in numerical model exhibits little difference with the experimental one 3 2 convergent tests and representative parameters a series of convergent tests are carried out before the simulations which examine the effects of the size of the particles d p 0 1 0 05 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 m time step size of sph δ t 5 10 4 1 10 4 6 10 5 4 10 5 and 2 10 5 s segments of the mooring lines n m 2 3 4 5 and 6 and time step size of mooring solver δ t m 2 10 5 1 10 5 5 10 6 2 10 6 and 1 10 6 s on the numerical results the motions of the floating breakwater under waves with t 1 0 s and h 0 046 m are compared for identifying the convergences of these parameters fig 6 presents the motion series of the breakwaters in the convergent tests from which it is observed that in general the size of the particles greatly affects the numerical results in the test on d p the motion amplitudes become bigger as the d p gets smaller with more evident double crests observed in single one cycle of the heave motion meanwhile owing to the changes of the generated particles visible phase difference occurs between the motion series with different d p however which is not observed from the other tests for the simulations with d p 0 01 m and 0 005 m the motion series of the breakwaters is mostly coincided with each other indicating convergence at this moment thus d p 0 01 m is adopted in this study for compromising between computational time and accuracy subsequently in the tests on the time step of sph the motion amplitudes are observed to increase as the δ t gets smaller and converge after δ t is approximately 4 10 5 s the segments of the mooring lines as well as the time step in the mooring solver exhibit random effects on the numerical results as shown in fig 6 c and d it can be found that the convergent points are hard to be determined for n m and δ t m fortunately the effects made by them are small enough to be neglected thus the n m and δ t m are empirically specified as 5 and 2 10 6 s respectively then in the present sph the time step size δ t is 4 10 5 s the size of the particles d p equals to 0 01 m with a total number of 42 368 particles generated including 868 fixed particles 200 moving particles 744 floating particles and 40 556 fluid particles the smoothed length r is set to be 1 5d p a quantic kernel function and symplectic integration algorithm are adopted artificial viscosity is used to substitute the real viscosity of water flows and the coefficient α 0 01 in the mooring system the cables are equally divided into 5 segments with diameter d and mass per unit length m l of the mooring lines are 0 001 m and 0 001 kg m 1 respectively thus the total gravity of the mooring chains is negligibly smaller than the net buoyancy of the modeled floating breakwater at the initial moment in addition to prevent the mooring lines from stretching large cable stiffness k cable 4 105 n m 1 is utilized the time step for modeling the dynamics of the mooring lines δ t m is 2 10 6 s to improve the computational efficiency the codes have been developed based on cuda toolkits by dualsphysics and run with gpu acceleration the gpu card involved in this study is nvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti the representative parameters and the computing device configuration are summarized in table 1 and table 2 respectively 3 3 numerical results fig 7 shows the time series of the water surface elevations recorded at gauges 1 4 it can be found that at the seaside the incoming waves make the water surface to move as a simple harmonic and somewhere are strengthened due to the reflected waves for example wave height at gauge 2 is 1 22 times as high as the incoming wave height when t 0 8 s at the leeside the wave amplitudes decrease sharply owing to the wave attenuation by the breakwater at the same time the water surface shows a non linear profile with steepened wave crests and flattened wave troughs which can be identified in both sphm and experimental results in particular when t 1 0 s the results indicate that the waves break over the breakwater which results in wave decompositions and higher harmonics at the leeside however complex wave profiles with double crests on the leeward are not reproduced adequately in sphm simulations the secondary peaks and troughs are smaller than those of experimental results it may result by the over damping force against higher harmonics of artificial viscosity as mentioned in the paper of ren et al 2017 overall water surface elevations in sphm show satisfactory agreements with the experimental ones and sphm model can be utilized in the simulations of floating breakwaters there are no experimental results for the motions of the breakwater under waves of t 0 8 s h 0 030 m in the paper of peng et al 2013 thus only the comparisons of motions of the breakwater under the waves of t 1 0 s h 0 046 m are shown in fig 8 the rotations are positive in counter clockwise when the wave peaks act on the breakwater it moves down and right first then comes back to the equilibrium position as well when the wave troughs act on the breakwater it moves down and left first then comes back to the equilibrium position again this explains why there are two troughs and crests in heave component during single one cycle the secondary troughs in heave component of sphm are a little flatter than those of the experiment in general the sphm shows satisfactory agreements with experiments for the breakwater motions fig 9 shows the time series of onshore and offshore mooring tensions corresponding to mooring chain 2 and 1 respectively owing to the double crests phenomenon occurred in heave motion the time series of mooring tensions also has double crests and troughs in single one cycle however the secondary troughs in heave motion are not reproduced adequately resulting in that the secondary troughs of mooring tensions are flatter than those of the experiment in general the mooring tensions exhibit satisfactory agreements with the experimental ones from figs 7 9 it can be said that the coupled sphm model can be used to simulate the floating breakwaters and give correct predictions of wave elevations breakwater motions fluid forces and mooring tensions the numerical results satisfactorily agree with the experimental ones though there are no turbulence models applied in addition liu et al 2019 dominguez et al 2019 and liu and wang 2020 have carried out simulations on moored floating breakwaters using sph without turbulence models involved thus turbulence models are neglected in this study to reduce computational cost and to handle massive cases 4 results and discussions a systematic study on the comparison between four kinds of breakwaters dual rectangular breakwater single rectangular breakwater dual circular breakwater and single circular breakwater is carried out to explore their wave attenuation performances and hydrodynamics which includes the examinations of the effects of width of single part of the dual rectangular breakwater a radius of single part of the dual circular breakwater r d radius of the single circular breakwater r the spacing between the two parts l the immersion depth b the height of rectangular breakwater h and the density ρ as shown in fig 1 for the dual circular and rectangular breakwaters the two parts of them are assumed to be connected by trusses which allow fluid particles to flow freely between the two parts and have small impacts on the water flows consequently in the 2d numerical models of sph the trusses are neglected and the two parts of dual breakwaters are modeled as one rigid floating body in dualsphysics a total of 88 numerical simulations are carried out to meet the topic of this study the case name and settings are listed in table 3 in order to make these four kinds of breakwater comparable the used material remains the same as each other the wave maker on the left side produces regular waves with t 1 0 s and h 0 046 m and the results will be analyzed against non dimensional parameters such as a l r l b h h h etc finally four optimized breakwaters will be derived from the numerical results of the parametric studies by combining the optimized parameters in separated testing group and those breakwaters will be also simulated to evaluate the breakwaters in a quantitative way the reflected wave coefficient k r transmitted wave coefficient k t and dissipated wave coefficient k d are calculated for each case in particular k r means the ratio of reflected wave height to the incoming wave height and k t represents the ratio of transmitted wave height to the incident wave height and k d is the square root of energy proportion converted into other type of energy i e internal energy and kinetic energy of the breakwater and the mooring system based on the energy conservation of the incoming wave a balanced relationship can be set up as 11 e i e r e t e d in which e i is the incoming wave energy e r e t and e d represent the reflected wave energy transmitted wave energy and dissipated wave energy respectively by dividing e i on both sides of the equation following the relationship of wave energy and wave height e h 2 a formula containing k r k t and k d can be expressed as 12 k r 2 k t 2 k d 2 1 the reflected wave height at the seaside is calculated using the two point method put forward by goda and suzuki 1976 also the fast fourier transform fft is carried out to analyze the synthetic waves at the leeside after that k r k t and k d can be determined for the evaluation of the performance of the breakwaters k t as the ratio of transmitted wave height to the incident wave height is the key parameter besides the motions of the breakwaters are investigated since the simulations are restricted as two dimensional only the amplitudes in three directions i e surge a surge heave a heave and pitch a pitch are calculated the response amplitude operators raos of surge a surge a i heave a heave a i and pitch a pitch ka i with a i as the incoming wave height are applied for the discussions of the breakwaters motions fft is also used to analyze the time series of fluid forces and mooring tensions 4 1 parametric studies 4 1 1 effects of breakwater width or radius fig 10 presents the wave coefficients as a function of a r and r d for the cases a1 5 a1 5 r1 6 and r1 9 it is observed that for dual rectangular breakwaters the reflected wave coefficient falls down first and then rises as a increases with a minimum value of 0 14 at a l 0 13 as for the single rectangular breakwaters the reflected wave coefficient always moves up as a gets larger and is greater than those of the dual rectangular breakwaters for transmitted wave coefficient as shown in fig 10 b both the dual rectangular and the single rectangular breakwaters exhibit downtrends with increasing a indicating that the longer the breakwater the better the performances will be assuming that breakwaters with k t 0 5 are effective a l 0 125 and 0 136 can be interpolated as shown in fig 10 b for dual rectangular and single rectangular breakwaters respectively in addition as illustrated in fig 10 c the dissipated wave energy portion of breakwaters grows as a becomes bigger additionally for the circular breakwaters the radius results in slight changes in k r k t and k d with small improvement in wave attenuation observed in fig 10 b therefore the bigger the circular breakwaters the better the performances will be however the transmitted wave coefficients of single circular breakwaters are bigger than those of the rests and r d l 0 152 is interpolated for dual circular breakwater ensuring k t 0 5 which is bigger than those of rectangular breakwaters meanwhile the reflected wave coefficients of circular breakwaters are almost smaller than those of the rectangular breakwater indicating that the former can hardly reflect ocean waves the surge heave and pitch raos of rectangular and circular breakwaters as a function of a r and r d are shown in fig 11 a c it is observed that all the three raos for the dual rectangular breakwaters and circular breakwaters decrease as a increases therefore it can also be inferred that the smaller the dual rectangular and circular breakwaters the more violent the motions will be on the contrary the surge and heave raos for the single rectangular breakwater rise with oscillations while the pitch rao deceases when a increases it is obvious that the motions of the single rectangular breakwaters are much bigger than those of the rests and the motions of the dual circular breakwaters are the smallest the possible explanation is that the circular breakwaters are curved so the fluid particles can escape along the surfaces resulting in smaller exciting forces furthermore the dual box type breakwaters have bigger lateral stiffness and rotational stiffness thus resulting in smaller motions fig 12 presents the fluid forces and mooring tensions of the breakwaters as a function of a r and r d from which it can be seen that as the width and radius of rectangular and circular breakwaters increase the fluid forces and mooring tensions almost roughly exhibit uptrends except for the fluid force and offshore mooring tension of dual rectangular breakwater consequently it can be said that the bigger the breakwaters the higher the fluid forces and mooring tensions will be meanwhile these forces i e fluid forces and mooring tensions of the rectangular breakwaters are greater than those of the circular breakwaters and ones of the single breakwaters are greater than those of the dual breakwaters from figs 11 and 12 it can be seen that as the width or radius increase the motions of the breakwaters reduce and the forces increase indicating that there should negative correlations between motions and forces in order to show the fundamental differences between these four kinds of breakwaters the instantaneous flow fields around the breakwaters under case a5 a5 r6 and r9 at different moments are drawn in figs 13 16 respectively the selections of those cases for plotting are from the consideration that those four cases show the largest differences between the wave coefficients it can be directly observed that the fluid velocity near the water surface is bigger and decreases as the depth increases and that near the single breakwaters are much bigger than that near the dual ones with the motions of the latter are more peaceful at the seaside the fluid velocity of the single rectangular breakwater is greatly bigger than that of the rests owing to the reflected waves as observed in fig 10 a at the leeside fluid velocity for the dual breakwaters seems to be smaller than that of the corresponding single breakwaters meanwhile which mainly moves laterally resulting in small wave amplitudes the possible reason is that the heave and pitch motions of the dual breakwaters are greatly reduced thus it can be said that dual breakwaters are with features of rectification of the water flows for the dual breakwaters it is evident that the incoming waves are attenuated twice as propagating with violent flows and vortices occur around the structure dissipating the wave energy into thermal energy 4 1 2 effects of spacing of dual breakwaters the wave coefficients of dual and single breakwaters for cases l1 5 l1 lr1 5 and lr1 are shown in fig 17 it is observed that as the spacing between the two breakwaters gets wider k r and k t rise first before they fall down and k r approximately converges to 0 16 for the dual rectangular breakwater when l a 1 5 the dual rectangular breakwater performs worse than the single one as shown in fig 17 b with inverse being true when l a 1 5 and similar trends observed for circular breakwaters however the variations of k t as a function of l are negligible fig 17 a shows the reflected wave coefficients from which it can be seen that k r increases first and then decreases and that of circular ones is smaller resulted by the escaping of the fluid particles along the curved surface the evident difference between the reflected waves may explain that the wave attenuation performance of rectangular breakwaters is better than that of the circular breakwaters fig 17 c illustrates the dissipated wave coefficients and k d decreases first and then rises for both rectangular and circular breakwaters as the spacing gets wider k d gradually converges to 0 92 considering the fact that the transmitted wave coefficient is the most important parameter determining the performance of the breakwater and k t here is found to be nearly independent with l thus the flow fields will not be provided the surge heave and pitch raos of the breakwaters as a function of l are plotted in fig 18 notably as the spacing of the breakwaters increases the motions of the breakwaters will become gentler and gradually converge to nearly zero the reason is probably that as the spacing gets wider the inertia of moment and lateral stiffness of the breakwaters increase thus the motions of the dual breakwaters are limited the motions of the circular breakwaters are smaller than those of the rectangular breakwaters owing to the particles escaping mentioned above the fluid forces and mooring tensions as a function of l are sketched in fig 19 as the spacing between the two parts of the dual breakwaters increases the motions of the breakwaters fluid forces and mooring tensions all decrease implying that there are positive correlations between the motions and forces this finding is different with that in subsection 4 1 1 which means that the motions and forces are not directly dependent with each other and are affected by many factors such as width and spacing meanwhile similar with fig 12 the forces of single breakwaters are greater than those of dual breakwaters and ones of rectangular breakwaters are greater than those of circular breakwaters 4 1 3 effects of immersion depth fig 20 shows the wave coefficients of the dual and single breakwaters as a function of immersion depth for single rectangular and single circular breakwaters k r and k d show similar trends which rise first and then fall down the incoming waves are almost reflected by the dual rectangular breakwater which is located at the water surface for the dual breakwaters k r always fall down with increasing b and k d rises first and then falls down the maximum k d closes to 0 95 denoting nearly 90 of the wave energy dissipated as for k t the same trends of decreasing first and then increasing are observed for all four kinds of breakwaters implying that as the immersion depth increases the wave attenuation performance gets better first and then worse the optimum values occur at b 0 03 m 0 03m 0 05m and 0 08 m for the dual rectangular breakwater dual circular breakwater single circular breakwater and single rectangular breakwater respectively therefore it can be safely said that the dual breakwaters should be installed with small immersion depth and the single rectangular breakwaters can be adopted with bigger immersion depth with the single circular breakwater within them the k t of dual rectangular breakwater is found to have the smallest value when b 0 03 m seen from fig 20 b the wave attenuation performance of the breakwaters is sensitive to the immersion depth which should be the key parameter in the design of these kinds of breakwaters the motions of the single breakwaters become violent first before they recede as the immersion depth increases as shown in fig 21 however for the dual breakwaters the motions of the breakwater show nearly monotone decreasing as a function of the immersion depth after b h 1 74 raos of surge heave and pitch components become almost constants indicating that the motions of dual breakwaters can hardly be affected by the immersion depth as immersion depth increases the forces and mooring tensions of single breakwaters in fig 22 almost exhibit similar trends of increasing first and then decreasing and those of dual breakwaters are hardly affected by the immersion depth the changes of forces and motions are similar with each other when in small immersion depth cases the breakwaters may move out of the water surface resulting in relative small fluid forces and small motions as the immersion depth increases all the wave forces act on the breakwaters thus the fluid forces and motions increase as the immersion depth continuously increases the wave forces decrease resulting in smaller fluid forces and motions from figs 12 and 19 and 22 it can be found that the offshore mooring tensions are greater than the onshore mooring tensions thus the offshore mooring line should be well designed ensuring its safety and stability as has been found from fig 20 b that k t has both minimum and maximum as immersion depth changes with large variation observed the velocity fields of water flows surrounding b2 and b6 b1 and b4 br2 and br6 as well as br3 and br6 are drawn in figs 23 30 respectively for the breakwaters with local best performances the transmitted waves are smaller than those of the corresponding breakwaters with local worst performances with both smaller wave velocity and amplitudes at the leeside there are some similarities for the velocity fields of the well performed breakwaters such as for dual breakwaters the fluid velocity near the part at the seaside is greatly bigger than that near the part at the leeside for the single breakwaters the fluid velocity near the surface at the seaside is greatly bigger than that near the surface at the leeside thus it can be inferred that the part of a well designed breakwater at the seaside primarily attenuates the waves and should be designed effectively specifically asymmetrical breakwaters can be considered for economics interestingly on the leeside of the dual breakwaters with small immersion depth see figs 23 and 25 the high speed water particles impact on the breakwater resulting in some particles move much faster than the neighboring particles generating wave breakings which becomes invisible as the immersion depth gets larger however those phenomenon are not adequately produced by sph simulations which maybe resulted by the ignorance of air phase in the numerical model sun et al 2019d studied the effects of air phase on the numerical simulation of wave interactions with structures when wave peaks impact with the structures air bubbles would generate between the waves and the seaside surface of the breakwaters which would help the waves break as the propagation of the waves negative air pressure would generate on the top surface of the breakwaters which helps the waves overtop onto the top surface owing to the ignorance of air phase the waves seems stable in the numerical simulations however it costs too much computational time for two phase simulation and the validation indicates satisfactory agreements between experimental and numerical results thus air phase is neglected in this study as a compromising between computational time and accuracy it is known that the waves mainly propagate in a limited depth beneath the water surface and which is classified into a top layer middle layer and bottom layer according to the colors of the fluid velocity in figs 23 30 subsequently it can be said that dual breakwaters should be located in top layer and single breakwaters should be located in middle layer to obtain well performances 4 1 4 effects of breakwater height wave coefficients for dual and single breakwaters as a function of h r and r d are shown in fig 31 when h increases for the single rectangular breakwater the reflected wave energy will have no apparent changes but the dissipated wave energy portion will increase which results in a slight improvement in the single rectangular breakwater as illustrated in fig 31 b in addition k r k t and k d of the rest breakwaters show very small difference when the height or radius of the breakwater changes thus for saving the material thinner dual rectangular breakwater and smaller single or dual circular breakwaters can be adopted with little effects on the wave attenuation performance raos in surge heave and pitch components are displayed in fig 32 it is clear that as the breakwater gets higher and bigger raos decrease slightly except for the heave component of the single rectangular breakwater meanwhile the fluid forces and mooring tensions shown in fig 33 almost increase as the sizes of the breakwater increases the bigger the breakwaters the higher the forces will be however the increase in size will increase the moment of inertia and stiffness of the breakwaters consequently the motions of the breakwaters decrease meanwhile the larger the breakwater the better the performances will be in general it is safe to say that the wave coefficients motions of the breakwaters and forces are insensitive to the changes in the height or radius of the breakwaters 4 1 5 effects of breakwater density fig 34 presents the wave coefficients for dual and single breakwaters as a function of density higher density variations between transmission medium and reflection medium often result in a larger reflected coefficient as shown in fig 34 a as well for dual rectangular breakwaters k r and k d fall while k t rises as increasing the breakwater density for circular breakwaters k r changes slightly and k d decreases as density increases resulting in the increase of k t therefore it can be deduced that the higher the density the worse the wave attenuation performance will be fig 35 illustrates the comparisons of raos between dual and single breakwaters while changing the density it is known that when the forces are fixed the heavier the breakwater the smaller the motions will be this can also be observed in fig 35 a c except for the heave component of the single rectangular breakwaters for the fluid forces and mooring tensions shown in fig 36 except for the forces of single rectangular breakwater the forces of the rests exhibit small dependence on breakwater density the forces of single rectangular breakwater show fluctuations during the changes of density it can be said that the forces can hardly affected by the breakwater density meanwhile the offshore mooring tensions are greater than the onshore ones 4 2 optimized breakwaters from the separated testing groups in section 4 1 it can be summarized as follows the performances motions and forces are significantly sensitive to the width or radius and immersion depth of the breakwaters as the immersion depth increases the performances of the breakwaters get better first and then worse and the motions and forces increase first and then decrease however the performances motions and forces are insensitive to the spacing height and density of the breakwaters in general the larger wider and lighter the breakwaters are the better the performances will be the motions and forces of single breakwaters are commonly greater than those of the dual ones and the motions and forces of rectangular breakwaters are greater than those of the circular ones meanwhile the offshore mooring tensions are greater than the onshore mooring tensions there are no evident relationships between performances motions and forces however dual rectangular breakwater exhibits not only good performances but also has small motions and forces in order to clarify whether it is possible to optimize the floating breakwaters by combining the optimized parameters in the separated testing group four breakwaters with the geometry parameters being the combinations of the optimized parameters in each separated group are designed as listed in table 4 the numerical results are listed in table 5 meanwhile the minimum k t of the typical breakwaters in the separated studies k t min are also shown in table 5 it can be clearly seen that the optimized breakwaters perform better than the corresponding best breakwaters in all the separated cases especially for the dual rectangular breakwater with nearly 65 of improvement in wave attenuations and this is also the best among the four kinds of breakwaters therefore it is possible to determine the parameters separately and combine the optimized parameters to obtain well designed breakwaters in addition it is also found that following the dual rectangular breakwater single circular breakwater is better than the rests and the single rectangular one is the worst this implies that for single rectangular breakwater splitting the structure into two parts is effective but which is not true for single circular breakwaters 5 conclusions in this study the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn is implemented and the obtained coupled model is utilized to investigate four typical submerged floating breakwaters the effects of the geometry parameters are clarified and the performances motions and forces of these breakwaters are compared the question whether it is possible to optimize the floating breakwaters by using separated testing group is clarified following summarized the conclusions 1 the circular breakwaters reflect less portion of the incoming waves than the rectangular breakwaters owing to the particle escaping along the curved surface which also results in smaller motions and forces of the circular breakwaters 2 the optimized dual rectangular breakwater performs greatly better in wave attenuations than the others meanwhile its motions fluid forces and mooring tensions are smaller than those of single breakwaters 3 the wave attenuation performances of the breakwaters show large sensitivity to the immersion depth and dual breakwaters should be located near the free water surface while single breakwaters should be located with larger immersion depth 4 the wave attenuation performances of the breakwaters are insensitive to the size and density of the breakwaters however in general the larger and lighter the breakwaters the better the wave attenuation performances will be 5 the motions and forces of single breakwaters are greater than those of the dual breakwaters and the motions and forces of rectangular breakwaters are greater than those of the circular breakwaters meanwhile offshore mooring tensions generally bigger than the onshore mooring tensions 6 importantly optimizing the geometry parameters separately and combining them together to obtain well designed breakwaters is found to be effective credit authorship contribution statement zhenqing liu conceptualization methodology resources supervision project

21773,box type floating breakwaters have been studied extensively however the examinations of the performances of them with different shapes or different numbers of boxes are limited in addition if it is possible to optimize the floating breakwaters by combining the optimized parameters in separated testing groups is still unclear consequently in this study four typical box type floating breakwaters i e dual rectangular breakwater single rectangular breakwater dual circular breakwater and single circular breakwater are selected to do extensive investigations using sph the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn is implemented and verified and the coupled code can be applied to simulate the interactions between waves and moored floating structures a total of 88 cases are modeled and the effects of the geometry parameters on wave attenuation performances of the breakwaters are clarified the numerical results show that the performances of the breakwaters are greatly sensitive to the immersion depth in general the larger and lighter the breakwaters the better the performances will be meanwhile the dual rectangular breakwater performs the best in wave attenuations and its motions and forces are smaller than single breakwaters importantly combining the optimized parameters in each separated testing group is found to be effective to optimize the floating breakwaters keywords floating submerged box type breakwater wave structure interaction numerical simulation sph 1 introduction in the past few years many marine energy exploration structures e g offshore wind turbines and oil wells have been installed unfortunately these structures may be damaged by the violent waves floating breakwaters are therefore proposed to protect offshore structures with natural merits of construction economic and aesthetic in particular they are competitive in terrible seas with deep water depths large tidal ranges and poor seabed consequently they can be considered as alternatives to the traditional bottom mounted breakwaters floating breakwaters can be categorized into seven types based on their shapes respectively named as box type pontoon type frame type mat type tethered floating type horizontal plate type and the others dai et al 2018 among them the box type floating breakwaters have been extensively examined owing to their simple geometries e g macagno 1953 tay et al 2009 koutandos et al 2010 wang et al 2010 peng et al 2013 ren et al 2017 however the performances of box type floating breakwaters are meanwhile extremely restricted by their simple geometries to enhance the wave attenuation performances this type of breakwaters has to be produced of large sizes subsequently some researchers e g gesraha 2006 xia et al 2008 tang et al 2011 uzaki et al 2011 chen et al 2012 koraim and rageh 2013 huang et al 2014 behera and sahoo 2015 he et al 2017 yang et al 2018 qin et al 2019 have proposed several novel breakwaters to substitute box type breakwaters by changing the shapes of the breakwaters adding appending structures such as protruding plates mesh cages and trusses coupling breakwaters and wave energy converters and filling water into the breakwaters though these types of breakwaters perform better than the original box type breakwaters their geometries get more complex and the cost for productions and constructions becomes much more expensive resulting in limitations of real sea state applications as a result several researchers considered separating the box type floating breakwaters into pairs of identical parts which was more efficient than the original single box type ones with acceptable increase in production and construction cost williams and abul azm 1997 and williams et al 2000 analyzed a pontoon type floating breakwater consisting of a pair of floating cylinders connected by a rigid deck and the deck would stop the water flows subsequently hong et al 2002 studied the hydro elastic responses of a pontoon type breakwater which allowed water flows through its opening at the bottom of the structure then a numerical model developed by rahman et al 2006 based on the volume of fluid method was adopted to investigate the non linear dynamics of a pontoon type moored breakwater under waves similar to the work of williams and abul azm 1997 weng and chou 2007 also studied the behavior of a breakwater consisting of two pontoons connected by a rigid framework and moored on the seabed interestingly experiments on a single box type breakwater a dual box type breakwater and a board net type breakwater under regular waves with or without currents were carried out by dong et al 2008 in which they compared the transmitted wave coefficients of each type of breakwater most recently ji et al 2016 2017 investigated the performance of a novel cylindrical floating breakwater system by experiments which consisted of 10 cylindrical floating breakwater units and 10 mesh cages with balls in them connected by 18 connectors meanwhile ning et al 2017 studied a dual pontoon type floating breakwater numerically though there have been many papers on pontoon type or dual box type breakwaters systematic parametric studies and optimizations of these breakwaters have seldom been conducted and the differences between dual and single box type breakwaters with different shapes are also not clear in the above mentioned research potential flow theory and computational fluid dynamics cfd methods were adopted for numerical investigations of the floating breakwaters however potential flow theory could only deal with the irrotational fluids in addition the breakwaters are required to be fixed or with small motions in the potential flow theory which limits the utilizations in investigating floating breakwaters with complex geometries and violent motions compared with mesh based methods mesh free methods such as smoothed particles hydrodynamics sph with lagrangian perspective have nature merits of easily treating violent free surface flows large hydrodynamic loads and complex boundary conditions especially the fluid floating boundaries therefore in the past several years sph has been extensively adopted in ocean engineering and coastal engineering problems such as dam breaking crespo et al 2008 2015 yang et al 2016 sun et al 2019b wang et al 2019 wave slamming gao et al 2012 gotoh and khayyer 2016 wave structure interaction liu et al 2013 khayyer et al 2018a 2018c verbrugghe et al 2018 wen et al 2018d 2019 wave flume with porous media ren et al

gotoh and khayyer 2018 the state of the art of particle methods as well as the latest advancements corresponding to stability accuracy and boundary conditions are reviewed for instance molteni and colagrossi 2009 proposed a diffusive term for continuity equation of sph however it doesn t keep the mass conservation during the simulations which has been affirmed and overcome by antuono et al 2012 and wen et al 2018b when using dynamic boundary conditions crespo et al 2007 to model the interfaces between fluid and solid structures unphysical gaps would occur between them which can be countered by using the semi analytical wall boundary condition ferrand et al 2013 2017 or improved dynamic boundary condition ren et al 2014a b furthermore the particle shifting algorithm pst sun et al 2019a dissipation properties of δ sph meringolo et al 2019 extension of δ sph for simulating vortex induced vibration sun et al 2019c are respectively introduced recently in this study sph especially dualsphysics crespo et al 2015 will be adopted which is a well known hardware accelerated software package for modeling free surface flows and in order to simulate the moored floating breakwaters the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn hall and goupee 2015 a solver for mooring system kinematics will also be implemented dominguez et al 2019 have first introduced the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn however it is seldom implemented and used to study floating breakwaters in summary even the single box type and dual box type floating breakwaters have been studied extensively the examinations of the differences between the floating breakwaters with different cross sections e g rectangle and circle and different numbers of boxes are still very limited systematic parametric studies and optimizations of those breakwaters are seldom carried out meanwhile whether it is possible to optimize the floating breakwaters by combining the optimized parameters in separated testing groups is still unclear therefore in this study four different typical submerged box type breakwaters are studied including a dual rectangular breakwater single rectangular breakwater dual circular breakwater and single circular breakwater as shown in fig 1 in which a and r d are width and radius of one part of dual rectangular and circular breakwaters respectively l indicates the spacing between the two parts b means the immersion depth h is the height of rectangular breakwaters r represents the radius of circular breakwaters and ρ is the density those breakwaters are moored onto the seabed with tension leg mooring systems the effects of the above listed geometry parameters on wave attenuation performances motions fluid forces and mooring tensions are systematically studied through 88 sph simulations a sphm model is developed by coupling dualsphysics and moordyn for those simulations the reflected wave coefficient k r transmitted wave coefficient k t and dissipated wave coefficient k d are adopted to evaluate the efficiencies of the breakwaters besides the motions of the breakwaters are quantitatively described using response amplitude operator rao and fast fourier transform fft is used to handle the time series of fluid forces and mooring tensions interestingly the velocity fields surrounding the breakwaters are also visualized for clarifying the mechanisms of them finally breakwaters with optimized parameters in each testing group are simulated to check whether those cases are more efficient and can reach better performances than the best ones in each group 2 numerical methods the coupling between dualsphysics crespo et al 2015 and moordyn hall and goupee 2015 is implemented in this study obtaining coupled sphm model which will be validated against existed experiments in section 3 and is used to examine the wave attenuation performance and hydrodynamics of the four breakwaters in section 4 technically discretized n s equations are utilized to describe the dynamics of the fluid with a state equation used to enforce the water flows to be incompressible the diffusive term for the continuity equation proposed by molteni and colagrossi 2009 is applied to reduce the density fluctuations resulted by the stiff density field and the natural disordering of the lagrangian perspective in addition to counter the anisotropic particle spacing in sph a particle shifting algorithm proposed by xu et al 2009 and first created for incompressible sph by vacondio et al 2013 is also used dynamic boundary conditions crespo et al 2007 are utilized to describe the interfaces between the fluids and boundaries when dealing with fluid driven moored floating bodies the fluid forces acting on the breakwater are evaluated by summing up the interaction forces of each boundary particle exerted by the neighboring fluid particles the reaction forces of the mooring system are calculated using lumped mass approach and then the motions of the moored breakwaters can be determined using the newton s second law the wave maker can be modeled as moving boundaries with predefined motions and active wave absorptions in dualsphysics damping zone is implemented to eliminate the effects of the reflected waves the details of the sph method and the additional technologies i e particle shifting algorithm fluid driven floating body and the diffusive term for the continuity equation can be found in the paper of crespo et al 2015 and the major formulations of sph and implementation of coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn are presented in the following subsections 2 1 sph governing equations in sph fluid is discretized into a set of independent material particles with original physical properties of density and mass maintained the discretized n s equations are locally integrated at the locations of each particle meanwhile the motions of the fluid particles are governed by a momentum equation and mass continuity equation as follows crespo et al 2015 1 d v i d t j m j p j p i ρ j ρ i π i j i w i j g 2 d ρ i d t j m j v i j i w i j where v represents the velocity of the particles ρ is the density p denotes the water pressure g means the gravitational acceleration m indicates the mass of the particles and in the above equations the subscript i denotes the target particle while j represents the neighboring particles within the support domain of the target particle fig 2 sketches the target particle neighboring particle and support domain w is the smoothed kernel function and a quantic kernel suggested by wendland 1995 is adopted in this study and π denotes the artificial viscosity which is used to substitute the real viscosity of fluid providing shear viscosities for the water flows and meanwhile ensuring the numerical integration stability the w and π can be expressed as 3 w r r α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 w h e n 0 q 2 4 π i j α c i j μ i j ρ i j w h e n v i j r i j 0 0 w h e n v i j r i j 0 in which q r r is the non dimensional distances between the target particle and the neighboring ones with r and r as the real distance and the smoothed length respectively α d 7 4 π r 2 when the simulation is two dimensional as shown in fig 2 kr is the radius of support domain in which k 2 meanwhile c i j 0 5 c i c j in eq 4 is the mean speed of sound μ i j r v i j r i j r i j 2 η 2 in which η 2 0 01 r 2 v i j v i v j and r i j r i r j with v k and r k as the position and velocity of the particle k respectively and α 0 01 is adopted altomare et al 2015 to enforce the water flows to be closely incompressible it is required that small changes in density would result in large changes in pressure thus a state equation batchelor 1974 monaghan et al 1999 is added to describe the relationship between pressure and density as follow 5 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ in which γ 7 and ρ 0 1000 k g m 3 is the reference density as well c 0 denotes the speed of sound and can be calculated using the following expression 6 c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 where c 0 should be at least ten times faster than the maximum fluid velocity to keep the density variations theoretically less than 1 and to force the water flows to be incompressible 2 2 dynamic boundary condition and wave making the dynamic boundary condition dbc proposed by crespo et al 2007 is utilized to describe the interfaces between fluid and solid boundaries the boundary particles are governed by the same equations as those of the fluid ones which are impervious owing to the limitations of eq 5 however they would not move according to the quantities calculated instead they will remain their fixed positions i e fixed boundaries or move according to a predefined motion i e moving boundaries on the basis of dbc wave maker can be modeled as moving boundaries whose motions are predefined according to the second order wave generation theory madsen 1971 first the wave maker stroke s 0 can be determined by 7 h s 0 2 s i n h 2 k d s i n h k d c o s h k d k d where h denotes the wave height d means the water depth and k 2π l is the wave number in which l is the wave length subsequently the time series e 0 t of the wave maker motions can be expressed as 8 e 0 t s 0 2 s i n ω t δ h 2 32 d 3 c o s h k d s i n h 3 k d 2 m 1 s i n 2 ω t 2 δ in which ω 2π t with t as the wave period δ is the initial phase and m 1 h s 0 besides active wave absorption techniques provided by dualsphysics have been utilized then the wave maker position at t dt is corrected using the following expression 9 e 0 t d t e 0 t u c t d t u c t d t 2 where u c is the corrected wave maker velocity and can be computed as u c t d t u i t u r t with u i and u r respectively as the theoretical velocity and the velocity correction to absorb the reflected waves u i t ω s 0 2 c o s ω t δ and u r t η s p h t η i t g d η s p h and η i are respectively the measured wave elevation in front of the wave maker and the target incident wave elevation besides there are also new active techniques such as relaxation zone altomare et al 2018 and non reflective wave makers ren et al 2014a b wen and ren 2018 2 3 passive wave absorption damping zone is implemented as passive wave absorption system to reduce the effects of the reflected waves within which the velocity of the fluid particles reduces at each time step according to their locations in the zone with quadratic decay then the velocity is modified by 10 v v 0 1 δ t β r x x 0 x 1 x 0 2 where v 0 is the initial velocity of the particles at the entry of the zone v is the final velocity δ t denotes the time step in sph x means the locations of the particles with x 0 and x 1 as the initial and final positions of the damping zone respectively the reduction coefficient β r controls the modifications on the particle velocity at each time step and 10 is adopted in this study which is recommended by dualsphysics 2 4 lumped mass approach the floating breakwaters are moored by chains with two ends named as anchor and fairlead as shown in fig 3 a the cable dynamics illustrated in fig 3 b and c are resolved using lumped mass approach hall and goupee 2015 technically the mooring chains or cables are first divided into n m evenly sized line segments connecting n m 1 nodes as indicated in fig 3 b the index starts from the anchor with the node numbered as 0 and ends at the fairlead with the node numbered as n m the cable segment between nodes i and i 1 is numbered as i 1 2 meanwhile the forces on the cable contain internal axial tension damping force weight buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces determined by morison s equation as exhibited in fig 3 c the forces from the contact with the seabed are neglected for the tension leg mooring systems after that the accelerations of each node can be calculated by solving the force equilibrium equation finally the resultant forces and torques of the mooring systems acting on floating breakwaters can be calculated as f m and t m respectively 2 5 coupled sphm model the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn is implemented in this study the sph program mainly consists of three main parts which are the generation of the neighbor lists whose sizes are the same with the radius of support domain calculation of continuum and momentum equations for each particle and updating of the physical quantities at the next time step the mooring system solver is compiled to be a dynamically linked library dll and is called by sph program the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn follows a loose coupling arrangement for details in each time step of sph the fluid forces on the floating breakwater are calculated by summing up the interaction forces of each surrounding fluid particle after that sph program transmits the position and velocity of floating breakwater into the mooring model followed by the solution of the kinematics of mooring system and mooring line motions subsequently the reaction forces by the mooring system exerting on the breakwaters are transmitted back to the sph program and added with the fluid forces obtaining the total external forces of the breakwaters finally the motions of the floating breakwaters can be calculated by using the newton s second law of motion innovatively it was found that numerical oscillations would occur for the calculated quantities of the particles at the beginning of the simulation which resulted in numerical oscillations of the computed velocity and acceleration of the floating breakwater those were extremely larger than the real ones and passing them into moordyn would cause termination of the calculation owing to that the floating breakwater moved out of the computational field under the distorted predicted mooring forces consequently a time interval between starting the sph simulation and importing moordyn was recommended which was 1 0 s of sph simulation in this study other implementation of coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn can be found in the paper of dominguez et al 2019 fig 4 illustrates the whole flow chart of sphm model in this study 3 validation of the sphm model 3 1 experiment description the sphm model is validated against the experiments conducted by peng et al 2013 which deal with the interactions between regular waves and moored submerged box type floating breakwaters the experiments were performed in a 2d water flume with length l flume 30 m width of 0 7 m and depth of 0 9 m as indicated in fig 5 a piston type wave maker was located at left side of the water flume and at the right side a rubble mound made wave absorber was set up to reduce the effects of reflected waves a submerged box type floating breakwater of width 2a 0 40 m height h 0 15 m and density ρ 700 kg m 3 was located at a distance of l w 18 5 m far away from the wave maker there was only 2 cm gap left between the floating breakwater and lateral walls of the water flume ensuring that these experiments can be simulated in 2d mode peng et al 2013 the mass and moment of inertia of the breakwater were 28 6 kg and 0 435 kg m2 respectively the tension leg mooring system consisted of four mooring chains which were carefully arranged to ensure a good symmetry along with x and y directions where the mooring cables were anchored to the seabed with a 60 inclination at the initial moment the immersion depth of the top deck b was 0 102 m two wave conditions were examined i e t 0 8 s h 0 030 m and t 1 0 s h 0 046 m resulting in wave lengths l 0 998 m and 1 538 m respectively gauges 1 4 were four measuring points used for water elevation recording and the arrangements are displayed in fig 5 subsequently the numerical geometry in sphm model is adjusted as indicated in fig 5 the water flume length l flume changes to 7 2 m and the distance between the wave maker and breakwater l w 2 95 m with the other parameters remain the same as those in the experiment as well the length of the damping zone is 2 3 m assuming that the center of mass of the breakwater is the origin the x positive and z positive respectively rightwards and upwards subsequently the fairleads of the mooring chains 1 and 2 are respectively located at 0 20 m 0 075 m and 0 20 m 0 075 m and the anchors of the mooring chains 1 and 2 are respectively located at 0 40 m 0 423 m and 0 40 m 0 423 m the lengths of the mooring chains are 0 40 m ensuring that the equilibrium position of the breakwater in numerical model exhibits little difference with the experimental one 3 2 convergent tests and representative parameters a series of convergent tests are carried out before the simulations which examine the effects of the size of the particles d p 0 1 0 05 0 02 0 01 and 0 005 m time step size of sph δ t 5 10 4 1 10 4 6 10 5 4 10 5 and 2 10 5 s segments of the mooring lines n m 2 3 4 5 and 6 and time step size of mooring solver δ t m 2 10 5 1 10 5 5 10 6 2 10 6 and 1 10 6 s on the numerical results the motions of the floating breakwater under waves with t 1 0 s and h 0 046 m are compared for identifying the convergences of these parameters fig 6 presents the motion series of the breakwaters in the convergent tests from which it is observed that in general the size of the particles greatly affects the numerical results in the test on d p the motion amplitudes become bigger as the d p gets smaller with more evident double crests observed in single one cycle of the heave motion meanwhile owing to the changes of the generated particles visible phase difference occurs between the motion series with different d p however which is not observed from the other tests for the simulations with d p 0 01 m and 0 005 m the motion series of the breakwaters is mostly coincided with each other indicating convergence at this moment thus d p 0 01 m is adopted in this study for compromising between computational time and accuracy subsequently in the tests on the time step of sph the motion amplitudes are observed to increase as the δ t gets smaller and converge after δ t is approximately 4 10 5 s the segments of the mooring lines as well as the time step in the mooring solver exhibit random effects on the numerical results as shown in fig 6 c and d it can be found that the convergent points are hard to be determined for n m and δ t m fortunately the effects made by them are small enough to be neglected thus the n m and δ t m are empirically specified as 5 and 2 10 6 s respectively then in the present sph the time step size δ t is 4 10 5 s the size of the particles d p equals to 0 01 m with a total number of 42 368 particles generated including 868 fixed particles 200 moving particles 744 floating particles and 40 556 fluid particles the smoothed length r is set to be 1 5d p a quantic kernel function and symplectic integration algorithm are adopted artificial viscosity is used to substitute the real viscosity of water flows and the coefficient α 0 01 in the mooring system the cables are equally divided into 5 segments with diameter d and mass per unit length m l of the mooring lines are 0 001 m and 0 001 kg m 1 respectively thus the total gravity of the mooring chains is negligibly smaller than the net buoyancy of the modeled floating breakwater at the initial moment in addition to prevent the mooring lines from stretching large cable stiffness k cable 4 105 n m 1 is utilized the time step for modeling the dynamics of the mooring lines δ t m is 2 10 6 s to improve the computational efficiency the codes have been developed based on cuda toolkits by dualsphysics and run with gpu acceleration the gpu card involved in this study is nvidia geforce rtx 2080 ti the representative parameters and the computing device configuration are summarized in table 1 and table 2 respectively 3 3 numerical results fig 7 shows the time series of the water surface elevations recorded at gauges 1 4 it can be found that at the seaside the incoming waves make the water surface to move as a simple harmonic and somewhere are strengthened due to the reflected waves for example wave height at gauge 2 is 1 22 times as high as the incoming wave height when t 0 8 s at the leeside the wave amplitudes decrease sharply owing to the wave attenuation by the breakwater at the same time the water surface shows a non linear profile with steepened wave crests and flattened wave troughs which can be identified in both sphm and experimental results in particular when t 1 0 s the results indicate that the waves break over the breakwater which results in wave decompositions and higher harmonics at the leeside however complex wave profiles with double crests on the leeward are not reproduced adequately in sphm simulations the secondary peaks and troughs are smaller than those of experimental results it may result by the over damping force against higher harmonics of artificial viscosity as mentioned in the paper of ren et al 2017 overall water surface elevations in sphm show satisfactory agreements with the experimental ones and sphm model can be utilized in the simulations of floating breakwaters there are no experimental results for the motions of the breakwater under waves of t 0 8 s h 0 030 m in the paper of peng et al 2013 thus only the comparisons of motions of the breakwater under the waves of t 1 0 s h 0 046 m are shown in fig 8 the rotations are positive in counter clockwise when the wave peaks act on the breakwater it moves down and right first then comes back to the equilibrium position as well when the wave troughs act on the breakwater it moves down and left first then comes back to the equilibrium position again this explains why there are two troughs and crests in heave component during single one cycle the secondary troughs in heave component of sphm are a little flatter than those of the experiment in general the sphm shows satisfactory agreements with experiments for the breakwater motions fig 9 shows the time series of onshore and offshore mooring tensions corresponding to mooring chain 2 and 1 respectively owing to the double crests phenomenon occurred in heave motion the time series of mooring tensions also has double crests and troughs in single one cycle however the secondary troughs in heave motion are not reproduced adequately resulting in that the secondary troughs of mooring tensions are flatter than those of the experiment in general the mooring tensions exhibit satisfactory agreements with the experimental ones from figs 7 9 it can be said that the coupled sphm model can be used to simulate the floating breakwaters and give correct predictions of wave elevations breakwater motions fluid forces and mooring tensions the numerical results satisfactorily agree with the experimental ones though there are no turbulence models applied in addition liu et al 2019 dominguez et al 2019 and liu and wang 2020 have carried out simulations on moored floating breakwaters using sph without turbulence models involved thus turbulence models are neglected in this study to reduce computational cost and to handle massive cases 4 results and discussions a systematic study on the comparison between four kinds of breakwaters dual rectangular breakwater single rectangular breakwater dual circular breakwater and single circular breakwater is carried out to explore their wave attenuation performances and hydrodynamics which includes the examinations of the effects of width of single part of the dual rectangular breakwater a radius of single part of the dual circular breakwater r d radius of the single circular breakwater r the spacing between the two parts l the immersion depth b the height of rectangular breakwater h and the density ρ as shown in fig 1 for the dual circular and rectangular breakwaters the two parts of them are assumed to be connected by trusses which allow fluid particles to flow freely between the two parts and have small impacts on the water flows consequently in the 2d numerical models of sph the trusses are neglected and the two parts of dual breakwaters are modeled as one rigid floating body in dualsphysics a total of 88 numerical simulations are carried out to meet the topic of this study the case name and settings are listed in table 3 in order to make these four kinds of breakwater comparable the used material remains the same as each other the wave maker on the left side produces regular waves with t 1 0 s and h 0 046 m and the results will be analyzed against non dimensional parameters such as a l r l b h h h etc finally four optimized breakwaters will be derived from the numerical results of the parametric studies by combining the optimized parameters in separated testing group and those breakwaters will be also simulated to evaluate the breakwaters in a quantitative way the reflected wave coefficient k r transmitted wave coefficient k t and dissipated wave coefficient k d are calculated for each case in particular k r means the ratio of reflected wave height to the incoming wave height and k t represents the ratio of transmitted wave height to the incident wave height and k d is the square root of energy proportion converted into other type of energy i e internal energy and kinetic energy of the breakwater and the mooring system based on the energy conservation of the incoming wave a balanced relationship can be set up as 11 e i e r e t e d in which e i is the incoming wave energy e r e t and e d represent the reflected wave energy transmitted wave energy and dissipated wave energy respectively by dividing e i on both sides of the equation following the relationship of wave energy and wave height e h 2 a formula containing k r k t and k d can be expressed as 12 k r 2 k t 2 k d 2 1 the reflected wave height at the seaside is calculated using the two point method put forward by goda and suzuki 1976 also the fast fourier transform fft is carried out to analyze the synthetic waves at the leeside after that k r k t and k d can be determined for the evaluation of the performance of the breakwaters k t as the ratio of transmitted wave height to the incident wave height is the key parameter besides the motions of the breakwaters are investigated since the simulations are restricted as two dimensional only the amplitudes in three directions i e surge a surge heave a heave and pitch a pitch are calculated the response amplitude operators raos of surge a surge a i heave a heave a i and pitch a pitch ka i with a i as the incoming wave height are applied for the discussions of the breakwaters motions fft is also used to analyze the time series of fluid forces and mooring tensions 4 1 parametric studies 4 1 1 effects of breakwater width or radius fig 10 presents the wave coefficients as a function of a r and r d for the cases a1 5 a1 5 r1 6 and r1 9 it is observed that for dual rectangular breakwaters the reflected wave coefficient falls down first and then rises as a increases with a minimum value of 0 14 at a l 0 13 as for the single rectangular breakwaters the reflected wave coefficient always moves up as a gets larger and is greater than those of the dual rectangular breakwaters for transmitted wave coefficient as shown in fig 10 b both the dual rectangular and the single rectangular breakwaters exhibit downtrends with increasing a indicating that the longer the breakwater the better the performances will be assuming that breakwaters with k t 0 5 are effective a l 0 125 and 0 136 can be interpolated as shown in fig 10 b for dual rectangular and single rectangular breakwaters respectively in addition as illustrated in fig 10 c the dissipated wave energy portion of breakwaters grows as a becomes bigger additionally for the circular breakwaters the radius results in slight changes in k r k t and k d with small improvement in wave attenuation observed in fig 10 b therefore the bigger the circular breakwaters the better the performances will be however the transmitted wave coefficients of single circular breakwaters are bigger than those of the rests and r d l 0 152 is interpolated for dual circular breakwater ensuring k t 0 5 which is bigger than those of rectangular breakwaters meanwhile the reflected wave coefficients of circular breakwaters are almost smaller than those of the rectangular breakwater indicating that the former can hardly reflect ocean waves the surge heave and pitch raos of rectangular and circular breakwaters as a function of a r and r d are shown in fig 11 a c it is observed that all the three raos for the dual rectangular breakwaters and circular breakwaters decrease as a increases therefore it can also be inferred that the smaller the dual rectangular and circular breakwaters the more violent the motions will be on the contrary the surge and heave raos for the single rectangular breakwater rise with oscillations while the pitch rao deceases when a increases it is obvious that the motions of the single rectangular breakwaters are much bigger than those of the rests and the motions of the dual circular breakwaters are the smallest the possible explanation is that the circular breakwaters are curved so the fluid particles can escape along the surfaces resulting in smaller exciting forces furthermore the dual box type breakwaters have bigger lateral stiffness and rotational stiffness thus resulting in smaller motions fig 12 presents the fluid forces and mooring tensions of the breakwaters as a function of a r and r d from which it can be seen that as the width and radius of rectangular and circular breakwaters increase the fluid forces and mooring tensions almost roughly exhibit uptrends except for the fluid force and offshore mooring tension of dual rectangular breakwater consequently it can be said that the bigger the breakwaters the higher the fluid forces and mooring tensions will be meanwhile these forces i e fluid forces and mooring tensions of the rectangular breakwaters are greater than those of the circular breakwaters and ones of the single breakwaters are greater than those of the dual breakwaters from figs 11 and 12 it can be seen that as the width or radius increase the motions of the breakwaters reduce and the forces increase indicating that there should negative correlations between motions and forces in order to show the fundamental differences between these four kinds of breakwaters the instantaneous flow fields around the breakwaters under case a5 a5 r6 and r9 at different moments are drawn in figs 13 16 respectively the selections of those cases for plotting are from the consideration that those four cases show the largest differences between the wave coefficients it can be directly observed that the fluid velocity near the water surface is bigger and decreases as the depth increases and that near the single breakwaters are much bigger than that near the dual ones with the motions of the latter are more peaceful at the seaside the fluid velocity of the single rectangular breakwater is greatly bigger than that of the rests owing to the reflected waves as observed in fig 10 a at the leeside fluid velocity for the dual breakwaters seems to be smaller than that of the corresponding single breakwaters meanwhile which mainly moves laterally resulting in small wave amplitudes the possible reason is that the heave and pitch motions of the dual breakwaters are greatly reduced thus it can be said that dual breakwaters are with features of rectification of the water flows for the dual breakwaters it is evident that the incoming waves are attenuated twice as propagating with violent flows and vortices occur around the structure dissipating the wave energy into thermal energy 4 1 2 effects of spacing of dual breakwaters the wave coefficients of dual and single breakwaters for cases l1 5 l1 lr1 5 and lr1 are shown in fig 17 it is observed that as the spacing between the two breakwaters gets wider k r and k t rise first before they fall down and k r approximately converges to 0 16 for the dual rectangular breakwater when l a 1 5 the dual rectangular breakwater performs worse than the single one as shown in fig 17 b with inverse being true when l a 1 5 and similar trends observed for circular breakwaters however the variations of k t as a function of l are negligible fig 17 a shows the reflected wave coefficients from which it can be seen that k r increases first and then decreases and that of circular ones is smaller resulted by the escaping of the fluid particles along the curved surface the evident difference between the reflected waves may explain that the wave attenuation performance of rectangular breakwaters is better than that of the circular breakwaters fig 17 c illustrates the dissipated wave coefficients and k d decreases first and then rises for both rectangular and circular breakwaters as the spacing gets wider k d gradually converges to 0 92 considering the fact that the transmitted wave coefficient is the most important parameter determining the performance of the breakwater and k t here is found to be nearly independent with l thus the flow fields will not be provided the surge heave and pitch raos of the breakwaters as a function of l are plotted in fig 18 notably as the spacing of the breakwaters increases the motions of the breakwaters will become gentler and gradually converge to nearly zero the reason is probably that as the spacing gets wider the inertia of moment and lateral stiffness of the breakwaters increase thus the motions of the dual breakwaters are limited the motions of the circular breakwaters are smaller than those of the rectangular breakwaters owing to the particles escaping mentioned above the fluid forces and mooring tensions as a function of l are sketched in fig 19 as the spacing between the two parts of the dual breakwaters increases the motions of the breakwaters fluid forces and mooring tensions all decrease implying that there are positive correlations between the motions and forces this finding is different with that in subsection 4 1 1 which means that the motions and forces are not directly dependent with each other and are affected by many factors such as width and spacing meanwhile similar with fig 12 the forces of single breakwaters are greater than those of dual breakwaters and ones of rectangular breakwaters are greater than those of circular breakwaters 4 1 3 effects of immersion depth fig 20 shows the wave coefficients of the dual and single breakwaters as a function of immersion depth for single rectangular and single circular breakwaters k r and k d show similar trends which rise first and then fall down the incoming waves are almost reflected by the dual rectangular breakwater which is located at the water surface for the dual breakwaters k r always fall down with increasing b and k d rises first and then falls down the maximum k d closes to 0 95 denoting nearly 90 of the wave energy dissipated as for k t the same trends of decreasing first and then increasing are observed for all four kinds of breakwaters implying that as the immersion depth increases the wave attenuation performance gets better first and then worse the optimum values occur at b 0 03 m 0 03m 0 05m and 0 08 m for the dual rectangular breakwater dual circular breakwater single circular breakwater and single rectangular breakwater respectively therefore it can be safely said that the dual breakwaters should be installed with small immersion depth and the single rectangular breakwaters can be adopted with bigger immersion depth with the single circular breakwater within them the k t of dual rectangular breakwater is found to have the smallest value when b 0 03 m seen from fig 20 b the wave attenuation performance of the breakwaters is sensitive to the immersion depth which should be the key parameter in the design of these kinds of breakwaters the motions of the single breakwaters become violent first before they recede as the immersion depth increases as shown in fig 21 however for the dual breakwaters the motions of the breakwater show nearly monotone decreasing as a function of the immersion depth after b h 1 74 raos of surge heave and pitch components become almost constants indicating that the motions of dual breakwaters can hardly be affected by the immersion depth as immersion depth increases the forces and mooring tensions of single breakwaters in fig 22 almost exhibit similar trends of increasing first and then decreasing and those of dual breakwaters are hardly affected by the immersion depth the changes of forces and motions are similar with each other when in small immersion depth cases the breakwaters may move out of the water surface resulting in relative small fluid forces and small motions as the immersion depth increases all the wave forces act on the breakwaters thus the fluid forces and motions increase as the immersion depth continuously increases the wave forces decrease resulting in smaller fluid forces and motions from figs 12 and 19 and 22 it can be found that the offshore mooring tensions are greater than the onshore mooring tensions thus the offshore mooring line should be well designed ensuring its safety and stability as has been found from fig 20 b that k t has both minimum and maximum as immersion depth changes with large variation observed the velocity fields of water flows surrounding b2 and b6 b1 and b4 br2 and br6 as well as br3 and br6 are drawn in figs 23 30 respectively for the breakwaters with local best performances the transmitted waves are smaller than those of the corresponding breakwaters with local worst performances with both smaller wave velocity and amplitudes at the leeside there are some similarities for the velocity fields of the well performed breakwaters such as for dual breakwaters the fluid velocity near the part at the seaside is greatly bigger than that near the part at the leeside for the single breakwaters the fluid velocity near the surface at the seaside is greatly bigger than that near the surface at the leeside thus it can be inferred that the part of a well designed breakwater at the seaside primarily attenuates the waves and should be designed effectively specifically asymmetrical breakwaters can be considered for economics interestingly on the leeside of the dual breakwaters with small immersion depth see figs 23 and 25 the high speed water particles impact on the breakwater resulting in some particles move much faster than the neighboring particles generating wave breakings which becomes invisible as the immersion depth gets larger however those phenomenon are not adequately produced by sph simulations which maybe resulted by the ignorance of air phase in the numerical model sun et al 2019d studied the effects of air phase on the numerical simulation of wave interactions with structures when wave peaks impact with the structures air bubbles would generate between the waves and the seaside surface of the breakwaters which would help the waves break as the propagation of the waves negative air pressure would generate on the top surface of the breakwaters which helps the waves overtop onto the top surface owing to the ignorance of air phase the waves seems stable in the numerical simulations however it costs too much computational time for two phase simulation and the validation indicates satisfactory agreements between experimental and numerical results thus air phase is neglected in this study as a compromising between computational time and accuracy it is known that the waves mainly propagate in a limited depth beneath the water surface and which is classified into a top layer middle layer and bottom layer according to the colors of the fluid velocity in figs 23 30 subsequently it can be said that dual breakwaters should be located in top layer and single breakwaters should be located in middle layer to obtain well performances 4 1 4 effects of breakwater height wave coefficients for dual and single breakwaters as a function of h r and r d are shown in fig 31 when h increases for the single rectangular breakwater the reflected wave energy will have no apparent changes but the dissipated wave energy portion will increase which results in a slight improvement in the single rectangular breakwater as illustrated in fig 31 b in addition k r k t and k d of the rest breakwaters show very small difference when the height or radius of the breakwater changes thus for saving the material thinner dual rectangular breakwater and smaller single or dual circular breakwaters can be adopted with little effects on the wave attenuation performance raos in surge heave and pitch components are displayed in fig 32 it is clear that as the breakwater gets higher and bigger raos decrease slightly except for the heave component of the single rectangular breakwater meanwhile the fluid forces and mooring tensions shown in fig 33 almost increase as the sizes of the breakwater increases the bigger the breakwaters the higher the forces will be however the increase in size will increase the moment of inertia and stiffness of the breakwaters consequently the motions of the breakwaters decrease meanwhile the larger the breakwater the better the performances will be in general it is safe to say that the wave coefficients motions of the breakwaters and forces are insensitive to the changes in the height or radius of the breakwaters 4 1 5 effects of breakwater density fig 34 presents the wave coefficients for dual and single breakwaters as a function of density higher density variations between transmission medium and reflection medium often result in a larger reflected coefficient as shown in fig 34 a as well for dual rectangular breakwaters k r and k d fall while k t rises as increasing the breakwater density for circular breakwaters k r changes slightly and k d decreases as density increases resulting in the increase of k t therefore it can be deduced that the higher the density the worse the wave attenuation performance will be fig 35 illustrates the comparisons of raos between dual and single breakwaters while changing the density it is known that when the forces are fixed the heavier the breakwater the smaller the motions will be this can also be observed in fig 35 a c except for the heave component of the single rectangular breakwaters for the fluid forces and mooring tensions shown in fig 36 except for the forces of single rectangular breakwater the forces of the rests exhibit small dependence on breakwater density the forces of single rectangular breakwater show fluctuations during the changes of density it can be said that the forces can hardly affected by the breakwater density meanwhile the offshore mooring tensions are greater than the onshore ones 4 2 optimized breakwaters from the separated testing groups in section 4 1 it can be summarized as follows the performances motions and forces are significantly sensitive to the width or radius and immersion depth of the breakwaters as the immersion depth increases the performances of the breakwaters get better first and then worse and the motions and forces increase first and then decrease however the performances motions and forces are insensitive to the spacing height and density of the breakwaters in general the larger wider and lighter the breakwaters are the better the performances will be the motions and forces of single breakwaters are commonly greater than those of the dual ones and the motions and forces of rectangular breakwaters are greater than those of the circular ones meanwhile the offshore mooring tensions are greater than the onshore mooring tensions there are no evident relationships between performances motions and forces however dual rectangular breakwater exhibits not only good performances but also has small motions and forces in order to clarify whether it is possible to optimize the floating breakwaters by combining the optimized parameters in the separated testing group four breakwaters with the geometry parameters being the combinations of the optimized parameters in each separated group are designed as listed in table 4 the numerical results are listed in table 5 meanwhile the minimum k t of the typical breakwaters in the separated studies k t min are also shown in table 5 it can be clearly seen that the optimized breakwaters perform better than the corresponding best breakwaters in all the separated cases especially for the dual rectangular breakwater with nearly 65 of improvement in wave attenuations and this is also the best among the four kinds of breakwaters therefore it is possible to determine the parameters separately and combine the optimized parameters to obtain well designed breakwaters in addition it is also found that following the dual rectangular breakwater single circular breakwater is better than the rests and the single rectangular one is the worst this implies that for single rectangular breakwater splitting the structure into two parts is effective but which is not true for single circular breakwaters 5 conclusions in this study the coupling between dualsphysics and moordyn is implemented and the obtained coupled model is utilized to investigate four typical submerged floating breakwaters the effects of the geometry parameters are clarified and the performances motions and forces of these breakwaters are compared the question whether it is possible to optimize the floating breakwaters by using separated testing group is clarified following summarized the conclusions 1 the circular breakwaters reflect less portion of the incoming waves than the rectangular breakwaters owing to the particle escaping along the curved surface which also results in smaller motions and forces of the circular breakwaters 2 the optimized dual rectangular breakwater performs greatly better in wave attenuations than the others meanwhile its motions fluid forces and mooring tensions are smaller than those of single breakwaters 3 the wave attenuation performances of the breakwaters show large sensitivity to the immersion depth and dual breakwaters should be located near the free water surface while single breakwaters should be located with larger immersion depth 4 the wave attenuation performances of the breakwaters are insensitive to the size and density of the breakwaters however in general the larger and lighter the breakwaters the better the wave attenuation performances will be 5 the motions and forces of single breakwaters are greater than those of the dual breakwaters and the motions and forces of rectangular breakwaters are greater than those of the circular breakwaters meanwhile offshore mooring tensions generally bigger than the onshore mooring tensions 6 importantly optimizing the geometry parameters separately and combining them together to obtain well designed breakwaters is found to be effective credit authorship contribution statement zhenqing liu conceptualization methodology resources supervision project

21774,the present study analyzed 41 years of era 5 wind wave data 1979 2019 to understand the long term trend inter annual and inter seasonal variability of total wind generated waves wind seas and swell waves in the indian ocean io the significant wave height swh of era 5 was validated with the multi platform calibrated altimetry wave height the correlation coefficient of swh was about 0 97 considering the entire domain and it is greater than 0 9 for different sectors in the io basin the absolute and root mean square errors in different sub domains are observed in the range of 0 16 0 3 m and 0 2 0 37 m respectively and found higher in the extra tropical io etsi the etsi showed an increasing trend for both wind seas and swell waves 0 5 1 cm year in context to wind seas shift in the westerly wind belt leads to pole ward increasing and equator ward decreasing trend in the northern arabian sea the swell waves exhibited an increasing trend 0 8 cm year during the south west monsoon meanwhile the wind sea activity over the arabian sea and head bay of bengal are seen to decrease the regions in the io that experienced higher variability of swh in the last four decades are identified using eof empirical orthogonal function analysis the dominant mode of principal component analysis signified the explicit contribution of swell waves over the total significant wave height the second and third modes of variability are majorly contributed by wind seas especially in the south io attributed due to the southern annular mode sam the wavelet spectrum analysis conducted at the identified locations of higher variability manifests the domain sensitivity by which the makran coast experienced an increased average variance in annular and semi annular scales keywords indian ocean total significant wave height wind seas swell waves trend variability era 5 eof pcas 1 introduction the ocean surface is characterized by superimposed wave systems that comprises of locally generated wind seas and the remotely forced swell waves long period surface gravity waves most of the time the global ocean is dominated by storm generated swell waves semedo et al 2011 whereas the wind seas are prominent in basins that experience strong prevailing wind system in context to the io geographical regions in the so experience the strongest wind westerly and wind wave fields young 1999 interestingly the wave heights of separated swell waves and wind seas are almost comparable over this belt the regions off west and north west australia are prone to high wave activity attributed due to the australian summer monsoon suppiah 1992 wheeler and mcbride 2007 the wind wave climate of the nio north indian ocean is unique due to the reversing wind system from asian monsoon slingo et al 2005 schott and mccreary 2001 a number of studies have illustrated on the sea state along the coastal regions of india which is significantly influenced and modified by the swell wave field amrutha et al 2015 johnsonet al 2012 gowthaman et al 2013 sanil kumar et al 2011 moreover from the climatological aspect the io is dominated by the swell waves muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 in all months except the monsoonal months in general along the west coast of india swells are superlative during the south west sw monsoon season nayak et al 1989 in addition the nio is also influenced by swell wave field resulting from nw winds in the arabian sea shamal and makran waves and the so swells aboobacker et al 2011 aboobacker and shanas 2018 anoopet al 2020 shamal winds are the strong north westerly low level wind system that develop due to the dynamic interaction between upper level jet streams and lower tropospheric pressure systems vinod kumar et al 2014 these wind systems exist in the arabian peninsula and that can extend until the west coast of india with a decreasing magnitude from north to south aboobacker and shanas 2018 the shamal events are known to have significant influence on wind driven circulation in the arabian sea samiksha et al 2014 more details on the onset intensity and duration of shamal events in the arabian peninsula and its distribution in the arabian sea are available in vinod kumar et al 2014 and yu et al 2016 on the other hand the periodic northerly lower atmosphere jets in the mid latitude belt of the sub tropical asian regions are modified by the makran mountain ranges in the central south coast of pakistan where the winds are predominantly in the west northwest and northeast directions this wind system modified by the makran mountain ranges generates a new wave system that propagates in the arabian sea as makran swells prevalent during the months from october to may a study by nayak et al 2013 nayak et al 2013 reported that swells generated from so region influences the local wind wave climate of nio within four days semedo et al 2011 semedo et al 2011 advocated on the existence of strong wind wave climatology for the indian sector in the southern ocean highlighting the importance of the highest seasonal mean higher swell and significant wave height activity along with maximum winds were found during the two extreme seasons december january february djf and june july august jja nevertheless the so swells that propagate over very long distances circumscribing the hemisphere and reaching various coastal destinations undergo dissipation of wave energy as a function of distance hemer et al 2010 and the mean wave period ts declines towards the north of tsio above 30 s however no warning system has come up to detect swell propagation and thus it is indeed imperative to understand the regional characteristics of swell waves in the ocean basin there are ample studies concerned with the indian ocean waves and its climatological aspects still one can hardly find few detailed analyses of separate wind seas and swell waves in the io muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 thus it is crucial to understand the significant contribution of swells and wind seas over the total significant wave height swh their characteristics trends as well as variability in the io therefore this study focuses on the analyses of swell waves and wind seas further to reveal their relative significance over the total swh seasonal characteristics and spatio temporal variability in the io in the context of waves parameters like wind stress air sea interaction energy transfer small scale currents ardhuinet al 2017 are indeed essential and vital in governing the generation and directionality of waves concerning to the long term variability atmospheric parameters plays the primary role in which surface air temperature sea surface temperature sea level pressure and winds actively participate mohan and bhaskaran 2019 in a changing climate scenario the global wind and waves are also experiencing an increasing trend young and ribal 2019 from the same study the south of io has not exhibited a clear indication of the trend for mean significant wave height swh whereas the higher percentile swh has a more positive trend at the same time the trend in mean and higher percentile winds shows a far more positive trend over large areas of the global ocean in concern with these two contradictory observations further investigation on the wind wave climate are crucial and to be specific a study on separated swell and wind seas characteristics over regional scales in ocean basins is essential from the synoptic analysis of observational satellite altimetry the maximum wave height in so and the annual mean swh in the bay of bengal bob was observed to be increased patra and bhaskaran 2016 gupta et al 2015 during 2002 2012 the trend of swh over the io was figured out with a less positive rate during 1999 2019 than the accounted rate in 1979 1999 muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 these studies urge to take a look into the trends of separate swell waves and wind seas to establish the linkage between the trends of winds and waves which have not attempted yet the information of ocean waves can be extracted from in situ or model products the voluntary observation ship vos records and satellite swath observations from the in situ account are beneficial in this regard these observation data require interpolation for spatial integrity and the latter is widely accepted since 1989 ers1 the satellite altimeters have provided information on the wave parameters however a careful calibration is necessary to be done for the altimeter observational data queffeulou 2003 2004 sepulveda et al 2015 french research institute for exploitation of the sea ifremer cersat provides a bias corrected altimeter derived wind and wave records for the period 1991 2017 in which 10 satellite records are been synchronized this public data set was found beneficial in investigating the trends variability and model validation of wave heights for different domains patra and bhaskaran 2016 gupta et al 2015 patra and bhaskaran 2017 the reanalysis data from numerical models has advantages in the length and resolution of the data record which is apparent for synoptic analyses ecmwf is a popular public domain repository of global earth science reanalysis products era interim is the fourth generation atmospheric model of ecmwf that was widely popularized among the scientific community deeet al 2011 later it was replaced by era5 fifth generation ecmwf re analysis in 2018 with higher spatial resolution and better model physics and the products are available through c3s hersbach and dee 2012 hoffmannet al 2019 era5 provides wave parameters of separated swell and wind seas which can be a highly beneficial resource for the present study muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 examined the climatology and trends of indian ocean surface wind and waves utilizing 39 years 1979 2017 of ecmwf era5 reanalysis data the era5 significant wave height and maximum wave height showed a good match with the measured in situ buoy data in coastal and deep waters with a respective bias of 0 29 m and 0 18 m respectively also their study mentioned that during tropical cyclones the era5 under estimated the significant wave height and maximum wave height as compared to the buoy data by 2 7 and 1 4 respectively with a larger bias approx 0 69 m their study muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 using scatter plots performed an inter comparison between buoy and era5 parameters for locations ratnagiri west coast of india and gopalpur east coast of india examining the maximum wave height hmax significant wave height hs mean and peak wave periods also their study using scatter plots compared the significant wave height and mean wave periods for deep water locations ad02 in the arabian sea and ds3 in the bay of bengal during the periods 2012 and 2003 respectively for the buoy ad02 located in arabian sea the estimated buoy mean hs and era5 mean hs was 1 78 m and 1 71 m respectively the respective rmse and bias were 0 22 m and 0 07 m for the location ds3 in the bay of bengal the buoy and era5 mean hs were 1 61 m and 1 80 m respectively with rmse of 0 29 m and bias of 0 18 m the annual maximum hsmax measured at ratnagiri was 8 6 m whereas the same obtained from era5 was 7 6 m indicating an under estimation of approx 12 the measured annual maximum hs for the same location was 5 2 m whereas from era5 it was 4 1 m in general the era5 under estimated the monthly maximum hs ranging between 9 and 39 whereas the monthly maximum hsmax were under estimated in era5 by 2 34 wind generated waves simulated during fair weather conditions derived from era5 reanalysis product is found satisfactory with only exception for extreme weather events like cyclones which is a limitation the authors agree that typhoon induced wave heights accounts only a minor part of the wave climate global evaluation of era5 wind and waves demonstrated that the maximum errors in era5 are associated with the extreme sea states of extra tropical systems and tropical cyclones parsons et al 2018 there are studies that performed inter comparison of wind and wave data from reanalysis products sterl and caires 2005 has mentioned the underestimation of the era 40 wind field during extreme weather conditions stopa and cheung 2014 made an inter comparison of wind speeds and wave heights for 30 years from reanalysis products era interim and ncep cfsr utilizing altimetry and buoy observations to assess their consistency in space and time scales both these products showed good spatial homogeneity with consistent error levels in both northern and southern hemispheres their study stopa and cheung 2014 revealed that era interim had a better homogeneity with time recommending its importance for modeling long term processes however it has limitations in the analysis of upper percentiles especially for extreme events for extreme wind wave modeling studies wind fields from hipocas remo and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr ncep noaa are found highly beneficial specifically for extreme events the hipocas product showed the strongest winds followed by cfsr noaa and era interim campos and guedes soares 2017 campos et al 2018 the study revealed significant under estimation of era interim product during peak of the storms associated with coarse space and time resolutions the fifth generation atmospheric model of ecmwf the era5 winds are found to underestimate the super typhoon meranti 2016 but observed as consistent under weaker typhoons malakas and megi 2016 hsiao et al 2019 based on their study for typhoons meranti malakas and megi the wind fields of ncep cfsv2 are relatively higher as compared to era5 and era interim especially for regions in close vicinity surrounding the inner eye wall of the typhoon similarly for the io the significant wave height of era5 during tropical cyclone phailin 2013 was found consistent with buoy observations muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 the time series plot of wave parameters from era5 and era interim with buoy measured maximum wave height significant wave height mean and peak wave periods during phailin at gopalpur location on the east coast of india indicates that era5 showed a good match with buoy maximum wave height in the case of significant wave height the era5 matched much better against buoy data relative to the era interim it is also noticed that the era5 could well represent the extreme waves unlike the era interim the measured maximum hsmax was 13 13 m which is close 12 95 m with the era5 also the measured maximum hs was 7 06 m whereas the value was 6 87 m in era5 the under estimation in era5 during the phailin cyclone was 1 4 in hmax and 2 7 in hs murty et al 2020 murty et al 2020 reported on improved cyclonic wind fields over the bay of bengal region and its application for storm surge and wave computations their study murty et al 2020 developed a blended wind product and revealed that the blended wind field matched well with the measured data all the above mentioned studies indicate on the limitation of reanalysis products for extreme weather events for a dataset with considerable spatial and temporal integrity the primary challenge is concerned with the high dimensionality of data that varies in both space and time concurrently moreover each spatial unit varies in a distinct direction along with the time domain and therefore it is essential to represent the dominant character of the dataset to accomplish this one has to use dimensionality reduction techniques and the widely used mathematical tools in climate analyses are eof pca low rank and sparse decomposition technique wavelet analysis fast fourier transforms ffts etc these methods can provide valuable information on the dominant modes of variability and pca eof is widely used in the atmospheric and oceanographic variability studies lintner 2002 hannachi et al 2007 a number of authors have extensively detailed the method of eof with different algorithms and svd singular value decomposition is the efficient one among them wu et al 1997 wang and chang 2007 based on the spatial variability for the arabian sea and bob it was noticed from eof analysis that the first mode comprises nearly 70 of the total variance and the monsoon is possibly the dominant mode of variability rao et al 2011 anoop et al 2015 for the so the first five modes together contribute 50 of the total variability and the dominant mode of variability is the prevailing wind system rao et al 2011 moreover few recent studies addressed the significant role of climate indices such as el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and southern annular mode sam etc in the met ocean dynamics kumar et al 2016 arora and dash 2019 hence it is essential to investigate the potential regions that experience higher variability and the factors that enhance it this study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of wind generated waves in the io covering the aspects of climatology trend and variability using 41 years of era data for the same the total significant wave height swh significant wave heights of swell waves swhsw as well as wind seas swhws and wind speed are considered also it extends the effort to establish the relative contribution of wind seas and swell waves over the total swh over different geographical regions in the io the monthly averaged swh is used for the entire study to set the objectives the study also covers aspects on the inter seasonal and inter annual variability of separated wave systems advanced mathematical tools such as pca eof have been used to study the spatio temporal variability whereas the wave spectrum analysis to analyze the temporal characteristics of identified potential regions the potential areas recognized in this study are expected to be important regions of future reference in terms of variability 2 study area as mentioned above this study is concerned with the investigation on the variability and trends of swh over the io the wind patterns highly diversify the regime from the southern hemisphere sh to the northern hemisphere nh at the same time the meridional variation of wind patterns is visible in the marginal seas of nio such as the as and bob due to the monsoonal reversal and locally generated wind systems for example besides the prevailing sw and ne monsoon the as also experiences regional winds known as shamal and makran winds that are characterized by the low level jets llj in the middle east such as strong northwesterly and northerly jets respectively aboobacker and shanas 2018 anoopet al 2020 shamal winds occur during the summer and winter often extending to the as and reaching the west coast of india vinod kumar et al 2014 a recent study by anoopet al 2020 delineated the transformation of northerly llj into makran winds that modifies by the presence of makran mountains along the southern pakistan coast the wave field in the indian ocean region varies in response to the prevailing wind systems according to seasons and the generation area for better knowledge few of the examinations included in this work were conducted in the sub basins the wind patterns and wind generated wave fields are domain sensitive for example a comparatively strong wind field is observed in the south of 35 whereas weak wind field in the tropical io as far as the nio is concerned the seasonal reversing governs the wind wave characteristics and the as is largely influenced prior study for swell waves by alves 2006 sub divided the indian ocean sector into three areas such as tnio tropical north indian ocean the tsio tropical south indian ocean and the etsi extra tropical south indian ocean their classification alves 2006 was based on the non interrupted storm tracks and the etsi considered was region bounded between 25 and 80 s recent study by sreelakshmi and bhaskaran 2020a 2020b made the divisions based on the diversified nature of wind and wave characteristics for the entire indian ocean into six sectors in which the sub domains 5 and 6 together represents the zonal area between 35 and 63 s in which the easterly winds over the tsio and westerly winds in the extra tropical regions are mutually exclusive the indian ocean region sub divided into six sectors are believed to better represent the trends in wind and wave climate studies therefore the entire io is divided into six sub sectors according to the wind patterns and to be exclusively separated from one another which has explained by sreelakshmi and bhaskaran 2020a sreelakshmi and bhaskaran 2020b fig 1 and table 1 illustrate and give essential details of the various sub sectors 3 data european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf provides global climate hind cast data since 1980 s and atmospheric reanalysis era5 is the latest among them hersbach and dee 2012 hersbachet al 2019 era interim the predecessor of era5 was widely accepted aboobacker and shanas 2018 anoop et al 2015 and era5 products are now popular pertaining to the analyses of atmospheric ocean and land physics this study used 41 years of wave information including significant wave heights of combined wind sea and swell waves swh total swell waves swhsw and wind seas swhws from 1979 through august 2019 the data are retrieved in 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution from the copernicus climate change service c3s hersbachet al 2019 in monthly averaged time frequency the calibrated and merged satellite observations are beneficial in short term atmospheric and ocean climate studies also the satellite observations are used to validate the model results as it has extensive spatial coverage whereas the in situ records are limited to specific locations however the validation and correction processes of the merged satellite data are crucial and essential in this study a bias corrected multi platform altimeter swh from ifremer cersat is used to validate the era5 swh of combined swell and wind seas data for the entire io the corrected swath files retrieved from ifremer cersat is further interpolated using brat basic radar altimeter toolbox 4 2 1 toolbox and the final dataset is of spatially homogenized monthly mean swh for a shorter span of 25 years 1992 2016 the basic radar altimeter toolbox brat 4 2 1 toolbox was used to process the corrected swath files retrieved from ifremer cersat the processed dataset is a 1 1 interval grid box where the values at each grid point represent the swh values covering the study domain the nearest neighbor interpolation method was used on the brat post processed data to address the sparseness and sampling problems associated with satellite data further the dataset was subjected to a 5 5 cell gaussian smoothing digital filter using an approximate radius of 2 8 standard deviation that resulted in the final smoothed product covering the study area this procedure filters the random or unusual spikes in the final processed datasets the final dataset is a spatially homogenized monthly mean hs for a shorter span of 25 years 1992 2016 the details of data used for validation was carried out for all the sub sectors fig 1 table 1 between era5 and altimeter swh total significant wave height covering the time window from 1992 to 2016 at spatial grid resolution of 1 1 on monthly scale for a detailed investigation on the variability and trend of wave height in the io the monthly parameters of swh swhsw and swhws from era5 1979 2019 at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution were constructed to seasonal and annual scales following the imd indian meteorological department pune nomenclature 3 1 methodology to compare the performance of reanalysis and model products with the space borne data the following quantitative assessments have been carried out such as the correlation coefficient r the root mean squared error rmse the average error bias ae the average absolute error aae stowet al 2009 and the percentage of bias pb dabrowski et al 2014 r i 1 n o i o r i r i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n r i r 2 r m s e i 1 n r i o i 2 n a e i 1 n r i o i n a a e r i

averages respectively the correlation coefficient r pertains to the relationship of the relative movements of two variables and the value ranges between 1 and 1 the zero value infers no correlation and the positive sign indicates that the variables vary linearly if the variables are in phase the correlation coefficient value is expected to be near one the bias average error infers how far the

significant wave height is the highest one third of the combined swell waves and wind seas in a given record however for era5 waves are derived from a spectral model hs is obtained from the zeroth order spectral moment area under the spectral curve as there are no individual waves to compute one third of the highest as it is derived from the wave spectrum using the relation h s 4 01 m 0 where m 0 refers to the area under the spectral curve previous reports postulate intra inter seasonal as well as annual variability of swh and wind speed muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 young and ribal 2019 anoop et al 2015 sreelakshmi and bhaskaran 2020a this study carries out different aspects of investigations on significant wave height such as climatology trend and variability in seasonal and annual scales for the climatology and trend analysis the seasons are selected according to the imd nomenclature such as winter jan feb season1 pre monsoon mar may season2 monsoon june sep season3 and post monsoon oct dec season4 simple linear regression analysis is used here to study the wave trend with a statistical significance test and represented spatially to get a better understanding of the domain it was performed using a poly fitting function and the slope y mx c m representing the slope c representing intercept x representing time in years and y the corresponding value of swh provides a quantification on the changes per year the statistical significance of trend values are calculated using the mann kendal trend test mann 1945 for 95 confidence limit pca eof analysis was conducted to examine the various spatio temporal variability modes and patterns it helps to represent the data according to the variance by performing eigen value decomposition wherein pca provides the measure of temporal variation and the eof attributes to its spatial variability wang and chang 2007 this method essentially captures the non linearity and high dimensional characteristics for a given dataset preserving significant patterns and their variability thereby aiding the users to derive meaningful information for data interpretation and analysis the eigen value together with its corresponding eof and principal components pcs represents the mode of variability arranged in the descending order of eigen values however the signs of each eof pca loadings are arbitrary and only their relative amplitudes and sign patterns are exact jollife and cadima 2016 in this study eof pca analysis is carried out by applying the svd algorithm on the datasets prepared moreover the study focuses on the descriptive analysis of the eof pca patterns rather the inferential sign values all investigations are conducted separately for swell waves and wind seas for seasonal and annual scales to understand the individual characteristics the entire basin is domain sensitive and to conveniently analyze the southern and northern hemisphere together the seasons are selected as austral winter october march and summer april september hereafter mentioned as season1 and season2 respectively from the variability analysis twelve locations were identified from the domain that exhibited more significant variability in the eof first three modes torrence and compo 1998 provide more details on wavelet analysis along with their significance levels torrence and compo 1998 wavelet transform is a powerful technique to analyze the frequency components of a signal from the given dataset techniques using fourier transform can also be used to analyze the frequency components however if this technique is applied for the entire time duration under consideration one cannot interpret at what time instant a particular frequency rise a short time fourier transform uses sliding window for spectrogram that provides information in both time and frequency scales however there is a constraint with the window length that can limit the frequency resolution in this context wavelet transforms serve as powerful technique to provide solution to the above mentioned problem wavelet transforms works in the principle based on small wavelets with limited duration the first type of wavelet transform is the orthogonal haar wavelet addison 2018 a second type of orthogonal wavelet termed as meyer wavelet was formulated in 1985 wavelet transform algorithm has found numerous applications in the field of signal processing in diverse disciplines complex wavelets have fourier transforms that is zero for negative frequencies advantages of using a complex wavelet is its capability in separating the phase and amplitude components of the signal the morlet wavelet is the most commonly used complex wavelet that can be expressed in the form addison 2018 1 ψ t π 1 4 e i 2 π f 0 t e 2 π f 0 2 2 e t 2 2 the term f 0 represents the central frequency of the mother wavelet and the second term in the bracket is the correction term it corrects the non zero mean of the complex sinusoid multiplied by the gaussian term when f 0 0 the correction term is negligible and can be ignored in this case the morelet wavelet transform addison 2018 can be represented in the form 2 ψ t 1 π 1 4 e i 2 π f 0 t e t 2 2 in eqn young 1999 the wavelet is of the form having a complex sinusoid e i 2 π f 0 t with a gaussian envelope e t 2 2 the term π 1 4 is a normalization factor ensuring that the wavelet has unit energy it should be noted that eqn young 1999 has a non zero mean meaning that the zeroth frequency term of the corresponding energy spectra is non zero and its applicability holds good with minimal error when f 0 0 the fourier transform of the morlet wavelet addison 2018 can be expressed in the form 3 ψ ˆ f π 1 4 2 e 2 π f 2 π f 0 2 2 representing a gaussian function displaced along the frequency axis by f 0 characteristics frequency is chosen for the analytic morlet wavelet the characteristic frequency of the mother wavelet changes as per the wavelet scale a in the form addison 2018 4 f c f 0 a the square of the magnitude of the fourier transform is the energy spectrum expressed as addison 2018 5 ψ ˆ f 2 2 π 1 2 e 2 π f 2 π f 0 2 the morlet wavelet transform can be used for continuous wavelet analysis and used in the present study utilizing the monthly swh observations for the selected twelve locations from the eof analysis 4 results and discussion the indian ocean region due to its unique geographic setting has been considered in this study to assess and evaluate the variability of wind generated waves utilizing era5 data some recent studies postulate the modulation of long distant swells propagating from the southern ocean influencing the local wind wave climate of the north indian ocean region nayak et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 the climatological study using era5 for separated swell and wind seas by muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 have provided valuable information however the knowledge on variability and trend aspects needs to be further investigated therefore it is worthwhile to study the swell and wind seas spatial and temporal characteristics this section includes more details on i validation of reanalysis data ii annual as well as iii seasonal climatology and trends of swell waves and wind seas iv inter annual and v inter seasonal spatio temporal variability and vi wavelet spectrum analysis of selected potential locations of wind wave variability portrayed for the io 4 1 validation of era5 data with altimeter this section provides detail on the validation of era5 combined significant wave height swh with that of altimeters the altimeter instruments have a good along track resolution whereas the cross track resolution is of hundreds of kilometers and the repeat cycle varies between days to few weeks depending upon the satellite orbit this low spatial temporal resolution can however miss some of the extreme events and hence the altimeter data may not represent the ground truth always young et al 2012 young et al 2017 though the repeat cycle is of 35 days swh and wind speed derived from saral altika was found satisfactory for the north indian ocean region where swh was less than 4 m and wind speed less than 13 m s for the analysis period kumar et al 2015 their study indicates that significant wave height from altika compared well with buoy data having a negligible bias of 0 02 m and small rmse of 0 15 m however the altimetry has low credibility for near coastal regions associated with signal contamination due to partial reflections of ocean and land surfaces gomiset al 2012 another study postulated that significant wave heights from satellites are over estimated at range of low wave height less than 1 m and under estimated for wave heights greater than 2 m park et al 2013 besides such limitations young et al 2017 has reported a consistent agreement for altimeter wave height with buoy measurements and using the altimeter source data one can estimate 100 year return period of extreme significant wave height within a 5 error of buoy data vinoth and young 2011 hence altimetry wave data is highly beneficial for the validation of era5 swh the altimeter wave record is available from 1985 and in this study 25 years of data have been used 1992 2017 to evaluate the swh of era5 the model skill assessment tests such as aae ae pb rmse correlation coefficient r and stds standard deviation are found to be broadly used and are calculated for swh in this study the calculations are carried out separately for all the six sub domains and the statistical details are tabulated in table 2 the correlation coefficient of altimeter waves with era5 is found to be 0 97 for the entire io regime and the agreement between era5 and altimeter annual average swh is excellent the rmse of swh from era5 is calculated as 0 29 m for the entire io when it is higher in the etsi 37 cm and less over the as and bob 21 cm higher rms error signifies a higher risk of residuals in the regime of the stronger wave field and more precise for moderate wave fields the aae is found to be 30 cm in the etsi regions 5 and 6 whereas for the nio and tsio absolute average bias is in the range of 15 18 cm the negative sign of ae obtained for all the sub basins indicate that the era5 data underestimates the altimeter satellite observations the correlation coefficients for all the sub domains are measured to be above 0 9 which indicates a good correlation of the reanalysis data and is excellent for nio and tsio 0 94 regions table 2 from this study the era5 swh is proved good for the entire domain as well as over different sub sectors of the io and hence found reasonable to carry out further analysis 4 2 annual seasonal climatology and trends of indian ocean waves the io is unique as compared to the other ocean basins due to the monsoon wind system reversal and it plays a major role in moderating the wind and wave climate as far as the variability of wind speed is considered it is reported to be higher in the nio as compared to sio however the climatological ranges of wind speed and total significant wave height are higher in the sio in addition the wave field of a basin is superimposed of locally and remotely generated waves hence it is essential to understand the climatology and the variability of separated waves i e swell and wind seas by which the significance of wind and remotely forced swells over the wave field of a basin can be explicitly understood the following sub section discusses on the annual and seasonal climatology as well as the trends of swh of swell waves swells and wind seas for io fig 2 illustrates the long term annual distribution of swell waves and wind seas left panel in the io along with their trends right panel using 41 years of era5 wave products the statistical significance of trend values is calculated using mann kendal test and the values within 95 confidence limit are marked in the corresponding trend figures annual climatological swh of combined waves swells and wind seas varies between 0 and 4 5 m the total swell heights 0 3 5 m are higher than the wind seas 0 3 m in most of the regions except the as the swell waves and wind seas are almost comparable in the as 1 1 5 m and the etsi indicating the wind wave generation muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 for most of the locations in the bob and tsio the swell wave heights varied between 1 5 and 2 5 m the westerly wind system in the so belt is known to be quite strong so analogous to this the highest annual wave heights swells and wind seas are found to be in the so belt 40 60 precisely between 95 105 e and 85 95 e for swells and wind seas respectively potential zones of wind generated waves in etsi now onwards further these locations are investigated for temporal variability and trends of swh which has been explained in the section 4 1 in the context of wind seas the maximum range of climatological swh is higher over the etsi 3 m as compared 1 5 m to the rest the apparent wind seas in the central tsio and off the somalia coast are in the range of about 1 5 m the southeasterly trade winds govern the wind seas in tsio and the strong cross equatorial winds of the findlater jet findlater 1969 near somalia the spatial trend left panel of fig 2 for swell waves is positive 0 1 5 cm year in the io specifically to the north of 60 s interestingly the east coast of australia the southern african coast and central etsi 60 e 110 e showed a noticeable increasing trend of swell wave activity along the 40 s belt the trend in wind seas appears to be decreasing whereas the complete so westerly belt exhibited a growing wind seas trend both the mentioned locations having the highest wind seas and swell wave activity showed an increasing trend 0 5 cm year annual total swh were reported to be increasing in the as aboobaker et al 2011 whereas the shamal swells found decreasing the present study signifies that the trend in total swells is found to be rising in the as the seasonal variability of mean wind speed in etsi is lower compared to nio though the wind speeds are the highest therefore it is worthwhile to examine the trend of wind seas and swells seasonal wise understanding of wave climate will help to understand the intra annual variation of the segregated wave trends hence the different seasonal distribution of swells and wind seas along with their trends in the io are represented in fig 3 interestingly from figs 2 and 3 it is noticed that the locations detected with the highest wave heights in the etsi remain unaltered in all seasons and are found to have increasing trends during all seasons swell waves exhibit a growing trend in the io and noticeably in the as 0 9 1 cm year during the monsoonal period the northern as and off oman coast exhibit an increasing trend around 0 8 cm year similarly the eastern coast of australia as well as the southern african coast experienced an increasing swell wave activity in all seasons at the rate of 0 6 0 9 cm year 4 3 spatial and temporal variability of indian ocean waves 4 3 1 inter annual variability this section deals with the geographical locations that have experienced higher inter annual variability of wind and waves using different modes of eof eigen vectors also pca analysis included in this section intends to investigate the relative contribution of wind seas and swells on the total significant wave height variability fig 4 illustrates the inter annual variability of swh swhsw and swgws in terms of eigen vectors eof pcs from the analysis of 41 years of era 5 data the first mode of variability represents 80 82 and 70 of the total variability of each mentioned wave respectively for the three cases the variability exhibited is highest in the etsi however the relative higher range of wind seas 0 0 012 indicates the significant changes that occurred in the wind speed potential zones of wind generated waves in the etsi particularly the active wind seas generation area exhibited high variability in the first eof mode pertaining to total significant wave height as well as in the partitioned wind seas however the pc1 sub plot fig 4 shows that the total significant wave height synchronizes very well and in phase with that of swells swhs indicating the influence of swell wave variability on the total swh nevertheless the higher modes for swh pc2 pc3 are in phase with the wind seas to understand the other dominant aspects of variability more eigen modes of waves are to be analyzed the second mode for swh 1 6 and that of wind seas 2 7 exhibited a zonal dipole variability in the etsi 40 s 63 s indicating the influence of southern annular mode sam the correlation of pc2 of swh as well as wind seas with the southern annular mode index sami http www nerc bas ac uk icd gjma sam html are observed to be moderate 0 61 0 8 and significant 95 confidence level the first mode of annual wind seas from fig 4 illustrates a noticeable variability in the gulf of mannar and the south eastern tip of the sri lanka the first mode of swell wave variability in the as is concentrated in the northeast off gujarat and maharashtra coast and southeast off kerala and mangalore coast in the context of as previous studies have pointed out that monsoonal winds accounts for the dominant mode of variability queffeulou 2004 anoop et al 2015 at the same time the as is observed with shamal swells during december and march makran swells during october and dominant so swells during pre monsoon season from fig 4 the dominant mode of inter annual variability of swh in the as has a mixed pattern representing the active contributions from wind seas and swells in the bob the variability due to swell and total significant wave height are comparable and both these observations indicate that significant participation of swell waves in the inter annual wave variability this observation cannot be proved using the pca variation of the entire io because pca values are the temporal variation of the area that has experienced higher variability and thus may not be applicable to all regions therefore pca analyses were carried out in the identified six sub domains fig 1 separately subplots of fig 5 illustrate the first principal component pc1 of swhsw swhws and swh for the selected sub domains it is noticed from the fig 5 that the pc1 of swh and swhsw are synchronous and in phase from 1979 to 2018 consistently for all the regions hence inferred that the dominant variability of the io wave fields is accounted for mainly due to the swell waves however it is to be noted that the wind seas are also synchronous with the total swh except in few historical years in the as and so where the wind and wind generated waves are essential to be considered the variability of swhws has a significant influence on the swh thus the variability patterns at these regions are a function of swell and wind seas the eof3 of swh is also worth noticeable in the etsi and strongly concentrated towards the pacific and atlantic sectors of the so at the same time the pc3 of swhsw and swh are moderately correlated 0 5 0 49 with sami 95 confidence level whereas it is not significant for wind seas this is because of the active propagation of distant swells from the pacific and atlantic sector of so alves 2006 fig 6 illustrates the pc2 of the three waves in the west and east sectors of the etsi interestingly the swh are found to be synchronized and in phase with swhws in region six and swhsw in region 5 from the correlation analysis of pc2 of swh swhws and swhsw with sami the east region6 sector exhibited a coefficient of 0 75 0 77 and 0 66 respectively with 95 confidence level as far as the west sector region 5 is considered pc2 of the wind seas are observed with a significant correlation of 0 75 with sami 95 confidence level in contrast total swh and swhsw are found to be insignificant thus it is deduced from the analysis that the sam is significant in the eastern etsi as compared to the western sector this observation is substantiated by a previous study in which the south west australian coast has shown a large decreasing variability whereas the east etsi exhibited marginal variability fig 7 a hemer et al 2010 of winter mean altimeter derived swh and show moderate correlation with sami in the sh in the tsio and bob the variability due to swhws is high but the swh are majorly controlled by the swhsw at the same time in the scs the swell and wind seas are well harmonized with each other there is a gradual increase and decrease in the pc1 of swhsw as well as swh during 1979 2018 which are significantly noticeable for all regions a decreasing trend negative variability during 1987 1995 and increasing trend during 2000 2012 are found for the nio on an average the variability of the waves is found increasing in the second phase from 2000 the year 1997 experienced exceptional variability in wind seas in the nio and similarly in the years 1985 1987 2010 and 2015 these historic years were recorded to have higher enso whereas the phenomena were highly significant in 1996 in the tsio and the etsi however the swh are less contributed by the swhws variability as far as the dominant mode is considered at the same time off the west coast of australia there are remarkable variations in the swell field mode two and mode three from the third mode certain regions are noticed with a higher concentration of swell variability such as the east coast of indonesia archipelagic waters of maldives off somalia coast off south oman coast northern as and the western indian sub continental coast the higher swell variability in the as accounts due to the shamal and makran swells for mode1 of inter annual variability 66 of the total io variability of swells wind seas is dominated by the variability arising due to swells it is worth noticing that the inter annual variability of swell waves third mode has a good correlation with that of the annual trend indicating unidentified climate variability 4 3 2 inter seasonal variability the spatial distribution of swh in a region differs with seasons intra season and the inter seasonal variability attributes to the inter annual variation for a convenient seasonal analysis of nh and sh the seasons are taken as two in this section such as season1 october to march and season2 april to september by which the seasons of the asian summer monsoon australian summer monsoon as shamal and makran waves are conserved in season2 the results included here are from the analyses of the inter seasonal anomaly of swh swhsw swhws and wind speed figs 7 and 8 illustrate the first three dominant modes eof and pcs corresponding to season1 and season2 from the primary mode of eof eof1 and pc1 shown in figs 7 and 8 it is observed that the variability of swh 92 7 of the total variance in season1 and 89 in season2 and swhsw 93 in season1 and 92 in season2 are synchronous and is in phase with time thus the variation of swhsw in both the seasons has been majorly contributed to the total wave field in both seasons the highest variabilities are identified in the as scs and etsi in the arabian sea eof1 patterns of swh are seen to be a mixture of swhsw from the north as and swhws off somalia jet in both seasons the second and third modes of variability in the nio are due to the swhsw waves propagated from the north as whereas the north south shift of so westerly belt sam and the australian summer monsoon north westerly wind are responsible for the second mode variability of total swh in the sio the second mode of swh waves in the two seasons are rather consistent with swhws than swhsw further the seasonal pc2 values were also correlated with the seasonal values of sami i e austral autumn mam winter jja spring son and summer djf and are tabulated in table 3 the calculated coefficient values indicated that pc2 of swh swhws and swhsw for season1 october march are seen to be significantly correlated with the sami in austral summer 0 8 0 8 0 34 and for season2 the correlations are found well and significant in austral winter 0 79 0 8 and 0 7 the correlation coefficients mentioned above as significant corresponds to 95 confidence level also from the analysis of season2 the correlations are seen as moderate and significant 0 3 0 5 in autumn mam and spring son the significant influences of sam in autumn as well as winter waves are consistent with a previous study conducted by hemer et al 2010 hemer et al 2010 the third and fourth modes of eof in season2 fig 8 explains a bimodal dipole signature in the west and east of the etsi resembling an elongated s curve this observation is consistent with the inter annual variability eof3 of total swh but the correlation of swh or swhws is not significant in the seasonal analyses in contrast pc3 of the swhsw are moderately correlated in both the seasons 0 45 and 0 42 with a 95 confidence level the inconsistency of the third mode for swhsw variability with that of swhws and swh indicates the propagation of swhsw from the near so sectors to the io sector however the contribution of the propagated swhsw over the swh in the second and other higher modes are found to be poor along with this observation it is interesting to notice that the pc2 of inter annual variability for swh over the region6 east etsi which was recognized to be synchronous and in phase with swhws whereas it was swhsw for the region5 west etsi therefore it is inferred that the swh in the eastern sector of the etsi is due to the swhws and that for the western sector is accounted from swhsw a separate pca analysis in the region6 for the inter seasonal variability of swh depicted that season2 is more consistent with the sami with a correlation coefficient of 0 63 and for season1 is found to be 0 4 similarly region5 exhibited a significant correlation between swh and sami as 0 33 and 0 6 in season1 and 2 respectively from the study we identified a number of locations that have experienced significant variability such as off the somalia coast the north arabian sea north and the central bay of bengal south china sea south and north of australia and different locations in the etsi detailed in table 3 and the frequency of dominant variability are examined through wavelet analysis 4 3 3 wavelet spectrum analysis this section deals with a detailed investigation on the wavelet spectrum analysis in those locations where the variability is found to be significant a total of twelve sites are selected from the entire io six each from sio and nio with the help of spatial variability gradients pertaining to the first three modes of eof the coordinates and details of each site are mentioned in table 4 the continuous morlet wave transform is mostly used in the atmospheric and oceanic studies which consists of a plane wave modified by gaussian envelope and proven with high precision yi et al 2014 one can find various freely available wavelet transform algorithms developed by different researchers in matlab environment this study utilizes the torrence s code for the morlet continuous wavelet transform the monthly time series of selected locations is then subjected to wavelet spectrum analysis and the wavelet chosen for the study is morlet at 90 confidence level for the red noise process figs 9 and 10 correspond to the six locations situated in the sio and nio respectively each location is described with four subplots a b c and d that represent the wavelet power spectrum for the significant wave height global wavelet power spectrum which is time averaged along the x axis the power averaged time series for 2 8 semi annual and 8 16 annual monthly components the red dashed line in subplot b represents the 90 confidence level and the thick black contour in sub plot a highlights the time frequency region higher than the specified limit fig 9 shows the six locations situated in the southern indian ocean 0 eq 70 s each of these locations exhibited a dominant 90 confidence level and continuous wave power spectrum along with the annular frequency and sparse distribution of power along with the intra annular frequency fig 9 subplots a b in order to understand the temporal variation of annular and intra annular frequency an averaged variance for 2 8 months and 8 16 months scales were taken out and represented in the sub plots c and d respectively a decreasing and increasing phase is observed in the annular variance subplot d for locations 1 2 and 3 located in the etsi and the shift occurred during 2006 2010 the time series trend is demonstrated with the best fitting linear regression line and the rate of change is also mentioned in the sub plot that explains the direction of change the annual scale averaged variance is found to have a decreasing pattern for all the six locations a consistent but a slow decline is noticed for the location 6 which is a potential variability location in the western etsi fig 10 represents the six points selected in the north indian ocean and the first two locations are near the west of somalia coast and the north arabian sea these are the only two regions in the io where the continuous significant power is perceived along with the annual and semi annular frequency in context to the north as the semi annular variance is noticed to be significant and consistent since 1989 90 sub plot a of p8 fig 10 the subplots a and b depicted an increasing annual as well as semi annular variance indicating the increasing trend of makran wave activity in the north as markers p9 p10 and p11 are the locations situated in the bob precisely north head bob central bob and south of sri lanka coast these locations exhibited a dominant and continuous annular variation for p9 and p10 the annular variance is found to have decadal breaks similarly there is a decadal break for average variance in the semi annular variance off the somalia coast at the same time the annular variance at p11 was uniform throughout the past 41 years the south china sea p12 is detected with vigorous wave activity comparable to that of the etsi in contrast to the sio the potential locations of nio exhibited an increasing pattern of averaged variance 5 conclusion the study reports on a climatological analysis of significant wave heights pertaining to swell waves wind seas and combined total swell waves and wind seas utilizing era5 ecmwf re analysis fifth datasets about 41 years of era5 data 1979 2019 was used to investigate the trends and spatio temporal variability in the indian ocean basin from the validation of the total significant wave height of the era5 with calibrated multi platform satellite altimetry data the performance of era5 proved to be good for the entire io as well as for the various sub sectors of the domain a total correlation coefficient of 0 97 is obtained for the io in a time window of 25 years between 1992 and 2016 and not less than 0 9 for the different sectors the rms error and absolute errors are found higher in the extra tropical regions 0 37 m 0 3 m indicating a high risk of residuals in the data for stronger wave conditions however the errors obtained in the arabian sea and bay of bengal are minimal rmse 0 21 m aae 0 16 m that imply the quality of data for the moderate range of significant wave heights the study signifies that the etsi which has been experienced the highest wave activity showed an increasing trend for both wind seas and swells 0 5 1 cm year in the context of wind seas the north south movement of the westerly wind belt has caused a pole ward increasing and equator ward decreasing trend in the etsi during monsoon the northern arabian sea and for regions off the oman coast the swell wave activity showed an increasing trend 0 8 cm year on the contrary the activity of wind seas in the arabian sea and the head bay of bengal are found to be decreasing the aforementioned trend observations fall within a 5 significance level according to the mann kendal trend test further the inter annual and inter seasonal variability are examined using eof analysis and the potential regions of higher variability are identified from the pc1 analysis it is evident that swells play an active role and a major contributor to the dominant mode of the total swh variability in all regions of the io basin in the nio the variability of wind seas has a direct linkage with the enso years however the total swh is least affected the second dominant mode of inter annual variability in the etsi is associated with the southern annular mode sam and found more prominent in the eastern etsi the pc2 of total swh is consistent with wind seas for eastern etsi whereas the effect of swells dominates in the western etsi in the same context pc3 of swhsw is moderately correlated with the sami indicating the presence of distant swells that propagate from the so sectors the seasonal variability of swhsw are also consistent with sami in addition the correlation of pc2 with the sami is found significant particularly during austral summer january march and winter july september based on the analysis of seasonal and annual variability there are 12 identified regions in the io sector that experienced higher variability furthermore the designated 12 locations are investigated using the wave spectrum analysis for combined significant wave height the arabian sea exhibited dominant variability both in the annular and semi annular frequency scales apart from the annular scales the sio experienced enhanced wave activity in the intra annular scale the wave spectrum analysis reveals that regions in the north arabian sea show increased annual variance during the past 41 years further the locations in the southern io exhibited a decreasing annual scale variance in contrary to the nio basin credit

21774,the present study analyzed 41 years of era 5 wind wave data 1979 2019 to understand the long term trend inter annual and inter seasonal variability of total wind generated waves wind seas and swell waves in the indian ocean io the significant wave height swh of era 5 was validated with the multi platform calibrated altimetry wave height the correlation coefficient of swh was about 0 97 considering the entire domain and it is greater than 0 9 for different sectors in the io basin the absolute and root mean square errors in different sub domains are observed in the range of 0 16 0 3 m and 0 2 0 37 m respectively and found higher in the extra tropical io etsi the etsi showed an increasing trend for both wind seas and swell waves 0 5 1 cm year in context to wind seas shift in the westerly wind belt leads to pole ward increasing and equator ward decreasing trend in the northern arabian sea the swell waves exhibited an increasing trend 0 8 cm year during the south west monsoon meanwhile the wind sea activity over the arabian sea and head bay of bengal are seen to decrease the regions in the io that experienced higher variability of swh in the last four decades are identified using eof empirical orthogonal function analysis the dominant mode of principal component analysis signified the explicit contribution of swell waves over the total significant wave height the second and third modes of variability are majorly contributed by wind seas especially in the south io attributed due to the southern annular mode sam the wavelet spectrum analysis conducted at the identified locations of higher variability manifests the domain sensitivity by which the makran coast experienced an increased average variance in annular and semi annular scales keywords indian ocean total significant wave height wind seas swell waves trend variability era 5 eof pcas 1 introduction the ocean surface is characterized by superimposed wave systems that comprises of locally generated wind seas and the remotely forced swell waves long period surface gravity waves most of the time the global ocean is dominated by storm generated swell waves semedo et al 2011 whereas the wind seas are prominent in basins that experience strong prevailing wind system in context to the io geographical regions in the so experience the strongest wind westerly and wind wave fields young 1999 interestingly the wave heights of separated swell waves and wind seas are almost comparable over this belt the regions off west and north west australia are prone to high wave activity attributed due to the australian summer monsoon suppiah 1992 wheeler and mcbride 2007 the wind wave climate of the nio north indian ocean is unique due to the reversing wind system from asian monsoon slingo et al 2005 schott and mccreary 2001 a number of studies have illustrated on the sea state along the coastal regions of india which is significantly influenced and modified by the swell wave field amrutha et al 2015 johnsonet al 2012 gowthaman et al 2013 sanil kumar et al 2011 moreover from the climatological aspect the io is dominated by the swell waves muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 in all months except the monsoonal months in general along the west coast of india swells are superlative during the south west sw monsoon season nayak et al 1989 in addition the nio is also influenced by swell wave field resulting from nw winds in the arabian sea shamal and makran waves and the so swells aboobacker et al 2011 aboobacker and shanas 2018 anoopet al 2020 shamal winds are the strong north westerly low level wind system that develop due to the dynamic interaction between upper level jet streams and lower tropospheric pressure systems vinod kumar et al 2014 these wind systems exist in the arabian peninsula and that can extend until the west coast of india with a decreasing magnitude from north to south aboobacker and shanas 2018 the shamal events are known to have significant influence on wind driven circulation in the arabian sea samiksha et al 2014 more details on the onset intensity and duration of shamal events in the arabian peninsula and its distribution in the arabian sea are available in vinod kumar et al 2014 and yu et al 2016 on the other hand the periodic northerly lower atmosphere jets in the mid latitude belt of the sub tropical asian regions are modified by the makran mountain ranges in the central south coast of pakistan where the winds are predominantly in the west northwest and northeast directions this wind system modified by the makran mountain ranges generates a new wave system that propagates in the arabian sea as makran swells prevalent during the months from october to may a study by nayak et al 2013 nayak et al 2013 reported that swells generated from so region influences the local wind wave climate of nio within four days semedo et al 2011 semedo et al 2011 advocated on the existence of strong wind wave climatology for the indian sector in the southern ocean highlighting the importance of the highest seasonal mean higher swell and significant wave height activity along with maximum winds were found during the two extreme seasons december january february djf and june july august jja nevertheless the so swells that propagate over very long distances circumscribing the hemisphere and reaching various coastal destinations undergo dissipation of wave energy as a function of distance hemer et al 2010 and the mean wave period ts declines towards the north of tsio above 30 s however no warning system has come up to detect swell propagation and thus it is indeed imperative to understand the regional characteristics of swell waves in the ocean basin there are ample studies concerned with the indian ocean waves and its climatological aspects still one can hardly find few detailed analyses of separate wind seas and swell waves in the io muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 thus it is crucial to understand the significant contribution of swells and wind seas over the total significant wave height swh their characteristics trends as well as variability in the io therefore this study focuses on the analyses of swell waves and wind seas further to reveal their relative significance over the total swh seasonal characteristics and spatio temporal variability in the io in the context of waves parameters like wind stress air sea interaction energy transfer small scale currents ardhuinet al 2017 are indeed essential and vital in governing the generation and directionality of waves concerning to the long term variability atmospheric parameters plays the primary role in which surface air temperature sea surface temperature sea level pressure and winds actively participate mohan and bhaskaran 2019 in a changing climate scenario the global wind and waves are also experiencing an increasing trend young and ribal 2019 from the same study the south of io has not exhibited a clear indication of the trend for mean significant wave height swh whereas the higher percentile swh has a more positive trend at the same time the trend in mean and higher percentile winds shows a far more positive trend over large areas of the global ocean in concern with these two contradictory observations further investigation on the wind wave climate are crucial and to be specific a study on separated swell and wind seas characteristics over regional scales in ocean basins is essential from the synoptic analysis of observational satellite altimetry the maximum wave height in so and the annual mean swh in the bay of bengal bob was observed to be increased patra and bhaskaran 2016 gupta et al 2015 during 2002 2012 the trend of swh over the io was figured out with a less positive rate during 1999 2019 than the accounted rate in 1979 1999 muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 these studies urge to take a look into the trends of separate swell waves and wind seas to establish the linkage between the trends of winds and waves which have not attempted yet the information of ocean waves can be extracted from in situ or model products the voluntary observation ship vos records and satellite swath observations from the in situ account are beneficial in this regard these observation data require interpolation for spatial integrity and the latter is widely accepted since 1989 ers1 the satellite altimeters have provided information on the wave parameters however a careful calibration is necessary to be done for the altimeter observational data queffeulou 2003 2004 sepulveda et al 2015 french research institute for exploitation of the sea ifremer cersat provides a bias corrected altimeter derived wind and wave records for the period 1991 2017 in which 10 satellite records are been synchronized this public data set was found beneficial in investigating the trends variability and model validation of wave heights for different domains patra and bhaskaran 2016 gupta et al 2015 patra and bhaskaran 2017 the reanalysis data from numerical models has advantages in the length and resolution of the data record which is apparent for synoptic analyses ecmwf is a popular public domain repository of global earth science reanalysis products era interim is the fourth generation atmospheric model of ecmwf that was widely popularized among the scientific community deeet al 2011 later it was replaced by era5 fifth generation ecmwf re analysis in 2018 with higher spatial resolution and better model physics and the products are available through c3s hersbach and dee 2012 hoffmannet al 2019 era5 provides wave parameters of separated swell and wind seas which can be a highly beneficial resource for the present study muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 examined the climatology and trends of indian ocean surface wind and waves utilizing 39 years 1979 2017 of ecmwf era5 reanalysis data the era5 significant wave height and maximum wave height showed a good match with the measured in situ buoy data in coastal and deep waters with a respective bias of 0 29 m and 0 18 m respectively also their study mentioned that during tropical cyclones the era5 under estimated the significant wave height and maximum wave height as compared to the buoy data by 2 7 and 1 4 respectively with a larger bias approx 0 69 m their study muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 using scatter plots performed an inter comparison between buoy and era5 parameters for locations ratnagiri west coast of india and gopalpur east coast of india examining the maximum wave height hmax significant wave height hs mean and peak wave periods also their study using scatter plots compared the significant wave height and mean wave periods for deep water locations ad02 in the arabian sea and ds3 in the bay of bengal during the periods 2012 and 2003 respectively for the buoy ad02 located in arabian sea the estimated buoy mean hs and era5 mean hs was 1 78 m and 1 71 m respectively the respective rmse and bias were 0 22 m and 0 07 m for the location ds3 in the bay of bengal the buoy and era5 mean hs were 1 61 m and 1 80 m respectively with rmse of 0 29 m and bias of 0 18 m the annual maximum hsmax measured at ratnagiri was 8 6 m whereas the same obtained from era5 was 7 6 m indicating an under estimation of approx 12 the measured annual maximum hs for the same location was 5 2 m whereas from era5 it was 4 1 m in general the era5 under estimated the monthly maximum hs ranging between 9 and 39 whereas the monthly maximum hsmax were under estimated in era5 by 2 34 wind generated waves simulated during fair weather conditions derived from era5 reanalysis product is found satisfactory with only exception for extreme weather events like cyclones which is a limitation the authors agree that typhoon induced wave heights accounts only a minor part of the wave climate global evaluation of era5 wind and waves demonstrated that the maximum errors in era5 are associated with the extreme sea states of extra tropical systems and tropical cyclones parsons et al 2018 there are studies that performed inter comparison of wind and wave data from reanalysis products sterl and caires 2005 has mentioned the underestimation of the era 40 wind field during extreme weather conditions stopa and cheung 2014 made an inter comparison of wind speeds and wave heights for 30 years from reanalysis products era interim and ncep cfsr utilizing altimetry and buoy observations to assess their consistency in space and time scales both these products showed good spatial homogeneity with consistent error levels in both northern and southern hemispheres their study stopa and cheung 2014 revealed that era interim had a better homogeneity with time recommending its importance for modeling long term processes however it has limitations in the analysis of upper percentiles especially for extreme events for extreme wind wave modeling studies wind fields from hipocas remo and climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr ncep noaa are found highly beneficial specifically for extreme events the hipocas product showed the strongest winds followed by cfsr noaa and era interim campos and guedes soares 2017 campos et al 2018 the study revealed significant under estimation of era interim product during peak of the storms associated with coarse space and time resolutions the fifth generation atmospheric model of ecmwf the era5 winds are found to underestimate the super typhoon meranti 2016 but observed as consistent under weaker typhoons malakas and megi 2016 hsiao et al 2019 based on their study for typhoons meranti malakas and megi the wind fields of ncep cfsv2 are relatively higher as compared to era5 and era interim especially for regions in close vicinity surrounding the inner eye wall of the typhoon similarly for the io the significant wave height of era5 during tropical cyclone phailin 2013 was found consistent with buoy observations muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 the time series plot of wave parameters from era5 and era interim with buoy measured maximum wave height significant wave height mean and peak wave periods during phailin at gopalpur location on the east coast of india indicates that era5 showed a good match with buoy maximum wave height in the case of significant wave height the era5 matched much better against buoy data relative to the era interim it is also noticed that the era5 could well represent the extreme waves unlike the era interim the measured maximum hsmax was 13 13 m which is close 12 95 m with the era5 also the measured maximum hs was 7 06 m whereas the value was 6 87 m in era5 the under estimation in era5 during the phailin cyclone was 1 4 in hmax and 2 7 in hs murty et al 2020 murty et al 2020 reported on improved cyclonic wind fields over the bay of bengal region and its application for storm surge and wave computations their study murty et al 2020 developed a blended wind product and revealed that the blended wind field matched well with the measured data all the above mentioned studies indicate on the limitation of reanalysis products for extreme weather events for a dataset with considerable spatial and temporal integrity the primary challenge is concerned with the high dimensionality of data that varies in both space and time concurrently moreover each spatial unit varies in a distinct direction along with the time domain and therefore it is essential to represent the dominant character of the dataset to accomplish this one has to use dimensionality reduction techniques and the widely used mathematical tools in climate analyses are eof pca low rank and sparse decomposition technique wavelet analysis fast fourier transforms ffts etc these methods can provide valuable information on the dominant modes of variability and pca eof is widely used in the atmospheric and oceanographic variability studies lintner 2002 hannachi et al 2007 a number of authors have extensively detailed the method of eof with different algorithms and svd singular value decomposition is the efficient one among them wu et al 1997 wang and chang 2007 based on the spatial variability for the arabian sea and bob it was noticed from eof analysis that the first mode comprises nearly 70 of the total variance and the monsoon is possibly the dominant mode of variability rao et al 2011 anoop et al 2015 for the so the first five modes together contribute 50 of the total variability and the dominant mode of variability is the prevailing wind system rao et al 2011 moreover few recent studies addressed the significant role of climate indices such as el niño southern oscillation enso indian ocean dipole iod and southern annular mode sam etc in the met ocean dynamics kumar et al 2016 arora and dash 2019 hence it is essential to investigate the potential regions that experience higher variability and the factors that enhance it this study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of wind generated waves in the io covering the aspects of climatology trend and variability using 41 years of era data for the same the total significant wave height swh significant wave heights of swell waves swhsw as well as wind seas swhws and wind speed are considered also it extends the effort to establish the relative contribution of wind seas and swell waves over the total swh over different geographical regions in the io the monthly averaged swh is used for the entire study to set the objectives the study also covers aspects on the inter seasonal and inter annual variability of separated wave systems advanced mathematical tools such as pca eof have been used to study the spatio temporal variability whereas the wave spectrum analysis to analyze the temporal characteristics of identified potential regions the potential areas recognized in this study are expected to be important regions of future reference in terms of variability 2 study area as mentioned above this study is concerned with the investigation on the variability and trends of swh over the io the wind patterns highly diversify the regime from the southern hemisphere sh to the northern hemisphere nh at the same time the meridional variation of wind patterns is visible in the marginal seas of nio such as the as and bob due to the monsoonal reversal and locally generated wind systems for example besides the prevailing sw and ne monsoon the as also experiences regional winds known as shamal and makran winds that are characterized by the low level jets llj in the middle east such as strong northwesterly and northerly jets respectively aboobacker and shanas 2018 anoopet al 2020 shamal winds occur during the summer and winter often extending to the as and reaching the west coast of india vinod kumar et al 2014 a recent study by anoopet al 2020 delineated the transformation of northerly llj into makran winds that modifies by the presence of makran mountains along the southern pakistan coast the wave field in the indian ocean region varies in response to the prevailing wind systems according to seasons and the generation area for better knowledge few of the examinations included in this work were conducted in the sub basins the wind patterns and wind generated wave fields are domain sensitive for example a comparatively strong wind field is observed in the south of 35 whereas weak wind field in the tropical io as far as the nio is concerned the seasonal reversing governs the wind wave characteristics and the as is largely influenced prior study for swell waves by alves 2006 sub divided the indian ocean sector into three areas such as tnio tropical north indian ocean the tsio tropical south indian ocean and the etsi extra tropical south indian ocean their classification alves 2006 was based on the non interrupted storm tracks and the etsi considered was region bounded between 25 and 80 s recent study by sreelakshmi and bhaskaran 2020a 2020b made the divisions based on the diversified nature of wind and wave characteristics for the entire indian ocean into six sectors in which the sub domains 5 and 6 together represents the zonal area between 35 and 63 s in which the easterly winds over the tsio and westerly winds in the extra tropical regions are mutually exclusive the indian ocean region sub divided into six sectors are believed to better represent the trends in wind and wave climate studies therefore the entire io is divided into six sub sectors according to the wind patterns and to be exclusively separated from one another which has explained by sreelakshmi and bhaskaran 2020a sreelakshmi and bhaskaran 2020b fig 1 and table 1 illustrate and give essential details of the various sub sectors 3 data european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf provides global climate hind cast data since 1980 s and atmospheric reanalysis era5 is the latest among them hersbach and dee 2012 hersbachet al 2019 era interim the predecessor of era5 was widely accepted aboobacker and shanas 2018 anoop et al 2015 and era5 products are now popular pertaining to the analyses of atmospheric ocean and land physics this study used 41 years of wave information including significant wave heights of combined wind sea and swell waves swh total swell waves swhsw and wind seas swhws from 1979 through august 2019 the data are retrieved in 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution from the copernicus climate change service c3s hersbachet al 2019 in monthly averaged time frequency the calibrated and merged satellite observations are beneficial in short term atmospheric and ocean climate studies also the satellite observations are used to validate the model results as it has extensive spatial coverage whereas the in situ records are limited to specific locations however the validation and correction processes of the merged satellite data are crucial and essential in this study a bias corrected multi platform altimeter swh from ifremer cersat is used to validate the era5 swh of combined swell and wind seas data for the entire io the corrected swath files retrieved from ifremer cersat is further interpolated using brat basic radar altimeter toolbox 4 2 1 toolbox and the final dataset is of spatially homogenized monthly mean swh for a shorter span of 25 years 1992 2016 the basic radar altimeter toolbox brat 4 2 1 toolbox was used to process the corrected swath files retrieved from ifremer cersat the processed dataset is a 1 1 interval grid box where the values at each grid point represent the swh values covering the study domain the nearest neighbor interpolation method was used on the brat post processed data to address the sparseness and sampling problems associated with satellite data further the dataset was subjected to a 5 5 cell gaussian smoothing digital filter using an approximate radius of 2 8 standard deviation that resulted in the final smoothed product covering the study area this procedure filters the random or unusual spikes in the final processed datasets the final dataset is a spatially homogenized monthly mean hs for a shorter span of 25 years 1992 2016 the details of data used for validation was carried out for all the sub sectors fig 1 table 1 between era5 and altimeter swh total significant wave height covering the time window from 1992 to 2016 at spatial grid resolution of 1 1 on monthly scale for a detailed investigation on the variability and trend of wave height in the io the monthly parameters of swh swhsw and swhws from era5 1979 2019 at 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution were constructed to seasonal and annual scales following the imd indian meteorological department pune nomenclature 3 1 methodology to compare the performance of reanalysis and

significant wave height is the highest one third of the combined swell waves and wind seas in a given record however for era5 waves are derived from a spectral model hs is obtained from the zeroth order spectral moment area under the spectral curve as there are no individual waves to compute one third of the highest as it is derived from the wave spectrum using the relation h s 4 01 m 0 where m 0 refers to the area under the spectral curve previous reports postulate intra inter seasonal as well as annual variability of swh and wind speed muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 young and ribal 2019 anoop et al 2015 sreelakshmi and bhaskaran 2020a this study carries out different aspects of investigations on significant wave height such as climatology trend and variability in seasonal and annual scales for the climatology and trend analysis the seasons are selected according to the imd nomenclature such as winter jan feb season1 pre monsoon mar may season2 monsoon june sep season3 and post monsoon oct dec season4 simple linear regression analysis is used here to study the wave trend with a statistical significance test and represented spatially to get a better understanding of the domain it was performed using a poly fitting function and the slope y mx c m representing the slope c representing intercept x representing time in years and y the corresponding value of swh provides a quantification on the changes per year the statistical significance of trend values are calculated using the mann kendal trend test mann 1945 for 95 confidence limit pca eof analysis was conducted to examine the various spatio temporal variability modes and patterns it helps to represent the data according to the variance by performing eigen value decomposition wherein pca provides the measure of temporal variation and the eof attributes to its spatial variability wang and chang 2007 this method essentially captures the non linearity and high dimensional characteristics for a given dataset preserving significant patterns and their variability thereby aiding the users to derive meaningful information for data interpretation and analysis the eigen value together with its corresponding eof and principal components pcs represents the mode of variability arranged in the descending order of eigen values however the signs of each eof pca loadings are arbitrary and only their relative amplitudes and sign patterns are exact jollife and cadima 2016 in this study eof pca analysis is carried out by applying the svd algorithm on the datasets prepared moreover the study focuses on the descriptive analysis of the eof pca patterns rather the inferential sign values all investigations are conducted separately for swell waves and wind seas for seasonal and annual scales to understand the individual characteristics the entire basin is domain sensitive and to conveniently analyze the southern and northern hemisphere together the seasons are selected as austral winter october march and summer april september hereafter mentioned as season1 and season2 respectively from the variability analysis twelve locations were identified from the domain that exhibited more significant variability in the eof first three modes torrence and compo 1998 provide more details on wavelet analysis along with their significance levels torrence and compo 1998 wavelet transform is a powerful technique to analyze the frequency components of a signal from the given dataset techniques using fourier transform can also be used to analyze the frequency components however if this technique is applied for the entire time duration under consideration one cannot interpret at what time instant a particular frequency rise a short time fourier transform uses sliding window for spectrogram that provides information in both time and frequency scales however there is a constraint with the window length that can limit the frequency resolution in this context wavelet transforms serve as powerful technique to provide solution to the above mentioned problem wavelet transforms works in the principle based on small wavelets with limited duration the first type of wavelet transform is the orthogonal haar wavelet addison 2018 a second type of orthogonal wavelet termed as meyer wavelet was formulated in 1985 wavelet transform algorithm has found numerous applications in the field of signal processing in diverse disciplines complex wavelets have fourier transforms that is zero for negative frequencies advantages of using a complex wavelet is its capability in separating the phase and amplitude components of the signal the morlet wavelet is the most commonly used complex wavelet that can be expressed in the form addison 2018 1 ψ t π 1 4 e i 2 π f 0 t e 2 π f 0 2 2 e t 2 2 the term f 0 represents the central frequency of the mother wavelet and the second term in the bracket is the correction term it corrects the non zero mean of the complex sinusoid multiplied by the gaussian term when f 0 0 the correction term is negligible and can be ignored in this case the morelet wavelet transform addison 2018 can be represented in the form 2 ψ t 1 π 1 4 e i 2 π f 0 t e t 2 2 in eqn young 1999 the wavelet is of the form having a complex sinusoid e i 2 π f 0 t with a gaussian envelope e t 2 2 the term π 1 4 is a normalization factor ensuring that the wavelet has unit energy it should be noted that eqn young 1999 has a non zero mean meaning that the zeroth frequency term of the corresponding energy spectra is non zero and its applicability holds good with minimal error when f 0 0 the fourier transform of the morlet wavelet addison 2018 can be expressed in the form 3 ψ ˆ f π 1 4 2 e 2 π f 2 π f 0 2 2 representing a gaussian function displaced along the frequency axis by f 0 characteristics frequency is chosen for the analytic morlet wavelet the characteristic frequency of the mother wavelet changes as per the wavelet scale a in the form addison 2018 4 f c f 0 a the square of the magnitude of the fourier transform is the energy spectrum expressed as addison 2018 5 ψ ˆ f 2 2 π 1 2 e 2 π f 2 π f 0 2 the morlet wavelet transform can be used for continuous wavelet analysis and used in the present study utilizing the monthly swh observations for the selected twelve locations from the eof analysis 4 results and discussion the indian ocean region due to its unique geographic setting has been considered in this study to assess and evaluate the variability of wind generated waves utilizing era5 data some recent studies postulate the modulation of long distant swells propagating from the southern ocean influencing the local wind wave climate of the north indian ocean region nayak et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 the climatological study using era5 for separated swell and wind seas by muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 have provided valuable information however the knowledge on variability and trend aspects needs to be further investigated therefore it is worthwhile to study the swell and wind seas spatial and temporal characteristics this section includes more details on i validation of reanalysis data ii annual as well as iii seasonal climatology and trends of swell waves and wind seas iv inter annual and v inter seasonal spatio temporal variability and vi wavelet spectrum analysis of selected potential locations of wind wave variability portrayed for the io 4 1 validation of era5 data with altimeter this section provides detail on the validation of era5 combined significant wave height swh with that of altimeters the altimeter instruments have a good along track resolution whereas the cross track resolution is of hundreds of kilometers and the repeat cycle varies between days to few weeks depending upon the satellite orbit this low spatial temporal resolution can however miss some of the extreme events and hence the altimeter data may not represent the ground truth always young et al 2012 young et al 2017 though the repeat cycle is of 35 days swh and wind speed derived from saral altika was found satisfactory for the north indian ocean region where swh was less than 4 m and wind speed less than 13 m s for the analysis period kumar et al 2015 their study indicates that significant wave height from altika compared well with buoy data having a negligible bias of 0 02 m and small rmse of 0 15 m however the altimetry has low credibility for near coastal regions associated with signal contamination due to partial reflections of ocean and land surfaces gomiset al 2012 another study postulated that significant wave heights from satellites are over estimated at range of low wave height less than 1 m and under estimated for wave heights greater than 2 m park et al 2013 besides such limitations young et al 2017 has reported a consistent agreement for altimeter wave height with buoy measurements and using the altimeter source data one can estimate 100 year return period of extreme significant wave height within a 5 error of buoy data vinoth and young 2011 hence altimetry wave data is highly beneficial for the validation of era5 swh the altimeter wave record is available from 1985 and in this study 25 years of data have been used 1992 2017 to evaluate the swh of era5 the model skill assessment tests such as aae ae pb rmse correlation coefficient r and stds standard deviation are found to be broadly used and are calculated for swh in this study the calculations are carried out separately for all the six sub domains and the statistical details are tabulated in table 2 the correlation coefficient of altimeter waves with era5 is found to be 0 97 for the entire io regime and the agreement between era5 and altimeter annual average swh is excellent the rmse of swh from era5 is calculated as 0 29 m for the entire io when it is higher in the etsi 37 cm and less over the as and bob 21 cm higher rms error signifies a higher risk of residuals in the regime of the stronger wave field and more precise for moderate wave fields the aae is found to be 30 cm in the etsi regions 5 and 6 whereas for the nio and tsio absolute average bias is in the range of 15 18 cm the negative sign of ae obtained for all the sub basins indicate that the era5 data underestimates the altimeter satellite observations the correlation coefficients for all the sub domains are measured to be above 0 9 which indicates a good correlation of the reanalysis data and is excellent for nio and tsio 0 94 regions table 2 from this study the era5 swh is proved good for the entire domain as well as over different sub sectors of the io and hence found reasonable to carry out further analysis 4 2 annual seasonal climatology and trends of indian ocean waves the io is unique as compared to the other ocean basins due to the monsoon wind system reversal and it plays a major role in moderating the wind and wave climate as far as the variability of wind speed is considered it is reported to be higher in the nio as compared to sio however the climatological ranges of wind speed and total significant wave height are higher in the sio in addition the wave field of a basin is superimposed of locally and remotely generated waves hence it is essential to understand the climatology and the variability of separated waves i e swell and wind seas by which the significance of wind and remotely forced swells over the wave field of a basin can be explicitly understood the following sub section discusses on the annual and seasonal climatology as well as the trends of swh of swell waves swells and wind seas for io fig 2 illustrates the long term annual distribution of swell waves and wind seas left panel in the io along with their trends right panel using 41 years of era5 wave products the statistical significance of trend values is calculated using mann kendal test and the values within 95 confidence limit are marked in the corresponding trend figures annual climatological swh of combined waves swells and wind seas varies between 0 and 4 5 m the total swell heights 0 3 5 m are higher than the wind seas 0 3 m in most of the regions except the as the swell waves and wind seas are almost comparable in the as 1 1 5 m and the etsi indicating the wind wave generation muhammed naseef and sanil kumar 2020 for most of the locations in the bob and tsio the swell wave heights varied between 1 5 and 2 5 m the westerly wind system in the so belt is known to be quite strong so analogous to this the highest annual wave heights swells and wind seas are found to be in the so belt 40 60 precisely between 95 105 e and 85 95 e for swells and wind seas respectively potential zones of wind generated waves in etsi now onwards further these locations are investigated for temporal variability and trends of swh which has been explained in the section 4 1 in the context of wind seas the maximum range of climatological swh is higher over the etsi 3 m as compared 1 5 m to the rest the apparent wind seas in the central tsio and off the somalia coast are in the range of about 1 5 m the southeasterly trade winds govern the wind seas in tsio and the strong cross equatorial winds of the findlater jet findlater 1969 near somalia the spatial trend left panel of fig 2 for swell waves is positive 0 1 5 cm year in the io specifically to the north of 60 s interestingly the east coast of australia the southern african coast and central etsi 60 e 110 e showed a noticeable increasing trend of swell wave activity along the 40 s belt the trend in wind seas appears to be decreasing whereas the complete so westerly belt exhibited a growing wind seas trend both the mentioned locations having the highest wind seas and swell wave activity showed an increasing trend 0 5 cm year annual total swh were reported to be increasing in the as aboobaker et al 2011 whereas the shamal swells found decreasing the present study signifies that the trend in total swells is found to be rising in the as the seasonal variability of mean wind speed in etsi is lower compared to nio though the wind speeds are the highest therefore it is worthwhile to examine the trend of wind seas and swells seasonal wise understanding of wave climate will help to understand the intra annual variation of the segregated wave trends hence the different seasonal distribution of swells and wind seas along with their trends in the io are represented in fig 3 interestingly from figs 2 and 3 it is noticed that the locations detected with the highest wave heights in the etsi remain unaltered in all seasons and are found to have increasing trends during all seasons swell waves exhibit a growing trend in the io and noticeably in the as 0 9 1 cm year during the monsoonal period the northern as and off oman coast exhibit an increasing trend around 0 8 cm year similarly the eastern coast of australia as well as the southern african coast experienced an increasing swell wave activity in all seasons at the rate of 0 6 0 9 cm year 4 3 spatial and temporal variability of indian ocean waves 4 3 1 inter annual variability this section deals with the geographical locations that have experienced higher inter annual variability of wind and waves using different modes of eof eigen vectors also pca analysis included in this section intends to investigate the relative contribution of wind seas and swells on the total significant wave height variability fig 4 illustrates the inter annual variability of swh swhsw and swgws in terms of eigen vectors eof pcs from the analysis of 41 years of era 5 data the first mode of variability represents 80 82 and 70 of the total variability of each mentioned wave respectively for the three cases the variability exhibited is highest in the etsi however the relative higher range of wind seas 0 0 012 indicates the significant changes that occurred in the wind speed potential zones of wind generated waves in the etsi particularly the active wind seas generation area exhibited high variability in the first eof mode pertaining to total significant wave height as well as in the partitioned wind seas however the pc1 sub plot fig 4 shows that the total significant wave height synchronizes very well and in phase with that of swells swhs indicating the influence of swell wave variability on the total swh nevertheless the higher modes for swh pc2 pc3 are in phase with the wind seas to understand the other dominant aspects of variability more eigen modes of waves are to be analyzed the second mode for swh 1 6 and that of wind seas 2 7 exhibited a zonal dipole variability in the etsi 40 s 63 s indicating the influence of southern annular mode sam the correlation of pc2 of swh as well as wind seas with the southern annular mode index sami http www nerc bas ac uk icd gjma sam html are observed to be moderate 0 61 0 8 and significant 95 confidence level the first mode of annual wind seas from fig 4 illustrates a noticeable variability in the gulf of mannar and the south eastern tip of the sri lanka the first mode of swell wave variability in the as is concentrated in the northeast off gujarat and maharashtra coast and southeast off kerala and mangalore coast in the context of as previous studies have pointed out that monsoonal winds accounts for the dominant mode of variability queffeulou 2004 anoop et al 2015 at the same time the as is observed with shamal swells during december and march makran swells during october and dominant so swells during pre monsoon season from fig 4 the dominant mode of inter annual variability of swh in the as has a mixed pattern representing the active contributions from wind seas and swells in the bob the variability due to swell and total significant wave height are comparable and both these observations indicate that significant participation of swell waves in the inter annual wave variability this observation cannot be proved using the pca variation of the entire io because pca values are the temporal variation of the area that has experienced higher variability and thus may not be applicable to all regions therefore pca analyses were carried out in the identified six sub domains fig 1 separately subplots of fig 5 illustrate the first principal component pc1 of swhsw swhws and swh for the selected sub domains it is noticed from the fig 5 that the pc1 of swh and swhsw are synchronous and in phase from 1979 to 2018 consistently for all the regions hence inferred that the dominant variability of the io wave fields is accounted for mainly due to the swell waves however it is to be noted that the wind seas are also synchronous with the total swh except in few historical years in the as and so where the wind and wind generated waves are essential to be considered the variability of swhws has a significant influence on the swh thus the variability patterns at these regions are a function of swell and wind seas the eof3 of swh is also worth noticeable in the etsi and strongly concentrated towards the pacific and atlantic sectors of the so at the same time the pc3 of swhsw and swh are moderately correlated 0 5 0 49 with sami 95 confidence level whereas it is not significant for wind seas this is because of the active propagation of distant swells from the pacific and atlantic sector of so alves 2006 fig 6 illustrates the pc2 of the three waves in the west and east sectors of the etsi interestingly the swh are found to be synchronized and in phase with swhws in region six and swhsw in region 5 from the correlation analysis of pc2 of swh swhws and swhsw with sami the east region6 sector exhibited a coefficient of 0 75 0 77 and 0 66 respectively with 95 confidence level as far as the west sector region 5 is considered pc2 of the wind seas are observed with a significant correlation of 0 75 with sami 95 confidence level in contrast total swh and swhsw are found to be insignificant thus it is deduced from the analysis that the sam is significant in the eastern etsi as compared to the western sector this observation is substantiated by a previous study in which the south west australian coast has shown a large decreasing variability whereas the east etsi exhibited marginal variability fig 7 a hemer et al 2010 of winter mean altimeter derived swh and show moderate correlation with sami in the sh in the tsio and bob the variability due to swhws is high but the swh are majorly controlled by the swhsw at the same time in the scs the swell and wind seas are well harmonized with each other there is a gradual increase and decrease in the pc1 of swhsw as well as swh during 1979 2018 which are significantly noticeable for all regions a decreasing trend negative variability during 1987 1995 and increasing trend during 2000 2012 are found for the nio on an average the variability of the waves is found increasing in the second phase from 2000 the year 1997 experienced exceptional variability in wind seas in the nio and similarly in the years 1985 1987 2010 and 2015 these historic years were recorded to have higher enso whereas the phenomena were highly significant in 1996 in the tsio and the etsi however the swh are less contributed by the swhws variability as far as the dominant mode is considered at the same time off the west coast of australia there are remarkable variations in the swell field mode two and mode three from the third mode certain regions are noticed with a higher concentration of swell variability such as the east coast of indonesia archipelagic waters of maldives off somalia coast off south oman coast northern as and the western indian sub continental coast the higher swell variability in the as accounts due to the shamal and makran swells for mode1 of inter annual variability 66 of the total io variability of swells wind seas is dominated by the variability arising due to swells it is worth noticing that the inter annual variability of swell waves third mode has a good correlation with that of the annual trend indicating unidentified climate variability 4 3 2 inter seasonal variability the spatial distribution of swh in a region differs with seasons intra season and the inter seasonal variability attributes to the inter annual variation for a convenient seasonal analysis of nh and sh the seasons are taken as two in this section such as season1 october to march and season2 april to september by which the seasons of the asian summer monsoon australian summer monsoon as shamal and makran waves are conserved in season2 the results included here are from the analyses of the inter seasonal anomaly of swh swhsw swhws and wind speed figs 7 and 8 illustrate the first three dominant modes eof and pcs corresponding to season1 and season2 from the primary mode of eof eof1 and pc1 shown in figs 7 and 8 it is observed that the variability of swh 92 7 of the total variance in season1 and 89 in season2 and swhsw 93 in season1 and 92 in season2 are synchronous and is in phase with time thus the variation of swhsw in both the seasons has been majorly contributed to the total wave field in both seasons the highest variabilities are identified in the as scs and etsi in the arabian sea eof1 patterns of swh are seen to be a mixture of swhsw from the north as and swhws off somalia jet in both seasons the second and third modes of variability in the nio are due to the swhsw waves propagated from the north as whereas the north south shift of so westerly belt sam and the australian summer monsoon north westerly wind are responsible for the second mode variability of total swh in the sio the second mode of swh waves in the two seasons are rather consistent with swhws than swhsw further the seasonal pc2 values were also correlated with the seasonal values of sami i e austral autumn mam winter jja spring son and summer djf and are tabulated in table 3 the calculated coefficient values indicated that pc2 of swh swhws and swhsw for season1 october march are seen to be significantly correlated with the sami in austral summer 0 8 0 8 0 34 and for season2 the correlations are found well and significant in austral winter 0 79 0 8 and 0 7 the correlation coefficients mentioned above as significant corresponds to 95 confidence level also from the analysis of season2 the correlations are seen as moderate and significant 0 3 0 5 in autumn mam and spring son the significant influences of sam in autumn as well as winter waves are consistent with a previous study conducted by hemer et al 2010 hemer et al 2010 the third and fourth modes of eof in season2 fig 8 explains a bimodal dipole signature in the west and east of the etsi resembling an elongated s curve this observation is consistent with the inter annual variability eof3 of total swh but the correlation of swh or swhws is not significant in the seasonal analyses in contrast pc3 of the swhsw are moderately correlated in both the seasons 0 45 and 0 42 with a 95 confidence level the inconsistency of the third mode for swhsw variability with that of swhws and swh indicates the propagation of swhsw from the near so sectors to the io sector however the contribution of the propagated swhsw over the swh in the second and other higher modes are found to be poor along with this observation it is interesting to notice that the pc2 of inter annual variability for swh over the region6 east etsi which was recognized to be synchronous and in phase with swhws whereas it was swhsw for the region5 west etsi therefore it is inferred that the swh in the eastern sector of the etsi is due to the swhws and that for the western sector is accounted from swhsw a separate pca analysis in the region6 for the inter seasonal variability of swh depicted that season2 is more consistent with the sami with a correlation coefficient of 0 63 and for season1 is found to be 0 4 similarly region5 exhibited a significant correlation between swh and sami as 0 33 and 0 6 in season1 and 2 respectively from the study we identified a number of locations that have experienced significant variability such as off the somalia coast the north arabian sea north and the central bay of bengal south china sea south and north of australia and different locations in the etsi detailed in table 3 and the frequency of dominant variability are examined through wavelet analysis 4 3 3 wavelet spectrum analysis this section deals with a detailed investigation on the wavelet spectrum analysis in those locations where the variability is found to be significant a total of twelve sites are selected from the entire io six each from sio and nio with the help of spatial variability gradients pertaining to the first three modes of eof the coordinates and details of each site are mentioned in table 4 the continuous morlet wave transform is mostly used in the atmospheric and oceanic studies which consists of a plane wave modified by gaussian envelope and proven with high precision yi et al 2014 one can find various freely available wavelet transform algorithms developed by different researchers in matlab environment this study utilizes the torrence s code for the morlet continuous wavelet transform the monthly time series of selected locations is then subjected to wavelet spectrum analysis and the wavelet chosen for the study is morlet at 90 confidence level for the red noise process figs 9 and 10 correspond to the six locations situated in the sio and nio respectively each location is described with four subplots a b c and d that represent the wavelet power spectrum for the significant wave height global wavelet power spectrum which is time averaged along the x axis the power averaged time series for 2 8 semi annual and 8 16 annual monthly components the red dashed line in subplot b represents the 90 confidence level and the thick black contour in sub plot a highlights the time frequency region higher than the specified limit fig 9 shows the six locations situated in the southern indian ocean 0 eq 70 s each of these locations exhibited a dominant 90 confidence level and continuous wave power spectrum along with the annular frequency and sparse distribution of power along with the intra annular frequency fig 9 subplots a b in order to understand the temporal variation of annular and intra annular frequency an averaged variance for 2 8 months and 8 16 months scales were taken out and represented in the sub plots c and d respectively a decreasing and increasing phase is observed in the annular variance subplot d for locations 1 2 and 3 located in the etsi and the shift occurred during 2006 2010 the time series trend is demonstrated with the best fitting linear regression line and the rate of change is also mentioned in the sub plot that explains the direction of change the annual scale averaged variance is found to have a decreasing pattern for all the six locations a consistent but a slow decline is noticed for the location 6 which is a potential variability location in the western etsi fig 10 represents the six points selected in the north indian ocean and the first two locations are near the west of somalia coast and the north arabian sea these are the only two regions in the io where the continuous significant power is perceived along with the annual and semi annular frequency in context to the north as the semi annular variance is noticed to be significant and consistent since 1989 90 sub plot a of p8 fig 10 the subplots a and b depicted an increasing annual as well as semi annular variance indicating the increasing trend of makran wave activity in the north as markers p9 p10 and p11 are the locations situated in the bob precisely north head bob central bob and south of sri lanka coast these locations exhibited a dominant and continuous annular variation for p9 and p10 the annular variance is found to have decadal breaks similarly there is a decadal break for average variance in the semi annular variance off the somalia coast at the same time the annular variance at p11 was uniform throughout the past 41 years the south china sea p12 is detected with vigorous wave activity comparable to that of the etsi in contrast to the sio the potential locations of nio exhibited an increasing pattern of averaged variance 5 conclusion the study reports on a climatological analysis of significant wave heights pertaining to swell waves wind seas and combined total swell waves and wind seas utilizing era5 ecmwf re analysis fifth datasets about 41 years of era5 data 1979 2019 was used to investigate the trends and spatio temporal variability in the indian ocean basin from the validation of the total significant wave height of the era5 with calibrated multi platform satellite altimetry data the performance of era5 proved to be good for the entire io as well as for the various sub sectors of the domain a total correlation coefficient of 0 97 is obtained for the io in a time window of 25 years between 1992 and 2016 and not less than 0 9 for the different sectors the rms error and absolute errors are found higher in the extra tropical regions 0 37 m 0 3 m indicating a high risk of residuals in the data for stronger wave conditions however the errors obtained in the arabian sea and bay of bengal are minimal rmse 0 21 m aae 0 16 m that imply the quality of data for the moderate range of significant wave heights the study signifies that the etsi which has been experienced the highest wave activity showed an increasing trend for both wind seas and swells 0 5 1 cm year in the context of wind seas the north south movement of the westerly wind belt has caused a pole ward increasing and equator ward decreasing trend in the etsi during monsoon the northern arabian sea and for regions off the oman coast the swell wave activity showed an increasing trend 0 8 cm year on the contrary the activity of wind seas in the arabian sea and the head bay of bengal are found to be decreasing the aforementioned trend observations fall within a 5 significance level according to the mann kendal trend test further the inter annual and inter seasonal variability are examined using eof analysis and the potential regions of higher variability are identified from the pc1 analysis it is evident that swells play an active role and a major contributor to the dominant mode of the total swh variability in all regions of the io basin in the nio the variability of wind seas has a direct linkage with the enso years however the total swh is least affected the second dominant mode of inter annual variability in the etsi is associated with the southern annular mode sam and found more prominent in the eastern etsi the pc2 of total swh is consistent with wind seas for eastern etsi whereas the effect of swells dominates in the western etsi in the same context pc3 of swhsw is moderately correlated with the sami indicating the presence of distant swells that propagate from the so sectors the seasonal variability of swhsw are also consistent with sami in addition the correlation of pc2 with the sami is found significant particularly during austral summer january march and winter july september based on the analysis of seasonal and annual variability there are 12 identified regions in the io sector that experienced higher variability furthermore the designated 12 locations are investigated using the wave spectrum analysis for combined significant wave height the arabian sea exhibited dominant variability both in the annular and semi annular frequency scales apart from the annular scales the sio experienced enhanced wave activity in the intra annular scale the wave spectrum analysis reveals that regions in the north arabian sea show increased annual variance during the past 41 years further the locations in the southern io exhibited a decreasing annual scale variance in contrary to the nio basin credit
