15515,microplastics are widely present in global ecosystems threatening both marine and freshwater species given this problem it is vital to research where land based microplastics originate and how they are transmitted to receiving waters in urban agglomerations research results should inform systemic mitigation efforts to prevent future contamination this study established the multi directional transmission network of a microplastic mass balance system using a source pathway receptor framework and involving annual source stocks and pathway flows with considerable variations under dry and wet weather patterns details of a baseline scenario quantifying the occurrence and spread of microplastics in an urban agglomeration were also determined in the context of current environmental management practices we demonstrated that the total stock of the six major pollution sources amounted to 5317 7 2175 3 and 3320 1 953 6 tons a in dry and wet weather respectively and 2347 8 766 9 and 1991 8 701 8 tons a flows directly entered the sewer system and receiving water in shanghai china respectively prominent microplastic stocks were found in atmospheric fallout industrial wastewater and domestic sewage these stocks were much higher compared to crop farming wastewater aquacultural wastewater and livestock and poultry breeding wastewater total microplastic flows entering receiving water reached 3207 4 1071 6 tons a the largest contributions were from wet weather overflow 23 7 direct atmospheric fallout 21 7 wastewater treatment plant effluent 14 2 industrial wastewater 14 1 and surface runoff 10 4 weather patterns led to divergent microplastic transmission pathways and mass flows revealing a lagging timeline mode and illustrating the basic spatiotemporal features of microplastic contamination in urban agglomerations terminal disposal practices retained about two fifths of the microplastic flows that would have otherwise been transmitted into receiving water of these land

pattern environmental management practice data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction microplastics in aquatic ecosystems have been the focus of intense research and debate over the past two decades posing harm to the individual health and biological behavior of nearly 700 marine species and more than 50 freshwater species gall and thompson 2015 roughly 98 of microplastics in freshwater have been identified as originating in land based sources increasing the concern boucher and friot 2017 in particular the export of land based sources of microplastics within urban agglomeration is a key issue with respect to freshwater microplastic contamination grbic et al 2020 a 2015 survey of the greater paris river in france concluded that efforts should be dedicated to tracking microplastics influenced by broad anthropogenic activities especially in urban agglomerations dris et al 2015 since that time many cases of high contamination levels have been reported globally investigations conducted in the urban sections of rivers in china showed high levels of microplastics reaching approximately 3000 8000 particles m3 lin et al 2018 su et al 2016 an assessment across german urban and rural areas found that 90 of the cumulative annual plastic load throughout a watershed may have been exported from urban areas wagner et al 2019 these findings have shown that urban agglomeration is a clear risk hotspot playing a central role in driving the occurrence of microplastics over the watershed past studies highlight the urgency of filling current knowledge gaps to more systemically understand where land based microplastics originate and how they are transmitted to receiving water this would help inform future mitigation steps to prevent contamination a need that has been recognized through worldwide research efforts however urban agglomerations cover watersheds spanning broad land use gradients environmental compartments within these areas are interlinked with diverse networks of source pathway sink connections that influence the flux and retention of microplastics highly superimposed natural or anthropogenic variables alter the spatiotemporal pattern of microplastic footprints with increasingly complex and compounding trends for example the greater melbourne and western port areas in australia and the rhine main watershed in germany span broad gradients of land use from undeveloped catchments to heavily developed areas initial evidence from these areas delineated microplastic hotspots caused by a combination of natural accumulation through hydrological dynamics and contributions from increasing anthropogenic influences klein et al 2015 su et al 2020 these studies reveal that when investigations only evaluate individual environmental compartments or focus on unidirectional output the interdependencies of environmental compartments and the superimposed influences of variables may be overlooked this result in underestimates or probabilistic errors when quantifying the continuity and variability of microplastic flow consequences in the course of transmission some studies have investigated the impacts of weather and sewer and wastewater systems on receiving water microplastics chen et al 2020 wagner et al 2019 these have speculated that non point sources are a critical force dominating microplastic pollution in urban water bodies during dry weather which differs from wet weather situations this indicates temporal variability and weather dominated patterns in the source output and current flow state of microplastics in urban agglomerations in addition the research identified a low level of microplastics in the receiving waters in the central urban areas alfonso et al 2020 chen et al 2020 this finding differed from the reported positive association between aquatic microplastic pollution and the distance from the urban center wang et al 2017 in this respect global studies have verified the roles of environmental practices in mitigating the gross output of land based microplastics faltstrom and anderberg 2020 lau et al 2020 siegfried et al 2017 while evidence based strategies with systematic benefits in shaping the microplastic distributions over the watershed have not yet been established collectively these findings highlight four essential questions related to tracking the prevalence of microplastics in urban agglomeration waters from a systemic perspective 1 based on uniform evaluation criteria what are the microplastic stocks of different sources and what are their contributions to the contaminations of receiving water 2 what is the structure and mass flow of the microplastic transmission network 3 what roles do current environmental management practices play in the microplastic transmission network 4 how do weather patterns alter the mass flows given accelerating global climate change and the broad upgrades to pollution governance practices quantifying the stocks and flows of land based microplastics in urban agglomeration should be bundled and compiled in a structured way establishing a source pathway receptor framework is a prerequisite for clarifying these problems and avoiding single initiatives that have limited effects this is important for building a foundation that supports environmental strategic decisions or initiatives focusing on management or control priorities that achieve microplastic budget abatement this study established a microplastic mass balance model with a multi directional transmission network based on the source pathway receptor framework and a territory based accounting of data monitored and collected in 2018 2020 in shanghai megacity china we identified details of a baseline scenario for the occurrence and transmission of microplastics in the urban agglomeration at a watershed scale in the context of current environmental management practices the highly urbanized shanghai megacity where environmental management practices have been successively upgraded in the last two decades is an effective study area for understanding the variability of microplastic contamination in response to sources pathways and abatement strategies the model involved annual source stocks and pathway flows with variations under dry and wet weather patterns major pollution sources inventoried included domestic sewage ds industrial wastewater iw atmospheric fallout af livestock and poultry breeding wastewater lpbw aquacultural wastewater aw and crop farming wastewater cfw we evaluated the abatement efficacies of the sewer system wastewater treatment plant wwtp and surface runoff management management of af and agriculture were also reviewed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling events the shanghai megacity is an urban agglomeration a population exceeding 24 million of one central city and seven satellite towns in eastern china this is an approximately 6340 km2 river plain network area within the huangpu river watershed with thousands of branching canals the yangtze river and huangpu river are considered two of the largest contributors to marine microplastic loads worldwide lebreton et al 2017 sampling events were conducted during 2018 2019 and included 10 ds sites 10 iw sites 10 af sites 6 lpbw sites 6 aw sites and 6 cfw sites fig 1 the ds samples were collected from the inspection wells of branched sewage sewers extending from residential communities five urban sites and five suburban sites iw samples included the rigorously pretreated production wastewater cooling wastewater and cleaning wastewater collected from the main sewer inspection wells that were close to the industrial park outlets these included five light industrial sites and five heavy industrial sites the enterprises in the light industrial areas were mainly manufacturers of clothing textiles food and packaging materials the heavy industrial areas included port machine manufacturing and petrochemical industries the lpbw samples were of the effluent from the wastewater treatment facilities of six large enterprises raising pigs cattle and chickens the aw samples were collected from receded wastewater generated by routine water refresh during dry weather from freshwater fish shrimp and crab ponds the cfw samples included receded wastewater from paddy fields rice cultivation in dry weather and the surface runoff from the dry fields vegetable and fruit tree cultivation and paddy fields in wet weather both types of wastewater samples were collected at the effluent outlets the af samples were collected near the underlying surface from five urban sites and five suburban sites the sites were within open areas of residential commercial and traffic land uses surrounded by medium and low buildings including dry and wet fallouts details about the sampling methods are presented in text s1 2 2 microplastic identification liquid samples were treated with 1 m naoh at 65 c and were then shaken in the dark at 80 rpm for 48 h to digest biological and abiological materials each sample was then filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon filter under a vacuum the process used to filter and pretreat af samples is described in a separate study wright et al 2020 sample filters were visually examined for microplastics using a high speed stereomicroscope vhx 6000 keyence japan with 100 200 magnification fig s1 all the plastic like items on the filters were inspected and counted according to their morphological characteristics and the criteria described in a separate study dris et al 2015 each item s shape was categorized as granule granule microbead fragment pellet fiber fiber line or film film foam samples of the items in a one third subsample were randomly selected and analyzed using a micro fourier transform infrared spectrometer μft ir coupled with an attenuated total reflectance atr accessory nicolet in10 mx transmission modes thermo fisher scientific usa this was done to identify the sample polymer types based on the presence of characteristic ir peaks and the similarity of the matched spectra in the ft ir polymer spectrum library match score 80 approximately 76 of the sampled items were verified to be microplastics quality control measures were implemented to minimize potential airborne particles and microplastic contamination in the laboratory processes text s2 2 3 microplastic mass balance model to establish the multi directional transmission network comprised of sources interlinked pathways and output endpoints a microplastic mass balance model with source stock and pathway flow analysis was constructed based on the source pathway receptor framework waldschlager et al 2020 and territory based accounting text s3 the baseline scenario of microplastic occurrence and spread in the urban agglomeration focused on currently implemented practices including policies and law enforcement engineering facilities technological processes and terminal disposals fig 2 the initial pollution sources in a watershed system are generated through a wide range of anthropogenic activities that are highly diverse spatiotemporally complicated and lack detailed records it is difficult for them to be individually tracked and quantified this study applied a general and feasible approach where each pollution source was defined by its first layer entry path to the next environmental compartment after discharge as such one kind of microplastic source covers all of its potential sub categories text s4 according to the national pollution source census and regional environmental statistical survey from 2015 to 2019 ds iw af lpbw aw and cfw sources dominate land based pollutant outputs entering the freshwater system across shanghai and all of china we assume the system structure is in a steady state issues excluded in the defined boundary are described in text s5 source stocks of microplastics were quantified using the in field monitoring data obtained through the sampling described above the mass balance model using the six types of annual stocks was a starting point that was then reconciled to determine the transfer coefficients in a total of 27 individual pathway flows this was done to describe the partitioning of mass input to outputs the parameters used to create the transfer coefficient distributions were collected from the 2018 to 2020 empirical and statistical data disclosed in peer reviewed literature local government bulletins industrial reports and the pollution source census in particular because microplastics cannot be easily recycled like plastic waste the microplastic stocks and flows were quantified based on the static mass balance the aquatic microplastic abundance used in the model was the averaged value of the event mean abundance text s6 atmospheric microplastic abundance was measured using the average value a complete list of the quantification principles boundaries transfer coefficients and models of all the microplastic stock and flow items in dry and wet weather and the related data sources are provided in texts s7 s8 and s9 the methods used to analyze data quality and assess uncertainty is described in text s10 the calculation of averages and standard deviations one way analysis of variance anova and paired sample t test were performed using ibm spss statistics 25 tests were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 microplastic characteristics fig 3 shows the abundance of microplastics from the six sources iw and af microplastics were present at the highest levels in both dry d and wet w weather with iw reaching 119 4 38 9 d and 104 2 20 3 w particles l and af reaching 77 6 31 5 d and 92 0 26 4 w particles d m2 in dry weather higher levels of microplastics were seen in heavy iw samples compared to light iw samples p 0 004 there were higher levels of af microplastics in urban areas compared to suburban areas p 0 035 lpbw samples had microplastic levels of 24 8 12 6 d and 25 9 17 1 w particles l in contrast ds microplastics reached 14 3 7 7 d and 11 6 5 3 w particles l the microplastics discharged from urban areas were present at higher levels compared to suburban regions in both dry p 0 01 and wet weather p 0 05 cfw microplastics reached only 3 7 3 6 particles l w samples from dry fields had significantly higher microplastic levels compared to paddy fields p 0 003 paddy field cfw microplastics were present at only 2 1 1 2 particles l d aw microplastics reached a level of 16 8 6 8 d particles l fig 4 depicts the polymer and morphological characteristics of the microplastics the polymer compositions of the microplastics in ds af lpbw and aw were generally consistent polyethylene terephthalate pet was the main ingredient 57 2 70 9 followed by polycarbonate pc polyethersulfone pes and polypropylene pp in contrast the microplastic composition of iw and cfw significantly differed from other sources with pc 52 0 61 4 and pp 41 3 48 8 being the dominant microplastics in these two sources respectively pet accounted for 30 0 in addition polyethylene pe made up 14 1 33 4 of the microplastics in cfw regarding microplastic shape cfw microplastics were mainly composed of films 57 5 68 1 and granules 24 4 31 2 the other five sources were dominated by fibers 86 9 99 4 the size of the microplastics in the six sources generally ranged from 0 08 to 1 mm 63 9 88 1 the size of microplastics in af and cfw was larger with the proportion falling in the 1 5 mm size range reaching 35 0 3 2 microplastic stocks of the six sources the annual microplastic stocks of wastewater from the six sources according to weather pattern and flow direction are shown in fig 5 the total load of these six sources amounted to 5317 7 2175 3 d and 3320 1 953 6 w tons a and 2347 8 766 9 and 1991 8 701 8 tons a directly entered the sewer system and receiving water respectively af sources made up the largest proportions followed by iw and ds sources these three sources had the microplastic stocks in dry and wet weather as follows af sources at 3747 2 1522 7 d and 2577 8 741 2 w respectively accounting for 70 5 and 77 6 of the total annual stocks iw sources at 768 0 250 5 d and 388 7 75 8 w respectively 14 4 and 11 7 of total and ds sources at 462 0 248 1 d and 218 8 100 1 w 8 7 and 6 6 tons a respectively the sewer system received only af iw and ds microplastics accounting for 997 6 237 7 42 5 703 5 198 4 30 0 and 646 7 330 7 27 5 tons a respectively af and iw microplastics entering receiving water reached respective stocks at 1030 7 366 7 51 7 and 453 2 127 8 22 8 tons a respectively ds microplastics entering receiving water showed a lower stock at 34 0 17 4 tons a 1 7 in contrast microplastic stocks of the three agricultural sources were low during both dry and wet weather at 6 4 and 4 1 respectively lpbw sources were particularly low however when examining these microplastic loads entering receiving water agricultural wastewater output 23 8 remained significant and aw 224 5 90 6 tons a and cfw 247 6 98 3 tons a contributed proportions of 11 3 and 12 4 respectively 3 3 microplastic flows fig 6 maps the microplastic flows in the multi directional transmission network the total microplastic flows eventually entering receiving water reached 3207 4 1071 6 tons a of these flows the largest contributions were from the following sources wwf 761 1 230 5 tons a 23 7 direct af 695 7 249 0 tons a 21 7 wwtp effluent 456 1 140 3 tons a 14 2 iw 453 2 127 8 tons a 14 1 and surface runoff 335 0 117 7 tons a 10 4 microplastics retained in terminal disposal presented a total flow of 2088 9 785 6 tons a making up approximately two fifths of the microplastic flows that would have been delivered into receiving water of these flows land surface sweep contributed 45 8 956 7 388 8 tons a followed by flows retained in sewage sludge 730 8 224 9 tons a 35 0 and sewer sediment 399 9 171 3 tons a 19 1 atmospheric deposition was the largest scale pathway for microplastic flows in the urban agglomeration 6325 2263 9 tons a however land surface sweep and captures via permeable and impermeable land surfaces in built up regions led to a 52 8 reduction in the total microplastic flows this level of retention led to the land surface being the largest receptor of urban agglomeration microplastic flows the sewer system and wwtp played a crucial role in the microplastic flows from ds iw and surface runoff of the total 2347 8 766 8 tons a of microplastic flows entering the sewer system 48 6 1141 6 345 7 tons a was in the intercepted initial storm sewage entering the wwtp 32 4 was discharged out through wwf and entered the receiving water 17 0 settled into the sewer sediment during the transportation of dry weather wastewater the remained microplastics that eventually entered the wwtp through dry weather wastewater accounted for only 3 8 45 3 19 4 tons a of the total flows 61 6 of the total 1186 9 365 1 tons a of microplastic flows in the wwtp settled into the excess sewage sludge for further disposal 4 discussion 4 1 microplastic stocks of the pollution sources in the urban agglomerations recent studies have demonstrated that the atmosphere can be a critical source of microplastics in freshwater allen et al 2019 however little is known about its contribution to downstream environmental compartments we demonstrated the prominent risk of af as the largest source of microplastics in urban agglomeration waters both in terms of the exported volumes accounting for 70 of the total microplastic stocks and its diffusion involving mass flows in multiple directions a previous observational study reported that the inhalation of plastic fibers and particles may be associated with dyspnea caused by airway and interstitial inflammation prata 2018 as such the significant load of af microplastics would raise a public health concern our results were significantly higher than a previous rough estimate which showed that af generated deposits of 3 to 10 tons of fibers per year in the parisian agglomeration in france dris et al 2016 this indicates a discernible global difference in terms of the settling velocity in dry or wet weather our results quantified a higher level of microplastics for the shanghai megacity compared to those recorded in other seven coastal cities in china cai et al 2017 liu et al 2020 however the levels were lower than those seen in both paris france dris et al 2016 and london england wright et al 2020 generally these af microplastics have been recognized as originating in anthropogenic debris or city dust with sources such as synthetic clothing road tire abrasions plastic litter building materials or footwear the paris study reported that the flux was higher at the urban sites compared to the suburban sites dris et al 2016 this study showed a consistent result while further demonstrating that it occurred almost exclusively in dry weather this appears to explain the previous statistical conclusion that non point source is the critical force dominating the microplastic pollution in urban waters during dry weather given current environmental governance conditions chen et al 2020 the stock of af microplastics can be influenced by source distribution wind strength and weather patterns this complicates the tracing and prediction of the presence of af microplastics plastics cosmetics and paint enterprises generate primary microplastics non plastic manufacturing industries often create secondary microplastics to establish a loop locked policy system involving source control at the national level the direct discharge of iw from both these types of enterprises is prohibited or reduced through active management even when these wastewaters have been pretreated currently iw microplastics that are directly discharged to the environment are generally not the focus of intense debate with few available data however broader global evidence has illustrated that industrial land uses can contribute more plastic pollutants to the adjacent aquatic environments than other land uses lassen et al 2015 su et al 2020 this confirms the ubiquitous leaking of iw another example illustrating this was a positive correlation between the percentage of industrial area and microplastic pollution in estuarine rivers in the chesapeake bay usa yonkos et al 2014 our study determined that iw microplastics entering receiving water reached stocks at 453 2 127 8 tons a there was also a non negligible volume discharged through drainage networks and wastewater systems these microplastics were mainly composed of pet and pc which are used to manufacture such items as packaging materials textiles electronic appliances and automotive parts additionally we found higher levels of microplastics in heavy iw compared to light iw this was consistent with what we found in regionally relevant waters chen et al 2020 this may indicate that iw plays a critical role in regional discrepancies in the upper limit of microplastics in urban waters ds is mainly comprised of laundry effluents and has long been considered an important contributor of microplastics to urban waters hernandez et al 2017 in china and elsewhere microfibers derived from textile washing may contribute approximately 35 of the microplastics identified in the aquatic system xu et al 2020 similarly the ds microplastics identified in this study were also mainly fibrous pet was present at high levels and is widely used in garment processing kawecki et al 2019 cosmetics and personal care products are other vital sources of microplastics in ds one study estimated that approximately 2300 tons of plastic microbeads enter the north sea through ds every year gouin et al 2015 however this study found that the level of microplastics in ds was not expectedly high with an annual discharge load reaching only 6 6 8 7 of the total microplastic stocks of the six sources this level was lower than the level seen from af and iw microplastics directly discharged through ds to receiving waters reached only 1 7 of the total there is a lack of knowledge about the level of microplastics released from agricultural activities given the estimation challenges in this study a low load of microplastics was found to be exported by agricultural wastewater and low levels were found in both farmland runoff and receding water this finding was consistent with results found in the lake ontario watershed grbic et al 2020 however it was unexpected that agricultural microplastics could still reach a level of 23 8 of the total flow entering receiving waters in the shanghai agglomeration especially from crop farming and aquaculture this highlights the need to further assess the scale of microplastic contamination within agricultural fields aw microplastics have been generally considered to be an immediate source of risk in water particularly in the ocean rochman 2018 and estuarine shore xu et al 2018 whereas the problem of freshwater aw microplastics has not received much attention artificial freshwater pond systems must maintain high water quality levels for example the total suspended solids tss standard should be below 10 mg l however given the production of economic species discharged microplastics may not be low data from this study showed that the freshwater aw microplastics exported to receiving water amounted to 11 3 of the total load these microplastics mainly included pe pp and nylon often derived from fishing gear bubbles float and synthetic ropes and nets microplastics discharged with lpbw have been overlooked this study confirmed its minimal direct discharge load however its significant reuse for farmland fertilization or compost storage wu et al 2021 may exacerbate the large accumulation of microplastics in farmlands 4 2 weather pattern diverges the microplastic transmission pathways and flows weather patterns shift hydrologic states creating divergent microplastic transmission pathways and flows the mass flow balance revealed that storm events had a driving effect on the export of non point source microplastics during wet weather this superimposed significant contamination on the background values of the receiving water particularly those caused by urban runoff and wwf in this study wwf was found to be the largest contributor 23 7 at higher levels than wwtp effluent 14 2 however wwtp effluent has been the focus of most concern to date this finding is consistent with previous estimations based on the discharged wastewater yields and empirical correlation evidence chen et al 2020 the direct discharge of storm runoff contributed only 10 4 of the total microplastic input of receiving water however the divergent flows from storm runoff also made up large proportions of the microplastics in wwf and wwtp effluent thus storm runoff is a key initiator in the wet weather output pattern of microplastics in urban agglomerations this finding is consistent with observations from other urban associated environmental compartments for example microplastic abundances were reported to be higher during wet than dry conditions in storm runoff affected urban rivers in southern california and in the great lakes tributary in the usa baldwin et al 2016 moore et al 2011 the sewer system is the major pathway for microplastics moving from land based sources to the receiving waters in storm runoff this study helps build an understanding of the fate of microplastics within the sewer system further study is needed to complete detailed tracing activities and quantification wet weather patterns increase the microplastics exported from farmland surfaces while the incremental level assessed shows limited value to quantify the variations in annual flows caused by weather patterns it is crucial to also present the model links among microplastic loads based on wet weather days and rainfall intensity this could be valuable for future aggregate forecasting several studies have analyzed single storm events to assess the statistical association between rainfall intensity and climatic variables and the levels of microplastics delivered into the water table s1 microplastics originate in atmospheric sources agricultural sources and sewer wastewater that sink and accumulate in dry weather and that are delivered into receiving waters under wet weather this creates a lagging timeline mode and changes the basic spatiotemporal characteristics of microplastic pollution in urban agglomerations analyzing the antecedent dry weather days adwd is crucial in determining the degree of contamination induced by weather patterns a longer adwd may allow for more microplastic accumulation and with a diurnal resolution may result in significant variability in the peak microplastic level based on the characteristics of storm events the impacts created by the lagging effect are widespread causing the land surface to be a sizeable long term terminal receptor agricultural soils in particular represent large environmental reservoirs of microplastics nizzetto et al 2016b these are contributed by af the reuse of lpbw and wwtp sewage sludge and widely used plastic products such as pet or pe mulch plastic films and drainage tubes in this study the observed low levels of microplastics in both farmland runoff and receded wastewater provided evidence of the extensive retention of microplastics in agricultural soils in dry weather it also indicates that their possible persistent adverse ecological effects are a far more serious problem than those microplastics that are drained out in wet weather this is particularly true because agricultural soils are considered capable of retaining microplastics better than urban soils due to their greater permeability and lower surface runoff generation nizzetto et al 2016a moreover for sewer systems constructed in plain areas with low slopes the extensively settled sediments during dry weather allow microplastics that would otherwise enter and be disposed of in the wwtp to be washed into the receiving waters through wwf this constitutes a vast short term pollution peak in urban waters 4 3 role of environmental management practices in mitigating microplastic flows this study is the first to provide quantitative evidence of the systemic role of environmental management practices in mitigating aquatic microplastic pollution occurring in urban agglomerations we found that terminal disposal practices can retain approximately two fifths of the microplastic flows that would have otherwise been delivered into receiving water of the major contributors of microplastics at the watershed scale the atmosphere has been consistently confirmed to be ubiquitous and prominent in its adverse impacts however achieving source based abatement of af microplastic budgets is complex and costly since it involves industrial restructuring and clean energy development however it remains the most sensible place for such control thus it has become a priority to intervene in pollution events driven by storm runoff to mitigate the downward microplastic flows this is because storm runoff was identified as the driver of the wet weather output pattern of microplastics especially those originating from non point sources a previous study in this region found that interception measures for the initial 55 of storm runoff can control 60 70 of urban non point source pollutant loads he et al 2018 in this regard using natural features to mimic the undeveloped hydrologic properties of the site such as low impact development lid or sponge city development can extend runoff flow pathways and slow the flow allowing soil and vegetation to retain microplastics and attenuate both peaks and the total volumes table s2 for example a rain garden has been confirmed to remove 96 of anthropogenic debris werbowski et al 2021 bioretention cells have also been recommended as preventative measures for microplastics in urban areas showing an 84 decrease in the median levels of microplastics smyth et al 2021 the wet pond is the most common storm runoff treatment approach constructed in sweden retaining approximately 80 of suspended solids larm and alm 2016 nevertheless implementing lid infrastructure is challenging due to limited space as such reducing the need for treatment by implementing non structural measures such as road sweep and restrictions on the use of studded tires can be strong alternative measures werbowski et al 2021 the sweep rate of street dust below 2 mm using a machine has been reported to retain 15 to 80 of microplastics amato et al 2010 our evaluation showed that microplastics captured by land surface sweep accounted for nearly half of the total load deposited through terminal disposal practices demonstrating its abatement efficacy sewer and wastewater treatment systems form the major pathway connecting the sources of wastewater drain with receiving waters even there is currently no global quantification available studies in the shanghai and paris agglomerations chen et al 2020 martin and scott 2017 have provided evidence related to wwf and wwtp effluent verifying their significant contributions to aquatic microplastics this indicates that managing sewer and wastewater treatment systems may be a tangible solution to achieve a large scale abatement of the export of land based microplastics given the transmission of microplastic flows along the sewer and wastewater treatment system the key links for microplastic abatement involve improving front end wastewater collection management and treatment of sewer sediment storm sewage interception overflow reduction and wwtp removal targeted policies and efficient execution of wastewater collection activities are vital some developed areas such as cities in europe australia and the usa have significantly improved their water quality levels in urban rivers barrows et al 2018 su et al 2020 however the global wastewater collection rate has remained at an average of only 20 sonneveld et al 2018 in the shanghai agglomeration the low iw collection rate is still a severe problem that has resulted in high levels of microplastic discharge this is also a problem in other developing countries lahens et al 2018 siegfried et al 2017 storm runoff management infrastructure combined with wastewater collection practices could be an optimal strategy based on the systemic benefits for example adding lid to gray infrastructure can provide an additional reduction in annual overflow increasing the reduction from 9 76 to 15 77 liao et al 2015 accumulated sewer sediment is displaced and removed in storm events increasing the contamination load of wwf and creating a shock for wwtp operations in wet weather the first flushed wwf from most sewer systems is intercepted by setting a reasonable intercepting ratio with settling done in detention tanks these practices reduce a large number of discharged solid pollutants table s3 spatiotemporally sound sewer sediment dredging and treatment may effectively mitigate microplastic discharges investigations performed in 2020 in the shanghai megacity in china indicated that desilting efforts led to nearly a one fourth reduction in pollutants in regional wwf events the wwtp is the final barrier to reducing microplastic discharges with significant differences in removal effectiveness across global regions table s4 developing countries generally exhibit low removal efficiency implementing further improvements in removal efficiency is challenging the dredged sewer sediment and the sewage sludge from wwtp are thickened dewatered dried and landfilled or reused improper disposal and recycling policies make them a critical source of land based microplastics mahon et al 2017 overall under the ideal conditions of the baseline scenario the discrepancies in the efficiency gains when mitigating total microplastic loads entering receiving water are clear when achieved by the individually deployed practices mentioned above in sewer and wastewater treatment systems text s11 the linear models showed that improvements in wwtp removal efficiency storm sewage interception rate iw collection rate and sewer sediment dredge rate could further improve the efficacy of mitigation activities fig s2 microplastic stocks and flows from agricultural non point sources provide a different perspective with respect to urban point sources farmlands and aquacultural ponds are enormous reservoirs transmitting microplastics through polder ditches or through direct discharges the presence of microplastics is not currently a monitoring indicator that triggers control actions this is a liability in managing them and is caused by the popular and widespread focus on resource reclamation and utilization reusing resources also redistributes the microplastics present within those resources sewage sludge is widely used as a fertilizer and soil amendment for agricultural applications in many developed regions galafassi et al 2019 one study estimated that 125 850 tons of microplastic million inhabitants have been added annually to european agricultural soils nizzetto et al 2016b lpbw and biosolids are generally composted and reused for soil amendment before the seeding period these are new microplastic sources in agricultural soil which potentially threaten the safety of resource utilization and their retained loads are currently unknown this highlights that the mitigation efficacy of an individual environmental management practice may be one sided and may intensify the mass flow to the next environmental compartment creating even greater ecological risk soil remediation is difficult and costly with the intervention of source inputs remaining the best and most critical solution it is important to further establish thresholds for microplastic mass in sewage sludge or lpbw used for agricultural applications controlling aw discharges is on china s agenda however there are no universally applicable measures that can be implemented as one possibility however a previous study found that the removal rate of aw tss by artificial wetlands ranged from 80 5 to 82 9 zhang et al 2018 5 conclusion this study is the first known attempt to model and quantify the stocks and flows of microplastic as a mass balance system we also provide novel and comprehensive insights into the detailed baseline scenario of the occurrence and multi directional spread of land based microplastics in an urban agglomeration the findings contribute to bridging the knowledge gap to understand the role of pollution sources weather patterns and environmental management practices this is essential for systematically directing management efforts to reduce microplastic budgets in the future especially for proposing targeted mitigation strategies to settle risks associated with key transmission nodes results show the following 1 the total stock of the six sources was 5317 7 2175 3 d and

15515,microplastics are widely present in global ecosystems threatening both marine and freshwater species given this problem it is vital to research where land based microplastics originate and how they are transmitted to receiving waters in urban agglomerations research results should inform systemic mitigation efforts to prevent future contamination this study established the multi directional transmission network of a microplastic mass balance system using a source pathway receptor framework and involving annual source stocks and pathway flows with considerable variations under dry and wet weather patterns details of a baseline scenario quantifying the occurrence and spread of microplastics in an urban agglomeration were also determined in the context of current environmental management practices we demonstrated that the total stock of the six major pollution sources amounted to 5317 7 2175 3 and 3320 1 953 6 tons a in dry and wet weather respectively and 2347 8 766 9 and 1991 8 701 8 tons a flows directly entered the sewer system and receiving water in shanghai china respectively prominent microplastic stocks were found in atmospheric fallout industrial wastewater and domestic sewage these stocks were much higher compared to crop farming wastewater aquacultural wastewater and livestock and poultry breeding wastewater total microplastic flows entering receiving water reached 3207 4 1071 6 tons a the largest contributions were from wet weather overflow 23 7 direct atmospheric fallout 21 7 wastewater treatment plant effluent 14 2 industrial wastewater 14 1 and surface runoff 10 4 weather patterns led to divergent microplastic transmission pathways and mass flows revealing a lagging timeline mode and illustrating the basic spatiotemporal features of microplastic contamination in urban agglomerations terminal disposal practices retained about two fifths of the microplastic flows that would have otherwise been transmitted into receiving water of these land

pattern environmental management practice data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction microplastics in aquatic ecosystems have been the focus of intense research and debate over the past two decades posing harm to the individual health and biological behavior of nearly 700 marine species and more than 50 freshwater species gall and thompson 2015 roughly 98 of microplastics in freshwater have been identified as originating in land based sources increasing the concern boucher and friot 2017 in particular the export of land based sources of microplastics within urban agglomeration is a key issue with respect to freshwater microplastic contamination grbic et al 2020 a 2015 survey of the greater paris river in france concluded that efforts should be dedicated to tracking microplastics influenced by broad anthropogenic activities especially in urban agglomerations dris et al 2015 since that time many cases of high contamination levels have been reported globally investigations conducted in the urban sections of rivers in china showed high levels of microplastics reaching approximately 3000 8000 particles m3 lin et al 2018 su et al 2016 an assessment across german urban and rural areas found that 90 of the cumulative annual plastic load throughout a watershed may have been exported from urban areas wagner et al 2019 these findings have shown that urban agglomeration is a clear risk hotspot playing a central role in driving the occurrence of microplastics over the watershed past studies highlight the urgency of filling current knowledge gaps to more systemically understand where land based microplastics originate and how they are transmitted to receiving water this would help inform future mitigation steps to prevent contamination a need that has been recognized through worldwide research efforts however urban agglomerations cover watersheds spanning broad land use gradients environmental compartments within these areas are interlinked with diverse networks of source pathway sink connections that influence the flux and retention of microplastics highly superimposed natural or anthropogenic variables alter the spatiotemporal pattern of microplastic footprints with increasingly complex and compounding trends for example the greater melbourne and western port areas in australia and the rhine main watershed in germany span broad gradients of land use from undeveloped catchments to heavily developed areas initial evidence from these areas delineated microplastic hotspots caused by a combination of natural accumulation through hydrological dynamics and contributions from increasing anthropogenic influences klein et al 2015 su et al 2020 these studies reveal that when investigations only evaluate individual environmental compartments or focus on unidirectional output the interdependencies of environmental compartments and the superimposed influences of variables may be overlooked this result in underestimates or probabilistic errors when quantifying the continuity and variability of microplastic flow consequences in the course of transmission some studies have investigated the impacts of weather and sewer and wastewater systems on receiving water microplastics chen et al 2020 wagner et al 2019 these have speculated that non point sources are a critical force dominating microplastic pollution in urban water bodies during dry weather which differs from wet weather situations this indicates temporal variability and weather dominated patterns in the source output and current flow state of microplastics in urban agglomerations in addition the research identified a low level of microplastics in the receiving waters in the central urban areas alfonso et al 2020 chen et al 2020 this finding differed from the reported positive association between aquatic microplastic pollution and the distance from the urban center wang et al 2017 in this respect global studies have verified the roles of environmental practices in mitigating the gross output of land based microplastics faltstrom and anderberg 2020 lau et al 2020 siegfried et al 2017 while evidence based strategies with systematic benefits in shaping the microplastic distributions over the watershed have not yet been established collectively these findings highlight four essential questions related to tracking the prevalence of microplastics in urban agglomeration waters from a systemic perspective 1 based on uniform evaluation criteria what are the microplastic stocks of different sources and what are their contributions to the contaminations of receiving water 2 what is the structure and mass flow of the microplastic transmission network 3 what roles do current environmental management practices play in the microplastic transmission network 4 how do weather patterns alter the mass flows given accelerating global climate change and the broad upgrades to pollution governance practices quantifying the stocks and flows of land based microplastics in urban agglomeration should be bundled and compiled in a structured way establishing a source pathway receptor framework is a prerequisite for clarifying these problems and avoiding single initiatives that have limited effects this is important for building a foundation that supports environmental strategic decisions or initiatives focusing on management or control priorities that achieve microplastic budget abatement this study established a microplastic mass balance model with a multi directional transmission network based on the source pathway receptor framework and a territory based accounting of data monitored and collected in 2018 2020 in shanghai megacity china we identified details of a baseline scenario for the occurrence and transmission of microplastics in the urban agglomeration at a watershed scale in the context of current environmental management practices the highly urbanized shanghai megacity where environmental management practices have been successively upgraded in the last two decades is an effective study area for understanding the variability of microplastic contamination in response to sources pathways and abatement strategies the model involved annual source stocks and pathway flows with variations under dry and wet weather patterns major pollution sources inventoried included domestic sewage ds industrial wastewater iw atmospheric fallout af livestock and poultry breeding wastewater lpbw aquacultural wastewater aw and crop farming wastewater cfw we evaluated the abatement efficacies of the sewer system wastewater treatment plant wwtp and surface runoff management management of af and agriculture were also reviewed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sampling events the shanghai megacity is an urban agglomeration a population exceeding 24 million of one central city and seven satellite towns in eastern china this is an approximately 6340 km2 river plain network area within the huangpu river watershed with thousands of branching canals the yangtze river and huangpu river are considered two of the largest contributors to marine microplastic loads worldwide lebreton et al 2017 sampling events were conducted during 2018 2019 and included 10 ds sites 10 iw sites 10 af sites 6 lpbw sites 6 aw sites and 6 cfw sites fig 1 the ds samples were collected from the inspection wells of branched sewage sewers extending from residential communities five urban sites and five suburban sites iw samples included the rigorously pretreated production wastewater cooling wastewater and cleaning wastewater collected from the main sewer inspection wells that were close to the industrial park outlets these included five light industrial sites and five heavy industrial sites the enterprises in the light industrial areas were mainly manufacturers of clothing textiles food and packaging materials the heavy industrial areas included port machine manufacturing and petrochemical industries the lpbw samples were of the effluent from the wastewater treatment facilities of six large enterprises raising pigs cattle and chickens the aw samples were collected from receded wastewater generated by routine water refresh during dry weather from freshwater fish shrimp and crab ponds the cfw samples included receded wastewater from paddy fields rice cultivation in dry weather and the surface runoff from the dry fields vegetable and fruit tree cultivation and paddy fields in wet weather both types of wastewater samples were collected at the effluent outlets the af samples were collected near the underlying surface from five urban sites and five suburban sites the sites were within open areas of residential commercial and traffic land uses surrounded by medium and low buildings including dry and wet fallouts details about the sampling methods are presented in text s1 2 2 microplastic identification liquid samples were treated with 1 m naoh at 65 c and were then shaken in the dark at 80 rpm for 48 h to digest biological and abiological materials each sample was then filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon filter under a vacuum the process used to filter and pretreat af samples is described in a separate study wright et al 2020 sample filters were visually examined for microplastics using a high speed stereomicroscope vhx 6000 keyence japan with 100 200 magnification fig s1 all the plastic like items on the filters were inspected and counted according to their morphological characteristics and the criteria described in a separate study dris et al 2015 each item s shape was categorized as granule granule microbead fragment pellet fiber fiber line or film film foam samples of the items in a one third subsample were randomly selected and analyzed using a micro fourier transform infrared spectrometer μft ir coupled with an attenuated total reflectance atr accessory nicolet in10 mx transmission modes thermo fisher scientific usa this was done to identify the sample polymer types based on the presence of characteristic ir peaks and the similarity of the matched spectra in the ft ir polymer spectrum library match score 80 approximately 76 of the sampled items were verified to be microplastics quality control measures were implemented to minimize potential airborne particles and microplastic contamination in the laboratory processes text s2 2 3 microplastic mass balance model to establish the multi directional transmission network comprised of sources interlinked pathways and output endpoints a microplastic mass balance model with source stock and pathway flow analysis was constructed based on the source pathway receptor framework waldschlager et al 2020 and territory based accounting text s3 the baseline scenario of microplastic occurrence and spread in the urban agglomeration focused on currently implemented practices including policies and law enforcement engineering facilities technological processes and terminal disposals fig 2 the initial pollution sources in a watershed system are generated through a wide range of anthropogenic activities that are highly diverse spatiotemporally complicated and lack detailed records it is difficult for them to be individually tracked and quantified this study applied a general and feasible approach where each pollution source was defined by its first layer entry path to the next environmental compartment after discharge as such one kind of microplastic source covers all of its potential sub categories text s4 according to the national pollution source census and regional environmental statistical survey from 2015 to 2019 ds iw af lpbw aw and cfw sources dominate land based pollutant outputs entering the freshwater system across shanghai and all of china we assume the system structure is in a steady state issues excluded in the defined boundary are described in text s5 source stocks of microplastics were quantified using the in field monitoring data obtained through the sampling described above the mass balance model using the six types of annual stocks was a starting point that was then reconciled to determine the transfer coefficients in a total of 27 individual pathway flows this was done to describe the partitioning of mass input to outputs the parameters used to create the transfer coefficient distributions were collected from the 2018 to 2020 empirical and statistical data disclosed in peer reviewed literature local government bulletins industrial reports and the pollution source census in particular because microplastics cannot be easily recycled like plastic waste the microplastic stocks and flows were quantified based on the static mass balance the aquatic microplastic abundance used in the model was the averaged value of the event mean abundance text s6 atmospheric microplastic abundance was measured using the average value a complete list of the quantification principles boundaries transfer coefficients and models of all the microplastic stock and flow items in dry and wet weather and the related data sources are provided in texts s7 s8 and s9 the methods used to analyze data quality and assess uncertainty is described in text s10 the calculation of averages and standard deviations one way analysis of variance anova and paired sample t test were performed using ibm spss statistics 25 tests were considered significant at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 microplastic characteristics fig 3 shows the abundance of microplastics from the six sources iw and af microplastics were present at the highest levels in both dry d and wet w weather with iw reaching 119 4 38 9 d and 104 2 20 3 w particles l and af reaching 77 6 31 5 d and 92 0 26 4 w particles d m2 in dry weather higher levels of microplastics were seen in heavy iw samples compared to light iw samples p 0 004 there were higher levels of af microplastics in urban areas compared to suburban areas p 0 035 lpbw samples had microplastic levels of 24 8 12 6 d and 25 9 17 1 w particles l in contrast ds microplastics reached 14 3 7 7 d and 11 6 5 3 w particles l the microplastics discharged from urban areas were present at higher levels compared to suburban regions in both dry p 0 01 and wet weather p 0 05 cfw microplastics reached only 3 7 3 6 particles l w samples from dry fields had significantly higher microplastic levels compared to paddy fields p 0 003 paddy field cfw microplastics were present at only 2 1 1 2 particles l d aw microplastics reached a level of 16 8 6 8 d particles l fig 4 depicts the polymer and morphological characteristics of the microplastics the polymer compositions of the microplastics in ds af lpbw and aw were generally consistent polyethylene terephthalate pet was the main ingredient 57 2 70 9 followed by polycarbonate pc polyethersulfone pes and polypropylene pp in contrast the microplastic composition of iw and cfw significantly differed from other sources with pc 52 0 61 4 and pp 41 3 48 8 being the dominant microplastics in these two sources respectively pet accounted for 30 0 in addition polyethylene pe made up 14 1 33 4 of the microplastics in cfw regarding microplastic shape cfw microplastics were mainly composed of films 57 5 68 1 and granules 24 4 31 2 the other five sources were dominated by fibers 86 9 99 4 the size of the microplastics in the six sources generally ranged from 0 08 to 1 mm 63 9 88 1 the size of microplastics in af and cfw was larger with the proportion falling in the 1 5 mm size range reaching 35 0 3 2 microplastic stocks of the six sources the annual microplastic stocks of wastewater from the six sources according to weather pattern and flow direction are shown in fig 5 the total load of these six sources amounted to 5317 7 2175 3 d and 3320 1 953 6 w tons a and 2347 8 766 9 and 1991 8 701 8 tons a directly entered the sewer system and receiving water respectively af sources made up the largest proportions followed by iw and ds sources these three sources had the microplastic stocks in dry and wet weather as follows af sources at 3747 2 1522 7 d and 2577 8 741 2 w respectively accounting for 70 5 and 77 6 of the total annual stocks iw sources at 768 0 250 5 d and 388 7 75 8 w respectively 14 4 and 11 7 of total and ds sources at 462 0 248 1 d and 218 8 100 1 w 8 7 and 6 6 tons a respectively the sewer system received only af iw and ds microplastics accounting for 997 6 237 7 42 5 703 5 198 4 30 0 and 646 7 330 7 27 5 tons a respectively af and iw microplastics entering receiving water reached respective stocks at 1030 7 366 7 51 7 and 453 2 127 8 22 8 tons a respectively ds microplastics entering receiving water showed a lower stock at 34 0 17 4 tons a 1 7 in contrast microplastic stocks of the three agricultural sources were low during both dry and wet weather at 6 4 and 4 1 respectively lpbw sources were particularly low however when examining these microplastic loads entering receiving water agricultural wastewater output 23 8 remained significant and aw 224 5 90 6 tons a and cfw 247 6 98 3 tons a contributed proportions of 11 3 and 12 4 respectively 3 3 microplastic flows fig 6 maps the microplastic flows in the multi directional transmission network the total microplastic flows eventually entering receiving water reached 3207 4 1071 6 tons a of these flows the largest contributions were from the following sources wwf 761 1 230 5 tons a 23 7 direct af 695 7 249 0 tons a 21 7 wwtp effluent 456 1 140 3 tons a 14 2 iw 453 2 127 8 tons a 14 1 and surface runoff 335 0 117 7 tons a 10 4 microplastics retained in terminal disposal presented a total flow of 2088 9 785 6 tons a making up approximately two fifths of the microplastic flows that would have been delivered into receiving water of these flows land surface sweep contributed 45 8 956 7 388 8 tons a followed by flows retained in sewage sludge 730 8 224 9 tons a 35 0 and sewer sediment 399 9 171 3 tons a 19 1 atmospheric deposition was the largest scale pathway for microplastic flows in the urban agglomeration 6325 2263 9 tons a however land surface sweep and captures via permeable and impermeable land surfaces in built up regions led to a 52 8 reduction in the total microplastic flows this level of retention led to the land surface being the largest receptor of urban agglomeration microplastic flows the sewer system and wwtp played a crucial role in the microplastic flows from ds iw and surface runoff of the total 2347 8 766 8 tons a of microplastic flows entering the sewer system 48 6 1141 6 345 7 tons a was in the intercepted initial storm sewage entering the wwtp 32 4 was discharged out through wwf and entered the receiving water 17 0 settled into the sewer sediment during the transportation of dry weather wastewater the remained microplastics that eventually entered the wwtp through dry weather wastewater accounted for only 3 8 45 3 19 4 tons a of the total flows 61 6 of the total 1186 9 365 1 tons a of microplastic flows in the wwtp settled into the excess sewage sludge for further disposal 4 discussion 4 1 microplastic stocks of the pollution sources in the urban agglomerations recent studies have demonstrated that the atmosphere can be a critical source of microplastics in freshwater allen et al 2019 however little is known about its contribution to downstream environmental compartments we demonstrated the prominent risk of af as the largest source of microplastics in urban agglomeration waters both in terms of the exported volumes accounting for 70 of the total microplastic stocks and its diffusion involving mass flows in multiple directions a previous observational study reported that the inhalation of plastic fibers and particles may be associated with dyspnea caused by airway and interstitial inflammation prata 2018 as such the significant load of af microplastics would raise a public health concern our results were significantly higher than a previous rough estimate which showed that af generated deposits of 3 to 10 tons of fibers per year in the parisian agglomeration in france dris et al 2016 this indicates a discernible global difference in terms of the settling velocity in dry or wet weather our results quantified a higher level of microplastics for the shanghai megacity compared to those recorded in other seven coastal cities in china cai et al 2017 liu et al 2020 however the levels were lower than those seen in both paris france dris et al 2016 and london england wright et al 2020 generally these af microplastics have been recognized as originating in anthropogenic debris or city dust with sources such as synthetic clothing road tire abrasions plastic litter building materials or footwear the paris study reported that the flux was higher at the urban sites compared to the suburban sites dris et al 2016 this study showed a consistent result while further demonstrating that it occurred almost exclusively in dry weather this appears to explain the previous statistical conclusion that non point source is the critical force dominating the microplastic pollution in urban waters during dry weather given current environmental governance conditions chen et al 2020 the stock of af microplastics can be influenced by source distribution wind strength and weather patterns this complicates the tracing and prediction of the presence of af microplastics plastics cosmetics and paint enterprises generate primary microplastics non plastic manufacturing industries often create secondary microplastics to establish a loop locked policy system involving source control at the national level the direct discharge of iw from both these types of enterprises is prohibited or reduced through active management even when these wastewaters have been pretreated currently iw microplastics that are directly discharged to the environment are generally not the focus of intense debate with few available data however broader global evidence has illustrated that industrial land uses can contribute more plastic pollutants to the adjacent aquatic environments than other land uses lassen et al 2015 su et al 2020 this confirms the ubiquitous leaking of iw another example illustrating this was a positive correlation between the percentage of industrial area and microplastic pollution in estuarine rivers in the chesapeake bay usa yonkos et al 2014 our study determined that iw microplastics entering receiving water reached stocks at 453 2 127 8 tons a there was also a non negligible volume discharged through drainage networks and wastewater systems these microplastics were mainly composed of pet and pc which are used to manufacture such items as packaging materials textiles electronic appliances and automotive parts additionally we found higher levels of microplastics in heavy iw compared to light iw this was consistent with what we found in regionally relevant waters chen et al 2020 this may indicate that iw plays a critical role in regional discrepancies in the upper limit of microplastics in urban waters ds is mainly comprised of laundry effluents and has long been considered an important contributor of microplastics to urban waters hernandez et al 2017 in china and elsewhere microfibers derived from textile washing may contribute approximately 35 of the microplastics identified in the aquatic system xu et al 2020 similarly the ds microplastics identified in this study were also mainly fibrous pet was present at high levels and is widely used in garment processing kawecki et al 2019 cosmetics and personal care products are other vital sources of microplastics in ds one study estimated that approximately 2300 tons of plastic microbeads enter the north sea through ds every year gouin et al 2015 however this study found that the level of microplastics in ds was not expectedly high with an annual discharge load reaching only 6 6 8 7 of the total microplastic stocks of the six sources this level was lower than the level seen from af and iw microplastics directly discharged through ds to receiving waters reached only 1 7 of the total there is a lack of knowledge about the level of microplastics released from agricultural activities given the estimation challenges in this study a low load of microplastics was found to be exported by agricultural wastewater and low levels were found in both farmland runoff and receding water this finding was consistent with results found in the lake ontario watershed grbic et al 2020 however it was unexpected that agricultural microplastics could still reach a level of 23 8 of the total flow entering receiving waters in the shanghai agglomeration especially from crop farming and aquaculture this highlights the need to further assess the scale of microplastic contamination within agricultural fields aw microplastics have been generally considered to be an immediate source of risk in water particularly in the ocean rochman 2018 and estuarine shore xu et al 2018 whereas the problem of freshwater aw microplastics has not received much attention artificial freshwater pond systems must maintain high water quality levels for example the total suspended solids tss standard should be below 10 mg l however given the production of economic species discharged microplastics may not be low data from this study showed that the freshwater aw microplastics exported to receiving water amounted to 11 3 of the total load these microplastics mainly included pe pp and nylon often derived from fishing gear bubbles float and synthetic ropes and nets microplastics discharged with lpbw have been overlooked this study confirmed its minimal direct discharge load however its significant reuse for farmland fertilization or compost storage wu et al 2021 may exacerbate the large accumulation of microplastics in farmlands 4 2 weather pattern diverges the microplastic transmission pathways and flows weather patterns shift hydrologic states creating divergent microplastic transmission pathways and flows the mass flow balance revealed that storm events had a driving effect on the export of non point source microplastics during wet weather this superimposed significant contamination on the background values of the receiving water particularly those caused by urban runoff and wwf in this study wwf was found to be the largest contributor 23 7 at higher levels than wwtp effluent 14 2 however wwtp effluent has been the focus of most concern to date this finding is consistent with previous estimations based on the discharged wastewater yields and empirical correlation evidence chen et al 2020 the direct discharge of storm runoff contributed only 10 4 of the total microplastic input of receiving water however the divergent flows from storm runoff also made up large proportions of the microplastics in wwf and wwtp effluent thus storm runoff is a key initiator in the wet weather output pattern of microplastics in urban agglomerations this finding is consistent with observations from other urban associated environmental compartments for example microplastic abundances were reported to be higher during wet than dry conditions in storm runoff affected urban rivers in southern california and in the great lakes tributary in the usa baldwin et al 2016 moore et al 2011 the sewer system is the major pathway for microplastics moving from land based sources to the receiving waters in storm runoff this study helps build an understanding of the fate of microplastics within the sewer system further study is needed to complete detailed tracing activities and quantification wet weather patterns increase the microplastics exported from farmland surfaces while the incremental level assessed shows limited value to quantify the variations in annual flows caused by weather patterns it is crucial to also present the model links among microplastic loads based on wet weather days and rainfall intensity this could be valuable for future aggregate forecasting several studies have analyzed single storm events to assess the statistical association between rainfall intensity and climatic variables and the levels of microplastics delivered into the water table s1 microplastics originate in atmospheric sources agricultural sources and sewer wastewater that sink and accumulate in dry weather and that are delivered into receiving waters under wet weather this creates a lagging timeline mode and changes the basic spatiotemporal characteristics of microplastic pollution in urban agglomerations analyzing the antecedent dry weather days adwd is crucial in determining the degree of contamination induced by weather patterns a longer adwd may allow for more microplastic accumulation and with a diurnal resolution may result in significant variability in the peak microplastic level based on the characteristics of storm events the impacts created by the lagging effect are widespread causing the land surface to be a sizeable long term terminal receptor agricultural soils in particular represent large environmental reservoirs of microplastics nizzetto et al 2016b these are contributed by af the reuse of lpbw and wwtp sewage sludge and widely used plastic products such as pet or pe mulch plastic films and drainage tubes in this study the observed low levels of microplastics in both farmland runoff and receded wastewater provided evidence of the extensive retention of microplastics in agricultural soils in dry weather it also indicates that their possible persistent adverse ecological effects are a far more serious problem than those microplastics that are drained out in wet weather this is particularly true because agricultural soils are considered capable of retaining microplastics better than urban soils due to their greater permeability and lower surface runoff generation nizzetto et al 2016a moreover for sewer systems constructed in plain areas with low slopes the extensively settled sediments during dry weather allow microplastics that would otherwise enter and be disposed of in the wwtp to be washed into the receiving waters through wwf this constitutes a vast short term pollution peak in urban waters 4 3 role of environmental management practices in mitigating microplastic flows this study is the first to provide quantitative evidence of the systemic role of environmental management practices in mitigating aquatic microplastic pollution occurring in urban agglomerations we found that terminal disposal practices can retain approximately two fifths of the microplastic flows that would have otherwise been delivered into receiving water of the major contributors of microplastics at the watershed scale the atmosphere has been consistently confirmed to be ubiquitous and prominent in its adverse impacts however achieving source based abatement of af microplastic budgets is complex and costly since it involves industrial restructuring and clean energy development however it remains the most sensible place for such control thus it has become a priority to intervene in pollution events driven by storm runoff to mitigate the downward microplastic flows this is because storm runoff was identified as the driver of the wet weather output pattern of microplastics especially those originating from non point sources a previous study in this region found that interception measures for the initial 55 of storm runoff can control 60 70 of urban non point source pollutant loads he et al 2018 in this regard using natural features to mimic the undeveloped hydrologic properties of the site such as low impact development lid or sponge city development can extend runoff flow pathways and slow the flow allowing soil and vegetation to retain microplastics and attenuate both peaks and the total volumes table s2 for example a rain garden has been confirmed to remove 96 of anthropogenic debris werbowski et al 2021 bioretention cells have also been recommended as preventative measures for microplastics in urban areas showing an 84 decrease in the median levels of microplastics smyth et al 2021 the wet pond is the most common storm runoff treatment approach constructed in sweden retaining approximately 80 of suspended solids larm and alm 2016 nevertheless implementing lid infrastructure is challenging due to limited space as such reducing the need for treatment by implementing non structural measures such as road sweep and restrictions on the use of studded tires can be strong alternative measures werbowski et al 2021 the sweep rate of street dust below 2 mm using a machine has been reported to retain 15 to 80 of microplastics amato et al 2010 our evaluation showed that microplastics captured by land surface sweep accounted for nearly half of the total load deposited through terminal disposal practices demonstrating its abatement efficacy sewer and wastewater treatment systems form the major pathway connecting the sources of wastewater drain with receiving waters even there is currently no global quantification available studies in the shanghai and paris agglomerations chen et al 2020 martin and scott 2017 have provided evidence related to wwf and wwtp effluent verifying their significant contributions to aquatic microplastics this indicates that managing sewer and wastewater treatment systems may be a tangible solution to achieve a large scale abatement of the export of land based microplastics given the transmission of microplastic flows along the sewer and wastewater treatment system the key links for microplastic abatement involve improving front end wastewater collection management and treatment of sewer sediment storm sewage interception overflow reduction and wwtp removal targeted policies and efficient execution of wastewater collection activities are vital some developed areas such as cities in europe australia and the usa have significantly improved their water quality levels in urban rivers barrows et al 2018 su et al 2020 however the global wastewater collection rate has remained at an average of only 20 sonneveld et al 2018 in the shanghai agglomeration the low iw collection rate is still a severe problem that has resulted in high levels of microplastic discharge this is also a problem in other developing countries lahens et al 2018 siegfried et al 2017 storm runoff management infrastructure combined with wastewater collection practices could be an optimal strategy based on the systemic benefits for example adding lid to gray infrastructure can provide an additional reduction in annual overflow increasing the reduction from 9 76 to 15 77 liao et al 2015 accumulated sewer sediment is displaced and removed in storm events increasing the contamination load of wwf and creating a shock for wwtp operations in wet weather the first flushed wwf from most sewer systems is intercepted by setting a reasonable intercepting ratio with settling done in detention tanks these practices reduce a large number of discharged solid pollutants table s3 spatiotemporally sound sewer sediment dredging and treatment may effectively mitigate microplastic discharges investigations performed in 2020 in the shanghai megacity in china indicated that desilting efforts led to nearly a one fourth reduction in pollutants in regional wwf events the wwtp is the final barrier to reducing microplastic discharges with significant differences in removal effectiveness across global regions table s4 developing countries generally exhibit low removal efficiency implementing further improvements in removal efficiency is challenging the dredged sewer sediment and the sewage sludge from wwtp are thickened dewatered dried and landfilled or reused improper disposal and recycling policies make them a critical source of land based microplastics mahon et al 2017 overall under the ideal conditions of the baseline scenario the discrepancies in the efficiency gains when mitigating total microplastic loads entering receiving water are clear when achieved by the individually deployed practices mentioned above in sewer and wastewater treatment systems text s11 the linear models showed that improvements in wwtp removal efficiency storm sewage interception rate iw collection rate and sewer sediment dredge rate could further improve the efficacy of mitigation activities fig s2 microplastic stocks and flows from agricultural non point sources provide a different perspective with respect to urban point sources farmlands and aquacultural ponds are enormous reservoirs transmitting microplastics through polder ditches or through direct discharges the presence of microplastics is not currently a monitoring indicator that triggers control actions this is a liability in managing them and is caused by the popular and widespread focus on resource reclamation and utilization reusing resources also redistributes the microplastics present within those resources sewage sludge is widely used as a fertilizer and soil amendment for agricultural applications in many developed regions galafassi et al 2019 one study estimated that 125 850 tons of microplastic million inhabitants have been added annually to european agricultural soils nizzetto et al 2016b lpbw and biosolids are generally composted and reused for soil amendment before the seeding period these are new microplastic sources in agricultural soil which potentially threaten the safety of resource utilization and their retained loads are currently unknown this highlights that the mitigation efficacy of an individual environmental management practice may be one sided and may intensify the mass flow to the next environmental compartment creating even greater ecological risk soil remediation is difficult and costly with the intervention of source inputs remaining the best and most critical solution it is important to further establish thresholds for microplastic mass in sewage sludge or lpbw used for agricultural applications controlling aw discharges is on china s agenda however there are no universally applicable measures that can be implemented as one possibility however a previous study found that the removal rate of aw tss by artificial wetlands ranged from 80 5 to 82 9 zhang et al 2018 5 conclusion this study is the first known attempt to model and quantify the stocks and flows of microplastic as a mass balance system we also provide novel and comprehensive insights into the detailed baseline scenario of the occurrence and multi directional spread of land based microplastics in an urban agglomeration the findings contribute to bridging the knowledge gap to understand the role of pollution sources weather patterns and environmental management practices this is essential for systematically directing management efforts to reduce microplastic budgets in the future especially for proposing targeted mitigation strategies to settle risks associated with key transmission nodes results show the following 1 the total stock of the six sources was 5317 7 2175 3 d and 3320 1 953 6 w tons a 2 an estimated 2347 8 766 9 and 1991 8 701 8 tons a flows directly entered the sewer system and receiving water from the six sources respectively 3 microplastic stocks were identified in the following order af iw ds cfw aw lpbw 4 total microplastic flows entering receiving water reached 3207 4 1071 6 tons a the largest contributions came from wwf direct af wwtp effluent

efficacies in mitigating microplastic flows further research is needed to clarify the efficacies of different abatement strategies based on the combined scenarios and to assess the systemic benefits and risks it is also vital to establish an elaborated list of microplastic sources and process descriptions and to reduce model uncertainty declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

15516,sewage sludge ss is rich in nutrient elements such as phosphorus p nitrogen n and potassium k and therefore a candidate material for use in agriculture but high content of heavy metals hms can be a major obstacle to its further utilization therefore an appropriate hm removal technology is required before its land application in this study an innovative biodegradable agent citric acid fecl3 ammonium hydroxide tetrasodium iminodisuccinate ids and tea saponin assisted electrokinetic treatment ek was performed to investigate the hm removal efficiency rhms and nutrient transportation citric acid ids and fecl3 assisted ek showed a preferable average rhms rave reduction of 52 74 59 23 with low energy consumption after treatment the content of hg 0 51 mg kg 1 ni 13 23 mg kg 1 and pb 26 45 mg kg 1 elements met the criteria of national risk control standard in all cases following the treatment most hms in ss had a reduced potential to be absorbed by plants or be leached into water systems risk assessment indicated that the geoaccumulation index igeo value of hms has decreased by 0 28 2 40 and the risk of pb igeo 0 74 reduced to unpolluted potential meanwhile no excessive nutrient loss in ss occurred as a result of the treatment on the contrary there was a slight increase in p content 18 17 mg g 1 these results indicate that agent assisted ek treatment could be an environmentally friendly method for rhms and nutrient element recovery from ss opening new opportunities for sustainable ss recycling and its inclusion into circular economy concepts graphic abstract

introduction in recent years rapid economic development and urbanization have led to a massive increase in municipal wastewater production to solve this 15 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been set up in lhasa by 2019 and more wwtps have been put into naqu shigatse and other places in tibet the total annual ss production amount has reached up to 7 69 107 tons water content of 80 chen et al 2021b although ss production is increasing sharply tibet s current ss treatment capacity and treatment technology are seriously inadequate a large amount of ss was accumulated in the wwtps which seriously affects the normal operation of the factories the magnitude of ss production has stimulated the search for proper treatment options to avoid irreversible impacts ss is rich in nutrient elements for example p n and k required for plant growth considerably higher than in many other materials including biomass and manures tang et al 2022 however ss can contain a range of harmful substances including hms and organic pollutants xia et al 2020 more than half of hms in wastewater would be condensed in ss through bacterial absorption and mineral particle adsorption wang et al 2021b resulting in relatively high concentrations among the hms typically found in ss hg cu pb cr ni zn and cd are the main obstacle to further agricultural applications of ss yesil et al 2021 notably cu content 121 15 mg kg 1 in tibetan ss used in this study was about 2 4 times higher than the national soil environmental risk control standard value 50 mg kg 1 cd concentration 0 63 mg kg 1 reached over 14 4 times higher than the soil background value of tibet 0 04 mg kg 1 without proper treatment these harmful substances would be released into the environment causing pollution and endangering public health zheng et al 2020 even with moderate content of hms in ss bioavailable metals can accumulate in soil or vegetation over time with repeated ss applications zheng et al 2021 considering the fragile ecosystems in tibet and the many not yet fully understood potential risks of hms both hm concentration and bioavailability should be reduced prior to utilization of ss and its derived products in agricultural fields ek technique employs a low level direct current that passes across ss enabling contaminants to migrate towards cathode by electrophoresis electromigration and electroosmosis zeng et al 2021 during ek treatment water is reduced at the cathode chamber to produce hydroxyl ions oh and water oxidation occurs in anode chamber and produces h ions lower ph increases the rhms by dissolving the stable hms into exchangeable forms zhang et al 2020 tang et al 2021 reported high rcu rzn rcr rpb and rni 60 40 by approaching anode ek technique by ss acidification and ph decrease researchers chen et al 2021a liu et al 2017 tang et al 2020 xu et al 2017 applied various chemicals to reduce electrolyte ph variation which all confirmed the feasibility of ek treatment with considerable rhms 19 34 however these researches mainly focus on rhms of ss but ignored the further utilization potential of the ek treated ss ekss though xu et al 2019 claimed no excessive na and mg2 loss in ek treated soil was observed and kou et al 2020 proved that c n and p were retained after ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta acid extraction treatment of digested ss no related research illustrated the changes of nutrient elements n p and k in ekss or evaluated its potential for further utilization besides ek technique faces some challenges as the dissolved hms ions are adsorbed on the ss particles and form precipitates with carbonates hydroxides and other compounds near the cathode in the high ph area blocking the ek process recently chemical additives were employed to break the above mentioned obstacle and improve rhms chen et al 2021a added dicarboxymethyl glutamic acid glda to pretreat flue gas desulfurization derived ss in ek treatment their results showed that rcr increased by 22 48 compared to the unenhanced ek process traditional chelating agents including edta hanay et al 2009 ethylenediamine disuccinic acid edds and nitrilotriacetic acid nta song et al 2016 were also tested to improve rhms in ek treatment by solubilizing the hms but most traditional agents are non biodegradable posing secondary pollution and potential risk to the environment therefore five representative types of non toxic and biodegradable agents including organic acid citric acid alkaline ammonium hydroxide inorganic salt fecl3 traditional chelation agent ids and eco friendly chelating agent tea saponin were chosen to enhance rhms of ss in the ek technique in this paper citric acid has been used to improve the rhms by adjusting the ph value while ammonium hydroxide could transform the stable hms into unstable states suanon et al 2016 fecl3 has been reported for hm removal as increasing the ions concentration in the ss solution and governed by the hydroxide equilibria moon et al 2021 ids is an eco friendly chelator to replace the traditional chelating agent which is mainly utilized as a water treatment agent for its strong chelation of hms wu et al 2015 these agents showed high potential for rhms by chemical extraction method ma et al 2020 xu et al 2017 but few researchers combined them with ek treatment tea saponin is extracted from tea tree seeds with good biological activity and has an obvious effect on rhms by reducing surface tension although previous studies tang et al 2020 tang et al 2018 indicated that biosurfactants rhamnolipid saponin and sophorolipid could enhance ek treatment which improved rcu rzn rpb and rni by 23 30 respectively compared to the unenhanced ek treatment but the mechanism of biosurfactants in ek treatment remains largely unknown as different agents had varying effects on the rhms due to their different mechanisms this study focused on investigation and comparison of the effectiveness of five different types of eco friendly agents and underlying mechanisms in this study tibetan ss was treated with five agent assisted ek treatments the primary factors of ek process were tested including ph current and energy consumption hm concentration and its distribution were investigated to explore the mechanism of agent assisted ek process in addition specific nutrient content n p and k transformation in ss during ek treatment was determined to evaluate its further utilization potential moreover the environmental risk of treated ss was estimated by the igeo which is essential for the eco environment system in tibet the objectives of this study were to 1 illustrate the effects of different agents on rhms and mechanism of agent assisted ek treatment 2 identify the nutrient element changes and 3 determine energy consumption and environmental risk of the treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 ss sample ss was collected from tibet origin wwtp co ltd tibet with an average flow of 200 000 m3 d 1 that serves 1 million equivalent inhabitants the collected ss was the secondary treatment sediment after further drying until no further weight loss ground into powder and passed through a 0 15 mm sieve 2 2 ek experiments ek treatment was performed in an ek reactor shown in fig 1 a pair of titanium plate electrodes were placed in each electrode chamber to avoid ss leakage into the electrode chambers exchange membranes cmi 7000 were attached to the plexiglass plate ek experiments were carried out at room temperature for 120 h peng and tian 2010 at a constant voltage of 24 v and 0 1 m kh2po4 was used as the electrolytes 400 g of dry sludge was mixed with 1 2 l deionized water water content 75 ek0 was the unenhanced ek treatment using deionized water as the agent in agent assisted ek treatment ss was mixed with 0 1 mol kg 1 citric acid referred to as ek1 ammonium hydroxide ek2 fecl3 ek3 ids ek4 and tea saponin ek5 ss was mixed with solutions for 24 h to ensure uniformity before the reaction during the reactions the electrolyte solution was refreshed every 24 h the electric current was monitored every 12 h by a multimeter after the reaction ss samples were oven dried ground and passed through a 0 15 mm the ekss derived from ek0 ek5 and were separately labeled as ekss0 ekss5 2 3 chemical and analytical methods 2 3 1 sludge characteristic analysis the ph of ss was determined every 24 h by a ph meter phs 3c shanghai metash the compositions of cathode sediments were determined by x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf panalytical axios and x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance the specific surface areas and pore size of ss were determined by n2 isothermal adsorption desorption behavior using a micrometrics asap 2010 automated system scanning electron microscope sem jsm 7610f was induced to characterize the structure of ss 2 3 2 hms analysis the hm concentrations in ss and ekss were determined by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometer icp ms icap q thermo after acid digestion r and rave was calculated by eq s1 s2 the sequential extraction was performed using a four step modified european community bureau of reference bcr procedure all the measurements were performed in triplicate and the standard deviation was obtained by descriptive statistics 2 3 3 energy consumption to evaluate energy efficacy the specific energy consumption per rhms eu was proposed based on the cumulative energy consumption e eqs 1 and 2 1 e 0 t u i d t 0 2 e u e i r a v e i o r r h m i where u represents the voltage v i represents the electric current a and t stands for the reaction time h eu represents the energy consumption on rhms or raves for each ek treatment kwh 2 3 4 nutrient content total p tp inorganic p ip and organic p op contents in ss and ekss were analyzed by the standard measurement and testing smt method and p concentration was analyzed by ascorbic acid method with visible spectrophotometer uv 6000pc shanghai metash in triplicate tn of samples was tested by organic elemental analyzer thermo scientific flash 2000 tk was determined by icp ms after acid digestion 2 4 risk analysis geoaccumulation index igeo was calculated by eq s3 and the criteria for igeo is shown in table s10 2 5 statistical analysis the intensity of correlation between r to ph and current was determined by pearson correlation coefficient significant differences were calculated by one way analysis of variance anova and a post hoc test was determined by waller duncan in spss 24 0 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of agents on rhm s 3 1 1 rhms hm concentrations in ss ekss and control standards of pollutants for agricultural use gb 4284 2018 are listed in table s1 hm concentrations except for ni and pb in ss exceeded the limitations in the standard all hm concentrations were much higher than the soil background in tibet reported by the ministry of environmental protection of china table s1 after ek treatment hg ni and pb met the risk control standard gb 4284 2018 the concentration of the remaining elements cd cr cu and zn fell below the standard value in ek1 while there were some exceptions in ek2 ek5 and none of these elements reached the risk control value in ek0 in the following discussion the rhms were discussed in the order of hms and the mechanisms behind performance of the different agents in the ek treatments were analyzed as demonstrated in fig 2 and table s2 ek0 exhibited the lowest rave among ek treatments while only hg obtained a high r of 70 08 the agent assisted ek treatment favored rhms in various degrees compared to ek0 the rave was enhanced from 39 33 to 59 23 ek1 showed the best acceleration performance with higher rcr rcu rni and rzn than that in other circumstances indicating citric acid was a promising agent two reasons might lead to this phenomenon 1 more h were released after mixing citric acid with ss which boosted the hms desorption from ss surface by competing for active adsorption sites of ss with hm ions tang et al 2016 2 functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl integrated by soluble organics with hms prevented the re adsorption of hms ma et al 2020 specifically in ek1 the rcr significantly raised from 11 98 ek0 to 58 22 ek1 f 219 80 p 0 01 as shown in fig 2 the increase in rcu and rzn was less evident than cr in ek1 compared to ek0 p 0 01 and rcu demonstrated positive correlations with ni r 0 92 p 0 01 and zn r 0 95 p 0 01 indicating that citric acid had homologous effects on the rcu rni and rzn table s4 unlike the results illustrated by li et al 2020a where the traditional ek treatment had a much greater rcu than rzn because of the high transfer rate of cu2 similar rcu and rzn were obtained because the constant voltage in this study ensured each element had a strong reaction to the voltage and migrated towards the cathode agent assisted ek had significant f 19 69 p 0 01 enhancement effects on rni from 21 93 ss to 55 73 ek1 the rni in peng and tian 2010 s research 34 was lower than in this study 55 73 where adopted citric acid as electrolyte to enhance the rhms this implied that citric acid showed better rni by forming mobile complexes with hm ions in ss than the effect of controlling electrolyte circulation and ph notably rni implied strong correlations with rpb r 0 96 p 0 01 and rzn r 0 83 p 0 05 error bars represent standard deviation observed for triplicate experiments smaller than symbol if not shown the rhg was the highest in all treatments and showed minor differences in agent assisted treatments and the unenhanced ek fig 2 the rhg in ek0 was similar to the highest rhg 70 93 in falciglia et al 2016 s study as shown in table s4 hg exhibited strong positive correlation with ni pb and zn p 0 05 indicating desorption of these metal ions from ss was synergistically strengthened by adding agents which led to higher r via acceleration of electromigration rcd had significantly f 11 76 p 0 01 improved from 19 81 ek0 to 54 42 ek4 cd showed close positive correlation with cu r 0 90 p 0 05 hg r 0 95 p 0 01 ni r 0 99 p 0 01 and pb r 0 98 p 0 01 it indicated that the r of these elements showed similar responses with the combination of chelating effect and ek treatment and agents significantly f 43 90 p 0 01 stimulated rpb from 20 21 ss to 54 65 ek4 therefore ids was the second effective agent for rhms after citric acid as it showed the highest rhg rcd and rpb metals extraction by citric acid and ids was based on the affinity of the organic ligand for hms and the extent of complexation between polydentate hms and organic ligands which were determined by stability and amount of metal binding functional groups on the chelator kołodyńska et al 2009 in ek4 r varied a lot on each hms because of the different responses to ids stability constants s of ids on each hm complexes was with the order of shg 14 9 scu 13 1 sni 12 2 spb 11 0 szn 10 8 scr 9 6 scd 8 4 wu et al 2015 while in this study r reduced with the sequence of hg ni pb cd cu zn cr the extraction of hms from ss was closely related to the sequence of stability constants with slight modification given the response to the agent the formation of compounds between metals and hydroxyl groups varied from each element raheem et al 2018 the rave reduced in the order of ek1 ek4 ek3 ek5 ek2 ek0 fig 2 rcd rni rpb and rzn showed minor differences in ek3 in ek5 rcr was higher than that in ek2 ek4 owing to the reduction of surface tension in metals the surfactant micelles in tea saponin provided hydrogen ions that promoted the migration and biodegradation of hms during the process and carbonyl in tea saponin indicated its strong chelating capability with hms markedly the rcr was not correlated with any other element and hence the mechanism of the agent assisted ek remained unknown agents could destroy the compounds in hms tang et al 2017 and the fractions of hms might be vastly changed after agent assisted ek treatments to illustrate the role of agents on ek treatment the bioavailability and toxicity of hms in ekss more detailed discussions focusing on the speciation of the hms are needed 3 1 2 hms speciation variations in ekss applying different agents resulted in noticeable differences in the speciation of different hms fig 3 the sum of acid soluble and reducible proportion of cu was 49 02 in ss it reduced to 35 6 42 1 in ek1 ek3 and ek5 the oxidizable fraction accounted for the highest ratio of the four fractions in all agent assisted ek treatments which indicated ekss were relatively stable and would liberate the soluble metals only in oxidizing conditions raheem et al 2018 the oxidizable fraction of ek1 was up to 57 9 and approximately 10 5 of the reducible fraction was converted to the oxidizable fraction implying that the citric acid accelerated the unstable states of hms transfer into stable status in ek2 ek5 the oxidizable fractions fluctuated by 36 4 to 47 0 therefore main distributions of cu have not changed in the rest of agent assisted ek treatment in agreement with wang et al 2021a s study error bars represent standard deviation observed for triplicate experiments smaller than symbol if not shown the acid soluble and reducible fractions of zn accounted for up to 83 1 of zn in ss resulting in a high environmental risk used on land dai et al 2019 the residual fraction accounted for 6 6 in ss increased to 20 1 in ek3 the residual fraction was related to the crystalline mineral in ss and agents especially fecl3 showed the ability to dissolve the silicate and mineral matter the acid soluble fraction was negatively correlated r 0 93 p 0 01 with the reducible zn fraction table s4 the acid soluble fraction increased after ek treatment except for ek2 as reducible fractions were partly converted into acid soluble fractions tang et al 2021 claimed that the acid soluble fraction of zn was easier to remove in ek treatment therefore reaction time might be insufficient for rzn in this study hanay et al 2009 also clarified the unchangeable zn fractions in agent assisted ek treatment because of the insufficient concentration of the washing solution the acid soluble and reducible fractions of cd in ss were in excess of 87 20 indicating an easy to extract state the residual fraction accounted for 6 2 and increased to 23 2 after ek treatment the acid soluble fraction of cd indicated a significant negative correlation with the reducible fraction r 0 98 p 0 01 the acid soluble fractions increased from 36 2 to 63 0 ek3 and 58 1 ek5 but rcd in ek3 and ek5 were lower than that in ek1 and ek4 the chelation of tea saponin led to the competition of hm ions with organic matters in ss enhancing reducible fraction conversion to acid soluble states in comparison with other agents fecl3 likely promoted the transformation of hms from stable to unstable states and the oxidizable fraction indicated negative correlation with acid soluble r 0 84 p 0 05 fraction while showing positive correlation r 0 83 p 0 05 with reducible fraction this phenomenon was obvious in ek1 and similar results were obtained in chen et al 2021a s study the chelation of citric acid caused the competition of hms ions with organic matters in ss enhancing the conversion of oxidizable fractions to easily removable states thereby facilitating rcu residual and reducible fractions were the key forms of pb and accounted for 31 5 and 59 5 respectively the proportion of acid soluble fraction of ni was relatively low in ss and decreased below 1 of the total ni in most of the ek treatments which implied limited potential to be absorbed by plants or to be leached into water systems in addition the residual fractions of ni dramatically increased in all ek treatments rising to 63 7 ek1 and 75 6 ek3 correspondingly their rpb was higher than in other ek treatments indicating that hms likely formed more stable complexes with the citric acid functional groups and were likely to be extracted in citric acid assisted ek treatment ma et al 2020 the acid soluble and reducible fractions presented similar proportion with oxidizable and residual fractions of ni the high ratio of stable fractions retarded rni from ss after ek treatment the stable fractions of ni changed to easy to extract states which was also observed in a study by liu et al 2017 indicating that if an appropriate treatment process is followed by ek treatment hms would be more effectively removed and the coupling treated ekss would be more suitable for land utilization yuan and weng 2006 the oxidizable fraction of ni indicated negative correlation with acid soluble r 0 95 p 0 01 while showed positive correlation r 0 85 p 0 05 with reducible fraction therefore agents showed synergetic effect on the removal of oxidizable and reducible fractions with ss 3 1 3 impact of agents on electric current and sludge ph rhms is closely related to the sludge ph and electric current fig 4 overall ek3 showed the lowest ph values 5 50 to 2 35 while other treatments fluctuated with the minimum ph value of 3 36 to 3 73 except for ek2 4 44 as shown in eq 3 h ions were continuously generated along with the release of charges due to water electrolysis in the anode chamber and migrated into the reaction chamber in ek3 fe3 in fecl3 converted to fe2 with the ions in the reaction chamber which reduced the ph value by accumulating the h ions a low ph value could encourage the transformation and dissolution of hms fractions cherifi et al 2016 suggesting that adding fecl3 improved the rhms by reducing the reaction ph conversely ammonia might bind with the h in ss solution and generate more oh by inducing the electrolysis of water eq 4 oh enrichment resulted in a higher ph value in ek2 3 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 4 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h adding citric acid ids and tea saponin were ineffective in reducing the ph value compared to ek0 the buffer solution kh2po4 in the electrode chamber helped maintain the ph value in the cathode and anode chambers besides citric acid contains three carboxyl function groups cooh increasing its buffering capacity and helping maintain an acidic ph value from 3 to 6 nevertheless the carbonates in the natural sediment of citric acid prevented the migration of hydrogen ions from the anode towards the cathode song et al 2016 ids is a pentadentate complexing agent that forms octahedral chelates with many metal ions the reaction with metals varied with the ph and concentration of the solution four possible stereoisomers of ids could react with the metal ions with the following reversible reaction eqs 5 9 5 m m i d s n m ids n m 6 h 3 i d s h h 4 i d s 7 h 2 i d s 2 h h 3 i d s 8 h i d s 3 h h 2 i d s 2 9 i d s 4 h h i d s 3 the ph value of ek4 was around 6 0 to 4 0 and the acid condition was suitable for ni removal ma et al 2020 the ph value of ek5 was slightly lower than ek0 because tea saponin is a non ionic surface active agent and its functional group could change the physicochemical properties of ss the aqueous solubility and mobility were strengthened by their asymmetric structure the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces between hms and tea saponin also accelerated r rahman et al 2022 as for ek1 adding citric acid reduced the ph value of ss owing to the complexes formed by citric acid and hms promoted the hms mobility through electro migration and electro osmosis the ph value showed strongly positive correlation with the reducible fraction of zn r 0 88 p 0 05 and cd r 0 89 p 0 05 it can be inferred that high ph value and the high reducible fraction proportion of cd and zn hindered its extraction rate as mentioned in 3 1 1 rcd and rzn demonstrated positive correlation with rcu still the ph did not display any correlations with fractions of cu this was due to the preferable reduction of reducible fraction proportions after ek treatments and acid soluble fraction of cd exhibited significant negative correlation with the ph value r 0 82 p 0 05 this illustrated that the acid soluble extraction would be accelerated by reducing the ph this was contrary to chilian et al 2022 s study where the removal of acid soluble fraction was strengthened by the increase of ph values this was mainly because the response to ph was different by elements the extraction of al fe and cl had better extraction potential under alkaline solutions rather than cd element as the ek process was under a constant voltage electric current variations fig 4b reflect conductivity and ion exchanges tang et al 2018 the initial current reached the maximum value at the beginning of the process then rapidly dropped in the first 24 h and gradually declined until the end of the treatment ek0 was with the lowest current on average compared with other treatments notably the initial current of ek0 was 522 ma which was much higher than the previous study 100 ma tang et al 2017 ek4 had the highest initial current 2059 ma approximately four times higher than ek0 this was mainly because ids is rich in na ions and was initially active in the ek treatment and could rapidly migrate under the electric field high currents accelerated electrophoresis and electroosmosis and allowed hm removal by frequent migration of charged ions chen et al 2021a the initial current of ek3 was high but it dramatically dropped after 24 h and the average current value after 24 h was closed to ek0 therefore adding fecl3 increased the current for a short duration but was unable to improve the current in the subsequent reaction as it may accumulate during the treatment similarly ek1 and ek2 reached around 400 500 ma initially but dropped steadily during the rest of the process the average current value of the ek1 from 24 h to 120 h was the highest in ek treatments and ended at 164 ma which was higher than the maximum value in tang et al 2018 s study this might attribute to the regular refreshment of the electrolyte solutions in this study electrolytes played a key role in maintaining the stability of the current as oh and other substances in the cathode would hinder the ion s migration xu et al 2022 the current value of ek5 increased slightly during 48 60 h this variation indicated a relatively stable process that occurred with the synergistic effect of tea saponin and ss the current indicated significantly positive correlation with acid soluble fraction of ni r 0 883 p 0 05 and negative correlation with oxidizable fraction of ni r 0 842 p 0 05 therefore high current could enhance the unstable fractions of ni into easy extraction state and promote the rni in summary different agents had their unique functions on rhms and fraction transformation as weak organic acid more h ions were released after adding citric acid and its hydroxyl and carboxyl prevented the re adsorption of hms therefore highest rcr rcu and rzn were observed hms tended to be converted into a more stable state with ammonium hydroxide especially pb is more sensitive to the alkaline environment and could be slowly dissolved in ammonium hydroxide the relatively low rhms in ek2 were attributed to the high ph values during the treatment while fe3 in fecl3 converts to fe2 with the ions during the treatment which reduced the ph value by accumulating the h ions a low ph value could encourage the transformation and dissolution of hm fractions therefore the rave of ek3 was relatively high 52 74 ids could form octahedral chelates with many hm ions but its stability was sensitive to the ph values hms showed different responses to the affinity of organic ligand and highest rcd rhg rni and rpb were reached in ek4 the surfactant micelles in tea saponin accelerated the migration and biodegradation of hms and carbonyl groups had strong chelating capability with hms adding tea saponin enhanced reducible fraction conversion to acid soluble states by the competition of hm ions with organic matters in ss 3 2 characterization of ss and ekss 3 2 1 properties of ss and ekss the specific morphology and surface area of ss and ekss were characterized by sem fig s1 and bet table s8 ss had a relatively smooth surface and hardly any pores could be seen ss and ekss were basically in granular form but the particle size of ekss was narrowed compared to ss a few pores could be seen in ekss with random distribution and some irregular particles were attached to the surface this may be due to the ph changes during ek treatment and the removal of metals from ss the bet results showed that the specific surface area of ekss reduced to varying degrees after ek treatment dropping from 42 58 m2 g 1 ss to 8 95 m2 g 1 ekss2 this reduction was consistent with previous study liu et al 2020 and was likely due to the loss of surface charge accordingly the pore size increased in ekss this could point to the adsorption of hms degradation products on the ss surface and the collapse of mesopores to macropores the microscopic morphological changes of ekss varied under different agents but ek treatment failed to show positive changes in the morphology of ss 3 2 2 nutrient analysis of ss and ekss fig 5 showed that there was no excessive nutrient tp tk and tn loss in ekss compared to ss tp content of ekss indicated a slight increase compared to ss which was in agreement with other published research 13 56 20 40 mg g 1 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2017 but lower than that in the activated sludge 32 50 mg g 1 staal et al 2019 and anaerobically digested ss 33 60 mg g 1 huang and tang 2015 and much higher than the wetland biomass tp 7 58 mg g 1 cui et al 2019 wheat straw tp 1 12 mg g 1 xu et al 2016 this increase can mainly be ascribed to the addition of kh2po4 solution in electrolytes which may introduce p to the feedstock by electromigration and electroosmosis process besides the ph value dropped from 6 2 ss to 2 34 ekss3 this was consistent with the opposite relationships between ph gradient and tp contents found by temporetti et al 2019 after ek treatment the ip content increased from 9 54 mg g 1 ss to 13 54 ekss2 and op had partially converted to ip ip usually originated from chemical phosphorus removal and the raw wastewater in ss while op was usually derived from the metabolites and assimilation of microorganisms yu et al 2021 the microbial intracellular phosphorus might react with metal ions in ss under the constant voltage this led to the release of the microbial intracellular phosphorus meanwhile converting polyphosphate pyrophosphate and organic phosphorus into orthophosphate zhang et al 2019 which was the main content of ip moreover the reclamation of ip was relevant to the ph value of ss ekss2 had the highest ph value which resulted in the highest ip content in the agent assisted ek treatments the tendency was consistent with yan et al 2021 s study that higher ph facilitated more ip release ping et al 2020 found that the citrate agent could enhance the release of p by increasing ip and li et al 2020b claimed that fecl3 could fix the dissolved phosphate from apatite phosphorus in ss at the ph of 2 5 which was consistent with ek3 the ph was around 2 5 during 72 120 h therefore tp concentration in ss was well preserved during ek treatment and was easy to utilize subsequently error bars represent standard deviation observed for triplicate experiments during ek process k was extracted from ss together with hms tk content was reduced to 7 63 0 86 mg g 1 ekss2 and 11 15 1 02 mg g 1 ekss4 compared with 13 16 0 35 mg g 1 in ss despite the mobility k ions may not electrodeposit because of the lower reduction potential compared with hms gao et al 2022 also observed the stability of k and na cations and making it difficult to precipitate in the electrolyte during ek treatment the reduction was also attributed to adding alkaline substances in ek which accelerated the formation of nh 4 and reduced the k content notably the tk content of ekss was higher than that in most of the biomass for example it was 5 times higher than that in sawdust 2 09 mg g 1 wang et al 2016 and slightly higher than that in biogas residues 8 46 mg g 1 maize silage 7 31 mg g 1 wu et al 2021b and the pig manure 11 80 mg g 1 wang et al 2016 besides tn concentration in ss was around 5 and with minor fluctuations after ek treatment in summary the ekss was rich in nutrient elements with a slight reduction of tk and tn content compared to ss and no p was lost during ek treatment the mass fraction of total nutrient tn tk tp ranged from 54 46 to 60 48 which reached the national standard index 5 of organic fertilizer ny525 2012 3 3 energy consumption and metal recycling assessment as shown in fig 6 a e gradually increased as time elapsed the greater e4 and e1 were consistent with their higher current the trends were in agreement with previous research ryu et al 2011 showing that the energy consumption had a positive correlation with current under the constant voltage gradient e0 was only half of e4 and e1 because the electric conductivity of deionized water was relatively low thus adding agents improved electric conductivity of ss solution liu et al 2017 moreover adding agents accelerated the electromigration of metal ions by strengthening desorption of metal ions e0 was similar to that reported by song et al 2016 but e0 e5 was lower than that of cherifi et al 2016 this was attributed to the fact that the required e was directly related to the processing time and ss composition to evaluate energy efficacy eu was proposed to calculate the specific energy consumption per hm removal lower value of eu indicated higher energy efficacy the highest rave 59 23 and lowest eu 1 09 kwh were obtained in ek1 this was consistent that the lowest eu of ni cu and cd was achieved in ek1 relatively low energy consumption of 445 34 wh g 1 was obtained in previous citric acid intervening ek study wu et al 2021a with rcr of 21 62 this might be due to the voltage gradient 1 v cm 1 was lower than this study 1 6 v cm 1 the lowest eu of zn was obtained in ek3 because the lowest ph value in ek3 strengthened the extraction of zn besides the lowest eu of hg was obtained in ek0 because ek0 showed relatively high rhg and the inconspicuous increase of rhg in the agent assisted ek treatment compared to ek0 this optimal eu 1 09 1 77 kwh with a high rhms was more than an order of magnitude lower than that in glda assisted ek treatment chen et al 2021a 10 01 kwh therefore citric acid in ek1 could improve the rhms with low energy consumption with electrophoresis and electroosmosis sediments were accumulated as the hms transformed from ss to the cathode chamber to access the recycling potential of the elements sediments from the cathode were characterized by xrf table s9 and xrd fig s2 sediments mainly contained metal elements of ca k mg fe mn a trace amount of si al a large amount of p and s cl with limited amounts compared with ss the proportion of p 54 83 and k 19 67 was higher in the sediments this was mainly due to the utilization of the buffering solution of kh2po4 ca content increased from 8 81 ss to 27 52 ek2 and mg rose from 1 93 ss to 23 07 ek5 indicating that a large amount of ca2 and mg2 has migrated from ss to the cathode chamber thus recycling ca mg k p from sediments is attemptable other nutrient elements such as n and na were saved in ekss which consisted of results in 3 2 2 cr only existed in the sediments of ek1 and ek4 which indicated the two ek treatments had rcr and most hms were imperceptible as the relatively low proportion in ss xrd results showed that no secondary toxic product was generated in sediments the presence of k2co3 p2o5 cahpo4 h2o 2 and zno in sediments were invisible in ss which was consistent with the xrf result that the high contents of ca2 and k in the sediments compared with ss 3 4 risk economic assessment and application analysis igeo fig 7 was mainly used to estimate the contamination risk of ss and ekss for each hms independently igeo value of ss for metals has decreased by 0 28 2 40 after ek treatment compared to ss the igeo values of ekss1 ekss2 ekss4 and ekss5 for pb were 0 which indicated their uncontaminated potential ss was identified as heavily contaminated levels for cu cd and zn and fell in the moderately heavily polluted range with few exceptions the risk level of ekss1 ekss2 and ekss5 for cr reduced to a moderately contaminated level ss had a moderately contaminated level for ni and adjusted to unpolluted moderately polluted level in ekss chen et al 2021a noted that ss after ek treatment decreased to free of pollution levels for cu zn ni and pb however the rave of zn and ni in this study was higher than that in chen et al 2021a s research and similar rcu was observed the reason for the difference in igeo values was the relatively low hm contents in the background soil of tibet the igeo values in ss for hg were higher than 6 which had an extremely contaminated class the values reduced to 3 70 4 36 after agent assisted ek treatments hg concentration in ekss0 ekss5 was lower than the national risk control standards but the igeo value indicated ss had a heavily or heavily to extremely contaminated level this may be due to the low content in the background and the strict limitations attributed to health and agricultural considerations the contamination level of treated ss for hg was also reported as extremely polluted in chen et al 2021a s study as rhg was up to 70 08 81 11 in ek treatments some more targeted treatment for example coupling with post pyrolysis is suggested to further reduce the risk of hg before direct utilization in agricultural fields error bars represent standard deviation observed for triplicate experiments smaller than symbol if not shown the economic analysis indicated that 89 48 t 1 was needed for disposing of ss by ek0 table s11 which is in agreement with zeng et al 2021 who estimated the costs of the ek process to be 100 t 1 the cost of ek1 ek5 increased to 117 69 150 20 t 1 due to the addition of agents ek3 was the most economical one because of the low e and low price of fecl3 the treatment cost was cheaper than the landfilling cost of ss 165 245 t 1 zeng et al 2021 but a more competitive cost 40 50 m 2 liu et al 2018 was found for disposing of sediment and soil remediation by ek treatment thus further investigation on parameters affecting costs is needed to improve economic feasibility agent assisted ek treatment showed high potential for field application according to igeo the hms pollution risks have decreased by 0 28 2 40 after ek treatment from the perspective of rhms hg ni and pb met the risk control standard and the rest hm concentrations have been greatly reduced compared to ss meanwhile no excessive nutrient loss was observed in ekss compared to ss however the economic feasibility and the low ion migration speed in ss may limit the field application of ek xu et al 2019 further optimization of the ek system could enhance its scalability 4 conclusions this work highlighted that ek treatment does not result in excessive nutrient loss n p and k which for the first time provided insights on further utilization potential of the ekss non toxic and biodegradable agents including citric acid ids and fecl3 showed promise as chelating agents for enhancing rhms this significantly improved rave by 26 76 33 25 and reduced pollution risk igeo by 0 84 2 40 the rpb 70 reached in this work exceeded the average rpb of 50 in the references most hms in ekss showed a lower potential to be absorbed by plants or be leached into water systems the effectiveness and mechanism of adding representative types of agents in ek treatment were clarified this work provides evidence that agent assisted ek treatment can be an environmentally friendly modification method for hm removal from ss while retaining its nutrient content making it a suitable amendment for use in agriculture in line with circular economy objectives future investigation is warranted to determine the effects of agent assisted ek treatment on nutrient speciation transformation in ss and its further utilization further optimization of the ek system is needed to enhance its scalability and reduce costs credit authorship contribution statement xutong wang

15516,sewage sludge ss is rich in nutrient elements such as phosphorus p nitrogen n and potassium k and therefore a candidate material for use in agriculture but high content of heavy metals hms can be a major obstacle to its further utilization therefore an appropriate hm removal technology is required before its land application in this study an innovative biodegradable agent citric acid fecl3 ammonium hydroxide tetrasodium iminodisuccinate ids and tea saponin assisted electrokinetic treatment ek was performed to investigate the hm removal efficiency rhms and nutrient transportation citric acid ids and fecl3 assisted ek showed a preferable average rhms rave reduction of 52 74 59 23 with low energy consumption after treatment the content of hg 0 51 mg kg 1 ni 13 23 mg kg 1 and pb 26 45 mg kg 1 elements met the criteria of national risk control standard in all cases following the treatment most hms in ss had a reduced potential to be absorbed by plants or be leached into water systems risk assessment indicated that the geoaccumulation index igeo value of hms has decreased by 0 28 2 40 and the risk of pb igeo 0 74 reduced to unpolluted potential meanwhile no excessive nutrient loss in ss occurred as a result of the treatment on the contrary there was a slight increase in p content 18 17 mg g 1 these results indicate that agent assisted ek treatment could be an environmentally friendly method for rhms and nutrient element recovery from ss opening new opportunities for sustainable ss recycling and its inclusion into circular economy concepts graphic abstract

introduction in recent years rapid economic development and urbanization have led to a massive increase in municipal wastewater production to solve this 15 wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been set up in lhasa by 2019 and more wwtps have been put into naqu shigatse and other places in tibet the total annual ss production amount has reached up to 7 69 107 tons water content of 80 chen et al 2021b although ss production is increasing sharply tibet s current ss treatment capacity and treatment technology are seriously inadequate a large amount of ss was accumulated in the wwtps which seriously affects the normal operation of the factories the magnitude of ss production has stimulated the search for proper treatment options to avoid irreversible impacts ss is rich in nutrient elements for example p n and k required for plant growth considerably higher than in many other materials including biomass and manures tang et al 2022 however ss can contain a range of harmful substances including hms and organic pollutants xia et al 2020 more than half of hms in wastewater would be condensed in ss through bacterial absorption and mineral particle adsorption wang et al 2021b resulting in relatively high concentrations among the hms typically found in ss hg cu pb cr ni zn and cd are the main obstacle to further agricultural applications of ss yesil et al 2021 notably cu content 121 15 mg kg 1 in tibetan ss used in this study was about 2 4 times higher than the national soil environmental risk control standard value 50 mg kg 1 cd concentration 0 63 mg kg 1 reached over 14 4 times higher than the soil background value of tibet 0 04 mg kg 1 without proper treatment these harmful substances would be released into the environment causing pollution and endangering public health zheng et al 2020 even with moderate content of hms in ss bioavailable metals can accumulate in soil or vegetation over time with repeated ss applications zheng et al 2021 considering the fragile ecosystems in tibet and the many not yet fully understood potential risks of hms both hm concentration and bioavailability should be reduced prior to utilization of ss and its derived products in agricultural fields ek technique employs a low level direct current that passes across ss enabling contaminants to migrate towards cathode by electrophoresis electromigration and electroosmosis zeng et al 2021 during ek treatment water is reduced at the cathode chamber to produce hydroxyl ions oh and water oxidation occurs in anode chamber and produces h ions lower ph increases the rhms by dissolving the stable hms into exchangeable forms zhang et al 2020 tang et al 2021 reported high rcu rzn rcr rpb and rni 60 40 by approaching anode ek technique by ss acidification and ph decrease researchers chen et al 2021a liu et al 2017 tang et al 2020 xu et al 2017 applied various chemicals to reduce electrolyte ph variation which all confirmed the feasibility of ek treatment with considerable rhms 19 34 however these researches mainly focus on rhms of ss but ignored the further utilization potential of the ek treated ss ekss though xu et al 2019 claimed no excessive na and mg2 loss in ek treated soil was observed and kou et al 2020 proved that c n and p were retained after ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta acid extraction treatment of digested ss no related research illustrated the changes of nutrient elements n p and k in ekss or evaluated its potential for further utilization besides ek technique faces some challenges as the dissolved hms ions are adsorbed on the ss particles and form precipitates with carbonates hydroxides and other compounds near the cathode in the high ph area blocking the ek process recently chemical additives were employed to break the above mentioned obstacle and improve rhms chen et al 2021a added dicarboxymethyl glutamic acid glda to pretreat flue gas desulfurization derived ss in ek treatment their results showed that rcr increased by 22 48 compared to the unenhanced ek process traditional chelating agents including edta hanay et al 2009 ethylenediamine disuccinic acid edds and nitrilotriacetic acid nta song et al 2016 were also tested to improve rhms in ek treatment by solubilizing the hms but most traditional agents are non biodegradable posing secondary pollution and potential risk to the environment therefore five representative types of non toxic and biodegradable agents including organic acid citric acid alkaline ammonium hydroxide inorganic salt fecl3 traditional chelation agent ids and eco friendly chelating agent tea saponin were chosen to enhance rhms of ss in the ek technique in this paper citric acid has been used to improve the rhms by adjusting the ph value while ammonium hydroxide could transform the stable hms into unstable states suanon et al 2016 fecl3 has been reported for hm removal as increasing the ions concentration in the ss solution and governed by the hydroxide equilibria moon et al 2021 ids is an eco friendly chelator to replace the traditional chelating agent which is mainly utilized as a water treatment agent for its strong chelation of hms wu et al 2015 these agents showed high potential for rhms by chemical extraction method ma et al 2020 xu et al 2017 but few researchers combined them with ek treatment tea saponin is extracted from tea tree seeds with good biological activity and has an obvious effect on rhms by reducing surface tension although previous studies tang et al 2020 tang et al 2018 indicated that biosurfactants rhamnolipid saponin and sophorolipid could enhance ek treatment which improved rcu rzn rpb and rni by 23 30 respectively compared to the unenhanced ek treatment but the mechanism of biosurfactants in ek treatment remains largely unknown as different agents had varying effects on the rhms due to their different mechanisms this study focused on investigation and comparison of the effectiveness of five different types of eco friendly agents and underlying mechanisms in this study tibetan ss was treated with five agent assisted ek treatments the primary factors of ek process were tested including ph current and energy consumption hm concentration and its distribution were investigated to explore the mechanism of agent assisted ek process in addition specific nutrient content n p and k transformation in ss during ek treatment was determined to evaluate its further utilization potential moreover the environmental risk of treated ss was estimated by the igeo which is essential for the eco environment system in tibet the objectives of this study were to 1 illustrate the effects of different agents on rhms and mechanism of agent assisted ek treatment 2 identify the nutrient element changes and 3 determine energy consumption and environmental risk of the treatments 2 materials and methods 2 1 ss sample ss was collected from tibet origin wwtp co ltd tibet with an average flow of 200 000 m3 d 1 that serves 1 million equivalent inhabitants the collected ss was the secondary treatment sediment after further drying until no further weight loss ground into powder and passed through a 0 15 mm sieve 2 2 ek experiments ek treatment was performed in an ek reactor shown in fig 1 a pair of titanium plate electrodes were placed in each electrode chamber to avoid ss leakage into the electrode chambers exchange membranes cmi 7000 were attached to the plexiglass plate ek experiments were carried out at room temperature for 120 h peng and tian 2010 at a constant voltage of 24 v and 0 1 m kh2po4 was used as the electrolytes 400 g of dry sludge was mixed with 1 2 l deionized water water content 75 ek0 was the unenhanced ek treatment using deionized water as the agent in agent assisted ek treatment ss was mixed with 0 1 mol kg 1 citric acid referred to as ek1 ammonium hydroxide ek2 fecl3 ek3 ids ek4 and tea saponin ek5 ss was mixed with solutions for 24 h to ensure uniformity before the reaction during the reactions the electrolyte solution was refreshed every 24 h the electric current was monitored every 12 h by a multimeter after the reaction ss samples were oven dried ground and passed through a 0 15 mm the ekss derived from ek0 ek5 and were separately labeled as ekss0 ekss5 2 3 chemical and analytical methods 2 3 1 sludge characteristic analysis the ph of ss was determined every 24 h by a ph meter phs 3c shanghai metash the compositions of cathode sediments were determined by x ray fluorescence spectrometry xrf panalytical axios and x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance the specific surface areas and pore size of ss were determined by n2 isothermal adsorption desorption behavior using a micrometrics asap 2010 automated system scanning electron microscope sem jsm 7610f was induced to characterize the structure of ss 2 3 2 hms analysis the hm concentrations in ss and ekss were determined by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometer icp ms icap q thermo after acid digestion r and rave was calculated by eq s1 s2 the sequential extraction was performed using a four step modified european community bureau of reference bcr procedure all the measurements were performed in triplicate and the standard deviation was obtained by descriptive statistics 2 3 3 energy consumption to evaluate energy efficacy the specific energy consumption per rhms eu was proposed based on the cumulative energy consumption e eqs 1 and 2 1 e 0 t u i d t 0 2 e u e i r a v e i o r r h m i where u represents the voltage v i represents the electric current a and t stands for the reaction time h eu represents the energy consumption on rhms or raves for each ek treatment kwh 2 3 4 nutrient content total p tp inorganic p ip and organic p op contents in ss and ekss were analyzed by the standard measurement and testing smt method and p concentration was analyzed by ascorbic acid method with visible spectrophotometer uv 6000pc shanghai metash in triplicate tn of samples was tested by organic elemental analyzer thermo scientific flash 2000 tk was determined by icp ms after acid digestion 2 4 risk analysis geoaccumulation index igeo was calculated by eq s3 and the criteria for igeo is shown in table s10 2 5 statistical analysis the intensity of correlation between r to ph and current was determined by pearson correlation coefficient significant differences were calculated by one way analysis of variance anova and a post hoc test was determined by waller duncan in spss 24 0 3 results and discussions 3 1 effect of agents on rhm s 3 1 1 rhms hm concentrations in ss ekss and control standards of pollutants for agricultural use gb 4284 2018 are listed in table s1 hm concentrations except for ni and pb in ss exceeded the limitations in the standard all hm concentrations were much higher than the soil background in tibet reported by the ministry of environmental protection of china table s1 after ek treatment hg ni and pb met the risk control standard gb 4284 2018 the concentration of the remaining elements cd cr cu and zn fell below the standard value in ek1 while there were some exceptions in ek2 ek5 and none of these elements reached the risk control value in ek0 in the following discussion the rhms were discussed in the order of hms and the mechanisms behind performance of the different agents in the ek treatments were analyzed as demonstrated in fig 2 and table s2 ek0 exhibited the lowest rave among ek treatments while only hg obtained a high r of 70 08 the agent assisted ek treatment favored rhms in various degrees compared to ek0 the rave was enhanced from 39 33 to 59 23 ek1 showed the best acceleration performance with higher rcr rcu rni and rzn than that in other circumstances indicating citric acid was a promising agent two reasons might lead to this phenomenon 1 more h were released after mixing citric acid with ss which boosted the hms desorption from ss surface by competing for active adsorption sites of ss with hm ions tang et al 2016 2 functional groups hydroxyl and carboxyl integrated by soluble organics with hms prevented the re adsorption of hms ma et al 2020 specifically in ek1 the rcr significantly raised from 11 98 ek0 to 58 22 ek1 f 219 80 p 0 01 as shown in fig 2 the increase in rcu and rzn was less evident than cr in ek1 compared to ek0 p 0 01 and rcu demonstrated positive correlations with ni r 0 92 p 0 01 and zn r 0 95 p 0 01 indicating that citric acid had homologous effects on the rcu rni and rzn table s4 unlike the results illustrated by li et al 2020a where the traditional ek treatment had a much greater rcu than rzn because of the high transfer rate of cu2 similar rcu and rzn were obtained because the constant voltage in this study ensured each element had a strong reaction to the voltage and migrated towards the cathode agent assisted ek had significant f 19 69 p 0 01 enhancement effects on rni from 21 93 ss to 55 73 ek1 the rni in peng and tian 2010 s research 34 was lower than in this study 55 73 where adopted citric acid as electrolyte to enhance the rhms this implied that citric acid showed better rni by forming mobile complexes with hm ions in ss than the effect of controlling electrolyte circulation and ph notably rni implied strong correlations with rpb r 0 96 p 0 01 and rzn r 0 83 p 0 05 error bars represent standard deviation observed for triplicate experiments smaller than symbol if not shown the rhg was the highest in all treatments and showed minor differences in agent assisted treatments and the unenhanced ek fig 2 the rhg in ek0 was similar to the highest rhg 70 93 in falciglia et al 2016 s study as shown in table s4 hg exhibited strong positive correlation with ni pb and zn p 0 05 indicating desorption of these metal ions from ss was synergistically strengthened by adding agents which led to higher r via acceleration of electromigration rcd had significantly f 11 76 p 0 01 improved from 19 81 ek0 to 54 42 ek4 cd showed close positive correlation with cu r 0 90 p 0 05 hg r 0 95 p 0 01 ni r 0 99 p 0 01 and pb r 0 98 p 0 01 it indicated that the r of these elements showed similar responses with the combination of chelating effect and ek treatment and agents significantly f 43 90 p 0 01 stimulated rpb from 20 21 ss to 54 65 ek4 therefore ids was the second effective agent for rhms after citric acid as it showed the highest rhg rcd and rpb metals extraction by citric acid and ids was based on the affinity of the organic ligand for hms and the extent of complexation between polydentate hms and organic ligands which were determined by stability and amount of metal binding functional groups on the chelator kołodyńska et al 2009 in ek4 r varied a lot on each hms because of the different responses to ids stability constants s of ids on each hm complexes was with the order of shg 14 9 scu 13 1 sni 12 2 spb 11 0 szn 10 8 scr 9 6 scd 8 4 wu et al 2015 while in this study r reduced with the sequence of hg ni pb cd cu zn cr the extraction of hms from ss was closely related to the sequence of stability constants with slight modification given the response to the agent the formation of compounds between metals and hydroxyl groups varied from each element raheem et al 2018 the rave reduced in the order of ek1 ek4 ek3 ek5 ek2 ek0 fig 2 rcd rni rpb and rzn showed minor differences in ek3 in ek5 rcr was higher than that in ek2 ek4 owing to the reduction of surface tension in metals the surfactant micelles in tea saponin provided hydrogen ions that promoted the migration and biodegradation of hms during the process and carbonyl in tea saponin indicated its strong chelating capability with hms markedly the rcr was not correlated with any other element and hence the mechanism of the agent assisted ek remained unknown agents could destroy the compounds in hms tang et al 2017 and the fractions of hms might be vastly changed after agent assisted ek treatments to illustrate the role of agents on ek treatment the bioavailability and toxicity of hms in ekss more detailed discussions focusing on the speciation of the hms are needed 3 1 2 hms speciation variations in ekss applying different agents resulted in noticeable differences in the speciation of different hms fig 3 the sum of acid soluble and reducible proportion of cu was 49 02 in ss it reduced to 35 6 42 1 in ek1 ek3 and ek5 the oxidizable fraction accounted for the highest ratio of the four fractions in all agent assisted ek treatments which indicated ekss were relatively stable and would liberate the soluble metals only in oxidizing conditions raheem et al 2018 the oxidizable fraction of ek1 was up to 57 9 and approximately 10 5 of the reducible fraction was converted to the oxidizable fraction implying that the citric acid accelerated the unstable states of hms transfer into stable status in ek2 ek5 the oxidizable fractions fluctuated by 36 4 to 47 0 therefore main distributions of cu have not changed in the rest of agent assisted ek treatment in agreement with wang et al 2021a s study error bars represent standard deviation observed for triplicate experiments smaller than symbol if not shown the acid soluble and reducible fractions of zn accounted for up to 83 1 of zn in ss resulting in a high environmental risk used on land dai et al 2019 the residual fraction accounted for 6 6 in ss increased to 20 1 in ek3 the residual fraction was related to the crystalline mineral in ss and agents especially fecl3 showed the ability to dissolve the silicate and mineral matter the acid soluble fraction was negatively correlated r 0 93 p 0 01 with the reducible zn fraction table s4 the acid soluble fraction increased after ek treatment except for ek2 as reducible fractions were partly converted into acid soluble fractions tang et al 2021 claimed that the acid soluble fraction of zn was easier to remove in ek treatment therefore reaction time might be insufficient for rzn in this study hanay et al 2009 also clarified the unchangeable zn fractions in agent assisted ek treatment because of the insufficient concentration of the washing solution the acid soluble and reducible fractions of cd in ss were in excess of 87 20 indicating an easy to extract state the residual fraction accounted for 6 2 and increased to 23 2 after ek treatment the acid soluble fraction of cd indicated a significant negative correlation with the reducible fraction r 0 98 p 0 01 the acid soluble fractions increased from 36 2 to 63 0 ek3 and 58 1 ek5 but rcd in ek3 and ek5 were lower than that in ek1 and ek4 the chelation of tea saponin led to the competition of hm ions with organic matters in ss enhancing reducible fraction conversion to acid soluble states in comparison with other agents fecl3 likely promoted the transformation of hms from stable to unstable states and the oxidizable fraction indicated negative correlation with acid soluble r 0 84 p 0 05 fraction while showing positive correlation r 0 83 p 0 05 with reducible fraction this phenomenon was obvious in ek1 and similar results were obtained in chen et al 2021a s study the chelation of citric acid caused the competition of hms ions with organic matters in ss enhancing the conversion of oxidizable fractions to easily removable states thereby facilitating rcu residual and reducible fractions were the key forms of pb and accounted for 31 5 and 59 5 respectively the proportion of acid soluble fraction of ni was relatively low in ss and decreased below 1 of the total ni in most of the ek treatments which implied limited potential to be absorbed by plants or to be leached into water systems in addition the residual fractions of ni dramatically increased in all ek treatments rising to 63 7 ek1 and 75 6 ek3 correspondingly their rpb was higher than in other ek treatments indicating that hms likely formed more stable complexes with the citric acid functional groups and were likely to be extracted in citric acid assisted ek treatment ma et al 2020 the acid soluble and reducible fractions presented similar proportion with oxidizable and residual fractions of ni the high ratio of stable fractions retarded rni from ss after ek treatment the stable fractions of ni changed to easy to extract states which was also observed in a study by liu et al 2017 indicating that if an appropriate treatment process is followed by ek treatment hms would be more effectively removed and the coupling treated ekss would be more suitable for land utilization yuan and weng 2006 the oxidizable fraction of ni indicated negative correlation with acid soluble r 0 95 p 0 01 while showed positive correlation r 0 85 p 0 05 with reducible fraction therefore agents showed synergetic effect on the removal of oxidizable and reducible fractions with ss 3 1 3 impact of agents on electric current and sludge ph rhms is closely related to the sludge ph and electric current fig 4 overall ek3 showed the lowest ph values 5 50 to 2 35 while other treatments fluctuated with the minimum ph value of 3 36 to 3 73 except for ek2 4 44 as shown in eq 3 h ions were continuously generated along with the release of charges due to water electrolysis in the anode chamber and migrated into the reaction chamber in ek3 fe3 in fecl3 converted to fe2 with the ions in the reaction chamber which reduced the ph value by accumulating the h ions a low ph value could encourage the transformation and dissolution of hms fractions cherifi et al 2016 suggesting that adding fecl3 improved the rhms by reducing the reaction ph conversely ammonia might bind with the h in ss solution and generate more oh by inducing the electrolysis of water eq 4 oh enrichment resulted in a higher ph value in ek2 3 2 h 2 o o 2 4 h 4 e 4 2 h 2 o 2 e h 2 2 o h adding citric acid ids and tea saponin were ineffective in reducing the ph value compared to ek0 the buffer solution kh2po4 in the electrode chamber helped maintain the ph value in the cathode and anode chambers besides citric acid contains three carboxyl function groups cooh increasing its buffering capacity and helping maintain an acidic ph value from 3 to 6 nevertheless the carbonates in the natural sediment of citric acid prevented the migration of hydrogen ions from the anode towards the cathode song et al 2016 ids is a pentadentate complexing agent that forms octahedral chelates with many metal ions the reaction with metals varied with the ph and concentration of the solution four possible stereoisomers of ids could react with the metal ions with the following reversible reaction eqs 5 9 5 m m i d s n m ids n m 6 h 3 i d s h h 4 i d s 7 h 2 i d s 2 h h 3 i d s 8 h i d s 3 h h 2 i d s 2 9 i d s 4 h h i d s 3 the ph value of ek4 was around 6 0 to 4 0 and the acid condition was suitable for ni removal ma et al 2020 the ph value of ek5 was slightly lower than ek0 because tea saponin is a non ionic surface active agent and its functional group could change the physicochemical properties of ss the aqueous solubility and mobility were strengthened by their asymmetric structure the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic forces between hms and tea saponin also accelerated r rahman et al 2022 as for ek1 adding citric acid reduced the ph value of ss owing to the complexes formed by citric acid and hms promoted the hms mobility through electro migration and electro osmosis the ph value showed strongly positive correlation with the reducible fraction of zn r 0 88 p 0 05 and cd r 0 89 p 0 05 it can be inferred that high ph value and the high reducible fraction proportion of cd and zn hindered its extraction rate as mentioned in 3 1 1 rcd and rzn demonstrated positive correlation with rcu still the ph did not display any correlations with fractions of cu this was due to the preferable reduction of reducible fraction proportions after ek treatments and acid soluble fraction of cd exhibited significant negative correlation with the ph value r 0 82 p 0 05 this illustrated that the acid soluble extraction would be accelerated by reducing the ph this was contrary to chilian et al 2022 s study where the removal of acid soluble fraction was strengthened by the increase of ph values this was mainly because the response to ph was different by elements the extraction of al fe and cl had better extraction potential under alkaline solutions rather than cd element as the ek process was under a constant voltage electric current variations fig 4b reflect conductivity and ion exchanges tang et al 2018 the initial current reached the maximum value at the beginning of the process then rapidly dropped in the first 24 h and gradually declined until the end of the treatment ek0 was with the lowest current on average compared with other treatments notably the initial current of ek0 was 522 ma which was much higher than the previous study 100 ma tang et al 2017 ek4 had the highest initial current 2059 ma approximately four times higher than ek0 this was mainly because ids is rich in na ions and was initially active in the ek treatment and could rapidly migrate under the electric field high currents accelerated electrophoresis and electroosmosis and allowed hm removal by frequent migration of charged ions chen et al 2021a the initial current of ek3 was high but it dramatically dropped after 24 h and the average current value after 24 h was closed to ek0 therefore adding fecl3 increased the current for a short duration but was unable to improve the current in the subsequent reaction as it may accumulate during the treatment similarly ek1 and ek2 reached around 400 500 ma initially but dropped steadily during the rest of the process the average current value of the ek1 from 24 h to 120 h was the highest in ek treatments and ended at 164 ma which was higher than the maximum value in tang et al 2018 s study this might attribute to the regular refreshment of the electrolyte solutions in this study electrolytes played a key role in maintaining the stability of the current as oh and other substances in the cathode would hinder the ion s migration xu et al 2022 the current value of ek5 increased slightly during 48 60 h this variation indicated a relatively stable process that occurred with the synergistic effect of tea saponin and ss the current indicated significantly positive correlation with acid soluble fraction of ni r 0 883 p 0 05 and negative correlation with oxidizable fraction of ni r 0 842 p 0 05 therefore high current could enhance the unstable fractions of ni into easy extraction state and promote the rni in summary different agents had their unique functions on rhms and fraction transformation as weak organic acid more h ions were released after adding citric acid and its hydroxyl and carboxyl prevented the re adsorption of hms therefore highest rcr rcu and rzn were observed hms tended to be converted into a more stable state with ammonium hydroxide especially pb is more sensitive to the alkaline environment and could be slowly dissolved in ammonium hydroxide the relatively low rhms in ek2 were attributed to the high ph values during the treatment while fe3 in fecl3 converts to fe2 with the ions during the treatment which reduced the ph value by accumulating the h ions a low ph value could encourage the transformation and dissolution of hm fractions therefore the rave of ek3 was relatively high 52 74 ids could form octahedral chelates with many hm ions but its stability was sensitive to the ph values hms showed different responses to the affinity of organic ligand and highest rcd rhg rni and rpb were reached in ek4 the surfactant micelles in tea saponin accelerated the migration and biodegradation of hms and carbonyl groups had strong chelating capability with hms adding tea saponin enhanced reducible fraction conversion to acid soluble states by the competition of hm ions with organic matters in ss 3 2 characterization of ss and ekss 3 2 1 properties of ss and ekss the specific morphology and surface area of ss and ekss were characterized by sem fig s1 and bet table s8 ss had a relatively smooth surface and hardly any pores could be seen ss and ekss were basically in granular form but the particle size of ekss was narrowed compared to ss a few pores could be seen in ekss with random distribution and some irregular particles were attached to the surface this may be due to the ph changes during ek treatment and the removal of metals from ss the bet results showed that the specific surface area of ekss reduced to varying degrees after ek treatment dropping from 42 58 m2 g 1 ss to 8 95 m2 g 1 ekss2 this reduction was consistent with previous study liu et al 2020 and was likely due to the loss of surface charge accordingly the pore size increased in ekss this could point to the adsorption of hms degradation products on the ss surface and the collapse of mesopores to macropores the microscopic morphological changes of ekss varied under different agents but ek treatment failed to show positive changes in the morphology of ss 3 2 2 nutrient analysis of ss and ekss fig 5 showed that there was no excessive nutrient tp tk and tn loss in ekss compared to ss tp content of ekss indicated a slight increase compared to ss which was in agreement with other published research 13 56 20 40 mg g 1 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2017 but lower than that in the activated sludge 32 50 mg g 1 staal et al 2019 and anaerobically digested ss 33 60 mg g 1 huang and tang 2015 and much higher than the wetland biomass tp 7 58 mg g 1 cui et al 2019 wheat straw tp 1 12 mg g 1 xu et al 2016 this increase can mainly be ascribed to the addition of kh2po4 solution in electrolytes which may introduce p to the feedstock by electromigration and electroosmosis process besides the ph value dropped from 6 2 ss to 2 34 ekss3 this was consistent with the opposite relationships between ph gradient and tp contents found by temporetti et al 2019 after ek treatment the ip content increased from 9 54 mg g 1 ss to 13 54 ekss2 and op had partially converted to ip ip usually originated from chemical phosphorus removal and the raw wastewater in ss while op was usually derived from the metabolites and assimilation of microorganisms yu et al 2021 the microbial intracellular phosphorus might react with metal ions in ss under the constant voltage this led to the release of the microbial intracellular phosphorus meanwhile converting polyphosphate pyrophosphate and organic phosphorus into orthophosphate zhang et al 2019 which was the main content of ip moreover the reclamation of ip was relevant to the ph value of ss ekss2 had the highest ph value which resulted in the highest ip content in the agent assisted ek treatments the tendency was consistent with yan et al 2021 s study that higher ph facilitated more ip release ping et al 2020 found that the citrate agent could enhance the release of p by increasing ip and li et al 2020b claimed that fecl3 could fix the dissolved phosphate from apatite phosphorus in ss at the ph of 2 5 which was consistent with ek3 the ph was around 2 5 during 72 120 h therefore tp concentration in ss was well preserved during ek treatment and was easy to utilize subsequently error bars represent standard deviation observed for triplicate experiments during ek process k was extracted from ss together with hms tk content was reduced to 7 63 0 86 mg g 1 ekss2 and 11 15 1 02 mg g 1 ekss4 compared with 13 16 0 35 mg g 1 in ss despite the mobility k ions may not electrodeposit because of the lower reduction potential compared with hms gao et al 2022 also observed the stability of k and na cations and making it difficult to precipitate in the electrolyte during ek treatment the reduction was also attributed to adding alkaline substances in ek which accelerated the formation of nh 4 and reduced the k content notably the tk content of ekss was higher than that in most of the biomass for example it was 5 times higher than that in sawdust 2 09 mg g 1 wang et al 2016 and slightly higher than that in biogas residues 8 46 mg g 1 maize silage 7 31 mg g 1 wu et al 2021b and the pig manure 11 80 mg g 1 wang et al 2016 besides tn concentration in ss was around 5 and with minor fluctuations after ek treatment in summary the ekss was rich in nutrient elements with a slight reduction of tk and tn content compared to ss and no p was lost during ek treatment the mass fraction of total nutrient tn tk tp ranged from 54 46 to 60 48 which reached the national standard index 5 of organic fertilizer ny525 2012 3 3 energy consumption and metal recycling assessment as shown in fig 6 a e gradually increased as time elapsed the greater e4 and e1 were consistent with their higher current the trends were in agreement with previous research ryu et al 2011 showing that the energy consumption had a positive correlation with current under the constant voltage gradient e0 was only half of e4 and e1 because the electric conductivity of deionized water was relatively low thus adding agents improved electric conductivity of ss solution liu et al 2017 moreover adding agents accelerated the electromigration of metal ions by strengthening desorption of metal ions e0 was similar to that reported by song et al 2016 but e0 e5 was lower than that of cherifi et al 2016 this was attributed to the fact that the required e was directly related to the processing time and ss composition to evaluate energy efficacy eu was proposed to calculate the specific energy consumption per hm removal lower value of eu indicated higher energy efficacy the highest rave 59 23 and lowest eu 1 09 kwh were obtained in ek1 this was consistent that the lowest eu of ni cu and cd was achieved in ek1 relatively low energy consumption of 445 34 wh g 1 was obtained in previous citric acid intervening ek study wu et al 2021a with rcr of 21 62 this might be due to the voltage gradient 1 v cm 1 was lower than this study 1 6 v cm 1 the lowest eu of zn was obtained in ek3 because the lowest ph value in ek3 strengthened the extraction of zn besides the lowest eu of hg was obtained in ek0 because ek0 showed relatively high rhg and the inconspicuous increase of rhg in the agent assisted ek treatment compared to ek0 this optimal eu 1 09 1 77 kwh with a high rhms was more than an order of magnitude lower than that in glda assisted ek treatment chen et al 2021a 10 01 kwh therefore citric acid in ek1 could improve the rhms with low energy consumption with electrophoresis and electroosmosis sediments were accumulated as the hms transformed from ss to the cathode chamber to access the recycling potential of the elements sediments from the cathode were characterized by xrf table s9 and xrd fig s2 sediments mainly contained metal elements of ca k mg fe mn a trace amount of si al a large amount of p and s cl with limited amounts compared with ss the proportion of p 54 83 and k 19 67 was higher in the sediments this was mainly due to the utilization of the buffering solution of kh2po4 ca content increased from 8 81 ss to 27 52 ek2 and mg rose from 1 93 ss to 23 07 ek5 indicating that a large amount of ca2 and mg2 has migrated from ss to the cathode chamber thus recycling ca mg k p from sediments is attemptable other nutrient elements such as n and na were saved in ekss which consisted of results in 3 2 2 cr only existed in the sediments of ek1 and ek4 which indicated the two ek treatments had rcr and most hms were imperceptible as the relatively low proportion in ss xrd results showed that no secondary toxic product was generated in sediments the presence of k2co3 p2o5 cahpo4 h2o 2 and zno in sediments were invisible in ss which was consistent with the xrf result that the high contents of ca2 and k in the sediments compared with ss 3 4 risk economic assessment and application analysis igeo fig 7 was mainly used to estimate the contamination risk of ss and ekss for each hms independently igeo value of ss for metals has decreased by 0 28 2 40 after ek treatment compared to ss the igeo values of ekss1 ekss2 ekss4 and ekss5 for pb were 0 which indicated their uncontaminated potential ss was identified as heavily contaminated levels for cu cd and zn and fell in the moderately heavily polluted range with few exceptions the risk level of ekss1 ekss2 and ekss5 for cr reduced to a moderately contaminated level ss had a moderately contaminated level for ni and adjusted to unpolluted moderately polluted level in ekss chen et al 2021a noted that ss after ek treatment decreased to free of pollution levels for cu zn ni and pb however the rave of zn and ni in this study was higher than that in chen et al 2021a s research and similar rcu was observed the reason for the difference in igeo values was the relatively low hm contents in the background soil of tibet the igeo values in ss for hg were higher than 6 which had an extremely contaminated class the values reduced to 3 70 4 36 after agent assisted ek treatments hg concentration in ekss0 ekss5 was lower than the national risk control standards but the igeo value indicated ss had a heavily or heavily to extremely contaminated level this may be due to the low content in the background and the strict limitations attributed to health and agricultural considerations the contamination level of treated ss for hg was also reported as extremely polluted in chen et al 2021a s study as rhg was up to 70 08 81 11 in ek treatments some more targeted treatment for example coupling with post pyrolysis is suggested to further reduce the risk of hg before direct utilization in agricultural fields error bars represent standard deviation observed for triplicate experiments smaller than symbol if not shown the economic analysis indicated that 89 48 t 1 was needed for disposing of ss by ek0 table s11 which is in agreement with zeng et al 2021 who estimated the costs of the ek process to be 100 t 1 the cost of ek1 ek5 increased to 117 69 150 20 t 1 due to the addition of agents ek3 was the most economical one because of the low e and low price of fecl3 the treatment cost was cheaper than the landfilling cost of ss 165 245 t 1 zeng et al 2021 but a more competitive cost 40 50 m 2 liu et al 2018 was found for disposing of sediment and soil remediation by ek treatment thus further investigation on parameters affecting costs is needed to improve economic feasibility agent assisted ek treatment showed high potential for field application according to igeo the hms pollution risks have decreased by 0 28 2 40 after ek treatment from the perspective of rhms hg ni and pb met the risk control standard and the rest hm concentrations have been greatly reduced compared to ss meanwhile no excessive nutrient loss was observed in ekss compared to ss however the economic feasibility and the low ion migration speed in ss may limit the field application of ek xu et al 2019 further optimization of the ek system could enhance its scalability 4 conclusions this work highlighted that ek treatment does not result in excessive nutrient loss n p and k which for the first time provided insights on further utilization potential of the ekss non toxic and biodegradable agents including citric acid ids and fecl3 showed promise as chelating agents for enhancing rhms this significantly improved rave by 26 76 33 25 and reduced pollution risk igeo by 0 84 2 40 the rpb 70 reached in this work exceeded the average rpb of 50 in the references most hms in ekss showed a lower potential to be absorbed by plants or be leached into water systems the effectiveness and mechanism of adding representative types of agents in ek treatment were clarified this work provides evidence that agent assisted ek treatment can be an environmentally friendly modification method for hm removal from ss while retaining its nutrient content making it a suitable amendment for use in agriculture in line with circular economy objectives future investigation is warranted to determine the effects of agent assisted ek treatment on nutrient speciation transformation in ss and its further utilization further optimization of the ek system is needed to enhance its scalability and reduce costs credit authorship contribution statement xutong wang

15517,in shallow lakes eutrophication leads to a shift of the macrophyte dominated clear state towards an algae dominated turbid state phosphorus p is a crucial element during this shift and is usually concentrated in the suspended particulate matter spm in water however the dominant processes controlling internal p release in the algae ada and macrophyte dominated mda areas under the influence of p concentrated spm remains unclear in this study we conducted monthly field observations of p exchange across the sediment water interface swi with the deposition of spm in the ada and mda of lake taihu results revealed that both algae and macrophyte originated spm led to the depletion of oxygen across the swi during summer and autumn redox sensitive p fe p and organic p org p were the dominant mobile p fractions in both areas high fluxes of p across the swi were observed in both areas during the summer and autumn however the processes controlling p release were quite different in mda p release was mostly controlled by a traditional fe p dissolution process influenced by the coupled cycling of iron sulfur and p in the ada org p control was intensified with the deterioration of algal bloom status accompanied with the dissolution of fe p evidence from the current study revealed that the dominant process controlling the internal p release might gradually shift from fe p to a coupled process of fe p and org p with the shift of the macrophyte to an algae dominated state in shallow eutrophic lakes the differentiated processes in the mda and ada should be given more attention during future research and management of internal p loadings in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords suspended particulate matter internal phosphorus loading macrophyte dominated area algae dominated area sediment water interface lake taihu 1 introduction harmful algal blooms and loss of aquatic vegetation are typical ecological disasters faced by numerous lakes worldwide ho et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the increased algal blooms and decrease of macrophytes result in the shift of a clear state dominated by macrophytes to a turbid state dominated by algae which is considered a key process in the evolution of eutrophic shallow lakes scheffer and van nes 2007 several factors facilitate such alternative regimes including climate nutrients water depth and lake size coops et al 2003 scheffer and van nes 2007 among these nutrients have attracted widespread attention owing to their limited availability and assimilation to algae and macrophytes andersen et al 2020 nitrogen n and phosphorus p are major concerns subject to debate for decades with some researchers describing algal growth as limited by both conley et al 2009 cotner 2017 others believe that p or the n p ratio is more important than n qin et al 2020 schindler et al 2016 regardless p is established as a crucial element in this context owing to its sedimentation characteristics p is usually concentrated in suspended particulate matter spm and sediments ji et al 2022 liu et al 2019a concentrated p is deposited in the sediment through the deposition of spm then mobilized and released to the overlying water again through diffusion resuspension and other diagenetic processes taguchi et al 2020 persistent internal p release might increase p concentrations and promote algal blooms even after the reduction of external loads nürnberg et al 2012 during these sedimentation dissolution and release processes the composition and transformation of p fractions are essential sedimentary p is commonly divided into loosely adsorbed p ex p redox sensitive p fe p aluminum bound p al p organic p org p apatite other inorganic p ca p and residual p res p lukkari et al 2007 among these fractions ex p fe p and org p are considered more mobile rydin 2000 the dissolution of these forms of p has been widely accepted to control p release across the sediment water interface swi previous studies revealed that most of the p in water is present in particulate form shinohara et al 2016 especially in some eutrophic areas where the particulate p par p ratio can reach 90 or higher zhu et al 2020 the p concentrated spm in the algae dominated area ada was rich in both fe p and org p liu et al 2019a yang et al 2020 in the macrophyte dominated area mda a large portion of the p pool was discovered to be in the spm originated from calcite crusts on macrophytes sand jensen et al 2021 wang et al 2022 such p concentrated spm aggravates p release from the sediment in both areas liu et al 2019a zhao et al 2019 the differential distribution of p fractions in spm and the sediment increased the complexity of p exchange across the swi in the two areas the dissolution of fe p under anoxic conditions has been widely accepted as a typical means for internal p release hupfer and lewandowski 2008 however greater dissolution of fe p under aerobic conditions was discovered in mda than in ada kisand and nõges 2003 in addition a series of recent studies have revealed that org p is another key factor that controls the release of p especially in eutrophic shallow lakes with serious algal blooms alam et al 2020 song et al 2018 therefore there may be different processes that control p release in these two areas as an essential element for eutrophication and algal blooms p release in both the ada and mda influences the cycle of p throughout the whole lake however information on the differences of dominant processes for p release between these two areas remains limited further whether a shift in the dominant processes controlling p release also occurs during the two states remains unclear in the current study monthly field observations of the deposited spm and p exchanges across the swi in both the ada and mda were carried out in lake taihu the influence of p exchange by deposited spm originating from the two areas was studied we sought to reveal the distinct and dominant processes for internal p release in the ada and mda of eutrophic lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and field sampling of the water sediment and spm lake taihu is a typical large shallow eutrophic lake with an area of 2338 km2 and a mean depth of 2 m an increase in algal blooms and loss of macrophytes has affected the lake for decades the maximum algal bloom coverage was reported at 1208 km2 duan et

p zhu et al 2020 field observations were carried out monthly from may 2018 to april 2019 for both the ada t1 and mda t2 and t3 the bloomed algae in the ada were mostly cyanobacteria microcystis spp qin et al 2019 the dominant macrophytes in the mda were potamogetom crispus in spring and potamogeton malaianus vallisneria natans hydrilla verticillata potamogeton pectinatus trapa bispinosa and myriophyllum spicatum in summer according to our field observation and other studies zhang et al 2022 during each sampling period three sediment cores were collected from each site using a gravity corer 90 mm diameter 500 mm length rigo co ltd japan approximately 1 l of lake water from each site was simultaneously sampled all the sediment columns and water samples were preserved at 4 c transported to the laboratory within 3 h and then analyzed immediately in parallel to the sampling of water and sediment columns deposited spm at each site was also collected using self designed sediment traps each trap had 16 channels of plexiglass tubes 90 mm diameter 500 mm length on each sampling period two sets of traps were deployed at each sites in fig 1 details of the spm collection are described in the supplementary material spm from the same site was homogenized preserved at 4 c and immediately transported to the laboratory for analysis for each site the sedimentation rate of spm was calculated by freeze drying the fresh spm in three tubes to a constant weight under vacuum conditions 2 2 profile analysis and calculation immediately after the sediment columns were transported to the laboratory the vertical profiles of oxygen o2 across the swi were analyzed using a micro profiling system unisense aarhus denmark thereafter the pore water profiles of soluble reactive p srp and ferrous iron fe ii were obtained using a series of mini peepers fig s1 after obtaining the profile characteristics the o2 uptake rate was calculated based on fick s second law assuming zero order kinetics rasmussen and jorgensen 1992 the diffusive fluxes of srp and fe ii across the swi were calculated using fick s first law of diffusion ullman and aller 1982 the details of profile analysis and calculation are provided in the supplementary material 2 3 chemical analysis the total suspended solids tp total dissolved p srp par p organic p org p and chlorophyll a chla

analyses are described in the supplementary material 2 4 statistical analysis pearson s or spearman s correlations between various characteristics in the sediment and spm were analyzed the differences

3 1 monthly water quality variations in the algae and macrophyte dominated areas water tp srp par p and org p concentrations in the ada were generally higher than those in the mda throughout most of the study period fig s2 tp concentrations in t1 reached a peak of 0 70 mg l 1 in august accompanied by high srp 0 18 mg l 1 par p 0 52 mg l 1 total dissolved p 0 19 mg l 1 chla 228 1 μg l 1 and total suspended solids 84 0 mg l 1 concentrations two small peaks in tp concentrations in t2 and t3 occurred in june 0 09 mg l 1 and february 0 09 mg l 1 respectively the dominant p fraction in the water of both areas was par p with the highest ratios of 86 and 94 for ada and mda respectively while the par p concentrations in the ada were much higher than those in the mda especially during summer for the ada par p and other fractions of p in the water were considerably higher in summer as was chla concentration significantly positive correlation pearson s r 0 935 p 0 01 was discovered between the par p and chla in water for the mda no significant correlations were discovered between the par p and chla 3 2 properties of the deposited spm 3 2 1 development of sedimentation rate of the spm the sedimentation rate in ada was much higher than that in mda throughout the investigation fig s3 a p 0 01 anova the highest sedimentation rate of 978 8 g dw m 2 d 1 for t1 was observed in september close to that in august after april the sedimentation rate of t1 increased dramatically and was significantly positively correlated with chla in water pearson s r 0 580 p 0 01 the trends of sedimentation rate were quite similar between t2 and t3 p 0 122 paired t test with two increase periods in spring and early winter when the withering of potamogetom crispus and other submerged macrophytes occurred respectively these trends indicated that the sedimentation rate in t1 might be related to the algal bloom whereas that in t2 and t3 might be related to macrophyte withering 3 2 2

correlated with chla yet not significantly fig s4 b the bloomed algae at t1 might have had a significant influence on toc content in the spm while the toc of t2 and t3 might be influenced by macrophyte 3 2 3 phosphorus fractions in the spm generally tp concentrations in the spm of t1 were higher than those of t2 and t3 fig 2 p 0 01 anova the ex p concentrations of t1 were higher than those of t2 and t3 at most times throughout the year ex p was much lower than the other p fractions for all sites fe p and org p were the dominant mobile p fractions the fe p concentrations of t1 were close to those of t2 and t3 whereas the org p of t1 increased dramatically after may and peaked in august at 489 2 mg kg 1 the trend was consistent with chla increase during this period fig s2 in the other months the org p of t1 was similar to that of t2 and t3 al p and ca p were also the dominant fractions of inorganic p in spm the ratios of ca p to tp for t2 and t3 were higher than those of t1 3

those of t2 and t3 particularly in autumn and winter fig s5 the fe and al concentration of t1 were relatively stable while decreased obviously for t2 and t3 from summer to winter the ca concentration

significantly lower than that of t2 and t3 p 0 01 anova similar to that of spm fig s6 the toc in the surficial 2 cm sediment of t1 experienced a slight increase in july and august which might have been caused by the significant increase in toc in the spm during this period section 3 2 2 there was no obvious increase in the toc of t2 and t3 surficial sediments the influence of the deposited spm on sediment toc concentration in ada was more obvious than for mda during the serious algal bloom season 3 3 2 phosphorus fractions in the sediment columns the tp concentration in the sediment of t1

quite low compared to the other fractions a significant increase in org p in t1 was observed from may to october especially in the surficial 2 cm of the sediment with the highest value of 150 8 mg kg

concentrations of t1 increased from december to march and were similar to those in the spm section 3 2 4 similar to concentrations in the spm ca in the sediment of t1 remained stable and lower than in t2 and t3 p 0 016 anova a trend of increase in ca concentrations was observed for both t2 and t3 from october to january potentially caused by high levels of ca in the spm during this period fig s5 3

and mda fig s8 acid volatile sulfide and cr ii reducible sulfur concentrations in the sediments of t2 and t3 increased from may to september and were significantly higher than those in t1 generally the reduced sulfur concentrations in the mda were higher than those in the ada during summer and autumn probably caused by the high toc section 3 3 1 induced sulfate reduction rates in the area kim et al 2017 3 4 profile characteristics and fluxes across the swi 3 4 1 o2 profiles and uptake rates across the swi the o2 profiles showed significantly differences between different sites and sampling periods p 0 01 anova fig s9 from may to august the oxic sediment zone of t1 narrowed gradually fig s9 with the o2 penetration depth opd decreasing from 3 0 mm to 0 fig 4 an extreme anoxic condition of the swi was observed in august when o2 in the bottom water decreased to 0 significantly negative correlations were discovered between the chla in water and opd pearson s r 0 346 p 0 039 the opd remained lower than 2 mm until december from december to april the opd of t1 gradually increased to approximately 7 mm fig 4 o2 concentrations across the swi for t2 and t3 were also low from may to august fig s9 however the opd of both t2 and t3 p 0 231 paired t test exhibited a slow increase from may 2018 to march 2019 the lowest opd for t2 and t3 were observed from april to may notably negative o2 uptake rate values for t2 and t3 were detected from june to september especially in august fig 4 when the highest biomass of submerged macrophytes was recorded fig 1 3 4 2 pore water profiles of srp and fe ii across the swi the pore water srp concentrations were generally higher from may to october with those of t1 being higher than for t2 and t3 p 0 01 anova fig 5 after november the srp concentrations at all three sites decreased sharply especially for t1 this decrease in srp at t1 occurred slightly earlier than that at t2 and t3 resulting in lower srp concentrations in the former site from november to april the vertical distributions of srp remained relatively constant from the overlying water to the deeper sediment for all three sites under the low winter temperatures from december to march the fe ii concentrations of t1 were relatively higher from may to october fig 6 and were slightly higher than those of srp during the same period which did not allow for fe and p co precipitation in the oxic sediment zone lehtoranta et al 2009 from november to april the fe ii concentrations of t1 decreased sharply to under 0 5 mg l 1 or even close to 0 the concentrations of fe ii for t2 and t3 were remarkably higher than those for t1 p 0 01 anova which could be noticed during most of the year in particular significant increases in fe ii for t2 and t3 were observed after september when the temperature began to decline and the fe ii of t1 began to decrease even in winter december to february the fe ii concentrations of t2 and t3 were significantly higher than those of t1 and the corresponding srp concentrations p 0 01 anova 3 4 3 fluxes of srp and fe ii across the swi the srp fluxes of t1 remained stable between 1 50 and 2 23 mg m 2 d 1 from may to august which were already within the range of high p fluxes in many eutrophic lakes gibbons and bridgeman 2020 nürnberg et al 2012 the highest srp fluxes of t1 reached 16 79 mg m 2 d 1 in september and then decreased quickly the srp fluxes of t2 and t3 however increased gradually after may and peaked in july and august with fluxes of 14 90 and 13 57 mg m 2 d 1 respectively similarly the p fluxes of all three sites decreased sharply after november and remained low until the following april the fe ii fluxes of t1 increased gradually after may and peaked in july at 158 77 mg m 2 d 1 decreasing gradually thereafter down to below 0 2 mg m 2 d 1 after november the highest values of t2 and t3 reached 1097 24 and 423 46 mg m 2 d 1 in october and july respectively these values were considerably higher than for t1 and the srp fluxes at these two sites further analysis revealed significant positive relationships between fe ii and srp fluxes in t2 and t3 both p 0 01 but not in t1 fig 7 the simultaneous release of fe ii and srp in t2 and t3 was more evident than in t1 4 discussion 4 1 deposition of algae and macrophyte originated spm induced differential environmental changes across the swi previous studies have shown that the decomposition of algae and macrophytes could lead to o2 depletion as well as the release of p and other elements liu et al 2015 shen et al 2014 the deposition and decomposition of algae and macrophyte derived spm may play vital roles during these processes however the time periods of spm deposition were significantly different the deposition of algae originated spm was mostly observed from late spring to autumn with high sedimentation rates section 3 2 1 especially in the summer when lake taihu faced the most severe algal bloom qin et al 2019 the algae derived spm resulted in high concentrations of toc in the spm and the surficial sediment sections 3 2 2 and 3 3 1 as well as high levels of protein like organic matter liu et al 2019a consequently a rapid decomposition process occurs after spm deposition especially during summer and autumn with high temperatures derrien et al 2019 diaz and rosenberg 2008 our previous study in lake taihu revealed that the decomposition of algae originated spm generally took place within 5 days and o2 was depleted within 2 days liu et al 2019b 2015 in the current study o2 across the swi in the ada decreased to 0 from may to august and remained at low levels until the end of autumn section 3 4 1 the decomposition of algae originated spm led to low o2 low opd and a high consumption of o2 across the swi as shown in section 3 2 1 the deposition of spm in the mda was influenced by the two withering periods of different macrophytes the withering of potamogetom crispus resulted in a short period of o2 depletion in late spring which has also been observed in previous studies shen et al 2014 while in summer although high toc in the spm and sediment of t2 and t3 sections 3 2 2 and 3 3 1 might have led to the intense mineralization and consumption of o2 at high temperatures derrien et al 2019 li et al 2018 the depletion of o2 across the swi was not as drastic as that of t1 the radial o2 losses effect usually increases the depth of the oxic sediment zone around the rhizosphere han et al 2018 koop jakobsen et al 2017 thus increased opd from may to september and negative o2 uptake rates were observed in the mda under high macrophyte coverage section 3 4 1 comparing ada and mda algae originated spm led to the sharp depletion of o2 across the swi during summer and autumn while macrophyte originated spm mostly led to o2 depletion in late spring these environmental changes may further influence p exchange across the swi hupfer and lewandowski 2008 søndergaard et al 2003 4 2 deposited spm led to discrepant p sedimentation processes in the ada and mda as revealed in sections 3 2 3 and 3 3 2 ca p fe p and al p were the dominant inorganic p fractions in the spm and sediment the dominant status of ca p in the mda was more evident than that in the ada during the fast growth season large quantities of calcite crusts can frequently form on the leaves and stems of submerged macrophytes during daytime photosynthesis blindow 1992 dong et al 2014 kisand and nõges 2003 pełechaty et al 2013 sand jensen et al 2021 the co precipitation of ca and p through calcite crusts resulted in higher ratios of ca p in the mda than in the ada dierberg et al 2002 wang et al 2022 unlike ca distribution the fe and al concentrations in the spm and sediment in the ada were generally higher than those in the mda resulting in high concentrations of fe p and al p section 3 3 2 among these two fractions al p was considered more stable than fe p by many researchers rönicke et al 2021 rydin 2000 aluminum treatment was also considered more efficient over longer time series in many lakes rönicke et al 2021 yin et al 2018 therefore high concentrations of redox sensitive fe p may be more important for internal p release gu et al 2019 hupfer and lewandowski 2008 an increased fe p ratio is usually considered to increase stability of the p pool in the sediment jensen et al 1992 with regard to fe p t2 and t3 were quite close in both spm p 0 126 paired t test and the sediment p 0 427 paired t test being generally higher than t1 values at most times of the year especially in summer fig s10 a and b the fe p ratio of the sediment was significantly positively correlated with that of spm pearson s r 0 564 p 0 01 fig s10 c demonstrating the direct influence of spm on the sedimentation of fe and p in surficial sediments from may to august fe p in both areas decreased sharply accompanied by a decrease in fe p the obvious decrease in fe p at all three sites indicated a potential influence of fe p on the internal p cycle in both areas which has already been described as the dominant process for internal p release in many lakes alam et al 2020 tammeorg et al 2020 as per section 3 1 the dominant p fraction in the water of both areas was par p whereas the sources of these p concentrated spm were different for the ada the bloomed algae were the most likely sources of par p in the water and the spm sections 3 1 and 3 2 1 an increase in mobile p in the spm was also observed with the increase of par p in summer section 3 2 3 the increase in org p in spm was greater than those of ex p and fe p our previous field observations in the ada of lake taihu also revealed that org p was the dominant fraction of p in the algae originated spm kong et al 2020 a similar distribution of org p in spm was also discovered in the ada of lake chaohu liu et al 2019a yang et al 2020 the increased org p content in the spm gave rise to org p in the surficial sediment in summer section 3 3 2 which has also been considered a key factor influencing p release in many eutrophic areas amirbahman et al 2013 markovic et al 2019 for mda there was no obvious increase of org p in the spm and the surficial sediment during summer therefore the discrepant origins and elemental compositions of spm led to differential p sedimentation processes in the ada and mda which would further influence the internal p cycle in these two areas 4 3 differences of dominant processes for p dissolution and exchange across the swi in the ada and mda differential p sedimentation processes caused by deposited spm in the ada and mda resulted in differential distributions of mobile p in the sediment section 3 3 2 for both the areas fe p and org p were the dominant mobile p fractions for ada the anoxic conditions in summer section 3 4 1 induced the dissolution of fe p hupfer and lewandowski 2008 in parallel the concentrations of srp and fe ii in pore water increased significantly section 3 4 2 fe p concentration in the sediment was also negatively correlated with temperature and chla fig s4 therefore fe p dissolution is believed to occur during the severe algal bloom season at high temperatures which is consistent with previous studies gibbons and bridgeman 2020 hupfer and lewandowski 2008 in addition the mineralization of organic matter would also lead to org p dissolution this process is further enhanced by iron reduction markovic et al 2019 during the algal bloom season a significant increase in the org p difference between spm and the surficial sediment was observed fig s11 the org p difference was significantly higher than the fe p difference during this period in addition the pore water fe ii concentrations in t1 were close to or slightly higher than those of srp section 3 4 2 which did not allow for fe and p co precipitation in the oxic sediment zone lehtoranta et al 2009 these phenomena indicate that a large part of the deposited org p might have been mineralized and released in the ada the subsequent decrease in org p and the low opd after september indicated further mineralization of org p in autumn markovic et al 2019 for the mda org p in the surficial sediment and spm was significantly lower than in the ada during summer and autumn sections 3 2 3 and 3 3 2 moreover the org p difference for t2 and t3 was significantly lower than that of t1 p 0 01 paired t test and the fe p difference during this period p 0 05 paired t test fig s11 the fe p differences of t2 and t3 exhibited a general increase from may to september being mostly higher than that of t1 during summer and autumn the pore water profiles also showed that fe ii concentrations in t2 and t3 were several times the corresponding srp concentrations from may to december section 3 4 2 therefore the dissolution of fe p in mda was more obvious than that in ada as discussed in the current section and section 4 2 fe p dissolution during summer and autumn was observed in both areas however large differences were noted as fe p dissolution in the mda was considerably greater than that of other p fractions the significant positive relationship between srp and fe ii fluxes p 0 01 also indicated the simultaneous release of p and fe ii section 3 4 3 while for the ada no significant relationship was discovered between the fluxes of srp and fe ii section 3 4 3 the simultaneous dissolution of fe p and org p during the algal bloom season would both influence the release of p consequently different dominant processes for p release in ada and mda were deduced fig 8 p release in the mda is generally controlled by a traditional fe p dissolution process influenced by the coupled cycling of iron sulfur and p across the swi which has already been described in numerous previous studies lehtoranta et al 2009 rozan et al 2002 the high concentrations of reduced sulfur in the mda section 3 3 4 might facilitate the formation of iron sulfides sequentially restraining the co precipitation of fe and p in the oxic sediment layer and enhancing the release of p after fe p dissolution lehtoranta et al 2009 therefore the srp fluxes of t2 and t3 were mostly higher than those of t1 during the summer and autumn fig 7 in addition there are still some other factors that might result in the higher p fluxes in the mda including the decaying of macrophyte debris in the sediment shen et al 2014 the lower concentrations of p in the overlying water of the mda or the artefact caused by the calculation of fluxes using fick s first law of diffusion ullman and aller 1982 these factors influencing the internal p release in the mda still require further study with the development of eutrophication and algal blooms the traditional fe p controlled process was shifted to a coupled process controlled by both fe p and org p in the ada moreover the control of org p might gradually intensify with the deterioration of algal bloom status a widely accepted phenomenon for the evolution of eutrophic shallow lakes scheffer and van nes 2007 the shift between the macrophyte and algae dominated status might also shift the dominant processes for internal p release controlled by fe p and org p in addition due to the high ca p co precipitation by the crust on macrophytes section 4 2 the sedimentation and dissolution of ca p might also play an important role in internal p cycling in the mda dierberg et al 2002 kisand and nõges 2003 wang et al 2022 however the ca p in the sediment was mostly higher than in the spm sedimentation might still be the prevailing process for ca p the dissolution of ca p in the mda or other similar areas with high ratio of ca p requires further investigation 5 conclusions a yearlong field investigation in the ada and mda of lake taihu revealed that both algae and macrophyte originated spm led to the depletion of o2 across the swi during summer and autumn the different characteristics of deposited spm resulted in differential p sedimentation and release processes in the two areas a traditional fe p dissolution process influenced by the coupled cycling of iron sulfur and p was observed in the mda with the development of eutrophication and algal blooms the control of org p might be intensified and a coupled process controlled by both org p and fe p was discovered in the ada therefore we further deduced that the dominant process for internal p release might gradually shift from fe p to a coupled process of fe p and org p with the shift of macrophytes to algae in eutrophic shallow lakes similar processes might occur in shallow freshwater lakes with the deterioration of eutrophic statuses authors contributions cheng liu designed the research wrote the paper and performed the experiment yiheng du performed

15517,in shallow lakes eutrophication leads to a shift of the macrophyte dominated clear state towards an algae dominated turbid state phosphorus p is a crucial element during this shift and is usually concentrated in the suspended particulate matter spm in water however the dominant processes controlling internal p release in the algae ada and macrophyte dominated mda areas under the influence of p concentrated spm remains unclear in this study we conducted monthly field observations of p exchange across the sediment water interface swi with the deposition of spm in the ada and mda of lake taihu results revealed that both algae and macrophyte originated spm led to the depletion of oxygen across the swi during summer and autumn redox sensitive p fe p and organic p org p were the dominant mobile p fractions in both areas high fluxes of p across the swi were observed in both areas during the summer and autumn however the processes controlling p release were quite different in mda p release was mostly controlled by a traditional fe p dissolution process influenced by the coupled cycling of iron sulfur and p in the ada org p control was intensified with the deterioration of algal bloom status accompanied with the dissolution of fe p evidence from the current study revealed that the dominant process controlling the internal p release might gradually shift from fe p to a coupled process of fe p and org p with the shift of the macrophyte to an algae dominated state in shallow eutrophic lakes the differentiated processes in the mda and ada should be given more attention during future research and management of internal p loadings in eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords suspended particulate matter internal phosphorus loading macrophyte dominated area algae dominated area sediment water interface lake taihu 1 introduction harmful algal blooms and loss of aquatic vegetation are typical ecological disasters faced by numerous lakes worldwide ho et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 the increased algal blooms and decrease of macrophytes result in the shift of a clear state dominated by macrophytes to a turbid state dominated by algae which is considered a key process in the evolution of eutrophic shallow lakes scheffer and van nes 2007 several factors facilitate such alternative regimes including climate nutrients water depth and lake size coops et al 2003 scheffer and van nes 2007 among these nutrients have attracted widespread attention owing to their limited availability and assimilation to algae and macrophytes andersen et al 2020 nitrogen n and phosphorus p are major concerns subject to debate for decades with some researchers describing algal growth as limited by both conley et al 2009 cotner 2017 others believe that p or the n p ratio is more important than n qin et al 2020 schindler et al 2016 regardless p is established as a crucial element in this context owing to its sedimentation characteristics p is usually concentrated in suspended particulate matter spm and sediments ji et al 2022 liu et al 2019a concentrated p is deposited in the sediment through the deposition of spm then mobilized and released to the overlying water again through diffusion resuspension and other diagenetic processes taguchi et al 2020 persistent internal p release might increase p concentrations and promote algal blooms even after the reduction of external loads nürnberg et al 2012 during these sedimentation dissolution and release processes the composition and transformation of p fractions are essential sedimentary p is commonly divided into loosely adsorbed p ex p redox sensitive p fe p aluminum bound p al p organic p org p apatite other inorganic p ca p and residual p res p lukkari et al 2007 among these fractions ex p fe p and org p are considered more mobile rydin 2000 the dissolution of these forms of p has been widely accepted to control p release across the sediment water interface swi previous studies revealed that most of the p in water is present in particulate form shinohara et al 2016 especially in some eutrophic areas where the particulate p par p ratio can reach 90 or higher zhu et al 2020 the p concentrated spm in the algae dominated area ada was rich in both fe p and org p liu et al 2019a yang et al 2020 in the macrophyte dominated area mda a large portion of the p pool was discovered to be in the spm originated from calcite crusts on macrophytes sand jensen et al 2021 wang et al 2022 such p concentrated spm aggravates p release from the sediment in both areas liu et al 2019a zhao et al 2019 the differential distribution of p fractions in spm and the sediment increased the complexity of p exchange across the swi in the two areas the dissolution of fe p under anoxic conditions has been widely accepted as a typical means for internal p release hupfer and lewandowski 2008 however greater dissolution of fe p under aerobic conditions was discovered in mda than in ada kisand and nõges 2003 in addition a series of recent studies have revealed that org p is another key factor that controls the release of p especially in eutrophic shallow lakes with serious algal blooms alam et al 2020 song et al 2018 therefore there may be different processes that control p release in these two areas as an essential element for eutrophication and algal blooms p release in both the ada and mda influences the cycle of p throughout the whole lake however information on the differences of dominant processes for p release between these two areas remains limited further whether a shift in the dominant processes controlling p release also occurs during the two states remains unclear in the current study monthly field observations of the deposited spm and p exchanges across the swi in both the ada and mda were carried out in lake taihu the influence of p exchange by deposited spm originating from the two areas was studied we sought to reveal the distinct and dominant processes for internal p release in the ada and mda of eutrophic lakes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and field sampling of the water sediment and spm lake taihu is a typical large shallow eutrophic lake

qin et al 2019 the dominant macrophytes in the mda were potamogetom crispus in spring and potamogeton malaianus vallisneria natans hydrilla verticillata potamogeton pectinatus trapa bispinosa and myriophyllum spicatum in summer according to our field observation and other studies zhang et al 2022 during each sampling period three sediment cores were collected from each site using a gravity corer 90 mm diameter 500 mm length rigo co ltd japan approximately 1 l of lake water from each site was simultaneously sampled all the sediment columns and water samples were preserved at 4 c transported to the laboratory within 3 h and then analyzed immediately in parallel to the sampling of water and sediment columns deposited spm at each site was also collected using self designed sediment traps each trap had 16 channels of plexiglass tubes 90 mm diameter 500 mm length on each sampling period two sets of traps were deployed at each sites in fig 1 details of the spm collection

spm was calculated by freeze drying the fresh spm in three tubes to a constant weight under vacuum conditions 2 2 profile analysis and calculation immediately after the sediment columns were transported to the laboratory the vertical profiles of oxygen o2 across the swi were analyzed using a micro profiling system unisense aarhus denmark thereafter the pore water profiles of soluble

sedimentation rate were quite similar between t2 and t3 p 0 122 paired t test with two increase periods in spring and early winter when the withering of potamogetom crispus and other submerged

correlated with chla yet not significantly fig s4 b the bloomed algae at t1 might have had a significant influence on toc content in the spm while the toc of t2 and t3 might be influenced by macrophyte 3 2 3 phosphorus fractions in the spm generally tp concentrations in the spm of t1 were higher than those of t2 and t3 fig 2 p 0 01 anova the ex p concentrations of t1 were higher than those of t2 and t3 at most times throughout the year ex p was much lower than the other p fractions for all sites fe p and org p were the dominant mobile p fractions the fe p concentrations of t1 were close to those of t2 and t3 whereas the org p of t1 increased dramatically after may and peaked in august at 489 2 mg kg 1 the trend was consistent with chla increase during this period fig s2 in the other months the org p of t1 was similar to that of t2 and t3 al p and ca p were also the dominant fractions of inorganic p in spm the ratios of ca p to tp for t2 and t3 were higher than those of t1 3

those of t2 and t3 particularly in autumn and winter fig s5 the fe and al concentration of t1 were relatively stable while decreased obviously for t2 and t3 from summer to winter the ca concentration of t1 was also quite stable throughout and obviously lower than for t2 and t3 p 0 01 anova fig s5 3 3 properties of the sediment columns 3 3 1 vertical distributions of toc in the sediment columns toc concentrations in the sediment columns of all three sites were lower than those in the spm of corresponding sites section 3 2 2 especially t2 and t3 the toc concentration in the sediment of t1 was significantly lower than that of t2 and t3 p 0 01 anova similar to that of spm fig s6 the toc in the surficial 2 cm sediment of t1 experienced a slight increase in july and august which might have been caused by the significant increase in toc in the spm during this period section 3 2 2 there was no obvious increase in the toc of t2 and t3 surficial sediments the influence of the deposited spm on sediment toc concentration in ada was more obvious than for mda during the serious algal bloom season 3 3 2 phosphorus fractions in the sediment columns the tp concentration in the sediment of t1 was higher than those of t2 and t3 p 0 01 anova fig 3 all were lower than those in the spm similar to the p fraction in spm fe p and org p were also the dominant mobile p in the sediment ex p was quite low compared to the other fractions a significant increase in org p in t1 was observed from may to october especially in the surficial 2 cm of the sediment with the highest value of 150 8 mg kg 1 in july the increase of p in the mda mostly occurred in winter with a slight increase in fe p and org p fe p concentrations in t2 and t3 remained low during the summer and autumn when temperatures are highest 3 3 3 typical metals in the surficial sediment the concentrations of fe and al in the sediment of t1 were significantly higher than those of t2 and t3 p 0 01 anova fig s7 the fe and al concentrations of t1 increased from december to march and were similar to those in the spm section 3 2 4 similar to concentrations in the spm ca in the sediment of t1 remained stable and lower than in t2 and t3 p 0 016 anova a trend of increase in ca concentrations was observed for both t2 and t3 from october to january potentially caused by high levels of ca in the spm during this period fig s5 3 3 4 reduced inorganic sulfur fractions in the surficial sediment acid volatile sulfide and cr ii reducible sulfur were the dominant fractions of reduced inorganic sulfur in the sediments of both ada and mda fig s8 acid volatile sulfide and cr ii reducible sulfur concentrations in the sediments of t2 and t3 increased from may to september and were significantly higher than those in t1 generally the reduced sulfur concentrations in the mda were higher than those in the ada during summer and autumn probably caused by the high toc section 3 3 1 induced sulfate reduction rates in the area kim et al 2017 3 4 profile characteristics and fluxes across the swi 3 4 1 o2 profiles and uptake rates across the swi the o2 profiles showed significantly differences between different sites and sampling periods p 0 01 anova fig s9 from may to august the oxic sediment zone of t1 narrowed gradually fig s9 with the o2 penetration depth opd decreasing from 3 0 mm to 0 fig 4 an extreme anoxic condition of the swi was observed in august when o2 in the bottom water decreased to 0 significantly negative correlations were discovered between the chla in water and opd pearson s r 0 346 p 0 039 the opd remained lower than 2 mm until december from december to april the opd of t1 gradually increased to approximately 7 mm fig 4 o2 concentrations across the swi for t2 and t3 were also low from may to august fig s9 however the opd of both t2 and t3 p 0 231 paired t test exhibited a slow increase from may 2018 to march 2019 the lowest opd for t2 and t3 were observed from april to may notably negative o2 uptake rate values for t2 and t3 were detected from june to september especially in august fig 4 when the highest biomass of submerged macrophytes was recorded fig 1 3 4 2 pore water profiles of srp and fe ii across the swi the pore water srp concentrations were generally higher from may to october with those of t1 being higher than for t2 and t3 p 0 01 anova fig 5 after november the srp concentrations at all three sites decreased sharply especially for t1 this decrease in srp at t1 occurred slightly earlier than that at t2 and t3 resulting in lower srp concentrations in the former site from november to april the vertical distributions of srp remained relatively constant from the overlying water to the deeper sediment for all three sites under the low winter temperatures from december to march the fe ii concentrations of t1 were relatively higher from may to october fig 6 and were slightly higher than those of srp during the same period which did not allow for fe and p co precipitation in the oxic sediment zone lehtoranta et al 2009 from november to april the fe ii concentrations of t1 decreased sharply to under 0 5 mg l 1 or even close to 0 the concentrations of fe ii for t2 and t3 were remarkably higher than those for t1 p 0 01 anova which could be noticed during most of the year in particular significant increases in fe ii for t2 and t3 were observed after september when the temperature began to decline and the fe ii of t1 began to decrease even in winter december to february the fe ii concentrations of t2 and t3 were significantly higher than those of t1 and the corresponding srp concentrations p 0 01 anova 3 4 3 fluxes of srp and fe ii across the swi the srp fluxes of t1 remained stable between 1 50 and 2 23 mg m 2 d 1 from may to august which were already within the range of high p fluxes in many eutrophic lakes gibbons and bridgeman 2020 nürnberg et al 2012 the highest srp fluxes of t1 reached 16 79 mg m 2 d 1 in september and then decreased quickly the srp fluxes of t2 and t3 however increased gradually after may and peaked in july and august with fluxes of 14 90 and 13 57 mg m 2 d 1 respectively similarly the p fluxes of all three sites decreased sharply after november and remained low until the following april the fe ii fluxes of t1 increased gradually after may and peaked in july at 158 77 mg m 2 d 1 decreasing gradually thereafter down to below 0 2 mg m 2 d 1 after november the highest values of t2 and t3 reached 1097 24 and 423 46 mg m 2 d 1 in october and july respectively these values were considerably higher than for t1 and the srp fluxes at these two sites further analysis revealed significant positive relationships between fe ii and srp fluxes in t2 and t3 both p 0 01 but not in t1 fig 7 the simultaneous release of fe ii and srp in t2 and t3 was more evident than in t1 4 discussion 4 1 deposition of algae and macrophyte originated spm induced differential environmental changes across the swi previous studies have shown that the decomposition of algae and macrophytes could lead to o2 depletion as well as the release of p and other elements liu et al 2015 shen et al 2014 the deposition and decomposition of algae and macrophyte derived spm may play vital roles during these processes however the time periods of spm deposition were significantly different the deposition of algae originated spm was mostly observed from late spring to autumn with high sedimentation rates section 3 2 1 especially in the summer when lake taihu faced the most severe algal bloom qin et al 2019 the algae derived spm resulted in high concentrations of toc in the spm and the surficial sediment sections 3 2 2 and 3 3 1 as well as high levels of protein like organic matter liu et al 2019a consequently a rapid decomposition process occurs after spm deposition especially during summer and autumn with high temperatures derrien et al 2019 diaz and rosenberg 2008 our previous study in lake taihu revealed that the decomposition of algae originated spm generally took place within 5 days and o2 was depleted within 2 days liu et al 2019b 2015 in the current study o2 across the swi in the ada decreased to 0 from may to august and remained at low levels until the end of autumn section 3 4 1 the decomposition of algae originated spm led to low o2 low opd and a high consumption of o2 across the swi as shown in section 3 2 1 the deposition of spm in the mda was influenced by the two withering periods of different macrophytes the withering of potamogetom crispus resulted in a short period of o2 depletion in late spring which has also been observed in previous studies shen et al 2014 while in summer although high toc in the spm and sediment of t2 and t3 sections 3 2 2 and 3 3 1 might have led to the intense mineralization and consumption of o2 at high temperatures derrien et al 2019 li et al 2018 the depletion of o2 across the swi was not as drastic as that of t1 the radial o2 losses effect usually increases the depth of the oxic sediment zone around the rhizosphere han et al 2018 koop jakobsen et al 2017 thus increased opd from may to september and negative o2 uptake rates were observed in the mda under high macrophyte coverage section 3 4 1 comparing ada and mda algae originated spm led to the sharp depletion of o2 across the swi during summer and autumn while macrophyte originated spm mostly led to o2 depletion in late spring these environmental changes may further influence p exchange across the swi hupfer and lewandowski 2008 søndergaard et al 2003 4 2 deposited spm led to discrepant p sedimentation processes in the ada and mda as revealed in sections 3 2 3 and 3 3 2 ca p fe p and al p were the dominant inorganic p fractions in the spm and sediment the dominant status of ca p in the mda was more evident than that in the ada during the fast growth season large quantities of calcite crusts can frequently form on the leaves and stems of submerged macrophytes during daytime photosynthesis blindow 1992 dong et al 2014 kisand and nõges 2003 pełechaty et al 2013 sand jensen et al 2021 the co precipitation of ca and p through calcite crusts resulted in higher ratios of ca p in the mda than in the ada dierberg et al 2002 wang et al 2022 unlike ca distribution the fe and al concentrations in the spm and sediment in the ada were generally higher than those in the mda resulting in high concentrations of fe p and al p section 3 3 2 among these two fractions al p was considered more stable than fe p by many researchers rönicke et al 2021 rydin 2000 aluminum treatment was also considered more efficient over longer time series in many lakes rönicke et al 2021 yin et al 2018 therefore high concentrations of redox sensitive fe p may be more important for internal p release gu et al 2019 hupfer and lewandowski 2008 an increased fe p ratio is usually considered to increase stability of the p pool in the sediment jensen et al 1992 with regard to fe p t2 and t3 were quite close in both spm p 0 126 paired t test and the sediment p 0 427 paired t test being generally higher than t1 values at most times of the year especially in summer fig s10 a and b the fe p ratio of the sediment was significantly positively correlated with that of spm pearson s r 0 564 p 0 01 fig s10 c demonstrating the direct influence of spm on the sedimentation of fe and p in surficial sediments from may to august fe p in both areas decreased sharply accompanied by a decrease in fe p the obvious decrease in fe p at all three sites indicated a potential influence of fe p on the internal p cycle in both areas which has already been described as the dominant process for internal p release in many lakes alam et al 2020 tammeorg et al 2020 as per section 3 1 the dominant p fraction in the water of both areas was par p whereas the sources of these p concentrated spm were different for the ada the bloomed algae were the most likely sources of par p in the water and the spm sections 3 1 and 3 2 1 an increase in mobile p in the spm was also observed with the increase of par p in summer section 3 2 3 the increase in org p in spm was greater than those of ex p and fe p our previous field observations in the ada of lake taihu also revealed that org p was the dominant fraction of p in the algae originated spm kong et al 2020 a similar distribution of org p in spm was also discovered in the ada of lake chaohu liu et al 2019a yang et al 2020 the increased org p content in the spm gave rise to org p in the surficial sediment in summer section 3 3 2 which has also been considered a key factor influencing p release in many eutrophic areas amirbahman et al 2013 markovic et al 2019 for mda there was no obvious increase of org p in the spm and the surficial sediment during summer therefore the discrepant origins and elemental compositions of spm led to differential p sedimentation processes in the ada and mda which would further influence the internal p cycle in these two areas 4 3 differences of dominant processes for p dissolution and exchange across the swi in the ada and mda differential p sedimentation processes caused by deposited spm in the ada and mda resulted in differential distributions of mobile p in the sediment section 3 3 2 for both the areas fe p and org p were the dominant mobile p fractions for ada the anoxic conditions in summer section 3 4 1 induced the dissolution of fe p hupfer and lewandowski 2008 in parallel the concentrations of srp and fe ii in pore water increased significantly section 3 4 2 fe p concentration in the sediment was also negatively correlated with temperature and chla fig s4 therefore fe p dissolution is believed to occur during the severe algal bloom season at high temperatures which is consistent with previous studies gibbons and bridgeman 2020 hupfer and lewandowski 2008 in addition the mineralization of organic matter would also lead to org p dissolution this process is further enhanced by iron reduction markovic et al 2019 during the algal bloom season a significant increase in the org p difference between spm and the surficial sediment was observed fig s11 the org p difference was significantly higher than the fe p difference during this period in addition the pore water fe ii concentrations in t1 were close to or slightly higher than those of srp section 3 4 2 which did not allow for fe and p co precipitation in the oxic sediment zone lehtoranta et al 2009 these phenomena indicate that a large part of the deposited org p might have been mineralized and released in the ada the subsequent decrease in org p and the low opd after september indicated further mineralization of org p in autumn markovic et al 2019 for the mda org p in the surficial sediment and spm was significantly lower than in the ada during summer and autumn sections 3 2 3 and 3 3 2 moreover the org p difference for t2 and t3 was significantly lower than that of t1 p 0 01 paired t test and the fe p difference during this period p 0 05 paired t test fig s11 the fe p differences of t2 and t3 exhibited a general increase from may to september being mostly higher than that of t1 during summer and autumn the pore water profiles also showed that fe ii concentrations in t2 and t3 were several times the corresponding srp concentrations from may to december section 3 4 2 therefore the dissolution of fe p in mda was more obvious than that in ada as discussed in the current section and section 4 2 fe p dissolution during summer and autumn was observed in both areas however large differences were noted as fe p dissolution in the mda was considerably greater than that of other p fractions the significant positive relationship between srp and fe ii fluxes p 0 01 also indicated the simultaneous release of p and fe ii section 3 4 3 while for the ada no significant relationship was discovered between the fluxes of srp and fe ii section 3 4 3 the simultaneous dissolution of fe p and org p during the algal bloom season would both influence the release of p consequently different dominant processes for p release in ada and mda were deduced fig 8 p release in the mda is generally controlled by a traditional fe p dissolution process influenced by the coupled cycling of iron sulfur and p across the swi which has already been described in numerous previous studies lehtoranta et al 2009 rozan et al 2002 the high concentrations of reduced sulfur in the mda section 3 3 4 might facilitate the formation of iron sulfides sequentially restraining the co precipitation of fe and p in the oxic sediment layer and enhancing the release of p after fe p dissolution lehtoranta et al 2009 therefore the srp fluxes of t2 and t3 were mostly higher than those of t1 during the summer and autumn fig 7 in addition there are still some other factors that might result in the higher p fluxes in the mda including the decaying of macrophyte debris in the sediment shen et al 2014 the lower concentrations of p in the overlying water of the mda or the artefact caused by the calculation of fluxes using fick s first law of diffusion ullman and aller 1982 these factors influencing the internal p release in the mda still require further study with the development of eutrophication and algal blooms the traditional fe p controlled process was shifted to a coupled process controlled by both fe p and org p in the ada moreover the control of org p might gradually intensify with the deterioration of algal bloom status a widely accepted phenomenon for the evolution of eutrophic shallow lakes scheffer and van nes 2007 the shift between the macrophyte and algae dominated status might also shift the dominant processes for internal p release controlled by fe p and org p in addition due to the high ca p co precipitation by the crust on macrophytes section 4 2 the sedimentation and dissolution of ca p might also play an important role in internal p cycling in the mda dierberg et al 2002 kisand and nõges 2003 wang et al 2022 however the ca p in the sediment was mostly higher than in the spm sedimentation might still be the prevailing process for ca p the dissolution of ca p in the mda or other similar areas with high ratio of ca p requires further investigation 5 conclusions a yearlong field investigation in the ada and mda of lake taihu revealed that both algae and macrophyte originated spm led to the depletion of o2 across the swi during summer and autumn the different characteristics of deposited spm resulted in differential p sedimentation and release processes in the two areas a traditional fe p dissolution process influenced by the coupled cycling of iron sulfur and p was observed in the mda with the development of eutrophication and algal blooms the control of org p might be intensified and a coupled process controlled by both org p and fe p was discovered in the ada therefore we further deduced that the dominant process for internal p release might gradually shift from fe p to a coupled process of fe p and org p with the shift of macrophytes to algae in eutrophic shallow lakes similar processes might occur in shallow freshwater lakes with the deterioration of eutrophic statuses authors contributions cheng liu designed the research wrote the paper and performed the experiment yiheng du performed

15518,riparian zones are important natural means of water purification by decreasing the aqueous concentration of terrestrial organic matter om through adsorption and microbial degradation of the organic matter within the aquatic ecosystem limited studies have been reported so far concerning the migration of dissolved organic matter dom in the horizontal and vertical planes of riparian zones in this study the migration of dom in riparian zones from forest soil to wetland soil and with soil depth were explored based on a case study reservoir results showed that riparian wetlands can absorb the om from the forest soils and adjacent reservoir and act as a major om sink through microbial action methylomirabilota and gal15 bacteria increased with soil depth for the two soil systems and the wetland soil system also contained microbial sulfates nitrates and carbonates these microorganisms successfully utilize the fe3 so4 and co3 as electron acceptors in the wetland system resulting in enhanced om removal although the variation of soil dom in the vertical direction was the same for both forest and wetland soils the chemical structure of the dom was found to be significantly different furthermore the soil was found to be the main source of dom in the forest ecosystem with lignin as the main ingredient the lignin structure was gradually oxidized and decomposed with an increase in carboxyl groups as the lignin diffused down into the soil and the adjacent reservoir pls pm analysis showed that the soil physicochemical properties were the main factors affecting dom transformation however microbial metabolism was still the goes deeper affecting factor this study will contribute to the analysis that migration and transform of soil organic matter in riparian zone graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural organic matter dom riparian zones electron acceptor electron donor microbial metabolic pathway data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction riparian areas are usually transitional zones between the aquatic and the terrestrial ecosystems that are intermittently inundated or water logged wantzen and junk 2008 having a high water table mccormick 1979 along with the seasonal changes between oxic anoxic conditions décamps et al 2004 meanwhile the riparian ecosystem also exerts important influences on the adjacent waterways by mediating the bidirectional flow of matter and energy between the water body and surrounding uplands feld et al 2018 rood 2006 stutter et al 2021 therefore the riparian zone can widely be viewed as a practicable and cost effective means of protecting water quality and enhancing ecological values cole et al 2020 additionally the riparian buffer strips create a barrier for water pollution by reducing the nutrients contaminants and sediments in waterways through a range of physical hydrological chemical and biological processes dosskey et al 2010 knight et al 2010 stutter et al 2012 however the natural pollution of water bodies is usually the litter and humus in riparian ecosystems kalbitz et al 2000 that mainly consists of animal plant and microbial residues or faeces and household garbage angst et al 2019 existing in various chemical forms and structures simpson and simpson 2012 these substances gradually break down into particulate organic matter pom mineral associated organic matter maom and dissolved organic matter dom lavallee et al 2020 their physical properties have shown that the pom is coarser lighter more easily manageable and has a faster cycling pool than maom christensen 2002 golchin et al 1994 koegel knabner et al 2008 poeplau et al 2018 six et al 2002 maom can further decompose into dom which is the main component of water pollution as the organics can remain dissolved in water for a long time roth et al 2019 the rich carbon nitrogen and phosphorus content of dom may cause eutrophication of water bodies li et al 2021 dom is often defined as a range of varying molecular weight organic molecules including organic acids sugars amino acids and structures that pass through a membrane of 0 45 µm pore size fox et al 2018 mcfee et al 1995 additionally the dom in water bodies is also degraded by the hydrolysis of extracellular material into high molecular weight dissolved organic matter hmw dom kalbitz et al 2000 the hmw dom can be further resolved into monomeric low molecular weight dom mlmw doc or less reactive polymeric low molecular weight dom plmw doc that are functionally important in controlling the formation of maom by terminal respiratory processes burdige and komada 2015 and carbon migration in the soil profiles arndt et al 2013 previous studies have also shown that the turnover of dom as organic carbon nitrogen don and phosphorous dop in soil ecosystems are the major pathways of element cycling chantigny et al 1999 chardon et al 1997 donald et al 1993 mcfee et al 1995 zsolnay 1996 various researchers have shown that the dom translation is largely dominated by biota guggenberger et al 1998 and dom represents an important energy source and electron transfer intermediate between terrestrial and aquatic element cycles hedges and keil 1995 moreover the dom in aquatic systems can also be simplified as the mixture of different end members including the autochthonous and the allochthonous organic matter om at varying ratios and or their by products depending upon the biogeochemical processes derrien et al 2019 similarly the sources of the dom are commonly distinguished into two principal categories namely 1 autochthonous dom from photosynthetic heterotrophic organisms and sedimentation and 2 allochthonous dom from terrestrial ecosystems tulonen 2020 the addition of dom content into freshwater ecosystems occurs mainly during the raining seasons chiu et al 2020 d j et al 1992 dalva and moore 1991 and changes in precipitation can also affect the input of terrestrial dissolved organic matter tdom to freshwater ecosystems by modifying their hydrology temperature profiles light regimes and biochemical processes houser 2011 paerl and huisman 2008 sowerby et al 2010 it has been shown that dom in surface source waters can react with disinfectants during drinking water treatment to form a range of disinfection by products dbps wu et al 2019 which potentially represent a risk to the water ecology and human health su et al 2017 therefore exploring the migration transfer and removal of dom in the soils of riparian zones can make a significant contribution to understanding their role in water purification in riparian ecosystems microorganisms also play an important role in the decomposition and transformation of organic matter during the initial stages of dom generation certain microorganisms produce extracellular and membrane bound hydrolytic enzymes and the hydrolytic products are consumed by acetogenic and fermenting bacteria producing hydrogen and acetate however the dom during its breakdown stages is usually mineralized into carbon dioxide by aerobic biological tricarboxylic acid cycling moreover the mineralization of organic matter in anoxic environments is mainly by glycolysis the archaea bacteria an uncultivable population that are widespread and highly predominant in subsurface sediments biddle and f 2006 lipp et al 2008 schippers et al 2010 play an important role in the complex degradation of organic matter such as affecting the pathways and the kinetics of degradation aerobic or anaerobic conditions are highly dependent on the depth water content and porosity of the soil arndt et al 2013 therefore the content and composition of dom in soil is closely related to the different types of riparian ecosystem soil depth and microbial groups to the best of our knowledge the environmental processes of dom migration and transformation and the microbial degradation pathways within the riparian zones are still unknown this study are research two types of riparian soils forest soil and wetland soil and to evaluate the migration and microbiological degradation of dom the forest system was adjacent to the wetland system representing a terrestrial and an aquatic system respectively the objectives of the study were 1 to explore the dom transformation and migration in two riparian zones at different soil depths 2 to evaluate microbial degradation pathways of dom in different soil systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design in this research two riparian zone ecosystems were studied wetland and forest soil ecosystems and analyzed their physical chemical and biological properties at different soil depths additionally the water extractable soil organic matter was characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy and electrospray ionization coupled to fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry esi ft icr ms analysis the experiments were designed to reveal the transformation and migration mechanisms of the soluble organic matter in the different ecosystems and depths 2 2 study site and sampling soil sampling was conducted on may 29 2020 at the guanting reservoir located approximately 75 km northwest of beijing china supporting information fig s1 three representative unconnected sites were selected around the reservoir with each site having both a forest and adjoining wetland ecological system for each forest wetland ecosystem soil sampling was conducted at three locations and the geographical coordinates of these sampling locations are reported in the si supplementary table s1 at each location samples were taken by geotome from every 20 cm of soil depth up to 100 cm representing five soil layers after the sampling exercise the samples from the three forest ecosystem sites for the same depth were mixed to form a composite forest ecosystem f sample a similar composite wetland ecosystem wl sample was prepared from mixing the wetland samples taken at the same soil depth thereafter the 10 composite soil samples f at 5 depths and wt at 5 depths were immediately placed into self sealing bags stored in an ice box while being transferred to the laboratory and storage at 80 c refrigerator for microbial diversity testing and physicochemical properties testing respectively one aliquot of each soil sample was stored in liquid

to analyse the correlation between biodiversity and the physicochemical properties by the ggcor package graphics were processed using the origin pro 2018 software and the significance level for differences was adjusted at p 0 05 in this research 3 results and discussion to explore the mechanism of dom migration and microbiological degradation in the riparian zone soil samples in the horizontal and vertical directions were extracted at the three reservoir locations the horozontal distance between wetland and forest sampling points and water body is 5 m and 10 m respectively both wetland bordering on the reservoir and forest soils were extracted to represent the horizontal change of doc on the basis that reservoir water flows through the wetland before reaching the forest soil vertical migration and microbial degradation of dom were explored at different depths for both wetland and forest soils in every 20 cm layers up to a maximum depth of 100 cm in the vertical direction the particle size distribution results showed a gradual decrease with the depth of both wetland and forest soils however in the horizontal direction the particle size of the wetland soil was found to be significantly greater than that of the forest soil si fig s2 from 40 to 100 cm both wetland and forest soils consisted of silt clayey loam and contained a constant som content fig 1 f the som associated with large particles cannot penetrate into the silt clayey loam layer resulting in only the presence of dom in the silt clayey loam layer according to the results relating to the physicochemical properties the tc tn no3 and som concentrations in the wetland soil were significantly greater than the forest soil in the horizontal direction fig 1a b e and f this phenomenon was attributed to the reservoir bed sediment cole et al 2020 and also proves that the wetland riparian ecosystem is highly effective for absorption and decomposition of som as compared to the reservoir in contrast the tc concentration increased gradually with the increase of depth fig 1a however the som of the two riparian ecosystems showed a negligible change p 0 05 in the soil layers below 40 cm fig 1f the increasing carbon concentration was attributed to inorganic carbon species such as the formation of iron carbonates which form stable chelates lv et al 2018 the abnormal variation of no3 at 20 40 cm fig 1e was ascribed to the replacement of o2 by no3 as an electron acceptor in the facultative anaerobic soil environment paul et al 2010 however no3 was further replaced by fe3 so4 and co3 in highly anaerobic soil environments and the redox potential eh was observed to be the major determinant of the electron acceptor ramesh et al 2012 the increase in methylomirabilota and anaerobic microorganisms with increasing depth fig 2 c and d confirmed that the soil environment below 40 cm was highly anaerobic additionally the c n of wetland soil was found to be significantly higher p 0 05 not only than the forest soil fig 1c but also much greater than the optimal ratio for microbial growth of 25 1 resulting in reduced microbial activity hence a higher concentration of som was observed in the wetland soil compared to the forest soil fig 1f interestingly the reservoir som was also adsorbed by the wetland soil resulting in an increased concentration of the wetland som rivett et al 2008 the significant difference of ph fig 1g between wetland and forest soils may also have contributed to the difference in microbial activity and the removal rate of som the carbon and nitrogen cycles of the soil mainly depend on the activity and population structure of microorganisms kronzucker et al 1997 therefore the cultural bacteria and high throughput sequencing otu species of both wetland and forest soils were compared and the number of microbial in forest soil was found to be significantly higher than the wetland soil fig 2a and b however a lower bacterial variety was observed in the forest soil compared to the wetland soil fig 2c and d as the forest soil contained a large mass of microorganisms this indicated that the forest soil c n ratio fig 1c was sufficiently beneficial for the microbial growth in addition the high throughput sequencing results also showed that the gal15 and methylomirabilota content of both forest and wetland soils increased significantly with the increase of soil depth fig 2c and d and a similar trend was observed for the methanogenic bacteria fig 2e and f noticeably an increased carbonate respiration was observed with the increase of soil depth figs 2e f and 3 b cyanobacteria campilobacterota and rcp 2 54 were the major bacterial groups of wetland soil fig 2b different metabolic patterns were observed for both of the soil systems that utilize different electron acceptors such as sulphur iron fumarate nitrate and sulfate respiration attard et al 2010 freitag et al 2005 carbon and nitrogen concentrations in soil systems are not only the nutrients for microbes but also the source of electron donors and acceptors for the microorganisms attard et al 2010 freitag et al 2005 rivett et al 2008 similarly nh4 was also the main electron donor for microorganisms at different depths of both forest and wetland soils fig 1c typical microflora of various bacterial metabolisms si supplementary table s2 were screened from both forest and wetland soils and only the presence of carbonate metabolizing bacteria was found abundantly in the forest soil fig 3 indicating that carbonates were the main electron acceptors for microorganisms additionally bacterial metabolism involving sulfate nitrate and carbonates was also evident in wetland soil at different depths fig 3a b and c moreover the dom of wetland can utilize more inorganic salts as electron acceptors for microorganisms and these may be affected by the temperature soil ph som and smc fig 3d and e combinatorial correlation analysis results showed a significantly positive correlation of forest and wetland som with that of tn nh4 and temperature fig 3a in contrast the no3 and c n of wetland were found to be negatively correlated with som fig 3b enriched no3 can lead to denitrification resulting in nh4 production and inhibition of the decomposition of organic matter bruland et al 2008 the high c n ratio also lead to the degradation rate of organic matter as shown in fig 3b additionally the som was also found to be significantly correlated p 0 05 with the bacterial community distribution at the phylum level however the nh4 ph and temperature were found to be correlated p 0 05 or 0 01 with the bacterial community distribution at the class order family genus and species level fig 3 in general nh4 can act as an electron donor for microorganisms rivett et al 2008 and the appropriate ph and temperature are the necessary conditions for their growth although the types of microorganisms involved in om transformation at different soil depths have been identified the optical properties of the soil organic matter were further explored by fluorescence spectroscopy the eem scans showed a gradual decrease in dom content with the increase of soil depth fig 4 a to j eem spectra were divided into five regions corresponding to the type of om simple aromatic proteins and tyrosine like substances were assigned to regions i and ii ex 250 nm em 350 nm region iii ex 250 nm em 350 nm mainly consisted of fulvic acid like matter the soluble microbial products like and humic acid like substances were assigned to region iv ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm and region v ex 280 nm em 380 nm respectively marhuenda egea et al 2007 xing et al 2012 the eem spectra of dom extracted from both forest and wetland soil samples showed the presence of aromatic proteins fulvic acid like matter and humic acid like substances fig 4a to j two distinct peaks were detected in regions iii and v which weakened with soil depth indicating the presence of fulvic like and humic like organic substances in the topsoil 0 40 cm similarly the increasing silts and clays with increasing soil depth have less surface areas or pores available that may adsorb less humic acid like or fulvic acid like the decrease of soil particles and the increase of viscosity coefficient will prevent the downward migration of organic matter and reduce the survival rate of microorganisms the peak located in region i gradually decreased with the forest soil depth fig 4a to d which was mainly ascribed to the reduced metabolism of microorganisms in deep soil fig 2a and b in contrast the peaks in region i that were mainly assigned to microbial secretions ishii and boyer 2012 showed a negligible correlation at different depths of the wetland soil system fig 4e to j these findings further confirmed the presence of more active microbes in the deep wetland soils as compared to the forest soils additionally the higher water content of the wetland soils fig 1i contributed to the enhanced dom migration especially for small molecules more information about the dom components was extracted from parafac analysis of forest and wetland samples five fluorescent components characterized by ex em 220 320 430 nm component 1 c1 fig 4k 200 300 300 450 nm component 2 c2 fig 4l 250 500 nm component 3 c3 fig 4m 230 490 nm component 4 c4 fig 4n and 230 470 nm component 5 c5 fig 4o were identified by the eem parafac analysis the c1 was composed of some small molecular size compounds such as protein like materials including tryptophan like and tryosine like materials which had emission bands centered around 400 500 nm and 250 400 nm at an excitation peak around 230 nm or less jun et al 2014 hence the c1 resembled a humic like component mainly from terrestrial sources guéguen et al 2014 the c2 was composed of some small molecular size compounds such as protein like materials including tryptophan like and tryosine like materials with emission bands centered around 400 500 nm and 250 400 nm at an excitation peak around 230 nm or less ishii and boyer 2012 the c3 was classified as hydrophobic substances that belong to high molecular weight aromatic organic compounds with an excitation peak around 245 275 nm and an emission band centered around 450 520 nm ishii and boyer 2012 c4 is associated with humic like and fulvic like substances c5 was identified as humic like substances he et al 2014 murphy et al 2011 these results suggest that the dom of forest and wetland soils were terrestrial in origin and that dom migrated from forest soil to wetland soil in addition the sediment layer of the reservoir will also have the opportunity to migrate substantial amounts of organic matter to the wetland zone cole et al 2020 therefore wetland soil is the principal location for purifying exogenous organic matter and providing good quality water attributed principally to its abundant microbial diversity and appropriate c n fig 1c 2a and b several distinct and characteristic sharp stretching frequencies of different chemical groups were observed from atr ftir spectra for all samples fig 5 a and b based on previous literature gupta and garg 2009 jouraiphy et al 2005 lv et al 2013 the ftir characteristic peaks were assigned and incorporated to the main sharp stretching frequencies that relate to the biological activities involved and the corresponding functional groups was reported in the si supplementary table s3 lv et al 2013 the ftir spectra of all soil samples exhibited similar peaks at relative locations but varied in the relative intensity as reported in the si supplementary table s3 the main absorption bands were as follows 1 bands at 3407 3384 cm 1 were assigned to the o h stretching that was ascribed to the phenols and carboxylic groups lv et al 2013 2 characteristic peaks at 2931 2925 2854 cm 1 were assigned to the c h stretching which could be attributed to the biodegradation of fatty acids carbohydrates and other aliphatic groups gupta and garg 2009 3 peaks at 1655 1640 cm 1 were assigned to c o amide i carboxylates and c c aromatic ring modes alkenes bonds respectively li et al 2011 4 absorbance bands in the region of 1421 1410 cm 1 were caused by the carboxylic acids and amides iii that mainly belong to the coo and c n stretching li et al 2011 and 5 peaks at 1080 1030 cm 1 were assigned to the c o stretching which indicates the presence of polysaccharides or polysaccharide like substances abouelwafa et al 2008 these peaks further proved the degradation of soil organic matter together with the gradual decomposition of macromolecules in particular amide i or carboxylates c o aromatic rings or alkenes c c and polysaccharides c o stretching were found to be significantly higher in deep soils as compared to the shallow soils of both forest and wetland systems fig 5a and b sugars tend to be in linear chains and therefore may migrate more easily to deeper soils than the substances with a ring structure additionally a higher content of various functional groups was observed in forest soil compared to that of wetland soils fig 5a and b these findings might be attributed to the microbes that utilize the variety of nitrogen metabolism pathways more quickly in wetland systems than the forest soil systems fig 3a b and c the preliminary results based on the soil physicochemical properties microbial community characterization and ftir analysis can be divided into two soil layer regions above and below 40 cm depth figs 1 s3 s4 5a and 5b ft icr ms analysis was applied to further characterize the soluble dom in different soil layers and the halogenated products due to its ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy zhang et al 2014 figs s5a and s5b show the ultrahigh resolution mass spectra of the two types of soil dom samples with the depth range of 0 40 cm and 40 100 cm and the nominal mass of the scan was adjusted from 200 to 800 m z the ft icr ms results showed that the nominal mass of forest and wetland soil dom samples were distributed in between 250 and 600 m z fig s5a and between 250 and 800 m z fig s5b respectively the signal peak of principal components of forest soil dom was found to be significantly greater than that of the wetland soil dom fig 5a and b these findings may be attributed to the fallen leaves that supply humus directly to the forest soil and the dilution of the dom concentration in the riparian wetland in addition microorganisms can also decompose om using a variety of nitrogen metabolic pathways in wetland soils fig 3d and e leading to a greater nominal mass distribution of dom than that of the forest soil system generally the chemical formula of natural organic matter was assigned to the groups containing cho chno chos or chnos chemical compositions song et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 in this study it was found that in the forest soil the proportion of cho groups decreased with depth while the percentage of chno chos and chnos groups increased with soil depth fig s5c the cho group arises substantially from plant leaves with a percentage content in the range of 43 to 72 song et al 2018 and forms a new chemical bond by replacing the c o in the aldehyde groups after microbial degradation however sulfur respiration microbes were undiscovered below 20 cm in the forest soil system fig 3a resulting in the increased content of chno cnos and chnos groups in the bottom layers of the forest soils in contrast the sulfur respiration and nitrate respiration microbes were found abundantly in the lower layers of the wetland soils fig 3c leading to a significantly decreased content of the chno cnos and chnos groups with increasing soil depth fig s5c the van krevelen vk diagrams also confirmed these effects in terms of the different bio chemical substances represented by the h c and o c values the regions in the diagrams mainly represent lipids o c 0 0 2 h c 1 7 2 2 proteins o c 0 2 0 6 h c 1 5 2 2 n c 0 05 lignin o c 0 1 0 6 h c 0 6 1 7 aimod 0 67 carbohydrates o c 0 6 1 2 h c 1 5 2 2 tannins o c 0 6 1 2 h c 0 5 1 5 ai mod 0 67 and unsaturated hydrocarbons o c 0 0 1 h c 0 7 1 5 hertkorn et al 2006 the ft icr ms results also showed that the soluble dom of forest soil consisted mainly of lignin especially in the 0 40 cm of soil depth fig 5a and b with microbial degradation the lignin skeletal structure gradually reduces to small organic substances which can move deeper into the soil by rainwater percolation interestingly the coh structure of the lignin was rarely found in the wetland soils fig 5d or f indicating more rapid oxidation of dom in the wetland soils as compared to that in the forest soil system the redox active functional groups phenolic hydroxyl carboxyl amides etc of the dom fimmen et al 2007 have been widely accepted as electron shuttles in environmental redox processes he et al 2019 previous studies have also shown that the electron transfer capacities etc of humic acids were significantly associated with their aromaticity functional groups and molecular weight zhu rui et al 2018 moreover the phenolic and quinone groups mainly control the electron donating capacity edc and electron accepting capacity eac respectively aeschbacher et al 2010 herzsprung et al 2012 scott et al 1998 in this study the eac was significantly greater than the edc fig 6 a and b indicating the riparian zone dom was mainly in an oxidized state in addition it was observed that the macro and small molecular substances of the dom were electron acceptors and donors respectively che et al 2020 these phenomena further demonstrated the incomplete humification of the humus within the soil layers which was also shown by the ft icr results fig 5c to 5f the maximum values of eac and edc were detected in the 40 60 cm depth zone fig 6a and b which was attributed to the degradation of polymer proteins and the polymerization of aromatic substances he et al 2019 the protein like substances degradation is ascribe to microbial degradation and which substances participated in organic matter polycondensation wu et al 2017 these findings further indicated the following two phenomena a high conversion rate of humus in deep soil layers and the inhibited migration of humus macromolecules below 60 cm due to the influence of soil particle size fig 6c and d therefore the 0 60 cm depth region of the riparian zones was a complex area of humus decomposition including macromolecules and small molecular decomposition while the riparian soil below 60 cm depth consisted principally of decomposed small molecules partial least squares path modeling pls pm was conducted to explore the relationships between soil depth physico and electro chemical properties bacterial community and the dom of soil physicochemical properties were found to be a dominant factor affecting the dom degradation for both forest and wetland soil systems however the electrochemical properties and bacterial community were the secondary factors for dom degradation fig 7 a d in particular all the factors showed an indirect effect on the dom degradation in the forest soil samples while the physicochemical properties directly affected the dom of wetland soil samples fig 7 hence the pls pm analysis proved that the soil physicochemical properties are the key to dom transformation which may also affect the metabolic rate of the microorganisms 4 conclusions the present study has revealed the changes in microbial community structure and functional potential in forest and wetland riparian zones the wetland riparian zone contains various biological metabolic pathways including sulfate carbonate and nitrate respiration in the biodegradation of dom however the main source of dom was that released from forest soil and this gradually decomposed during the process of migration to the wetland dom was produced mainly from the gradual decomposition of lignin where the aromatic and or aldehyde groups were gradually oxidized and degraded changes in physicochemical properties not only played a decisive role in the composition of the microbial populations but also transformed the

15518,riparian zones are important natural means of water purification by decreasing the aqueous concentration of terrestrial organic matter om through adsorption and microbial degradation of the organic matter within the aquatic ecosystem limited studies have been reported so far concerning the migration of dissolved organic matter dom in the horizontal and vertical planes of riparian zones in this study the migration of dom in riparian zones from forest soil to wetland soil and with soil depth were explored based on a case study reservoir results showed that riparian wetlands can absorb the om from the forest soils and adjacent reservoir and act as a major om sink through microbial action methylomirabilota and gal15 bacteria increased with soil depth for the two soil systems and the wetland soil system also contained microbial sulfates nitrates and carbonates these microorganisms successfully utilize the fe3 so4 and co3 as electron acceptors in the wetland system resulting in enhanced om removal although the variation of soil dom in the vertical direction was the same for both forest and wetland soils the chemical structure of the dom was found to be significantly different furthermore the soil was found to be the main source of dom in the forest ecosystem with lignin as the main ingredient the lignin structure was gradually oxidized and decomposed with an increase in carboxyl groups as the lignin diffused down into the soil and the adjacent reservoir pls pm analysis showed that the soil physicochemical properties were the main factors affecting dom transformation however microbial metabolism was still the goes deeper affecting factor this study will contribute to the analysis that migration and transform of soil organic matter in riparian zone

available on request 1 introduction riparian areas are usually transitional zones between the aquatic and the terrestrial ecosystems that are intermittently inundated or water logged wantzen and junk 2008 having a high water table mccormick 1979 along with the seasonal changes between oxic anoxic conditions décamps et al 2004 meanwhile the riparian ecosystem also exerts important influences on the adjacent waterways by mediating the bidirectional flow of matter and energy between the water body and surrounding uplands feld et al 2018 rood 2006 stutter et al 2021 therefore the riparian zone can widely be viewed as a practicable and cost effective means of protecting water quality and enhancing ecological values cole et al 2020 additionally the riparian buffer strips create a barrier for water pollution by reducing the nutrients contaminants and sediments in waterways through a range of physical hydrological chemical and biological processes dosskey et al 2010 knight et al 2010 stutter et al 2012 however the natural pollution of water bodies is usually the litter and humus in riparian ecosystems kalbitz et al 2000 that mainly consists of animal plant and microbial residues or faeces and household garbage angst et al 2019 existing in various chemical forms and structures simpson and simpson 2012 these substances gradually break down into particulate organic matter pom mineral associated organic matter maom and dissolved organic matter dom lavallee et al 2020 their physical properties have shown that the pom is coarser lighter more easily manageable and has a faster cycling pool than maom christensen 2002 golchin et al 1994 koegel knabner et al 2008 poeplau et al 2018 six et al 2002 maom can further decompose into dom which is the main component of water pollution as the organics can remain dissolved in water for a long time roth et al 2019 the rich carbon nitrogen and phosphorus content of dom may cause eutrophication of water bodies li et al 2021 dom is often defined as a range of varying molecular weight organic molecules including organic acids sugars amino acids and structures that pass through a membrane of 0 45 µm pore size fox et al 2018 mcfee et al 1995 additionally the dom in water bodies is also degraded by the hydrolysis of extracellular material into high molecular weight dissolved organic matter hmw dom kalbitz et al 2000 the hmw dom can be further resolved into monomeric low molecular weight dom mlmw doc or less reactive polymeric low molecular weight dom plmw doc that are functionally important in controlling the formation of maom by terminal respiratory processes burdige and komada 2015 and carbon migration in the soil profiles arndt et al 2013 previous studies have also shown that the turnover of dom as organic carbon nitrogen don and phosphorous dop in soil ecosystems are the major pathways of element cycling chantigny et al 1999 chardon et al 1997 donald et al 1993 mcfee et al 1995 zsolnay 1996 various researchers have shown that the dom translation is largely dominated by biota guggenberger et al 1998 and dom represents an important energy source and electron transfer intermediate between terrestrial and aquatic element cycles hedges and keil 1995 moreover the dom in aquatic systems can also be simplified as the mixture of different end members including the autochthonous and the allochthonous organic matter om at varying ratios and or their by products depending upon the biogeochemical processes derrien et al 2019 similarly the sources of the dom are commonly distinguished into two principal categories namely 1 autochthonous dom from photosynthetic heterotrophic organisms and sedimentation and 2 allochthonous dom from terrestrial ecosystems tulonen 2020 the addition of dom content into freshwater ecosystems occurs mainly during the raining seasons chiu et al 2020 d j et al 1992 dalva and moore 1991 and changes in precipitation can also affect the input of terrestrial dissolved organic matter tdom to freshwater ecosystems by modifying their hydrology temperature profiles light regimes and biochemical processes houser 2011 paerl and huisman 2008 sowerby et al 2010 it has been shown that dom in surface source waters can react with disinfectants during drinking water treatment to form a range of disinfection by products dbps wu et al 2019 which potentially represent a risk to the water ecology and human health su et al 2017 therefore exploring the migration transfer and removal of dom in the soils of riparian zones can make a significant contribution to understanding their role in water purification in riparian ecosystems microorganisms also play an important role in the decomposition and transformation of organic matter during the initial stages of dom generation certain microorganisms produce extracellular and membrane bound hydrolytic enzymes and the hydrolytic products are consumed by acetogenic and fermenting bacteria producing hydrogen and acetate however the dom during its breakdown stages is usually mineralized into carbon dioxide by aerobic biological tricarboxylic acid cycling moreover the mineralization of organic matter in anoxic environments is mainly by glycolysis the archaea bacteria an uncultivable population that are widespread and highly predominant in subsurface sediments biddle and f 2006 lipp et al 2008 schippers et al 2010 play an important role in the complex degradation of organic matter such as affecting the pathways and the kinetics of degradation aerobic or anaerobic conditions are highly dependent on the depth water content and porosity of the soil arndt et al 2013 therefore the content and composition of dom in soil is closely related to the different types of riparian ecosystem soil depth and microbial groups to the best of our knowledge the environmental processes of dom migration and transformation and the microbial degradation pathways within the riparian zones are still unknown this study are research two types of riparian soils forest soil and wetland soil and to evaluate the migration and microbiological degradation of dom the forest system was adjacent

differences was adjusted at p 0 05 in this research 3 results and discussion to explore the mechanism of dom migration and microbiological degradation in the riparian zone soil samples in the horizontal and vertical directions were extracted at the three reservoir locations the horozontal distance between wetland and forest sampling points and water body is 5 m and 10 m respectively both wetland bordering on the reservoir and forest soils were extracted to represent the horizontal change of doc on the basis that reservoir water flows through the wetland before reaching the forest soil vertical migration and microbial degradation of dom were explored at different depths for both wetland and forest soils in every 20 cm layers up to a maximum depth of 100 cm in the vertical direction the particle size distribution results showed a gradual decrease with the depth of both wetland and forest soils however in the horizontal direction the particle size of the wetland soil was found to be significantly greater than that of the forest soil si fig s2 from 40 to 100 cm both wetland and forest soils consisted of silt clayey loam and contained a constant som content fig 1 f the som associated with large particles cannot penetrate into the silt clayey loam layer resulting in only the presence of dom in the silt clayey loam layer according to the results relating to the physicochemical properties the tc tn no3 and som concentrations in the wetland soil were significantly greater than the forest soil in the horizontal direction fig 1a b e and f this phenomenon was attributed to the reservoir bed sediment cole et al 2020 and also proves that the wetland riparian ecosystem is highly effective for absorption and decomposition of som as compared to the reservoir in contrast the tc concentration increased gradually with the increase of depth fig 1a however the som of the two riparian ecosystems showed a negligible change p 0 05 in the soil layers below 40 cm fig 1f the increasing carbon concentration was attributed to inorganic carbon species such as the formation of iron carbonates which form stable chelates lv et al 2018 the abnormal variation of no3 at 20 40 cm fig 1e was ascribed to the replacement of o2 by no3 as an electron acceptor in the facultative anaerobic soil environment paul et al 2010 however no3 was further replaced by fe3 so4 and co3 in highly anaerobic soil environments and the redox potential eh was observed to be the major determinant of the electron acceptor ramesh et al 2012 the increase in methylomirabilota and anaerobic microorganisms with increasing depth fig 2 c and d confirmed that the soil environment below 40 cm was highly anaerobic additionally the c n of wetland soil was found to be significantly higher p 0 05 not only than the forest soil fig 1c but also much greater than the optimal ratio for microbial growth of 25 1 resulting in reduced microbial activity hence a higher concentration of som was observed in the wetland soil compared to the forest soil fig 1f interestingly the reservoir som was also adsorbed by the wetland soil resulting in an increased concentration of the wetland som rivett et al 2008 the significant difference of ph fig 1g between wetland and forest soils may also have contributed to the difference in microbial activity and the removal rate of som the carbon and nitrogen cycles of the soil mainly depend on the activity and population structure of microorganisms kronzucker et al 1997 therefore the cultural bacteria and high throughput sequencing otu species of both wetland and forest soils were compared and the number of microbial in forest soil was found to be significantly higher than the wetland soil fig 2a and b however a lower bacterial variety was observed in the forest soil compared to the wetland soil fig 2c and d as the forest soil contained a large mass of microorganisms this indicated that the forest soil c n ratio fig 1c was sufficiently beneficial for the microbial growth in addition the high throughput sequencing results also showed that the gal15 and methylomirabilota content of both forest and wetland soils increased significantly with the increase of soil depth fig 2c and d and a similar trend was observed for the methanogenic bacteria fig 2e and f noticeably an increased carbonate respiration was observed with the increase of soil depth figs 2e f and 3 b cyanobacteria campilobacterota and rcp 2 54 were the major bacterial groups of wetland soil fig 2b different metabolic patterns were observed for both of the soil systems that utilize different electron acceptors such as sulphur iron fumarate nitrate and sulfate respiration attard et al 2010 freitag et al 2005 carbon and nitrogen concentrations in soil systems are not only the nutrients for microbes but also the source of electron donors and acceptors for the microorganisms attard et al 2010 freitag et al 2005 rivett et al 2008 similarly nh4 was also the main electron donor for microorganisms at different depths of both forest and wetland soils fig 1c typical microflora of various bacterial metabolisms si supplementary table s2 were screened from both forest and wetland soils and only the presence of carbonate metabolizing bacteria was found abundantly in the forest soil fig 3 indicating that carbonates were the main electron acceptors for microorganisms additionally bacterial metabolism involving sulfate nitrate and carbonates was also evident in wetland soil at different depths fig 3a b and c moreover the dom of wetland can utilize more inorganic salts as electron acceptors for microorganisms and these may be affected by the temperature soil ph som and smc fig 3d and e combinatorial correlation analysis results showed a significantly positive correlation of forest and wetland som with that of tn nh4 and temperature fig 3a in contrast the no3 and c n of wetland were found to be negatively correlated with som fig 3b enriched no3 can lead to denitrification resulting in nh4 production and inhibition of the decomposition of organic matter bruland et al 2008 the high c n ratio also lead to the degradation rate of organic matter as shown in fig 3b additionally the som was also found to be significantly correlated p 0 05 with the bacterial community distribution at the phylum level however the nh4 ph and temperature were found to be correlated p 0 05 or 0 01 with the bacterial community distribution at the class order family genus and species level fig 3 in general nh4 can act as an electron donor for microorganisms rivett et al 2008 and the appropriate ph and temperature are the necessary conditions for their growth although the types of microorganisms involved in om transformation at different soil depths have been identified the optical properties of the soil organic matter were further explored by fluorescence spectroscopy the eem scans showed a gradual decrease in dom content with the increase of soil depth fig 4 a to j eem spectra were divided into five regions corresponding to the type of om simple aromatic proteins and tyrosine like substances were assigned to regions i and ii ex 250 nm em 350 nm region iii ex 250 nm em 350 nm mainly consisted of fulvic acid like matter the soluble microbial products like and humic acid like substances were assigned to region iv ex 250 280 nm em 380 nm and region v ex 280 nm em 380 nm respectively marhuenda egea et al 2007 xing et al 2012 the eem spectra of dom extracted from both forest and wetland soil samples showed the presence of aromatic proteins fulvic acid like matter and humic acid like substances fig 4a to j two distinct peaks were detected in regions iii and v which weakened with soil depth indicating the presence of fulvic like and humic like organic substances in the topsoil 0 40 cm similarly the increasing silts and clays with increasing soil depth have less surface areas or pores available that may adsorb less humic acid like or fulvic acid like the decrease of soil particles and the increase of viscosity coefficient will prevent the downward migration of organic matter and reduce the survival rate of microorganisms the peak located in region i gradually decreased with the forest soil depth fig 4a to d which was mainly ascribed to the reduced metabolism of microorganisms in deep soil fig 2a and b in contrast the peaks in region i that were mainly assigned to microbial secretions ishii and boyer 2012 showed a negligible correlation at different depths of the wetland soil system fig 4e to j these findings further confirmed the presence of more active microbes in the deep wetland soils as compared to the forest soils additionally the higher water content of the wetland soils fig 1i contributed to the enhanced dom migration especially for small molecules more information about the dom components was extracted from parafac analysis of forest and wetland samples five fluorescent components characterized by ex em 220 320 430 nm component 1 c1 fig 4k 200 300 300 450 nm component 2 c2 fig 4l 250 500 nm component 3 c3 fig 4m 230 490 nm component 4 c4 fig 4n and 230 470 nm component 5 c5 fig 4o were identified by the eem parafac analysis the c1 was composed of some small molecular size compounds such as protein like materials including tryptophan like and tryosine like materials which had emission bands centered around 400 500 nm and 250 400 nm at an excitation peak around 230 nm or less jun et al 2014 hence the c1 resembled a humic like component mainly from terrestrial sources guéguen et al 2014 the c2 was composed of some small molecular size compounds such as protein like materials including tryptophan like and tryosine like materials with emission bands centered around 400 500 nm and 250 400 nm at an excitation peak around 230 nm or less ishii and boyer 2012 the c3 was classified as hydrophobic substances that belong to high molecular weight aromatic organic compounds with an excitation peak around 245 275 nm and an emission band centered around 450 520 nm ishii and boyer 2012 c4 is associated with humic like and fulvic like substances c5 was identified as humic like substances he et al 2014 murphy et al 2011 these results suggest that the dom of forest and wetland soils were terrestrial in origin and that dom migrated from forest soil to wetland soil in addition the sediment layer of the reservoir will also have the opportunity to migrate substantial amounts of organic matter to the wetland zone cole et al 2020 therefore wetland soil is the principal location for purifying exogenous organic matter and providing good quality water attributed principally to its abundant microbial diversity and appropriate c n fig 1c 2a and b several distinct and characteristic sharp stretching frequencies of different chemical groups were observed from atr ftir spectra for all samples fig 5 a and b based on previous literature gupta and garg 2009 jouraiphy et al 2005 lv et al 2013 the ftir characteristic peaks were assigned and incorporated to the main sharp stretching frequencies that relate to the biological activities involved and the corresponding functional groups was reported in the si supplementary table s3 lv et al 2013 the ftir spectra of all soil samples exhibited similar peaks at relative locations but varied in the relative intensity as reported in the si supplementary table s3 the main absorption bands were as follows 1 bands at 3407 3384 cm 1 were assigned to the o h stretching that was ascribed to the phenols and carboxylic groups lv et al 2013 2 characteristic peaks at 2931 2925 2854 cm 1 were assigned to the c h stretching which could be attributed to the biodegradation of fatty acids carbohydrates and other aliphatic groups gupta and garg 2009 3 peaks at 1655 1640 cm 1 were assigned to c o amide i carboxylates and c c aromatic ring modes alkenes bonds respectively li et al 2011 4 absorbance bands in the region of 1421 1410 cm 1 were caused by the carboxylic acids and amides iii that mainly belong to the coo and c n stretching li et al 2011 and 5 peaks at 1080 1030 cm 1 were assigned to the c o stretching which indicates the presence of polysaccharides or polysaccharide like substances abouelwafa et al 2008 these peaks further proved the degradation of soil organic matter together with the gradual decomposition of macromolecules in particular amide i or carboxylates c o aromatic rings or alkenes c c and polysaccharides c o stretching were found to be significantly higher in deep soils as compared to the shallow soils of both forest and wetland systems fig 5a and b sugars tend to be in linear chains and therefore may migrate more easily to deeper soils than the substances with a ring structure additionally a higher content of various functional groups was observed in forest soil compared to that of wetland soils fig 5a and b these findings might be attributed to the microbes that utilize the variety of nitrogen metabolism pathways more quickly in wetland systems than the forest soil systems fig 3a b and c the preliminary results based on the soil physicochemical properties microbial community characterization and ftir analysis can be divided into two soil layer regions above and below 40 cm depth figs 1 s3 s4 5a and 5b ft icr ms analysis was applied to further characterize the soluble dom in different soil layers and the halogenated products due to its ultrahigh resolution and mass accuracy zhang et al 2014 figs s5a and s5b show the ultrahigh resolution mass spectra of the two types of soil dom samples with the depth range of 0 40 cm and 40 100 cm and the nominal mass of the scan was adjusted from 200 to 800 m z the ft icr ms results showed that the nominal mass of forest and wetland soil dom samples were distributed in between 250 and 600 m z fig s5a and between 250 and 800 m z fig s5b respectively the signal peak of principal components of forest soil dom was found to be significantly greater than that of the wetland soil dom fig 5a and b these findings may be attributed to the fallen leaves that supply humus directly to the forest soil and the dilution of the dom concentration in the riparian wetland in addition microorganisms can also decompose om using a variety of nitrogen metabolic pathways in wetland soils fig 3d and e leading to a greater nominal mass distribution of dom than that of the forest soil system generally the chemical formula of natural organic matter was assigned to the groups containing cho chno chos or chnos chemical compositions song et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 in this study it was found that in the forest soil the proportion of cho groups decreased with depth while the percentage of chno chos and chnos groups increased with soil depth fig s5c the cho group arises substantially from plant leaves with a percentage content in the range of 43 to 72 song et al 2018 and forms a new chemical bond by replacing the c o in the aldehyde groups after microbial degradation however sulfur respiration microbes were undiscovered below 20 cm in the forest soil system fig 3a resulting in the increased content of chno cnos and chnos groups in the bottom layers of the forest soils in contrast the sulfur respiration and nitrate respiration microbes were found abundantly in the lower layers of the wetland soils fig 3c leading to a significantly decreased content of the chno cnos and chnos groups with increasing soil depth fig s5c the van krevelen vk diagrams also confirmed these effects in terms of the different bio chemical substances represented by the h c and o c values the regions in the diagrams mainly represent lipids o c 0 0 2 h c 1 7 2 2 proteins o c 0 2 0 6 h c 1 5 2 2 n c 0 05 lignin o c 0 1 0 6 h c 0 6 1 7 aimod 0 67 carbohydrates o c 0 6 1 2 h c 1 5 2 2 tannins o c 0 6 1 2 h c 0 5 1 5 ai mod 0 67 and unsaturated hydrocarbons o c 0 0 1 h c 0 7 1 5 hertkorn et al 2006 the ft icr ms results also showed that the soluble dom of forest soil consisted mainly of lignin especially in the 0 40 cm of soil depth fig 5a and b with microbial degradation the lignin skeletal structure gradually reduces to small organic substances which can move deeper into the soil by rainwater percolation interestingly the coh structure of the lignin was rarely found in the wetland soils fig 5d or f indicating more rapid oxidation of dom in the wetland soils as compared to that in the forest soil system the redox active functional groups phenolic hydroxyl carboxyl amides etc of the dom fimmen et al 2007 have been widely accepted as electron shuttles in environmental redox processes he et al 2019 previous studies have also shown that the electron transfer capacities etc of humic acids were significantly associated with their aromaticity functional groups and molecular weight zhu rui et al 2018 moreover the phenolic and quinone groups mainly control the electron donating capacity edc and electron accepting capacity eac respectively aeschbacher et al 2010 herzsprung et al 2012 scott et al 1998 in this study the eac was significantly greater than the edc fig 6 a and b indicating the riparian zone dom was mainly in an oxidized state in addition it was observed that the macro and small molecular substances of the dom were electron acceptors and donors respectively che et al 2020 these phenomena further demonstrated the incomplete humification of the humus within the soil layers which was also shown by the ft icr results fig 5c to 5f the maximum values of eac and edc were detected in the 40 60 cm depth zone fig 6a and b which was attributed to the degradation of polymer proteins and the polymerization of aromatic substances he et al 2019 the protein like substances degradation is ascribe to microbial degradation and which substances participated in organic matter polycondensation wu et al 2017 these findings further indicated the following two phenomena a high conversion rate of humus in deep soil layers and the inhibited migration of humus macromolecules below 60 cm due to the influence of soil particle size fig 6c and d therefore the 0 60 cm depth region of the riparian zones was a complex area of humus decomposition including macromolecules and small molecular decomposition while the riparian soil below 60 cm depth consisted principally of decomposed small molecules partial least squares path modeling pls pm was conducted to explore the relationships between soil depth physico and electro chemical properties bacterial community and the dom of soil physicochemical properties were found to be a dominant factor affecting the dom degradation for both forest and wetland soil systems however the electrochemical properties and bacterial community were the secondary factors for dom degradation fig 7 a d in particular all the factors showed an indirect effect on the dom degradation in the forest soil samples while the physicochemical properties directly affected the dom of wetland soil samples fig 7 hence the pls pm analysis proved that the soil physicochemical properties are the key to dom transformation which may also affect the metabolic rate of the microorganisms 4 conclusions the present study has revealed the changes in microbial community structure and functional potential in forest and wetland riparian zones the wetland riparian zone contains various biological metabolic pathways including sulfate carbonate and nitrate respiration in the biodegradation of dom however the main source of dom was that released from forest soil and this gradually decomposed during the process of migration to the wetland dom was produced mainly from the gradual decomposition of lignin where the aromatic and or aldehyde groups were gradually oxidized and degraded changes in physicochemical properties not only played a decisive role in the composition of the microbial populations but also transformed the

15519,intermittent voltage supply has been reported to improve the performance of electro assisted anaerobic digestion but has not been well understood in this study an intermittent voltage of 0 6 v 1 day on 1 day off was applied in an electro assisted anaerobic digester to explore its effects compared to those without the voltage the methane yield increased nearly by 20 0 and organic decomposition increased by 9 5 with the intermittent voltage which was similar to those with the continuous voltage the amide groups of the sludge protein after the electro treatment were polarized to enhance electron transfer and electron storage of protein like substances of the sludge although the voltage was supplied intermittently the increased conductivity and capacitance of the sludge and eps could effectively transport electrons between exoelectrogens and electrotrophs such as firmicutes and methanothrix to promote the anaerobic digestion this study explained the essence of electrochemical enhancement of anaerobic digestion from the perspective of molecular structure that is the polarization of functional groups by voltage could improve the sludge electro activity to maintain effective

data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is a sustainable and low carbon approach to recovering energy i e methane from the decomposition of organic wastes li et al 2019 luo et al 2020 ren et al 2018 however poor stability and slow methane yield of the anaerobic digestion affect its application in practice wang et al 2018 statistics show that over 2 3 of anaerobic digestion units across china have fallen into disuse due to the low operating efficiency wang et al 2021 interspecies electron transfer the key factor affecting anaerobic digestion performance provides a basic physiological link for anaerobic microorganisms to convert organic matters into energy wang et al 2021 traditionally interspecies hydrogen transfer iht is believed the main electron transfer pattern in anaerobic digestion in which h2 serving as the electron carrier is generated with acidogens from organic matter decomposition and consumed with methanogens for methane production baek et al 2018 zhao et al 2021a 2021b however the inefficient diffusion of hydrogen in kinetics and a quite low hydrogen partial pressure requirement in thermodynamics 10 4 10 5 atm make the digestion system susceptible to environmental conditions such as low ph high organic load rate and low temperature et al tezel et al 2011 extracellular electron transfer is an alternative

process yu et al 2018 and yu and zhang 2019 revealed that polarization of functional groups of sludge could accelerate extracellular electron transfer of microorganisms and improve the electro activity of sludge thus the direct electron exchange between exoelectrogens and electrotrophic methanogens is likely to be established with the bridge of the electro active sludge therefore the continuous voltage supply is not necessary for an electro assisted anaerobic digester if an intermittent voltage can develop the conductive sludge that supports efficient interspecies electron transfer accordingly many studies have reported that methane produced by reducing co2 via capturing cathodical electrons accounted for only a quite small proportion of total methane production zhang et al 2019 for example jiang et al 2022 found that the maximum methane yield obtained from the cathode reduction of carbon dioxide was only 0 13 0 33 of the total methane yield at the applied voltage zhao et al 2016 also found that cathodic reduction accounted for only 27 5 of the increase in methane production in mec treatment of anaerobic sludge digestion however up to now the reason for voltage enhancing the electro activity of anaerobic sludge remains unclear in this study a group of electro assisted anaerobic digesters was used to investigate the effects of an intermittent voltage on syntrophic metabolisms of microbial aggregations and anaerobic digestion performances the microbial community and electrochemical property of sludge aggregations with the intermittent and continuous voltage were compared to further explore the mechanism of this voltage supply mode we expect to deepen the understanding of the mechanism of the electro assisted anaerobic process and develop a more economical strategy to enhance anaerobic digestion 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates seed sludge was collected from an anaerobic digester of a municipal sludge treatment plant in dalian china the total suspended solid tss and volatile suspended solids vss of the seed sludge were 14 500 240 mg l and 10 150 110 mg l respectively a waste with a solid content of 15 composed of 33 of corn straw and 67 of cow manure was used as the model waste the tss vss and tcod of the waste were 98 000 240 mg l 62 000 110 mg l and 104 600 12 842 mg l respectively 2 2 reactor design a semi continuous experiment was conducted in two anaerobic reactors each with a working volume of 900 ml φ 10 0 cm 20 cm at 37 c for the reactor of the electro assisted group a carbon felt working area 375 cm3 and a carbon rod φ 0 8 cm 10 0 cm were used as the anode and cathode respectively and a voltage of 0 6 v was applied between the two electrodes the open circuit reactor the same as the electro assisted group but with no voltage supplied was used as the control group a rubber pipe was set on the top of the reactors for gas collection each reactor inoculated with 900 ml of seed sludge in advance was operated with a semi continuous feeding mode at a hydraulic retention time hrt of 30 days in other words 30 ml of waste was fed into the reactor each day to replace the same volume of the mixture inside the reactor before the operation the cap of each reactor was sealed with a gasket and the headspace of the reactors was all aerated with nitrogen for 30 min to ensure the anaerobic condition the schematic diagram and image of the reactor are shown in fig 1 in the first stage of the experiment 1 30 days the electro assisted group was operated with a continuous power supply in the second stage 31 55 days the electro assisted group was operated with an intermittent voltage mode namely powered on one day power off one day 1 day on and 1 day off particularly the voltage mode was only applied to the electro assisted group while the control was in a power off state throughout the experiment 2 3 analytical methods the gas produced in the reactors was collected with a sampling bag 500 ml delin china and the

890 usa method the concentrations of volatile fatty acids vfas in the effluent of the reactor were determined by a flame ionization detector fid tianmei gc 7900p fid china before the vfa and ethanol determination the samples were firstly centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min then filtered by a 0 22 μm filter membrane the ph value of effluent from the reactors was measured with a ph analyzer ub 10 usa 2 4 electrochemical characteristics cyclic voltammetry cv test was conducted to evaluate the electro activity of the sludge in the control and electro assisted group the sludge sample pretreatment method was documented in a previous study zhao et al 2020 in supporting information the conductivity of the sludge was measured by the three probe conductivity measurement method as reported previously li et al 2015 the sludge was taken from the bottom of each group of co fermentation reactors centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min before measurement and then washed three times with 0 1 mol l sodium chloride solution the measuring device consisted of two gold electrodes with a spacing of 0 5 mm an electrochemical workstation chenhua ch1030c china was used to apply a potential ramp to the one gold electrode as a working electrode and the other gold electrode was used as both the reference electrode and counter electrode so as to ensure that the potential applied was the same as the voltage between the working and countering electrode more detailed test methods are shown in the supporting information the electron donor capacity edc and electron acceptor capacity eac of eps of sludge were measured by chronoamperometry with an electrochemical workstation chenhua co ltd chi650b shanghai china aeschbacher et al 2010 the specific method is as follows for eac test the given potential of the working electrode was eh 0 49 v vs she firstly 25 ml of 1 m phosphate buffer solution was added to the reaction cell and then 520 µl 10 mm diquat dq solution was added to the reaction cell at this time the electrochemical workstation generated a reducing current when the current reached an equilibrium and no longer changes 1 ml eps sample was added the integral area of the resulting reduction current was the eac of eps the method for edc was similar except that the working electrode potential was changed to eh 0 61 v and oxidation reagent was replaced by 520 µl of 2 2 diazo 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ammonium salt diammonium salt abts solution 10 mm the pretreatment method used here was the same as the cv tests pretreatment above the electrochemical analysis methods are detailed in the supporting information 2 5 in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra the vibrational transition behaviors of the surface of the sludge during electrochemical reactions were characterized by electrochemical in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy rong et al 2008 yu et al 2015 a pt electrode φ 2 0 cm ag agcl electrode and pt sheet 15 15 0 1 mm was used as the working reference and counter electrode respectively a thin layer configuration equipped with a caf2 window was placed out of the infrared spectroscopy chamber in a vertical configuration sludge of the same quality was firstly scattered in 2 ml nafion solution and then a 200 μl mixture was coated on the surface of the working electrode then the electrodes were placed inside the infrared cell that was filled with 0 1 m 2h2o to avoid the dosage effect on the spectra the workstation chi 660 chenhua instrument china was used to control the potential of the working electrode shifting at a range of 0 8 v to 0 4 v the wavenumber range of ftir spectra was 500 4500 cm 1 and the spectra were subsequently analyzed with the omnic 8 0 software thermo nicolet 2 6 kinetic isotope effect kie test to examine the kie okamoto et al 2017 on current production anaerobic inoculated sludge in the same volume was taken from the reactor and coated on the surface of the working electrode glassy carbon electrode φ 0 5 cm for natural air drying the sludge samples used here were the same as the cv tests pretreatment above after n2 aeration for 15 min chronoamperometry was conducted with the potential of 0 3 v vs ag agcl applied on the working electrode as reported after all of the i t curves became stable 2h2o was added at a final concentration of 2 0 v v to observe the possible kinetic isotope effect on extracellular electron transfer the 2h of 2h2o added could replace 1h to slow down the electron transfer rate and results in a drop in current in other words the current drop with the addition of 2h2o indicated that the proton coupled electron transfer pcet accounted for a larger proportion in the electron transfer of sludge therefore 2h2o was added to evaluate the proton coupled electron transfer by observing the kinetic isotope effect kie of the sludge which was a recognized method to evaluate pect 2 7 microbial community analysis after the 30 day and 55 day experiments sludge samples from anode biofilms on the surface of the electrodes of the control and electro assisted group were frozen and stored at 80 respectively then microbial community composition was analyzed by high throughput 16srrna pyrosequencing the detailed methods for high throughput sequencing are provided in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of anaerobic digestion after a 30 day continuous voltage the electro assisted group was operated with the intermittent power supply 1 day power and 1 day off to investigate the effects of the voltage supply mode in the continuous voltage stage the average methane yield of the electro assisted group 417 91 1 ml d n 30 fig 2 was 25 6 higher than that of the control group 337 64 1 ml d n 30 in the intermittently powered stage the methane production of the electro assisted group showed a slight decrease but its average methane production 372 39 2 ml d n 25 was about 20 higher than that of the control group 312 26 3 ml d n 25 it indicated that the intermittent voltage of one day power off still significantly improved the methanogenesis in an electro assisted system the cathodic methane production of the electro assisted group was calculated according to the current shown in table 1 even if the electrons from the cathodic current were completely used to reduce carbon dioxide for methanogenesis the cathodic methane production only accounts for 0 42 of methane production in the continuously powered stage and 0 28 in the intermittently powered stage this result was in agreement with the previous reports that the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide was negligible jiang et al 2022 which was not the main reason for the increased methane production in the electro assisted group consistently the removal of organics was in agreement with the methane yield during the initial 30 days the cod and vss removal rates of the electro assisted group averaged 60 2 6 3 fig 3 a and 63 7 4 8 fig 3b respectively which were higher than those of the control 47 9 8 7 and 48 4 2 3 respectively in the intermittently powered stage the cod 55 3 9 0 and vss removal 54 8 2 3 of the electro assisted group were still higher than that of the control group 45 8 8 9 for cod removal and 48 4 2 3 for vss removal respectively the results showed that even though the voltage was supplied intermittently the electro assisted group still had the more efficient syntrophic metabolism to promote anaerobic digestion 3 2 microbial community analysis microbial community analysis after the experiment is shown in fig 4 a methanothrix a type of electrotrophic microorganisms capable of accepting electrons from exoelectrogenic microorganisms to reduce co2 to ch4 via diet holmes et al 2017 was the dominant genus in the sludge aggregates of the control group and electro assisted group particularly methanothrix accounted for 74 3 of the archaea communities of the electro assisted group higher than that of the control group 69 7 meanwhile the abundance of firmicutes of sludge in the electro assisted group was 15 4 higher than that of the control group 12 2 fig 4b firmicutes were capable of generating electrons from the oxidation of organics and transferring electrons to the conductive materials lu et al 2012 which could serve as the electron source for the eet of methanothrix in this way exoelectrogens firmicutes and methanothrix likely established diet with the assistance of the intermittent voltage compared with the increased methane yield increased by 19 2 the enrichment of electro active microorganisms was less increased by 3 2 for firmicutes and 4 6 for methanothrix together with the results in methane yield and organic removal the promoted iet might be a factor for the enhancement of anaerobic digestion with electro assistance 3 3 electrochemical characteristics of the sludge after the continuously powered stage day 1 30 the conductivity of the sludge fig 5 a taken from the electro assisted group 6 37 0 20 µs cm was 2 36 times that of the control group 2 70 0 18 µs cm in the intermittently powered stage day 31 55 the conductivity of the electro assisted group slightly increased to 6 67 0 14 µs cm which was still significantly higher than that of the control 2 56 0 36 µs cm cv tests also showed that the sludge aggregations of the electro assisted group 2 10 10 3 f in the continuously powered stage and 1 41 10 3 f in the intermittently powered stage were higher than that of the control group in the entire experimental stage 1 36 10 3 f in continuously powered stage and 1 22 10 3 f in intermittently powered stage fig 5b and c the increase of conductivity and capacitance represented the higher electron transfer rate and storage capacity of the sludge the electron acceptor capacity eac and electron donator capacity edc of the eps were detected to evaluate the amount of oxidation and reduction groups involved in eet wan et al 2021 zhao et al 2021a 2021b as shown in fig 6 in the continuously powered stage the eac and edc of the sludge in the electro assisted group were about 2 21 fold and 1 75 fold of the control group respectively in the intermittently powered stage the eac and edc of the sludge in the electro assisted group were 1 72 fold and 1 56 fold of the control group respectively therefore the increased electron exchanging capacity with the electro assistance benefited the eet in the syntrophic metabolisms particularly the electro activity of the eps was maintained even under the intermittent voltage supply to promote iet for methane production 3 4 molecular biological mechanisms with the intermittent voltage the sludge was further identified by electrochemical in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to observe the possible responses of functional groups in the sludge to electrical signals at the molecular level ye et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 for the sludge of the electro assisted group the intensities of the bands around 1550 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn in amide ii and 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of the c o group in the amide i increased with the potential shifting from 0 8 v to 0 4 v which was the result of the polarization of c n and c o in amide groups liu et al 2021 the polarizability was reported to be positively related to the relative permittivity that indicated the capacitance of the material dubois et al 2004 therefore the polarization of amide groups indicated that the capacitance of amide groups increased with the voltage which was consistent with the cv results of the sludge fig 5 while the intensity of the amide groups in the control group showed little changes with the test potential in agreement with the lower capacitance of the sludge of control fig 5 amide groups serve as an essential participant in biochemical redox reactions in which electron transfer is always accompanied by proton motions namely proton coupled electron transfer pcet bak and elliott 2013 chen et al 2014 mayer 2004 typically c o in amide group could capture the released h radicals from some protonated side chains of amino acids such as lysine to form c o h chen et al 2014 with the breaking and recombination of the h bonds in amide groups side chains and waters electrons were transferred along with the peptide skeleton and amino side chains to complete a long range transport hammes schiffer 2006 muhlbauer et al 2020 the polarization of c n and c o in amide groups meant that more electrons around n and o atoms in higher energy states were more likely to participate in pcet yu and zhang 2019 therefore compared with the inert response of amide groups in the control group to the electrical signals the polarized amide groups in the electro assisted group could support an efficient eet in the sludge via pcet considering that amide groups are widespread in cell envelopes and eps the polarized amide groups might be the main reason for the increased electro activity in the sludge and eps although slightly inferior to continuously applied voltage the intermittent voltage could still effectively improve the dielectric property and promote the electron transfer of the amide groups of sludge fig 7 therefore the polarization of the amide groups was the reason for the significantly increased capacitance and conductivity of the sludge with the voltage supply continuously and intermittently which benefited the eet to enhance methane production the 1h 2h kinetic isotope effect kie can describe the change in the rate of proton coupled or h atom coupled electron transfer by substituting 1h atom for 2h atom in a reactant fukuzumi et al 2021 limbach et al 2004 zhang and burgess 2012 kie tests were performed to investigate the effect of the voltage on the electron transfer processes of the sludge as shown in fig 8 the current of the electro assisted group was higher than that of the control group before the addition of deuterated water 2h2o the current of the electro assisted group in the continuously and intermittently powered stage was 1 67 fold and 1 23 fold of the current of the control group respectively which was consistent with the higher conductivity of the sludge of the electro assisted group fig 5a after the addition of deuterated water the current of the electro assisted group quickly decreased and finally stabilized at a lower level compared with the current before adding deuterated water the current profile of the control group was similar to that of the electro assisted group but its final stable current was almost at the same level as the initial current before the addition of deuterated water with the addition of 2h2o the higher mass of 2h inevitably slowed down the electron transfer rate resulting in the current decrease zhang and burgess 2012 therefore a more decline in the current of the electro assisted group showed that the electron transfer was more easily to be influenced by atom mass of proton it also indicated that h atom coupled electron transfer accounted for a larger proportion in the electron transfer of sludge the result suggested that the electron transfer pathway was smoother in the electro assisted group after the continuous or intermittent electro treatment it also indicated that the intermittent voltage supply effectively strengthened diet to promote anaerobic digestion 3 5 implications extracellular electron transfer eet provides a potential way to establish efficient interspecies electron transfer syntrophic metabolism to promote anaerobic digestion in general the enrichment of electroactive microorganisms is an important reason for the enhanced eet and electro assisted anaerobic systems however the abundance of electrotrophs increased only by a small level with the voltage applied in this study which did not meet the higher methane production and organic matter removal the electro treated sludge still showed significant improvement in capacitance or conductivity and the increased electro activity of the eps further verified that the changes in the microbial community were not the main reason for the increase in the sludge electro activity interestingly the polarity of the amide groups showed a positive response to electrical signals in the electro treated sludge which improved the capacitance of amide groups and benefited the proton coupled electron transfer pcet along with the protein like substances kie tests of the sludge furtherly verified the promotion of the electron transfer in the sludge therefore the polarization of amide groups was non negligible to the effects of bes ad that promote the eet and iet processes in anaerobic digestion on the whole the methane yield and organic removal in the intermittently powered stage were similar to that in the continuously powered stage notably the changes in polarity of amide groups were consistent with the continuous electro treatment and the intermittent voltage supply could polarize the functional groups in the sludge and did not decrease the electro activity of the sludge which still enabled the efficient eet to promote the anaerobic digestion the duration of intermittent energization the duration of a cycle and the proliferation of conductive sludge need to be further investigated in future studies 4 conclusion appling intermittent voltage significantly improved the methane production of anaerobic digestion which was similar to the effect of continuously applied voltage but with only half energy consumption consistently electro driven methane production just accounted for a small proportion of total methane production both intermittently and continuously applied voltage effectively improved the electro activity of sludge such as the charge discharge capacity and conductivity which benefited the diet and methane production the intermittent application of voltage could polarize the functional groups of the sludge and increase their electro activity to make the electron transfer smoother meanwhile exoelectrogens and electrotrophs such as firmicutes and methanothrix were enriched by intermittent power which accelerated the decomposition of substrates and methane production author contributions experiments were conceived and designed by lujun wang qilin yu and yaobin zhang

15519,intermittent voltage supply has been reported to improve the performance of electro assisted anaerobic digestion but has not been well understood in this study an intermittent voltage of 0 6 v 1 day on 1 day off was applied in an electro assisted anaerobic digester to explore its effects compared to those without the voltage the methane yield increased nearly by 20 0 and organic decomposition increased by 9 5 with the intermittent voltage which was similar to those with the continuous voltage the amide groups of the sludge protein after the electro treatment were polarized to enhance electron transfer and electron storage of protein like substances of the sludge although the voltage was supplied intermittently the increased conductivity and capacitance of the sludge and eps could effectively transport electrons between exoelectrogens and electrotrophs such as firmicutes and methanothrix to promote the anaerobic digestion this study explained the essence of electrochemical enhancement of anaerobic digestion from the perspective of molecular structure that is the polarization of functional groups by voltage could improve the sludge electro activity to maintain effective

data will be made available on request 1 introduction anaerobic digestion is a sustainable and low carbon approach to recovering energy i e methane from the decomposition of organic wastes li et al 2019 luo et al 2020 ren et al 2018 however poor stability and slow methane yield of the anaerobic digestion affect its application in practice wang et al 2018 statistics show that over 2 3 of anaerobic digestion units across china have fallen into disuse due to the low operating efficiency wang et al 2021 interspecies electron transfer the key factor affecting anaerobic digestion performance provides a basic physiological link for anaerobic microorganisms to convert organic matters into energy wang et al 2021 traditionally interspecies hydrogen transfer iht is believed the main electron transfer pattern in anaerobic digestion in which h2 serving as the electron carrier is generated with acidogens from organic matter decomposition and consumed with methanogens for methane production baek et al 2018 zhao et al 2021a 2021b however the inefficient diffusion of hydrogen in kinetics and a quite low hydrogen partial pressure requirement in thermodynamics 10 4 10 5

resulting reduction current was the eac of eps the method for edc was similar except that the working electrode potential was changed to eh 0 61 v and oxidation reagent was replaced by 520 µl of 2 2 diazo 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ammonium salt diammonium salt abts solution 10 mm the pretreatment method used here was the same as the cv tests pretreatment above the electrochemical analysis methods are detailed in the supporting information 2 5 in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir spectra the vibrational transition behaviors of the surface of the sludge during electrochemical reactions were characterized by electrochemical in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy rong et al 2008 yu et al 2015 a pt electrode φ 2 0 cm ag agcl electrode and pt sheet 15 15 0 1 mm was used as the working reference and counter electrode respectively a thin layer configuration equipped with a caf2 window was placed out of the infrared spectroscopy chamber in a vertical configuration sludge of the same quality was firstly scattered in 2 ml nafion solution and then a 200 μl mixture was coated on the surface of the working electrode then the electrodes were placed inside the infrared cell that was filled with 0 1 m 2h2o to avoid the dosage effect on the spectra the workstation chi 660 chenhua instrument china was used to control the potential of the working electrode shifting at a range of 0 8 v to 0 4 v the wavenumber range of ftir spectra was 500 4500 cm 1 and the spectra were subsequently analyzed with the omnic 8 0 software thermo nicolet 2 6 kinetic isotope effect kie test to examine the kie okamoto et al 2017 on current production anaerobic inoculated sludge in the same volume was taken from the reactor and coated on the surface of the working electrode glassy carbon electrode φ 0 5 cm for natural air drying the sludge samples used here were the same as the cv tests pretreatment above after n2 aeration for 15 min chronoamperometry was conducted with the potential of 0 3 v vs ag agcl applied on the working electrode as reported after all of the i t curves became stable 2h2o was added at a final concentration of 2 0 v v to observe the possible kinetic isotope effect on extracellular electron transfer the 2h of 2h2o added could replace 1h to slow down the electron transfer rate and results in a drop in current in other words the current drop with the addition of 2h2o indicated that the proton coupled electron transfer pcet accounted for a larger proportion in the electron transfer of sludge therefore 2h2o was added to evaluate the proton coupled electron transfer by observing the kinetic isotope effect kie of the sludge which was a recognized method to evaluate pect 2 7 microbial community analysis after the 30 day and 55 day experiments sludge samples from anode biofilms on the surface of the electrodes of the control and electro assisted group were frozen and stored at 80 respectively then microbial community composition was analyzed by high throughput 16srrna pyrosequencing the detailed methods for high throughput sequencing are provided in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of anaerobic digestion after a 30 day continuous voltage the electro assisted group was operated with the intermittent power supply 1 day power and 1 day off to investigate the effects of the voltage supply mode in the continuous voltage stage the average methane yield of the electro assisted group 417 91 1 ml d n 30 fig 2 was 25 6 higher than that of the control group 337 64 1 ml d n 30 in the intermittently powered stage the methane production of the electro assisted group showed a slight decrease but its average methane production 372 39 2 ml d n 25 was about 20 higher than that of the control group 312 26 3 ml d n 25 it indicated that the intermittent voltage of one day power off still significantly improved the methanogenesis in an electro assisted system the cathodic methane production of the electro assisted group was calculated according to the current shown in table 1 even if the electrons from the cathodic current were completely used to reduce carbon dioxide for methanogenesis the cathodic methane production only accounts for 0 42 of methane production in the continuously powered stage and 0 28 in the intermittently powered stage this result was in agreement with the previous reports that the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide was negligible jiang et al 2022 which was not the main reason for the increased methane production in the electro assisted group consistently the removal of organics was in agreement with the methane yield during the initial 30 days the cod and vss removal rates of the electro assisted group averaged 60 2 6 3 fig 3 a and 63 7 4 8 fig 3b respectively which were higher than those of the control 47 9 8 7 and 48 4 2 3 respectively in the intermittently powered stage the cod 55 3 9 0 and vss removal 54 8 2 3 of the electro assisted group were still higher than that of the control group 45 8 8 9 for cod removal and 48 4 2 3 for vss removal respectively the results showed that even though the voltage was supplied intermittently the electro assisted group still had the more efficient syntrophic metabolism to promote anaerobic digestion 3 2 microbial community analysis microbial community analysis after the experiment is shown in fig 4 a methanothrix a type of electrotrophic microorganisms capable of accepting electrons from exoelectrogenic microorganisms to reduce co2 to ch4 via diet holmes et al 2017 was the dominant genus in the sludge aggregates of the control group and electro assisted group particularly methanothrix accounted for 74 3 of the archaea communities of the electro assisted group higher than that of the control group 69 7 meanwhile the abundance of firmicutes of sludge in the electro assisted group was 15 4 higher than that of the control group 12 2 fig 4b firmicutes were capable of generating electrons from the oxidation of organics and transferring electrons to the conductive materials lu et al 2012 which could serve as the electron source for the eet of methanothrix in this way exoelectrogens firmicutes and methanothrix likely established diet with the assistance of the intermittent voltage compared with the increased methane yield increased by 19 2 the enrichment of electro active microorganisms was less increased by 3 2 for firmicutes and 4 6 for methanothrix together with the results in methane yield and organic removal the promoted iet might be a factor for the enhancement of anaerobic digestion with electro assistance 3 3 electrochemical characteristics of the sludge after the continuously powered stage day 1 30 the conductivity of the sludge fig 5 a taken from the electro assisted group 6 37 0 20 µs cm was 2 36 times that of the control group 2 70 0 18 µs cm in the intermittently powered stage day 31 55 the conductivity of the electro assisted group slightly increased to 6 67 0 14 µs cm which was still significantly higher than that of the control 2 56 0 36 µs cm cv tests also showed that the sludge aggregations of the electro assisted group 2 10 10 3 f in the continuously powered stage and 1 41 10 3 f in the intermittently powered stage were higher than that of the control group in the entire experimental stage 1 36 10 3 f in continuously powered stage and 1 22 10 3 f in intermittently powered stage fig 5b and c the increase of conductivity and capacitance represented the higher electron transfer rate and storage capacity of the sludge the electron acceptor capacity eac and electron donator capacity edc of the eps were detected to evaluate the amount of oxidation and reduction groups involved in eet wan et al 2021 zhao et al 2021a 2021b as shown in fig 6 in the continuously powered stage the eac and edc of the sludge in the electro assisted group were about 2 21 fold and 1 75 fold of the control group respectively in the intermittently powered stage the eac and edc of the sludge in the electro assisted group were 1 72 fold and 1 56 fold of the control group respectively therefore the increased electron exchanging capacity with the electro assistance benefited the eet in the syntrophic metabolisms particularly the electro activity of the eps was maintained even under the intermittent voltage supply to promote iet for methane production 3 4 molecular biological mechanisms with the intermittent voltage the sludge was further identified by electrochemical in situ fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir to observe the possible responses of functional groups in the sludge to electrical signals at the molecular level ye et al 2018 as shown in fig 7 for the sludge of the electro assisted group the intensities of the bands around 1550 cm 1 stretching vibration of cn in amide ii and 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of the c o group in the amide i increased with the potential shifting from 0 8 v to 0 4 v which was the result of the polarization of c n and c o in amide groups liu et al 2021 the polarizability was reported to be positively related to the relative permittivity that indicated the capacitance of the material dubois et al 2004 therefore the polarization of amide groups indicated that the capacitance of amide groups increased with the voltage which was consistent with the cv results of the sludge fig 5 while the intensity of the amide groups in the control group showed little changes with the test potential in agreement with the lower capacitance of the sludge of control fig 5 amide groups serve as an essential participant in biochemical redox reactions in which electron transfer is always accompanied by proton motions namely proton coupled electron transfer pcet bak and elliott 2013 chen et al 2014 mayer 2004 typically c o in amide group could capture the released h radicals from some protonated side chains of amino acids such as lysine to form c o h chen et al 2014 with the breaking and recombination of the h bonds in amide groups side chains and waters electrons were transferred along with the peptide skeleton and amino side chains to complete a long range transport hammes schiffer 2006 muhlbauer et al 2020 the polarization of c n and c o in amide groups meant that more electrons around n and o atoms in higher energy states were more likely to participate in pcet yu and zhang 2019 therefore compared with the inert response of amide groups in the control group to the electrical signals the polarized amide groups in the electro assisted group could support an efficient eet in the sludge via pcet considering that amide groups are widespread in cell envelopes and eps the polarized amide groups might be the main reason for the increased electro activity in the sludge and eps although slightly inferior to continuously applied voltage the intermittent voltage could still effectively improve the dielectric property and promote the electron transfer of the amide groups of sludge fig 7 therefore the polarization of the amide groups was the reason for the significantly increased capacitance and conductivity of the sludge with the voltage supply continuously and intermittently which benefited the eet to enhance methane production the 1h 2h kinetic isotope effect kie can describe the change in the rate of proton coupled or h atom coupled electron transfer by substituting 1h atom for 2h atom in a reactant fukuzumi et al 2021 limbach et al 2004 zhang and burgess 2012 kie tests were performed to investigate the effect of the voltage on the electron transfer processes of the sludge as shown in fig 8 the current of the electro assisted group was higher than that of the control group before the addition of deuterated water 2h2o the current of the electro assisted group in the continuously and intermittently powered stage was 1 67 fold and 1 23 fold of the current of the control group respectively which was consistent with the higher conductivity of the sludge of the electro assisted group fig 5a after the addition of deuterated water the current of the electro assisted group quickly decreased and finally stabilized at a lower level compared with the current before adding deuterated water the current profile of the control group was similar to that of the electro assisted group but its final stable current was almost at the same level as the initial current before the addition of deuterated water with the addition of 2h2o the higher mass of 2h inevitably slowed down the electron transfer rate resulting in the current decrease zhang and burgess 2012 therefore a more decline in the current of the electro assisted group showed that the electron transfer was more easily to be influenced by atom mass of proton it also indicated that h atom coupled electron transfer accounted for a larger proportion in the electron transfer of sludge the result suggested that the electron transfer pathway was smoother in the electro assisted group after the continuous or intermittent electro treatment it also indicated that the intermittent voltage supply effectively strengthened diet to promote anaerobic digestion 3 5 implications extracellular electron transfer eet provides a potential way to establish efficient interspecies electron transfer syntrophic metabolism to promote anaerobic digestion in general the enrichment of electroactive microorganisms is an important reason for the enhanced eet and electro assisted anaerobic systems however the abundance of electrotrophs increased only by a small level with the voltage applied in this study which did not meet the higher methane production and organic matter removal the electro treated sludge still showed significant improvement in capacitance or conductivity and the increased electro activity of the eps further verified that the changes in the microbial community were not the main reason for the increase in the sludge electro activity interestingly the polarity of the amide groups showed a positive response to electrical signals in the electro treated sludge which improved the capacitance of amide groups and benefited the proton coupled electron transfer pcet along with the protein like substances kie tests of the sludge furtherly verified the promotion of the electron transfer in the sludge therefore the polarization of amide groups was non negligible to the effects of bes ad that promote the eet and iet processes in anaerobic digestion on the whole the methane yield and organic removal in the intermittently powered stage were similar to that in the continuously powered stage notably the changes in polarity of amide groups were consistent with the continuous electro treatment and the intermittent voltage supply could polarize the functional groups in the sludge and did not decrease the electro activity of the sludge which still enabled the efficient eet to promote the anaerobic digestion the duration of intermittent energization the duration of a cycle and the proliferation of conductive sludge need to be further investigated in future studies 4 conclusion appling intermittent voltage significantly improved the methane production of anaerobic digestion which was similar to the effect of continuously applied voltage but with only half energy consumption consistently electro driven methane production just accounted for a small proportion of total methane production both intermittently and continuously applied voltage effectively improved the electro activity of sludge such as the charge discharge capacity and conductivity which benefited the diet and methane production the intermittent application of voltage could polarize the functional groups of the sludge and increase their electro activity to make the electron transfer smoother meanwhile exoelectrogens and electrotrophs such as firmicutes and methanothrix were enriched by intermittent power which accelerated the decomposition of substrates and methane production author contributions experiments were conceived and designed by lujun wang qilin yu and yaobin zhang
