17755,water is often chlorinated to protect public health but chlorination causes harmful disinfection byproducts to form currently available in vitro assays generally determine non volatile disinfection byproduct nvdbp toxicities because of the limitation of pretreatments used but chemical analyses and regulations are focused on volatile disinfection byproducts vdbps such as trihalomethanes the gap of vdbp toxicities have been of concern for some time in this study we extracted vdbps from two chlorinated effluent organic matters and one chlorinated natural organic matter using a helium aeration liquid nitrogen condensation system and systematically assessed the vdbp and nvdbp toxicities to mammalian cells vdbps accounted for 10 20 of the total organic halogen concentrations in three chlorinated water samples vdbps were much less cytotoxic caused fewer dna double strand breaks induced less reactive oxygen species and dna rna oxidative damage marker of 8 hydroxyl deoxy guanosine in cells than did nvdbps moreover by collecting the vdbps toxicity measurement of the full range of dbps was achieved cytotoxicity reactive oxygen species and 8 hydroxyl deoxy guanosine levels were significantly higher for cells exposed to the mixture of vdbps and nvdbps than only nvdbps but not by large percentages 20 30 for cytotoxicity suggesting nvdbps mainly contributed to the toxicity of chlorinated water our study suggested that future research should focus more on nvdbp toxicity and identifying toxicity drivers from nvdbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorination volatile dbps additive dbp mixture cytotoxicity genotoxicity 1 introduction chlorinating drinking water and wastewater to inactivate pathogens offers great public health benefits and strongly limits water borne diseases however chlorination causes disinfection byproducts dbps to form which are resulted from the reaction between chlorine and natural organic matter nom in drinking water or effluent organic matter efom in wastewater hu et al 2016 qu et al 2019 dong et al 2019 these dbps would pose risks to human health c m li et al 2016 sedlak and von gunten 2011 epidemiological investigation showed that the risk of bladder cancer increased with long term dbp exposure villanueva et al 2004 there is evidence from in vivo assays that 22 dbps are carcinogenic richardson et al 2007 and in in vitro assays using mammalian cells demonstrated more than 100 dbps were cytotoxic and genotoxic plewa et al 2017 in vitro toxicity assays are convenient and commonly used to evaluate the risks posed by chlorinated water bhuvaneshwari et al 2019 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2014 dbps are found at relatively low concentration in water so dbps in a sample usually need to be enriched to allow any potential toxic effects to be identified currently in vitro dbp toxicity assays involve enriching the dbps by performing a pretreatment e g solid phase extraction spe or liquid liquid extraction lle du et al 2018 yang et al 2014 however such pretreatment methods only retain non volatile dbps nvdbps volatile dbps vdbps are inevitably lost when the organic solvents e g acetone methanol or methyl tert butyl ether used in the pretreatment are removed the limitations of currently used pretreatment methods mean vdbp toxicities are not understood and are of concern li and mitch 2018 moreover the loss of vdbps might lead to the underestimation of the overall toxicities the dbps that were first identified were vdbps such as trihalomethanes thms concentrations of these vdbps are regulated by many countries and international organizations european council 1998 usepa 2006 studies of dbps usually involved detecting vdbps such as thms haloketones haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes by gas chromatography because of the convenience of performing such measurements beauchamp et al 2018 szczuka et al 2017 most epidemiological studies and risk assessments of dbps have been based on exposure to vdbp data nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009 thiriat et al 2009 however recent in vitro assays using chinese hamster ovary cho cells have indicated that thms are several orders of magnitude less cytotoxic than nvdbps such as halobenzoquinone and aromatic halogenated dbps prochazka et al 2015 2019 a significant correlation between the consumption of drinking water with relatively high thm concentrations 50 μg l and bladder cancer was found in an epidemiological study but the 95 confidence interval on the odds ratio was close to the statistical significance level costet et al 2001 implying the volatile thms might not be the risk drivers richardson and plewa 2020 therefore there have been a long standing contradiction in dbp studies that chemical analysis and regulations focus more on volatile dbps while toxicity assays generally evaluate the non volatile ones plewa and wagner 2015 richardson and plewa 2020 toxicological research on dbps should point out which dbp fraction vdbps or nvdbps needs specific focus and identify the toxicity drivers among the fraction with higher risk li and mitch 2018 thus comparing the toxicity of volatile dbps and non volatile dbps is needed recently a method for capturing vdbps suitable for in vitro toxicity assay was proposed by stalter et al 2016 who used liquid nitrogen to condense the vdbps that were blown off by helium based on this stalter et al 2016 also gave a discussion on the toxicity of tap waters finding that compared with nvdbps vdbps were generally more toxic to luminescent bacteria but induced less oxidative stress in the arec32 reporter gene assay because mammalian cells were closely related to human beings and widely used to evaluate the toxicity of dbps plewa et al 2008a b wagner and plewa 2017 it is necessary to systematically evaluate and distinguish the toxicity of vdbps and nvdbps to mammalian cells moreover by collecting the vdbps there is an opportunity to reveal the toxicity of the mixtures of vdbps and nvdbps additive dbps adbps which has bothered researchers for a long time lau et al 2020 stalter et al 2020 the aim of the study was to improve our understanding of the toxicities to mammalian cells of vdbps nvdbps and adbps produced through chlorination of natural organic matter nom and wastewater effluent organic matter efom the formation of vdbps and nvdbps was characterized cytotoxicity genotoxicity oxidative stress and dna rna oxidative damage caused by dbps were assessed using chinese hamster ovary cho cells 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the chemicals and reagents used are described in text s1 in supplementary information si 2 2 water sample preparation and water quality analysis the efom a and efom b samples were effluent organic matter in secondary effluent collected from municipal wastewater treatment plants a and b respectively both wastewater treatment plants were in shenzhen china and used aerobic anoxic oxic processes simulated drinking water was prepared by dissolving nom 2r101 purchased from the international humic substances society to give a carbon concentration of 5 0 mg l in ultrapure water containing nahco3 at a concentration in terms of caco3 of 90 mg l as described previously han and zhang 2018 each water sample was passed through a 0 45 μm microfilter and then stored at 4 c until it was used water quality parameters the dissolved organic carbon concentration uv absorbance ammonia nitrogen concentration and ph were determined as described previously du et al 2018 wu et al 2020 and the results are shown in table s2 2 3 chlorination and quenching the ph of each filtered water sample was adjusted to 7 00 0 05 by adding h2so4 or naoh then 6 l of the sample was chlorinated using naclo at a chlorine concentration of 10 mg l in a well sealed 6 l glass bottle for 24 h in the dark the residual chlorine was then quenched by adding 105 of the stoichiometrically required amount of 1 0 mol l sodium thiosulfate stalter et al 2016 the chlorine residual was determined by a hi 93711 chlorine analyzer hanna italy 2 4 vdbp and nvdbp extraction a vdbp extraction system was adapted from stalter et al 2016 and the schematic of the vdbp extraction system is shown in fig s1 the aeration and coldtrap systems in the vdbp extraction system were connected using a condenser pipe filled with flowing water at 0 2 c once the vdbps had been blown off the water vapor was condensed in a condenser tube that the vdbps could pass through to enter the coldtrap the coldtrap which consisted of an inner glass tube and an outer glass tube was submerged in liquid nitrogen the outer tube was filled with crushed ice when recovery tests were performed or crushed freezing culture medium when the toxicity assays were performed to provide condensation nuclei for the vdbps the vdbps in 5 l of chlorinated water were concentrated into 18 ml of ultrapure water or cell culture medium and then diluted to 20 ml with ultrapure water or cell culture medium to give a concentration factor of 250 the vdbp capture procedure is described in more detail in text s2 the recoveries achieved using the vdbp extraction system and the vdbp evaporation rates in the incubator were determined as described in text s3 once the chlorinated water had been aerated the remaining nvdbps were concentrated using a previously described spe procedure du et al 2017 each oasis hlb spe cartridge waters milford ma usa was activated by passing 10 ml of methanol and then 10 ml of ultrapure water through a water sample was adjusted to ph 2 00 0 05 by adding 2 mol l h2so4 then was passed through an activated oasis hlb spe cartridge at a flow rate of 5 ml min the sorbent in the cartridge was dried by passing nitrogen through then methanol 5 ml acetone 2 ml and dichloromethane 2 ml were passed through in sequence to elute the dbps eluent was then evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen to avoid the oxidation of dbps by air and then the extracts were stored at 4 c 2 5 determining individual dbp and tox concentrations individual dbps were concentrated by performing liquid liquid extractions lle then were analyzed using a 7890b gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the lle method and gas chromatography electron capture detector conditions are described in text s4 the total organic halogen tox concentrations of nvdbps were determined using a 250 ml aerated water sample pretreated by the spe method described above the extracted nvdbps were dissolved in ultrapure water then the solution was placed in a sealed quartz tube and irradiated with light at wavelengths of 185 nm produced by 12 w vacuum uv lamps as described by bu et al 2018 this converted organic halogen into inorganic halide ions light at a wavelength of 254 nm provided by a 11 w low pressure mercury lamp was used to reduce bromate if organic bromine was transformed into bromate during the vacuum uv irradiation process vdbps captured using the cold trap system were directly transferred to the quartz tube and irradiated because these vdbps would not have contained any inorganic halides the concentrations of chloride and bromide ions generated in the irradiation process were determined using an ics 900 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the tox concentration was defined as the difference between the halide concentrations before and after irradiation to avoid any error caused by the spe cartridge retaining trace quantities of halides 2 6 sample preparation for the toxicity assays the nvdbps that had been concentrated from a sample by spe were dissolved in a 1 1 mixture of dulbecco s modified eagle medium and f 12 dmem f12 thermo fisher scientific containing 0 5 v v dimethyl sulfoxide dmso to achieve the desired concentration factor vdbps were captured in dmem f12 containing 0 5 dmso in the coldtrap the maximum concentration factor was 250 the adbps were prepared by mixing nvdbps and vdbps at the same concentration factor 2 7 cell culture the cho k1 cell line was purchased from the american type culture collection the cells were cultured in dmem f 12 supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum thermo fisher scientific 100 u ml penicillin g and 100 μg ml streptomycin thermo fisher scientific the culture dishes were placed in a sterile incubator with a 5 co2 atmosphere and at a high humidity at 37 c the cells were passaged every second day cells that had undergone two five passages were used in the toxicity assays 2 8 cytotoxicity assay and cti calculation cytotoxicity was measured using a cell counting kit 8 dojindo kumamoto japan the reagent 2 2 methoxy 4 nitrophenyl 3 4 nitrophenyl 5 2 4 disulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium monosodium salt in the kit was reduced to yellow orange formazan crystals by dehydrogenase in mitochondria absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a spectramax i3 microplate reader molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa absorbance at 450 nm was proportional to the number of viable cells catauro et al 2014 a phenol solution in dmem f 12 medium containing 0 5 dmso was used as a reference solution to allow the cytotoxicity equivalent to be calculated cells were exposed to a sample for 6 h six replicates of each test were performed the cytotoxicity assay and cytotoxicity equivalent calculation methods are described in detail in text s5 the cytotoxicity indices ctis for the dbps that were determined were calculated using median lethal concentration lc50 m 1 values determined previously by performing cho cytotoxicity assays wagner and plewa 2017 previously published lc50 values for individual dbps are shown in table s2 it should be noted that the cho cell cytotoxicity index values of this study may be different from the published lc50 values this study employed an acute toxicity analyses 6 h treatment while the cho cytotoxicity method employed by wagner and plewa 2017 was a chronic exposure 72 h we assumed that the toxicities of the individual dbps were additive which was demonstrated by a recent study lau et al 2020 the cti of an individual dbp was calculated by dividing the dbp concentrations m by the lc50 values m chuang et al 2019 the cti for a sample was calculated by adding together the ctis for all of the individual dbps that were determined a cti value of 1 indicated that the dbp concentrations reached the lc50 concnetration which would cause 50 cell mortality 2 9 genotoxicity assay and gti calculation there is an one to one correspondence between phosphorylated histone h2ax ph2ax and dna double strand breaks dsbs so dna dsbs were quantified by measuring ph2ax kang et al 2012 takeiri et al 2019 to perform a genotoxicity assay 7000 cells were seeded into each well of a corning 3603 96 well microplate corning new york usa and then incubated for 12 h dmem f12 containing 0 5 dmso was used as a negative control after exposure to dbps for 6 h the cells were fixed permeated blocked incubated with the primary antibody phospho histone h2a x cell signaling technology boston ma usa and then stained with the second antibody alexa fluor 647 conjugate cell signaling technology and hoechst 33258 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa images of the cells were acquired using an imagexpress micro high content analysis hca system molecular devices the method is described in detail in text s6 six replicates of each test were performed the ph2ax induction ratios relative to the negative controls of samples at different concentration factors with cell viabilities 70 were used to obtain concentration effect curves by regression analysis plewa et al 2010 the genotoxicity indices gtis for the dbps that were determined were calculated from 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moment m values previously determined in acute cho genotoxicity assays comet assays wagner and plewa 2017 it should be noted that the phosphorylated histone h2ax ph2ax kit used in this study is a measure of dna double strand breaks and is an indicator for the induction of aneuploidy it is not equivalent to the genotoxicity analyses based on comet assay the method used to calculate the gtis was similar to the method used to calculate the ctis 2 10 measuring ros and dna rna oxidative damage the ros concentrations in test cells were measured using a ka4075 intracellular total ros assay kit abnova china cells were seeded into a corning 3603 96 well microplate 7000 cells well cultured for 12 h and then exposed to dbps for 6 h the dmem f12 medium was then discarded and 50 μl of the cell permeating non fluorescent ros probe was added to each well the cells were then incubated for 1 h the nuclei were then stained with hoechst 33258 images of the cells were acquired using the hca system using the tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate tritc channel for ros and the 4ʹ 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dihydrochloride dapi channel for the cell nuclei the fluorescence signal of the ros was then obtained by metaxpress software provided with the hca system the ros concentration was defined as the total fluorescence intensity divided by the number of cells i e the number of nuclei and was expressed as the fluorescence intensity per cell measurements of 8 oh d g were made to assess dna rna oxidative damage cells 7000 cells well were firstly treated with dbps for 6 h then the dmem f12 medium was removed the cells were fixed permeated and blocked using the same method as was used for the ph2ax assay described in text s6 the cells were then treated with a primary antibody dna rna oxidative damage markers thermo fisher scientific for 1 h thereafter cells were stained with the secondary antibody alexa fluor plus 555 thermo fisher scientific and hoechst 33258 for 1 h images of the cells were then acquired using the hca system using the tritc channel for 8 oh d g and the dapi channel for the nuclei the 8 oh d g concentration in cells was defined as the total fluorescence intensity divided by the number of cells and was expressed as the fluorescence intensity per cell 2 11 statistical analysis one way anova was performed to determine if the samples induced significant toxic effects relative to the negative controls if a significant f value p 0 05 was obtained a post hoc holm sidak multiple comparison test with the samples and the negative controls was performed to identify the lowest concentration factor that caused toxic effects the power of the test statistic 1 β was 0 8 at α 0 05 yang et al 2014 wagner and plewa 2017 for the cytotoxicity and dna dsb assay one way anova was used to identify significant differences between the cytotoxicity equivalents of the different samples and the ir1 5 values of the different samples respectively one way anova was also performed to identify significant differences between the toxic effects caused by the vdbps nvdbps and adbps at the same concentration factor 3 results 3 1 extracting vdbps for in vitro toxicity assays dbps that could be removed by helium were defined as vdbps the henry s coefficient of the vdbps in this study ranged from 10 10 to 10 3 atm m3 mol fig s3 dbps that remained in water samples after helium aeration were defined as nvdbps in this study we firstly optimized operation conditions of the vdbp extraction system including helium aeration time and helium flow rate to improve the blow off rate rblow off of dbps figs s2a and s2b to blow off more vdbps the aeration time and flow rate were set as 6 h and 1 0 l min rblow off of dbps under the optimized condition is shown in fig s3a trihalomethanes tcm bdcm dbcm and tbm and tcan tcnm 1 1 1 tcp could be blown off more than 95 rblow off of dcan bcan 1 1 dcp ranges from 35 to 65 rblow off of dban tcacam and ch is less than 15 generally a higher henry s coefficient of dbps would result a higher rblow off fig s3b all the dbps except ch could be captured from 45 to 85 by the cold trap system rcapture fig s3c the recovery rate rrecovery calculated as rblow off rcapture generally ranged from 30 to 60 fig s3d to perform the toxicity assay of vdbps their evaporating in the incubator during toxicity assay should also be taken into consideration experimental conditions were also optimized to minimize the evaporation rate revaporation of vdbps in the incubator including incubation time the kind of 96 well plate seal film and the dbp solution volume in 96 well plate to retain more vdbps the incubation time was set as 6 h and polyester seal film b was used to cover the 96 well plate during toxicity assay figs s4a and s4b besides the increased solution volume namely decreased headspace in 96 well plate lowered the evaporation rate of dbps revaporation fig s4c which was also reported by stalter et al 2013 the volume of dbp solution in the 96 well plate was optimized as 200 μl well although we paid much efforts a 100 retention ratio of vdbps in the incubator seems unavailable under the optimized condition revaporation of chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm bromodichloromethane tbm trichloroacetonitrile tcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm ranged from 50 to 70 fig s4c fortunately dbps with higher toxicity like dichloroacetonitrile dcan dibromoacetonitrile dban and bromochloroacetonitrile bcan wagner and plewa 2017 showed lower revaporation below 20 suggesting much of the toxic potency of vdbps might be retained during toxicity assay the vdbps in the test samples were extracted under the optimized conditions the vdbp concentrations both the amounts formed during chlorination and captured in the cold trap found in chlorinated efom a efom b and nom are shown in fig 1 a b and 1c respectively brominated dbps were found in chlorinated efom a and efom b because bromide is present in wastewater hobr obr formed when hocl oxidizes br during chlorination will react with organic matter to give brominated dbps yang et al 2014 thms particularly trichloromethane were more abundant than the other vdbps in all of the chlorinated water samples haloacetonitriles including dcan dban bcan and tcan were also found at relatively high concentrations total organic halogen tox is a collective term for halogenated dbps known and unknown han and zhang 2018 the vdbp and nvdbp contributions to the tox concentrations are shown in fig 1d the vdbp contributions to the total organic chlorine concentrations in chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 14 15 and 20 respectively the vdbp contributions to the total organic bromine concentrations in chlorinated efom a and efom b were only 12 and 10 respectively therefore vdbps contributed a small proportion of the tox in chlorinated efom and nom 3 2 cytotoxicity of vdbps and nvdbps concentration effect curves for the cytotoxicity assay results for chlorinated efom a efom b and nom are shown in fig 2 a b and 2c respectively and the statistical results are shown in table s3a the vdbps in all of the samples caused relatively little cell mortality mortality when cells were exposed to vdbps from chlorinated efom a at the maximum test concentration a concentration factor of 250 was 22 3 cell mortality when cells were exposed to vdbps from chlorinated efom b and nom was not significantly different from mortality for the negative controls even as the vdbp concentration factor increased one way anova p 0 05 indicating that the vdbps in chlorinated efom b and nom were not very cytotoxic the cytotoxicity indices ctis for the detected vdbps were quantified to support the toxicity assay results as shown in fig 2d the ctis for the vdbps from the three chlorinated samples were much lower than 1 at a concentration factor of 250 this supported our conclusion that vdbps had low cytotoxicities the mortalities when cells were exposed to the nvdbps from chlorinated efom a efom b and nom concentrated by spe at the maximum test concentrations were 56 4 68 6 and 72 4 respectively at low test concentrations generally at concentration factors 60 the vdbps and nvdbps were generally not very cytotoxic and the mortality results for vdbps and nvdbps were not significantly different one way anova p 0 05 table s3b however at higher concentrations the nvdbps were significantly more cytotoxic than the vdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s3b it should be noted that samples concentrated by spe might also contain pollutants in secondary effluent apart from dbps cytotoxicity of efom a efom b and nom without chlorination were also measured and none of them was cytotoxic at the relatively short exposure time of 6 h fig s5 suggesting the pollutants before chlorination would not interfere the toxicity measurement of nvdbps the adbps were significantly more cytotoxic than the nvdbps for all three chlorinated samples one way anova p 0 05 fig 2a and table s3c cytotoxicity equivalents were calculated using phenol as a reference compound with a method described in detail in text s2 when exposed to adbps compared with nvdbps cytotoxicity equivalents of chlorinated efom a efom b and nom significantly increased from 19 46 to 27 60 mg phenol l from 12 61 to 15 19 mg phenol l and from 13 57 to 16 35 mg phenol l one way anova p 0 05 respectively fig 2e the cytotoxicity of nvdbps accounted for 70 83 of the total cytotoxicity nvdbps was the main toxic factor 3 3 dna double strand break effects caused by vdbps and nvdbps dna double strand breaks dsbs are considered to be the most serious type of dna damage anand et al 2017 we assessed the dsb based genotoxicities of the chlorinated water samples by measuring the marker phosphorylated h2ax ph2ax the immunostaining results indicated that vdbp caused few ph2ax foci in cho cells fig 3 a and fig s6 concentration effect curves for the dna dsb assays of the chlorinated samples are shown in fig 3b and c and the statistical results are shown in table s5a the dna dsb induction rate was 1 4 times higher for the vdbps from chlorinated efom a than the negative controls at the highest test concentration factor 250 fig 3b the dna dsb induction rates were not significantly higher for the vdbps from chlorinated efom b and chlorinated nom than the negative controls one way anova p 0 05 fig 3b and c the different dsb induction rates for the vdbps from the different chlorinated water samples may have been caused by different types and or amounts of dbps being formed fig 1 which will depend on the organic precursors present in the original sample fu et al 2017 hu et al 2016 we also calculated genotoxicity indices gtis for the vdbps using the 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moments m previously determined in comet assays using cho cells by wagner and plewa 2017 table s4 a gti of 1 indicates that the dbps reached the median effect concentration ec50 during the comet assay the gtis of the vdbps from the three chlorinated samples were much lower than 1 even at a concentration factor of 250 fig 3e indicating that the vdbps had low genotoxicities similar to cytotoxicity the dsb induction rates were much higher for the nvdbps than the vdbps from the three chlorinated samples one way anova p 0 05 table s5b the dsb induction rates of nvdbps from chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 2 1 2 0 and 1 5 respectively at the highest concentration factors of 60 100 and 80 respectively this indicated that the nvdbps were much more genotoxic than the vdbps unlike for cytotoxicity the dsb induction rates were not significantly higher for the adbps than the nvdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s5c the concentration factor that increased the induction rate by a factor of 1 5 ir1 5 was used to compare the dsb induction abilities of different samples fig 3f the adbp ir1 5 values for chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 26 9 38 5 and 42 7 respectively and these were not significantly different from the nvdbp ir1 5 values one way anova p 0 05 3 4 reactive oxygen species and dna rna oxidative damage it has previously been found that excessive reactive oxygen species ros may form and cause oxidative stress in cells exposed to toxic dbps attene ramos et al 2010 cemeli et al 2006 j li et al 2016 pals et al 2013 we investigated the effects of vdbps nvdbps and adbps on ros in cho cells images in the ros measurement showed that vdbps at a concentration factor of 60 induced few ros to form fig 4 a and fig s7 concentration effect curves for ros for the three chlorinated water samples are shown in fig 4b d and the statistical results are shown in table s6a for all three samples ros were induced significantly less by the vdbps than the nvdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s6b which was in accordance with a previous study based on the arec32 reporter gene assay stalter et al 2016 intracellular ros were induced more by the adbps than by the nvdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s6c the chlorinated efom a efom b and nom nvdbps gave ros induction rates of 5 36 2 04 and 2 59 respectively at a concentration factor of 60 and the chlorinated efom a efom b and nom adbps gave ros induction rates of 8 68 3 11 and 3 22 respectively fig 4b d 8 hydroxy deoxyguanosine and 8 hydroxy guanosine together labeled 8 oh d g are produced through base modification at the c 8 position of guanine in deoxyguanosine and guanosine respectively these products are formed through oxidation by ros and are markers of dna and rna damage col et al 2010 nkulu et al 2018 shi et al 2012 excessive ros production caused by dbps implied oxidative damage of dna and rna in cho cells we therefore measured 8 oh d g in cells that had been exposed to dbps the immunofluorescent staining results indicated that vdbps caused only small amounts of 8 oh d g to form fig 5 a and fig s8 concentration effect curves for 8 oh d g induction by the three chlorinated water samples are shown in fig 5b d and the statistical results are shown in table s7a like for ros formation 8 oh d g were induced less by vdbps than nvdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s7b 8 oh d g were induced more by adbps than by nvdbps from all the chlorinated water samples at relatively high concentration factors one way anova p 0 05 table s7c 3 5 verification of vdbp toxicity the results described above indicated that vdbps are less toxic than nvdbps but the extraction system could not capture all of the vdbps fig 1a c meaning the toxicities of the vdbps may have been underestimated we therefore performed tests using spiked vdbp svdbp samples containing the vdbps at the concentrations found in chlorinated efom a table s8 this approach avoided vdbps being lost during extraction but excluded the effects of unidentified vdbps li and mitch 2018 concentration effect curves for cytotoxicity dna dsbs ros and 8 oh d g for the svdbps nvdbps and mixtures of svdbps and nvdbps are shown in fig 6 a d the staining results are shown in fig s9 and the statistical results are shown in tables s9a s10a s11a and s12a all of the tested toxicities for cho cells were caused significantly less by the svdbps than by the nvdbps at relatively high concentration factors one way anova p 0 05 tables s9b s10b s11b and s12b the svdbps caused cell mortality of 50 at the highest test concentration factor 250 and this was consistent with the cti being 1 fig 6e the gti was much lower than 1 fig 6f these results supported the conclusion that the vdbps were less toxic than the nvdbps mixtures of nvdbps and svdbps were more cytotoxic fig 6a and g caused more ros to form fig 6c and caused more 8 oh d g to form fig 6d than did the nvdbps alone but did not cause more dna dsbs than the nvdbps alone fig 6b and h these results agreed with the results found using vdbps captured by the extraction system 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of the vdbps and nvdbps formed the most abundant vdbps in all of the chlorinated water samples were thms as was found in previous studies cuthbertson et al 2019 this is one reason why there is more concern about thms than other dbps nitrogenous haloacetonitriles were also found at relatively high concentrations nitrogenous dbps are generally 100 times more cytotoxic and genotoxic than carbonaceous dbps according to in vitro tests using cho cells muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008a the vdbps contributed only small proportions of the tox concentrations in the chlorinated efom a efom b and nom however the toxicity will depend on both the dbp concentrations and the toxic potencies 1 lc50 of the dbps chuang et al 2019 different dbps can have toxic potencies several orders of magnitude different wagner and plewa 2017 it was therefore difficult to estimate the vdbp and nvdbp toxicities from the concentrations we therefore performed in vitro assays using cho cells to evaluate the vdbp and nvdbp toxicities 4 2 nvdbps are much more toxic than vdbps our results provided evidence for vdbps and nvdbps in chlorinated water having different toxicities to mammalian cells for all of the water samples that were tested the vdbps were much less cytotoxic than the nvdbps to cho cells suggesting that nvdbps pose stronger risks than vdbps the toxicities of vdbps and nvdbps were also compared using three other typical toxicity endpoints dna dsbs can cause the loss of base pairs containing genetic information severely undermine the integrity and function of chromatin and induce permanent cell cycle arrest cell apoptosis and even cell death helleday et al 2007 kinner et al 2008 olive 1998 ros in appropriate amounts are required for intracellular signal transduction but excess ros can weaken the antioxidant system and damage biological macromolecules such as dna rna proteins and lipids trachootham et al 2009 the development of almost all cancers is accompanied by increases in ros concentrations liou and storz 2010 the presence of 8 hydroxy deoxyguanosine can cause guanine to mismatch with adenine resulting in gene mutations col et al 2010 the presence of 8 hydroxy guanosine in rna can affect normal protein expression shi et al 2012 the dna dsb ros and 8 oh d g measurement results all indicated that the nvdbps were more toxic than the vdbps moreover a recent study used nitrogen sparging to eliminate the vdbps in chlorinated water finding sparging or not did not impact the developmental toxicity of dbps to marine platynereis dumerilii li et al 2020 all these results inferred that nvdbps will have stronger adverse effects than vdbps in humans exposed to chlorinated water studies have been focused more on vdbps such as thms for which many countries and international agencies have regulations than on nvdbps european council 1998 usepa 2006 exposure to dbps is mainly assessed in epidemiological studies and risk assessments using thm concentrations jones et al 2017 lodhi et al 2017 our results suggested that risks may be underestimated and key hazard factors ignored when only thm concentrations are used because nvdbps are more toxic due to the limitations of chemical analysis technique gas chromatography has been used to detect vdbps such as thms haloketones and haloacetonitriles in most studies on the formation and control of dbps huang et al 2019 this leads to the contradiction that chemical analyses are focused on vdbps even though nvdbps are much more toxic attempts have been made to identify the main species responsible for dbp toxicity in chlorinated water by combining the concentration and toxic potency 1 lc50 volatile nitrogenous dbps such as haloacetonitriles were previously considered to be the toxicity drivers among known dbps huang et al 2019 lau et al 2020 plewa et al 2017 haloacetonitriles were captured by the extraction system we used but they were found to be less toxic than the nvdbps it therefore seems that toxicity drivers would exist in the nvdbps namely attention needs to be paid to nvdbps when chemical analyses of dbps are performed 4 3 nvdbps are the main contributors to overall dbp toxicity traditional pretreatment methods like spe and lle preclude the toxicity of the full range of dbps in a sample being assessed because vdbps are lost during the removal of solvent stalter et al 2016 collecting the vdbps allowed us to assess the toxicity of full range of dbps in the samples by exposing cells to the adbps to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the toxicities of adbps have been assessed the adbps were significantly more cytotoxic and induced more ros and oxidative damage to dna rna but did not induce more dna dsbs than did the nvdbps this could have been because adbp components had different toxic mechanisms affecting different toxic endpoints this indicated that it is important to use multiple endpoints when assessing dbp toxicity shi et al 2010 the vdbps from the chlorinated water samples showed little toxicity but they enhanced the overall cytotoxicity and induction of ros and 8 oh d g suggesting that the loss of vdbps during traditional pretreatment processes could lead to the overall toxicity of chlorinated water being underestimated li and mitch 2018 the adbps were significantly more toxic than the nvdbps but the difference was not very large the nvdbp cytotoxicity equivalents of chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 15 2 9 9 and 10 7 mg phenol l and the adbp cytotoxicity equivalents of chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 21 7 11 9 and 12 9 mg phenol l i e adding vdbps increased the cytotoxicity by a small degree of 30 20 and 21 respectively it therefore appears that the dbp toxicity is predominantly caused by nvdbps 4 4 improved understanding of nvdbps is needed the svdbp toxicity results agreed well with the results for the vdbps captured using the extraction system however the svdbps even resulted in higher toxicity than vdbps captured in the cold trap fig s10 and table s13 suggesting there might be few unknown vdbps or the unknown vdbps toxicity might be relatively low studies focused on identifying and assessing the toxicities of nvdbps should therefore be performed in future recently some newly identified nvdbps e g haloacetamides halobenzoquinones and aromatic halogenated dbps have been found to be very toxic plewa et al 2008b wang et al 2014 2018 yang and zhang 2013 effort should be made to identify emerging dbps such as using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and high resolution mass spectrometry to improve our understanding of nvdbps yang et al 2019 5 conclusions in conclusion vdbps contributed only small proportions of the tox concentrations vdbp contributions to the tocl ranged from 14 to 20 and contributions to the tobr were around 10 compared with nvdbps vdbps showed much lower cytotoxicity and dna dsb based genotoxicity moreover vdbps had lower ability to induce ros and cause dna rna oxidative damage in cho cells compared with exposing to nvdbps when cho cells exposing to the mixtures of vdbps and nvdbps adbps both higher cytotoxicity ros and dna rna oxidative damage levels were observed moreover the spiked known vdbps showed higher toxicity than the captured vdbps suggesting there might be few unknown vdbps or the unknown vdbps toxicity is relatively low vdbps like trihalomethanes have been well studied and proven to be risky to humans our study found nvdbps are even more toxic therefore future research should focus more on nvdbps and identifying toxicity drivers from nvdbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17755,water is often chlorinated to protect public health but chlorination causes harmful disinfection byproducts to form currently available in vitro assays generally determine non volatile disinfection byproduct nvdbp toxicities because of the limitation of pretreatments used but chemical analyses and regulations are focused on volatile disinfection byproducts vdbps such as trihalomethanes the gap of vdbp toxicities have been of concern for some time in this study we extracted vdbps from two chlorinated effluent organic matters and one chlorinated natural organic matter using a helium aeration liquid nitrogen condensation system and systematically assessed the vdbp and nvdbp toxicities to mammalian cells vdbps accounted for 10 20 of the total organic halogen concentrations in three chlorinated water samples vdbps were much less cytotoxic caused fewer dna double strand breaks induced less reactive oxygen species and dna rna oxidative damage marker of 8 hydroxyl deoxy guanosine in cells than did nvdbps moreover by collecting the vdbps toxicity measurement of the full range of dbps was achieved cytotoxicity reactive oxygen species and 8 hydroxyl deoxy guanosine levels were significantly higher for cells exposed to the mixture of vdbps and nvdbps than only nvdbps but not by large percentages 20 30 for cytotoxicity suggesting nvdbps mainly contributed to the toxicity of chlorinated water our study suggested that future research should focus more on nvdbp toxicity and identifying toxicity drivers from nvdbps graphical abstract image 1 keywords chlorination volatile dbps additive dbp mixture cytotoxicity genotoxicity 1 introduction chlorinating drinking water and wastewater to inactivate pathogens offers great public health benefits and strongly limits water borne diseases however chlorination causes disinfection byproducts dbps to form which are resulted from the reaction between chlorine and natural organic matter nom in drinking water or effluent organic matter efom in wastewater hu et al 2016 qu et al 2019 dong et al 2019 these dbps would pose risks to human health c m li et al 2016 sedlak and von gunten 2011 epidemiological investigation showed that the risk of bladder cancer increased with long term dbp exposure villanueva et al 2004 there is evidence from in vivo assays that 22 dbps are carcinogenic richardson et al 2007 and in in vitro assays using mammalian cells demonstrated more than 100 dbps were cytotoxic and genotoxic plewa et al 2017 in vitro toxicity assays are convenient and commonly used to evaluate the risks posed by chlorinated water bhuvaneshwari et al 2019 wu et al 2019 yang et al 2014 dbps are found at relatively low concentration in water so dbps in a sample usually need to be enriched to allow any potential toxic effects to be identified currently in vitro dbp toxicity assays involve enriching the dbps by performing a pretreatment e g solid phase extraction spe or liquid liquid extraction lle du et al 2018 yang et al 2014 however such pretreatment methods only retain non volatile dbps nvdbps volatile dbps vdbps are inevitably lost when the organic solvents e g acetone methanol or methyl tert butyl ether used in the pretreatment are removed the limitations of currently used pretreatment methods mean vdbp toxicities are not understood and are of concern li and mitch 2018 moreover the loss of vdbps might lead to the underestimation of the overall toxicities the dbps that were first identified were vdbps such as trihalomethanes thms concentrations of these vdbps are regulated by many countries and international organizations european council 1998 usepa 2006 studies of dbps usually involved detecting vdbps such as thms haloketones haloacetonitriles and halonitromethanes by gas chromatography because of the convenience of performing such measurements beauchamp et al 2018 szczuka et al 2017 most epidemiological studies and risk assessments of dbps have been based on exposure to vdbp data nieuwenhuijsen et al 2009 thiriat et al 2009 however recent in vitro assays using chinese hamster ovary cho cells have indicated that thms are several orders of magnitude less cytotoxic than nvdbps such as halobenzoquinone and aromatic halogenated dbps prochazka et al 2015 2019 a significant correlation between the consumption of drinking water with relatively high thm concentrations 50 μg l and bladder cancer was found in an epidemiological study but the 95 confidence interval on the odds ratio was close to the statistical significance level costet et al 2001 implying the volatile thms might not be the risk drivers richardson and plewa 2020 therefore there have been a long standing contradiction in dbp studies that chemical analysis and regulations focus more on volatile dbps while toxicity assays generally evaluate the non volatile ones plewa and wagner 2015 richardson and plewa 2020 toxicological research on dbps should point out which dbp fraction vdbps or nvdbps needs specific focus and identify the toxicity drivers among the fraction with higher risk li and mitch 2018 thus comparing the toxicity of volatile dbps and non volatile dbps is needed recently a method for capturing vdbps suitable for in vitro toxicity assay was proposed by stalter et al 2016 who used liquid nitrogen to condense the vdbps that were blown off by helium based on this stalter et al 2016 also gave a discussion on the toxicity of tap waters finding that compared with nvdbps vdbps were generally more toxic to luminescent bacteria but induced less oxidative stress in the arec32 reporter gene assay because mammalian cells were closely related to human beings and widely used to evaluate the toxicity of dbps plewa et al 2008a b wagner and plewa 2017 it is necessary to systematically evaluate and distinguish the toxicity of vdbps and nvdbps to mammalian cells moreover by collecting the vdbps there is an opportunity to reveal the toxicity of the mixtures of vdbps and nvdbps additive dbps adbps which has bothered researchers for a long time lau et al 2020 stalter et al 2020 the aim of the study was to improve our understanding of the toxicities to mammalian cells of vdbps nvdbps and adbps produced through chlorination of natural organic matter nom and wastewater effluent organic matter efom the formation of vdbps and nvdbps was characterized cytotoxicity genotoxicity oxidative stress and dna rna oxidative damage caused by dbps were assessed using chinese hamster ovary cho cells 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the chemicals and reagents used are described in text s1 in supplementary information si 2 2 water sample preparation and water quality analysis the efom a and efom b samples were effluent organic matter in secondary effluent collected from municipal wastewater treatment plants a and b respectively both wastewater treatment plants were in shenzhen china and used aerobic anoxic oxic processes simulated drinking water was prepared by dissolving nom 2r101 purchased from the international humic substances society to give a carbon concentration of 5 0 mg l in ultrapure water containing nahco3 at a concentration in terms of caco3 of 90 mg l as described previously han and zhang 2018 each water sample was passed through a 0 45 μm microfilter and then stored at 4 c until it was used water quality parameters the dissolved organic carbon concentration uv absorbance ammonia nitrogen concentration and ph were determined as described previously du et al 2018 wu et al 2020 and the results are shown in table s2 2 3 chlorination and quenching the ph of each filtered water sample was adjusted to 7 00 0 05 by adding h2so4 or naoh then 6 l of the sample was chlorinated using naclo at a chlorine concentration of 10 mg l in a well sealed 6 l glass bottle for 24 h in the dark the residual chlorine was then quenched by adding 105 of the stoichiometrically required amount of 1 0 mol l sodium thiosulfate stalter et al 2016 the chlorine residual was determined by a hi 93711 chlorine analyzer hanna italy 2 4 vdbp and nvdbp extraction a vdbp extraction system was adapted from stalter et al 2016 and the schematic of the vdbp extraction system is shown in fig s1 the aeration and coldtrap systems in the vdbp extraction system were connected using a condenser pipe filled with flowing water at 0 2 c once the vdbps had been blown off the water vapor was condensed in a condenser tube that the vdbps could pass through to enter the coldtrap the coldtrap which consisted of an inner glass tube and an outer glass tube was submerged in liquid nitrogen the outer tube was filled with crushed ice when recovery tests were performed or crushed freezing culture medium when the toxicity assays were performed to provide condensation nuclei for the vdbps the vdbps in 5 l of chlorinated water were concentrated into 18 ml of ultrapure water or cell culture medium and then diluted to 20 ml with ultrapure water or cell culture medium to give a concentration factor of 250 the vdbp capture procedure is described in more detail in text s2 the recoveries achieved using the vdbp extraction system and the vdbp evaporation rates in the incubator were determined as described in text s3 once the chlorinated water had been aerated the remaining nvdbps were concentrated using a previously described spe procedure du et al 2017 each oasis hlb spe cartridge waters milford ma usa was activated by passing 10 ml of methanol and then 10 ml of ultrapure water through a water sample was adjusted to ph 2 00 0 05 by adding 2 mol l h2so4 then was passed through an activated oasis hlb spe cartridge at a flow rate of 5 ml min the sorbent in the cartridge was dried by passing nitrogen through then methanol 5 ml acetone 2 ml and dichloromethane 2 ml were passed through in sequence to elute the dbps eluent was then evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen to avoid the oxidation of dbps by air and then the extracts were stored at 4 c 2 5 determining individual dbp and tox concentrations individual dbps were concentrated by performing liquid liquid extractions lle then were analyzed using a 7890b gas chromatograph with an electron capture detector agilent technologies santa clara ca usa the lle method and gas chromatography electron capture detector conditions are described in text s4 the total organic halogen tox concentrations of nvdbps were determined using a 250 ml aerated water sample pretreated by the spe method described above the extracted nvdbps were dissolved in ultrapure water then the solution was placed in a sealed quartz tube and irradiated with light at wavelengths of 185 nm produced by 12 w vacuum uv lamps as described by bu et al 2018 this converted organic halogen into inorganic halide ions light at a wavelength of 254 nm provided by a 11 w low pressure mercury lamp was used to reduce bromate if organic bromine was transformed into bromate during the vacuum uv irradiation process vdbps captured using the cold trap system were directly transferred to the quartz tube and irradiated because these vdbps would not have contained any inorganic halides the concentrations of chloride and bromide ions generated in the irradiation process were determined using an ics 900 ion chromatograph thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the tox concentration was defined as the difference between the halide concentrations before and after irradiation to avoid any error caused by the spe cartridge retaining trace quantities of halides 2 6 sample preparation for the toxicity assays the nvdbps that had been concentrated from a sample by spe were dissolved in a 1 1 mixture of dulbecco s modified eagle medium and f 12 dmem f12 thermo fisher scientific containing 0 5 v v dimethyl sulfoxide dmso to achieve the desired concentration factor vdbps were captured in dmem f12 containing 0 5 dmso in the coldtrap the maximum concentration factor was 250 the adbps were prepared by mixing nvdbps and vdbps at the same concentration factor 2 7 cell culture the cho k1 cell line was purchased from the american type culture collection the cells were cultured in dmem f 12 supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum thermo fisher scientific 100 u ml penicillin g and 100 μg ml streptomycin thermo fisher scientific the culture dishes were placed in a sterile incubator with a 5 co2 atmosphere and at a high humidity at 37 c the cells were passaged every second day cells that had undergone two five passages were used in the toxicity assays 2 8 cytotoxicity assay and cti calculation cytotoxicity was measured using a cell counting kit 8 dojindo kumamoto japan the reagent 2 2 methoxy 4 nitrophenyl 3 4 nitrophenyl 5 2 4 disulfophenyl 2h tetrazolium monosodium salt in the kit was reduced to yellow orange formazan crystals by dehydrogenase in mitochondria absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a spectramax i3 microplate reader molecular devices sunnyvale ca usa absorbance at 450 nm was proportional to the number of viable cells catauro et al 2014 a phenol solution in dmem f 12 medium containing 0 5 dmso was used as a reference solution to allow the cytotoxicity equivalent to be calculated cells were exposed to a sample for 6 h six replicates of each test were performed the cytotoxicity assay and cytotoxicity equivalent calculation methods are described in detail in text s5 the cytotoxicity indices ctis for the dbps that were determined were calculated using median lethal concentration lc50 m 1 values determined previously by performing cho cytotoxicity assays wagner and plewa 2017 previously published lc50 values for individual dbps are shown in table s2 it should be noted that the cho cell cytotoxicity index values of this study may be different from the published lc50 values this study employed an acute toxicity analyses 6 h treatment while the cho cytotoxicity method employed by wagner and plewa 2017 was a chronic exposure 72 h we assumed that the toxicities of the individual dbps were additive which was demonstrated by a recent study lau et al 2020 the cti of an individual dbp was calculated by dividing the dbp concentrations m by the lc50 values m chuang et al 2019 the cti for a sample was calculated by adding together the ctis for all of the individual dbps that were determined a cti value of 1 indicated that the dbp concentrations reached the lc50 concnetration which would cause 50 cell mortality 2 9 genotoxicity assay and gti calculation there is an one to one correspondence between phosphorylated histone h2ax ph2ax and dna double strand breaks dsbs so dna dsbs were quantified by measuring ph2ax kang et al 2012 takeiri et al 2019 to perform a genotoxicity assay 7000 cells were seeded into each well of a corning 3603 96 well microplate corning new york usa and then incubated for 12 h dmem f12 containing 0 5 dmso was used as a negative control after exposure to dbps for 6 h the cells were fixed permeated blocked incubated with the primary antibody phospho histone h2a x cell signaling technology boston ma usa and then stained with the second antibody alexa fluor 647 conjugate cell signaling technology and hoechst 33258 sigma aldrich st louis mo usa images of the cells were acquired using an imagexpress micro high content analysis hca system molecular devices the method is described in detail in text s6 six replicates of each test were performed the ph2ax induction ratios relative to the negative controls of samples at different concentration factors with cell viabilities 70 were used to obtain concentration effect curves by regression analysis plewa et al 2010 the genotoxicity indices gtis for the dbps that were determined were calculated from 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moment m values previously determined in acute cho genotoxicity assays comet assays wagner and plewa 2017 it should be noted that the phosphorylated histone h2ax ph2ax kit used in this study is a measure of dna double strand breaks and is an indicator for the induction of aneuploidy it is not equivalent to the genotoxicity analyses based on comet assay the method used to calculate the gtis was similar to the method used to calculate the ctis 2 10 measuring ros and dna rna oxidative damage the ros concentrations in test cells were measured using a ka4075 intracellular total ros assay kit abnova china cells were seeded into a corning 3603 96 well microplate 7000 cells well cultured for 12 h and then exposed to dbps for 6 h the dmem f12 medium was then discarded and 50 μl of the cell permeating non fluorescent ros probe was added to each well the cells were then incubated for 1 h the nuclei were then stained with hoechst 33258 images of the cells were acquired using the hca system using the tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate tritc channel for ros and the 4ʹ 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dihydrochloride dapi channel for the cell nuclei the fluorescence signal of the ros was then obtained by metaxpress software provided with the hca system the ros concentration was defined as the total fluorescence intensity divided by the number of cells i e the number of nuclei and was expressed as the fluorescence intensity per cell measurements of 8 oh d g were made to assess dna rna oxidative damage cells 7000 cells well were firstly treated with dbps for 6 h then the dmem f12 medium was removed the cells were fixed permeated and blocked using the same method as was used for the ph2ax assay described in text s6 the cells were then treated with a primary antibody dna rna oxidative damage markers thermo fisher scientific for 1 h thereafter cells were stained with the secondary antibody alexa fluor plus 555 thermo fisher scientific and hoechst 33258 for 1 h images of the cells were then acquired using the hca system using the tritc channel for 8 oh d g and the dapi channel for the nuclei the 8 oh d g concentration in cells was defined as the total fluorescence intensity divided by the number of cells and was expressed as the fluorescence intensity per cell 2 11 statistical analysis one way anova was performed to determine if the samples induced significant toxic effects relative to the negative controls if a significant f value p 0 05 was obtained a post hoc holm sidak multiple comparison test with the samples and the negative controls was performed to identify the lowest concentration factor that caused toxic effects the power of the test statistic 1 β was 0 8 at α 0 05 yang et al 2014 wagner and plewa 2017 for the cytotoxicity and dna dsb assay one way anova was used to identify significant differences between the cytotoxicity equivalents of the different samples and the ir1 5 values of the different samples respectively one way anova was also performed to identify significant differences between the toxic effects caused by the vdbps nvdbps and adbps at the same concentration factor 3 results 3 1 extracting vdbps for in vitro toxicity assays dbps that could be removed by helium were defined as vdbps the henry s coefficient of the vdbps in this study ranged from 10 10 to 10 3 atm m3 mol fig s3 dbps that remained in water samples after helium aeration were defined as nvdbps in this study we firstly optimized operation conditions of the vdbp extraction system including helium aeration time and helium flow rate to improve the blow off rate rblow off of dbps figs s2a and s2b to blow off more vdbps the aeration time and flow rate were set as 6 h and 1 0 l min rblow off of dbps under the optimized condition is shown in fig s3a trihalomethanes tcm bdcm dbcm and tbm and tcan tcnm 1 1 1 tcp could be blown off more than 95 rblow off of dcan bcan 1 1 dcp ranges from 35 to 65 rblow off of dban tcacam and ch is less than 15 generally a higher henry s coefficient of dbps would result a higher rblow off fig s3b all the dbps except ch could be captured from 45 to 85 by the cold trap system rcapture fig s3c the recovery rate rrecovery calculated as rblow off rcapture generally ranged from 30 to 60 fig s3d to perform the toxicity assay of vdbps their evaporating in the incubator during toxicity assay should also be taken into consideration experimental conditions were also optimized to minimize the evaporation rate revaporation of vdbps in the incubator including incubation time the kind of 96 well plate seal film and the dbp solution volume in 96 well plate to retain more vdbps the incubation time was set as 6 h and polyester seal film b was used to cover the 96 well plate during toxicity assay figs s4a and s4b besides the increased solution volume namely decreased headspace in 96 well plate lowered the evaporation rate of dbps revaporation fig s4c which was also reported by stalter et al 2013 the volume of dbp solution in the 96 well plate was optimized as 200 μl well although we paid much efforts a 100 retention ratio of vdbps in the incubator seems unavailable under the optimized condition revaporation of chloroform tcm bromodichloromethane bdcm dibromochloromethane dbcm bromodichloromethane tbm trichloroacetonitrile tcan and trichloronitromethane tcnm ranged from 50 to 70 fig s4c fortunately dbps with higher toxicity like dichloroacetonitrile dcan dibromoacetonitrile dban and bromochloroacetonitrile bcan wagner and plewa 2017 showed lower revaporation below 20 suggesting much of the toxic potency of vdbps might be retained during toxicity assay the vdbps in the test samples were extracted under the optimized conditions the vdbp concentrations both the amounts formed during chlorination and captured in the cold trap found in chlorinated efom a efom b and nom are shown in fig 1 a b and 1c respectively brominated dbps were found in chlorinated efom a and efom b because bromide is present in wastewater hobr obr formed when hocl oxidizes br during chlorination will react with organic matter to give brominated dbps yang et al 2014 thms particularly trichloromethane were more abundant than the other vdbps in all of the chlorinated water samples haloacetonitriles including dcan dban bcan and tcan were also found at relatively high concentrations total organic halogen tox is a collective term for halogenated dbps known and unknown han and zhang 2018 the vdbp and nvdbp contributions to the tox concentrations are shown in fig 1d the vdbp contributions to the total organic chlorine concentrations in chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 14 15 and 20 respectively the vdbp contributions to the total organic bromine concentrations in chlorinated efom a and efom b were only 12 and 10 respectively therefore vdbps contributed a small proportion of the tox in chlorinated efom and nom 3 2 cytotoxicity of vdbps and nvdbps concentration effect curves for the cytotoxicity assay results for chlorinated efom a efom b and nom are shown in fig 2 a b and 2c respectively and the statistical results are shown in table s3a the vdbps in all of the samples caused relatively little cell mortality mortality when cells were exposed to vdbps from chlorinated efom a at the maximum test concentration a concentration factor of 250 was 22 3 cell mortality when cells were exposed to vdbps from chlorinated efom b and nom was not significantly different from mortality for the negative controls even as the vdbp concentration factor increased one way anova p 0 05 indicating that the vdbps in chlorinated efom b and nom were not very cytotoxic the cytotoxicity indices ctis for the detected vdbps were quantified to support the toxicity assay results as shown in fig 2d the ctis for the vdbps from the three chlorinated samples were much lower than 1 at a concentration factor of 250 this supported our conclusion that vdbps had low cytotoxicities the mortalities when cells were exposed to the nvdbps from chlorinated efom a efom b and nom concentrated by spe at the maximum test concentrations were 56 4 68 6 and 72 4 respectively at low test concentrations generally at concentration factors 60 the vdbps and nvdbps were generally not very cytotoxic and the mortality results for vdbps and nvdbps were not significantly different one way anova p 0 05 table s3b however at higher concentrations the nvdbps were significantly more cytotoxic than the vdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s3b it should be noted that samples concentrated by spe might also contain pollutants in secondary effluent apart from dbps cytotoxicity of efom a efom b and nom without chlorination were also measured and none of them was cytotoxic at the relatively short exposure time of 6 h fig s5 suggesting the pollutants before chlorination would not interfere the toxicity measurement of nvdbps the adbps were significantly more cytotoxic than the nvdbps for all three chlorinated samples one way anova p 0 05 fig 2a and table s3c cytotoxicity equivalents were calculated using phenol as a reference compound with a method described in detail in text s2 when exposed to adbps compared with nvdbps cytotoxicity equivalents of chlorinated efom a efom b and nom significantly increased from 19 46 to 27 60 mg phenol l from 12 61 to 15 19 mg phenol l and from 13 57 to 16 35 mg phenol l one way anova p 0 05 respectively fig 2e the cytotoxicity of nvdbps accounted for 70 83 of the total cytotoxicity nvdbps was the main toxic factor 3 3 dna double strand break effects caused by vdbps and nvdbps dna double strand breaks dsbs are considered to be the most serious type of dna damage anand et al 2017 we assessed the dsb based genotoxicities of the chlorinated water samples by measuring the marker phosphorylated h2ax ph2ax the immunostaining results indicated that vdbp caused few ph2ax foci in cho cells fig 3 a and fig s6 concentration effect curves for the dna dsb assays of the chlorinated samples are shown in fig 3b and c and the statistical results are shown in table s5a the dna dsb induction rate was 1 4 times higher for the vdbps from chlorinated efom a than the negative controls at the highest test concentration factor 250 fig 3b the dna dsb induction rates were not significantly higher for the vdbps from chlorinated efom b and chlorinated nom than the negative controls one way anova p 0 05 fig 3b and c the different dsb induction rates for the vdbps from the different chlorinated water samples may have been caused by different types and or amounts of dbps being formed fig 1 which will depend on the organic precursors present in the original sample fu et al 2017 hu et al 2016 we also calculated genotoxicity indices gtis for the vdbps using the 50 tail dna or midpoint of tail moments m previously determined in comet assays using cho cells by wagner and plewa 2017 table s4 a gti of 1 indicates that the dbps reached the median effect concentration ec50 during the comet assay the gtis of the vdbps from the three chlorinated samples were much lower than 1 even at a concentration factor of 250 fig 3e indicating that the vdbps had low genotoxicities similar to cytotoxicity the dsb induction rates were much higher for the nvdbps than the vdbps from the three chlorinated samples one way anova p 0 05 table s5b the dsb induction rates of nvdbps from chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 2 1 2 0 and 1 5 respectively at the highest concentration factors of 60 100 and 80 respectively this indicated that the nvdbps were much more genotoxic than the vdbps unlike for cytotoxicity the dsb induction rates were not significantly higher for the adbps than the nvdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s5c the concentration factor that increased the induction rate by a factor of 1 5 ir1 5 was used to compare the dsb induction abilities of different samples fig 3f the adbp ir1 5 values for chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 26 9 38 5 and 42 7 respectively and these were not significantly different from the nvdbp ir1 5 values one way anova p 0 05 3 4 reactive oxygen species and dna rna oxidative damage it has previously been found that excessive reactive oxygen species ros may form and cause oxidative stress in cells exposed to toxic dbps attene ramos et al 2010 cemeli et al 2006 j li et al 2016 pals et al 2013 we investigated the effects of vdbps nvdbps and adbps on ros in cho cells images in the ros measurement showed that vdbps at a concentration factor of 60 induced few ros to form fig 4 a and fig s7 concentration effect curves for ros for the three chlorinated water samples are shown in fig 4b d and the statistical results are shown in table s6a for all three samples ros were induced significantly less by the vdbps than the nvdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s6b which was in accordance with a previous study based on the arec32 reporter gene assay stalter et al 2016 intracellular ros were induced more by the adbps than by the nvdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s6c the chlorinated efom a efom b and nom nvdbps gave ros induction rates of 5 36 2 04 and 2 59 respectively at a concentration factor of 60 and the chlorinated efom a efom b and nom adbps gave ros induction rates of 8 68 3 11 and 3 22 respectively fig 4b d 8 hydroxy deoxyguanosine and 8 hydroxy guanosine together labeled 8 oh d g are produced through base modification at the c 8 position of guanine in deoxyguanosine and guanosine respectively these products are formed through oxidation by ros and are markers of dna and rna damage col et al 2010 nkulu et al 2018 shi et al 2012 excessive ros production caused by dbps implied oxidative damage of dna and rna in cho cells we therefore measured 8 oh d g in cells that had been exposed to dbps the immunofluorescent staining results indicated that vdbps caused only small amounts of 8 oh d g to form fig 5 a and fig s8 concentration effect curves for 8 oh d g induction by the three chlorinated water samples are shown in fig 5b d and the statistical results are shown in table s7a like for ros formation 8 oh d g were induced less by vdbps than nvdbps one way anova p 0 05 table s7b 8 oh d g were induced more by adbps than by nvdbps from all the chlorinated water samples at relatively high concentration factors one way anova p 0 05 table s7c 3 5 verification of vdbp toxicity the results described above indicated that vdbps are less toxic than nvdbps but the extraction system could not capture all of the vdbps fig 1a c meaning the toxicities of the vdbps may have been underestimated we therefore performed tests using spiked vdbp svdbp samples containing the vdbps at the concentrations found in chlorinated efom a table s8 this approach avoided vdbps being lost during extraction but excluded the effects of unidentified vdbps li and mitch 2018 concentration effect curves for cytotoxicity dna dsbs ros and 8 oh d g for the svdbps nvdbps and mixtures of svdbps and nvdbps are shown in fig 6 a d the staining results are shown in fig s9 and the statistical results are shown in tables s9a s10a s11a and s12a all of the tested toxicities for cho cells were caused significantly less by the svdbps than by the nvdbps at relatively high concentration factors one way anova p 0 05 tables s9b s10b s11b and s12b the svdbps caused cell mortality of 50 at the highest test concentration factor 250 and this was consistent with the cti being 1 fig 6e the gti was much lower than 1 fig 6f these results supported the conclusion that the vdbps were less toxic than the nvdbps mixtures of nvdbps and svdbps were more cytotoxic fig 6a and g caused more ros to form fig 6c and caused more 8 oh d g to form fig 6d than did the nvdbps alone but did not cause more dna dsbs than the nvdbps alone fig 6b and h these results agreed with the results found using vdbps captured by the extraction system 4 discussion 4 1 characteristics of the vdbps and nvdbps formed the most abundant vdbps in all of the chlorinated water samples were thms as was found in previous studies cuthbertson et al 2019 this is one reason why there is more concern about thms than other dbps nitrogenous haloacetonitriles were also found at relatively high concentrations nitrogenous dbps are generally 100 times more cytotoxic and genotoxic than carbonaceous dbps according to in vitro tests using cho cells muellner et al 2007 plewa et al 2008a the vdbps contributed only small proportions of the tox concentrations in the chlorinated efom a efom b and nom however the toxicity will depend on both the dbp concentrations and the toxic potencies 1 lc50 of the dbps chuang et al 2019 different dbps can have toxic potencies several orders of magnitude different wagner and plewa 2017 it was therefore difficult to estimate the vdbp and nvdbp toxicities from the concentrations we therefore performed in vitro assays using cho cells to evaluate the vdbp and nvdbp toxicities 4 2 nvdbps are much more toxic than vdbps our results provided evidence for vdbps and nvdbps in chlorinated water having different toxicities to mammalian cells for all of the water samples that were tested the vdbps were much less cytotoxic than the nvdbps to cho cells suggesting that nvdbps pose stronger risks than vdbps the toxicities of vdbps and nvdbps were also compared using three other typical toxicity endpoints dna dsbs can cause the loss of base pairs containing genetic information severely undermine the integrity and function of chromatin and induce permanent cell cycle arrest cell apoptosis and even cell death helleday et al 2007 kinner et al 2008 olive 1998 ros in appropriate amounts are required for intracellular signal transduction but excess ros can weaken the antioxidant system and damage biological macromolecules such as dna rna proteins and lipids trachootham et al 2009 the development of almost all cancers is accompanied by increases in ros concentrations liou and storz 2010 the presence of 8 hydroxy deoxyguanosine can cause guanine to mismatch with adenine resulting in gene mutations col et al 2010 the presence of 8 hydroxy guanosine in rna can affect normal protein expression shi et al 2012 the dna dsb ros and 8 oh d g measurement results all indicated that the nvdbps were more toxic than the vdbps moreover a recent study used nitrogen sparging to eliminate the vdbps in chlorinated water finding sparging or not did not impact the developmental toxicity of dbps to marine platynereis dumerilii li et al 2020 all these results inferred that nvdbps will have stronger adverse effects than vdbps in humans exposed to chlorinated water studies have been focused more on vdbps such as thms for which many countries and international agencies have regulations than on nvdbps european council 1998 usepa 2006 exposure to dbps is mainly assessed in epidemiological studies and risk assessments using thm concentrations jones et al 2017 lodhi et al 2017 our results suggested that risks may be underestimated and key hazard factors ignored when only thm concentrations are used because nvdbps are more toxic due to the limitations of chemical analysis technique gas chromatography has been used to detect vdbps such as thms haloketones and haloacetonitriles in most studies on the formation and control of dbps huang et al 2019 this leads to the contradiction that chemical analyses are focused on vdbps even though nvdbps are much more toxic attempts have been made to identify the main species responsible for dbp toxicity in chlorinated water by combining the concentration and toxic potency 1 lc50 volatile nitrogenous dbps such as haloacetonitriles were previously considered to be the toxicity drivers among known dbps huang et al 2019 lau et al 2020 plewa et al 2017 haloacetonitriles were captured by the extraction system we used but they were found to be less toxic than the nvdbps it therefore seems that toxicity drivers would exist in the nvdbps namely attention needs to be paid to nvdbps when chemical analyses of dbps are performed 4 3 nvdbps are the main contributors to overall dbp toxicity traditional pretreatment methods like spe and lle preclude the toxicity of the full range of dbps in a sample being assessed because vdbps are lost during the removal of solvent stalter et al 2016 collecting the vdbps allowed us to assess the toxicity of full range of dbps in the samples by exposing cells to the adbps to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the toxicities of adbps have been assessed the adbps were significantly more cytotoxic and induced more ros and oxidative damage to dna rna but did not induce more dna dsbs than did the nvdbps this could have been because adbp components had different toxic mechanisms affecting different toxic endpoints this indicated that it is important to use multiple endpoints when assessing dbp toxicity shi et al 2010 the vdbps from the chlorinated water samples showed little toxicity but they enhanced the overall cytotoxicity and induction of ros and 8 oh d g suggesting that the loss of vdbps during traditional pretreatment processes could lead to the overall toxicity of chlorinated water being underestimated li and mitch 2018 the adbps were significantly more toxic than the nvdbps but the difference was not very large the nvdbp cytotoxicity equivalents of chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 15 2 9 9 and 10 7 mg phenol l and the adbp cytotoxicity equivalents of chlorinated efom a efom b and nom were 21 7 11 9 and 12 9 mg phenol l i e adding vdbps increased the cytotoxicity by a small degree of 30 20 and 21 respectively it therefore appears that the dbp toxicity is predominantly caused by nvdbps 4 4 improved understanding of nvdbps is needed the svdbp toxicity results agreed well with the results for the vdbps captured using the extraction system however the svdbps even resulted in higher toxicity than vdbps captured in the cold trap fig s10 and table s13 suggesting there might be few unknown vdbps or the unknown vdbps toxicity might be relatively low studies focused on identifying and assessing the toxicities of nvdbps should therefore be performed in future recently some newly identified nvdbps e g haloacetamides halobenzoquinones and aromatic halogenated dbps have been found to be very toxic plewa et al 2008b wang et al 2014 2018 yang and zhang 2013 effort should be made to identify emerging dbps such as using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and high resolution mass spectrometry to improve our understanding of nvdbps yang et al 2019 5 conclusions in conclusion vdbps contributed only small proportions of the tox concentrations vdbp contributions to the tocl ranged from 14 to 20 and contributions to the tobr were around 10 compared with nvdbps vdbps showed much lower cytotoxicity and dna dsb based genotoxicity moreover vdbps had lower ability to induce ros and cause dna rna oxidative damage in cho cells compared with exposing to nvdbps when cho cells exposing to the mixtures of vdbps and nvdbps adbps both higher cytotoxicity ros and dna rna oxidative damage levels were observed moreover the spiked known vdbps showed higher toxicity than the captured vdbps suggesting there might be few unknown vdbps or the unknown vdbps toxicity is relatively low vdbps like trihalomethanes have been well studied and proven to be risky to humans our study found nvdbps are even more toxic therefore future research should focus more on nvdbps and identifying toxicity drivers from nvdbps declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

17756,groundwater flow has the potential to introduce arsenic as in previously uncontaminated aquifers the extent to which as transport is retarded by adsorption is particularly relevant in bangladesh where low as wells offer the best chance of reducing chronic exposure to as of a large rural population dependent on groundwater in this study column experiments were conducted with intact cores in the field to measure as retardation freshly collected cores of reduced iron fe ii dominated gray sediment of holocene age as well as oxidized fe iii coated orange sediment of pleistocene age were eluted at pore water velocities of 40 230 cm day with anoxic groundwater pumped directly from a well and containing 320 μg l as up to 100 μg l as was immediately released from gray sand but the main as breakthrough for both gray and orange sand occurred between 30 and 70 pore volumes depending on flow rate the early release of as from gray sand is attributed to the presence of a weakly bound pool of as the sorption of as was kinetically limited in both gray and orange sand columns we used a reversible multi reaction transport model to simulate as breakthrough curves while keeping the model parameters as constant as possible contrary to the notion that dissolved as is sorbed more strongly to orange sands we show that as was similarly retarded in both gray and orange sands in the field graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic groundwater transport column experiment kinetic model bangladesh 1 introduction millions of people in south and southeast asia drink groundwater pumped from low as 10 μg l alluvial aquifers typically composed of oxidized fe iii oxide coated orange sediment of pleistocene age dphe bgs 2001 ravenscroft et al 2009 fendorf et al 2010 these aquifers are often in close proximity to high as anoxic holocene aquifers composed of gray sediment often containing naturally elevated levels of as 100 μg l released by the microbial reduction of iron oxy hydroxides bhattacharya et al 1997 nickson et al 1998 dphe bgs 2001 berg et al 2001 ahmed et al 2004 low as aquifers can be contaminated by flow from high as aquifers but migration of as is affected by sorption to sediments during groundwater flow ravenscroft et al 2009 understanding the partitioning of as between groundwater and aquifer sediment that contain a sizeable pool 1 5 mg kg of adsorbed as zheng et al 2005 van geen et al 2008 is therefore important to predict the vulnerability of low as aquifers the partitioning of as between the solid and aqueous phase is often described using an empirical partition coefficient kd the ratio of the as concentration in the solid phase divided by the as concentration in the dissolved phase this approximation is useful to describe transport under near equilibrium and stable conditions baes and sharp 1983 kd estimates are affected by groundwater ph competing oxyanions such as phosphate bicarbonate and silicate the oxidation state of as and sediment mineralogy smedley and kinniburgh 2002 dixit and hering 2003 thi hoa mai et al 2014 the equilibrium assumption is less appropriate when groundwater flow is accelerated for example by pumping for irrigation or the municipal supply of large cities michael and voss 2008 knappett et al 2016 khan et al 2016 mozumder et al 2020 mihajlov et al 2020 indeed recent laboratory and field studies have suggested that as transport is a non equilibrium or rate limited process darland and inskeep 1997 zhang and selim 2005 2008 selim 2014 despite these limitations a kd can still be useful to predict as transport in aquifers where groundwater velocities are relatively well constrained by field measurements of environmental tracers isotopes in groundwater mozumder et al 2020 in gray holocene sediment as is thought to be efficiently transported because few sorption sites are available for as harvey et al 2002 swartz et al 2004 however laboratory and field experiments suggest adsorption can still occur in gray sand aquifers dphe bgs 2001 harvey et al 2002 swartz et al 2004 van geen et al 2008 itai et al 2010 jung et al 2012 thi hoa mai et al 2014 radloff et al 2015 the wide range of kd values of 0 15 46 l kg derived from these experiments corresponds to retardation factors of 2 300 assuming an aquifer material bulk density of 1 8 g cm3 and a porosity of 30 it is unclear to what extent this reflects variations in experimental conditions e g duration of experiment sediment properties or preservation or other factors such as kinetic limitations that prevent equilibrium adsorption desorption the extent of adsorption of as to orange sediments may differ from adsorption to gray sands and thought to provide significant protection against the intrusion of high as groundwater stollenwerk et al 2007 mcarthur et al 2011 robinson et al 2011 radloff et al 2011 van geen et al 2013 laboratory studies conducted in batch mode generally indicate higher kd values 20 70 l kg retardation of 120 420 in orange compared to gray sands some of these laboratory experiments may have been affected by sediment storage repacking of sediment and the use of artificial groundwater that is not representative of field conditions field based studies on the other hand are not affected by storage but are subject to different uncertainties such as aquifer mineralogy groundwater composition and the direction rate of groundwater flow field studies often indicate a lower kd of 1 10 l kg for originally orange sand that in some cases turned gray mihajlov et al 2020 and therefore lower retardation factors of 7 60 mcarthur et al 2011 radloff et al 2011 van geen et al 2013 here we used a novel hybrid of field and experimental research to study as transport in gray and orange sediments reacted with anaerobic groundwater under ambient conditions the fresh sediments used are from intact cores to ensure that their sediment microbial community mineralogy and redox state are unaffected by storage high as anoxic groundwater pumped directly from a shallow well was eluted for the present study at different rates through a series of columns containing intact fresh gray and orange aquifer sediment and monitored in the field under anaerobic conditions we hypothesized when designing this study that orange sands would show greater retention than gray sands and thus more effectively protect low as aquifers from the intrusion of as containing groundwater the need for a reliable measure of as retention in both reduced gray and oxidized orange sands to assess the long term vulnerability and sustainability of low as aquifers motivated the study 2 material and methods 2 1 sediment coring and column preparation sediment cores containing holocene gray sand and pleistocene orange sand were collected in araihazar bangladesh immediately before the experiment fig 1 intact cores were retrieved 30 cm long 1 8 cm outer diameter using a hammer driven soil corer ams 424 45 from drilling depths between 12 2 and 18 3 m immediately after retrieval the cores were refrigerated in nitrogen flushed mylar bags that were heat sealed after adding oxygen absorbers impak sorbent systems within 24 h and inside a nitrogen inflated glove chamber glas col04408 38 a total of 15 undisturbed sediment columns 8 gray and 7 orange sediment columns 7 5 cm in length and 1 6 cm in diameter were prepared from the central portion of the recovered cores using a precision tube cutter the inlets and outlets of the columns were enclosed with custom made plugs after inserting a thin layer of glass wool to prevent the loss of fine particles a column packed with pure sand acros organics 370942500 was prepared in parallel as a control 2 2 experimental setup the gray and orange sediment columns along with a sand column containing 99 8 sio2 quartz and 0 01 iron oxide mesh size 40 100 were eluted with groundwater directly at the wellhead from a shallow well screened from 18 to 20 m a depth where as concentrations typically peak in the study area fig s1c the influent groundwater from the shallow well was pumped continuously at a rate of 8 l min into a bag 50 l capacity shaped like a pyramid that was kept overflowing through a narrow opening at the top to ensure a constant supply of anoxic groundwater fig 2 the storage bag was placed at a higher elevation than the columns to ensure uninterrupted steady flow in the event of a pump stoppage or electricity failure the custom made bag ready containment llc facilitated escape of gas bubbles that tend to cling to the corners of a regular container groundwater from the storage bag reached a manifold that divided the flow into the columns at different rates using peristaltic pumps gilson minipuls 3 and various tubing diameters the columns were housed in custom made anoxic chambers modified becton dickinson 260672 with pouches that consume oxygen becton dickinson 260678 and anaerobic indicator strips becton dickinson 271051 the columns were placed inside the chamber in their natural orientation with the groundwater entering the top of each column fig 2 and with sufficient backpressure to prevent gravity flow and degassing of the experiments performed a total of 10 sediment columns 6 gray and 4 orange sand columns were successfully completed and 5 were compromised due to repeated flow interruption we focus here on the 10 successful columns most of the columns n 8 were eluted either at an average pore water velocity pwv of 154 10 cm day or 75 10 cm day in addition one orange sand column was eluted at 40 cm day and one column of gray sand was eluted at 230 cm day table 1 2 3 sampling and onsite measurements column effluents were collected in a manually operated fraction collector in acid leached 10 hcl 15 ml vials every 1 3 h for the first 10 days of the experiment followed by every 12 h for 2 weeks the sample volume was documented at the time of collection every other sample was acidified in the field with tracemetal grade hcl some of the remaining samples remained unacidified for anion analysis while others were acidified later in the lab with optima grade hcl for cation analysis after 20 days groundwater flow into the storage bag was interrupted and the retained water in the bag was spiked with sodium bromide fisher s255 500 at about 120 mg l and sodium phosphate monobasic dihydrate fisher s381 500 at about 6 mg l fig s2d and h the purpose of spiking with bromide and phosphate was to characterize sediment porosity and column dispersion and the effect of phosphate exchange respectively the influent groundwater was sampled daily at an outlet before it reached the storage bag and from the bottom of the storage bag fig 2 dissolved oxygen concentration in the influent water was tested daily with a visual kit chemetrics 0 40 ppb the input water was also monitored daily for ph orp oxidation reduction potential electrical conductivity and temperature using oakton probes ux 35650 10 and ux 35634 30 a ph flow through cell ux 05662 48 was used to measure ph in a subset of column effluents arsenic speciation cartridges were used in the field to separate as v from as iii in the influent water as well as in a subset of column effluents immediately after collection meng et al 2001 samples for dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic were collected in 22 ml clear glass vials sigma aldrich 27173 supelco the doc samples were acidified to 0 1 hcl while dic samples were left unacidified 2 4 sediment analyses 2 4 1 reflectance spectroscopy sediment cuttings collected while drilling were packed in plastic saran wrap a konica minolta cm 600d spectrophotometer was used to measure the difference in diffuse spectral reflectance between 530 and 520 nm horneman et al 2004 through the plastic wrap soon after the samples were collected as a proxy for the redox state of surficial fe oxides fig s1a b measurements were made in triplicate by the spectrophotometer and recorded for three different spots on each sample of cuttings 2 4 2 x ray fluorescence xrf and sediment phosphate extraction the saran wrapped sediment cuttings were also analyzed with a handheld x ray fluorescence analyzer innovx delta in 3 beam soil mode for bulk as concentration table 2 the internal calibration of the instrument was verified by analyzing reference nist standards srm 2709 2710 and 2711 in between samples as a measure of the exchangeable as content of the sediment 1 g of sand n 8 immersed in 55 ml n2 flushed 1 m na2hpo4 solution was adjusted to a ph of 5 for 24 h zheng et al 2005 the extraction was conducted in an anaerobic chamber coy 120001 and the solutions were filtered through 0 45 μm media 2 4 3 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas iron fe k edge x ray absorption spectra were collected on pristine gray and orange sediment cuttings in fluorescence mode at the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl on beamlines 4 1 and 11 2 fe spectra were collected using either 32 or 100 element ge detectors windowed on the fe kα fluorescence peak using a 3μx mn filter spectra were calibrated using a fe metal foil 7112 0 ev no photooxidation or reduction was observed during data collection spectral analysis was performed as detailed in shoenfelt et al 2018 fe ii content and mineral composition were determined by linear combination fitting using a combination of five of 10 reference compounds pyrite siderite goethite hematite magnetite biotite augite hornblende nontronite ferrihydrite that produced the best fit this approach is effective at identifying major or more distinct minerals but less abundant minerals may be omitted from fits even when present at concentrations less than 10 silicate minerals are often similar so nontronite and biotite should be regarded as trioctahedral fe iii and dioctahedral fe ii phyllosilicates and augite fits are representative of fe ii iii silicates including hornblende errors in mineral composition usually within 5 of total fe are based on sensitivity analysis and fitting quality newville 2001 this method is effective for most iron minerals but combines ferrihydrite and nanocrystalline goethite into a single reactive fe iii oxyhydroxide group sun et al 2018 2 5 analyses of groundwater and sediment extracts all acidified 1 hcl samples collected from the input well storage tank column effluents and sediment extracts were analyzed for p s fe mn as na k ca mg ba and sr using high resolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry hr icp ms with a detection limit of 0 1 μg l accounting for all dilutions cheng et al 2004 the results from the hr icp ms were replicated for a subset of groundwater samples with a precision of 5 the accuracy and precision of the measurements were within 10 when compared to known laboratory standards the anions br cl f and so4 2 were analyzed using a dionex integrion hpic system dionex thermo scientific with an as 18 column which has detection limits of 0 05 ppm and a precision of 5 at typical concentrations sulfide concentrations were not measured but were generally low based on the correspondence between total s by icpms and sulfate measured by ic doc and dic concentrations were analyzed for input solutions with a shimadzu carbon analyzer with 5 precision at lamont doherty earth observatory 2 6 column transport parameterization the darcy velocity was calculated by dividing the average volume of samples by the cross sectional area of columns 2 cm2 and average sampling interval and ranged from 0 5 to 3 cm h the average bulk density ρ ranged between 1 7 and 1 9 g cm3 of the columns was determined from oven dried sediment weight divided by the volume of dry sediment column table 1 the porosity θ ranged between 0 29 and 0 34 was then estimated as θ 1 ρ 2 65 assuming a particle density of 2 65 g cm3 the dispersion coefficient d was determined 1 5 and 3 cm2 h for slow and fast pwv respectively by fitting the bromide br breakthrough curve using the analytical solution for one dimensional advection dispersion equation assuming conservative transport of br i e a retardation factor of 1 in the sand columns fig s3 2 7 model formulation we used a single phase as well as a two phase reversible non linear kinetic model selim 2014 to predict the observed as breakthrough after modifying it to accommodate an initial exchangeable pool of as the central scenario is based on the two phase model because the retention and release of solute was time dependent under the experimental conditions kinetic reactions were employed instead of a local equilibrium assumption we used the one dimensional advection dispersion equation to formulate the transport of arsenic in the sediment columns lapidus and amundson 1952 1 θ c t ρ s t θd 2 c 2 x v c x where θ indicates the porosity of sand columns dimensionless ρ is the sediment bulk density g cm3 c represents solute concentration mg l s

2 4 s s 1 s 2 where the parameters k 1 and k 3 are the forward rate constant hr 1 k 2 and k 4 are the reverse rate constants hr 1 and n is the reaction order which is also a measure of variability in sorption sites in terms of arsenic retention zhang and selim 2005 selim 2014 the sorbed phase s 1 is assumed to react rapidly with the dissolved concentration c whereas sorbed phase s 2 is assumed to react slowly with c the single phase model assumes s 2 0 mg kg the numerical transport models were simulated using a gaussian elimination method carnahan et al 1969 selim 2014 the two phase model assumes a any initial release of as is due to desorption from an initial rapidly exchanged pool of sorbed as b the pool of total sorbed as s in the sediment is comprised of two components the first phase s 1 is the fast reacting phosphate extractable as and the second phase s 2 is a slow reacting phase which is the difference between the bulk sediment as concentration s and s 1 the adsorbed pools of as in s 1 and s 2 are estimated based on total as and laboratory phosphate extractions table 2 for a single solid phase the initial sorbed concentrations were adjusted while keeping the same k 1 and k 2 associated with s 1 used in the two phase model table s1 3 results 3 1 sediment properties bulk as concentrations measured by xrf in the gray holocene sediment ranged between 1 and 4 mg kg n 7 table 2 bulk as concentrations in the pleistocene orange sediment ranged from 1 8 to 3 0 mg kg n 7 in gray sand iron fe and calcium ca concentrations averaged 1 5 and 6 9 g kg respectively overall the orange sediment contained a higher concentration of fe 2 5 and a lower concentration of ca 4 4 g kg than gray sediment the difference in reflectance δr 530 nm 520 nm averaged 0 22 n 11 for gray sands which corresponds to about 80 fe ii in the hot acid leachable fraction of fe ii iii oxides in the sediment the δr for the orange sands averaged 1 1 n 10 which indicates the absence of detectable fe ii in the fraction of hot acid leachable fe oxides the average proportions of fe ii measured by xas analysis in freshly collected gray and orange sediments were 82 6 and 8 3 n 2 respectively the most abundant fe mineral classes in the gray sediment were fe silicates 20 3 biotite and 57 4 fe ii iii silicates with small and variable proportion of goethite siderite and little if any reactive fe oxides table 3 in contrast the orange sediments were primarily composed of reactive fe oxides 65 6 and small quantities of goethite nontronite and fe ii iii silicates phosphate extractations were used to differentiate labile and nonlabile as pools the gray sediment contains an average of about 3 mg kg of total as and about half 50 of that is p extractable table 2 the orange sediment also contains an average of about 2 mg kg of as but only about 15 is p extractable therefore on an average the gray sediment contains five times more p extractable as than orange sediment 3 2 influent groundwater composition the source groundwater selected to elute the sediment columns was consistently high in dissolved as 320 11 μg l and fe 7 0 4 mg l over the course of the experiment fig s2a b and e the water contained moderately high levels of manganese 3 mg l mn phosphate 1 5 mg l as p sulfate 3 mg l as so4 s and bicarbonate 104 mg l as dic figs s1e g and s2c d f there was no detectable dissolved oxygen in the groundwater do kit reading of 0 ppb the orp readings remained negative 105 to 134 mv and the ph was consistent at 7 0 0 1 throughout the experimental period fig s2i j the composition of groundwater remained unaltered in the overflowing storage bag arsenic was present mainly as as iii 90 in groundwater collected from the well and the storage bag n 8 each fig s2e the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in the input groundwater was about 3 mg l 3 3 initial effluent data for as and other redox sensitive parameters 3 3 1 pleistocene orange sediment columns concentrations of as remained below 10 μg l in the effluent for about 40 pore volumes pv in the two orange sand columns eluted at a pore water velocity pwv of about 80 cm day fig 3 b but only for 10 pv at pwvs of 156 cm day and 40 cm day fig 3a and c initial breakthrough of as 50 of the input concentration of 320 μg l was observed after about 50 pv at a pwv of 156 cm day and after 70 pv in a column with a pwv of 80 cm day breakthrough of as did not quite reach 50 in the 40 cm day pwv column in all columns fe concentrations in the effluent remained below 1 mg l despite a high input of 7 mg l of fe fig 3d f in contrast s levels in the effluent started immediately about 20 above the influent concentration of 3 mg l and dropped to 50 of the input 1 5 mg l after about 100 pv at 156 cm day pwv after 70 pv at 80 cm day pwv and after only 20 pv at a pwv of 40 cm day fig 3g i the inflow contained 1 5 mg l p most of which was retained in orange sand columns for the entire experiment fig 3j l 3 3 2 holocene gray sediment columns concentrations of as in the first 50 pv of effluent from the gray columns were consistently higher than for the orange columns and varied between 10 and 200 μg l fig 4 a c for the 4 fast flow columns at a pwv of 150 230 cm day as concentrations gradually increased to reach the inflow concentration of 320 μg l at about 60 70 pv and up to about 500 μg l at about 80 pv fig 4a and c for 1 out of the 2 slow flow gray sand columns eluted at a pwv of 72 cm day effluent as concentrations reached the influent level at about 40 pv while both slow flow columns reached the initial breakthrough at about 30 pv fig 4b in contrast to the orange columns concentrations of fe in the effluent reached inflow concentration of 7 mg l after 70 and 30 pv in the fast and slow flow columns of gray sand respectively fig 4d e about 10 20 pv later concentration of fe in effluent from the gray sediment columns reached 15 20 mg l as in the case of the orange sand columns concentrations of s in effluent from the gray sand columns started immediately at 3 5 mg l somewhat higher than the inflow and dropped below 50 of the input after 70 pv and at 30 pv for the fast and slow flow columns of gray sand respectively fig 4g and h unlike the orange sediment columns concentrations of p in effluent from the gray sediment columns gradually rose for both the fast flow and the slow flow columns fig 4j l 3 3 3 pure sand column arsenic and iron concentrations in effluent from the pure sand column reached levels of the inflow within about 10 pv and then showed fluctuations around an average that is slightly below that of the input fig 5 a and b concentration of p in the effluent took about 60 pv to reach about two thirds of the inflow concentration fig 5d as in the case of orange and gray columns figs 3g i and 4g i concentrations of s started a little above concentration in the inflow and then declined steadily to 0 5 mg l at about 100 pv fig 5c 3 4 effluent data from the later phase of the experiment the later phases of the experiment were affected by the redox chemistry of fe and s in most cases well after as breakthrough figs s4 and s5 the changes in fe and s concentrations during the experiments were distinct from the breakthrough curves and showed both transient pulses in fe and a rapid decline in effluent s concentrations figs s4d i and s5d i iron concentrations were generally low and only increased above 1 mg l after about 150 pv in the orange sand columns fig s4d and e sulfur concentrations in the effluent dropped to 0 5 mg l in both orange and gray sediment columns primarily after the initial breakthrough of as took place following the precipitous drop s in the effluent briefly rose above 0 5 mg l in the orange sand columns but only after 150 pv at 156 or 80 pwv and after 50 pv at 80 pwv fig s4g i the later effluent data also showed multiple breakthroughs of as in both gray and orange sand columns figs s4a b and s5a b the present study focuses on the early as breakthrough rather than the subsequent changes in effluent chemistry 4 discussion 4 1 transport of arsenic and other redox sensitive parameters typical breakthrough curves for reactive non conservative ion transport through sediments typically show strong retention until the mineral phases are saturated with ions and then rapid and complete breakthrough selim 2014 arsenic transport in the present experiments was more complex with early and partial breakthrough and effluent as levels that did not stabilize figs 3a c and 4a c despite these differences several common features were observed in most columns there are multiple pools of as in gray and orange sands and desorption from the more weakly retained pool by phosphate appears to enhance elution in gray columns in which about half of as was found in this phosphate extractable pool table 2 the data suggest that this as pool is efficiently released into the effluent from the onset of the experiment fig 4a c there was also a short lived pulse of as released into solution when four times higher than the input phosphate level was added to groundwater figs s2d and s7 suggesting the rise of effluent as beyond the input level could also be attributed to competitive desorption by phosphate the mechanism can also be described as a snow plough effect where an incoming solution with a high solute concentration displaces resident cations from the exchange sites barry et al 1983 in orange sediments the labile pool is much smaller and as is to a large extent retained during the early stages of transport fig 3a c the breakthrough of as after the initial release phase in the gray sediment columns is more rapid than that in orange sediment columns indicating a pool of as in orange sand becomes irreversibly adsorbed over time a rapid early rise in as concentrations followed by a slower approach to equilibrium is consistent with previous experiments conducted with orange sand radloff et al 2011 a possible alternative explanation is that gray sediments may have less effectively sorbed as than orange sediments under the experimental conditions in most of the columns the initial breakthrough of as occurred within 30 70 pv depending on the flow rate figs 3a b and 4a c the differences in as breakthrough as a function of pwv indicates that adsorption is kinetically limited under the range of experimental conditions darland and inskeep 1997 due to kinetic limitation the breakthrough of as takes place earlier at fast pwv as a function of time while slower flow allows for increased reaction times increased adsorption and delayed or partial breakthrough given kinetic limitation as transport is more consistent between columns when plotted as a function of time rather than pore volume fig 6 kinetic limitation was also reflected in other redox sensitive parameters sulfur in particular was consumed in the effluent earlier at slower pwv figs 3g i and 4g i but at around the same time when plotted as a function of time the initial effluent data show that as transport was affected primarily by adsorption and desorption which is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies e g stollenwerk et al 2007 changes in fe and s redox status were observed mostly during the later phases of the experiment when they affected both as speciation and fe mineralogy figs s4 and s5 the delay in redox transformation can be attributed to lag phase microbial growth which is widespread and occurs during the time microbes adapt to changing groundwater conditions for example a metabolic time lag of up to 20 days was observed between acetate addition and the onset of s reduction at the uranium mill tailings site in colorado druhan et al 2012 indicating prolonged suppression of s reducing bacterial activity similarly experimental data in our columns indicate a significant lag time of about 100 120 h in the build up of s reducing bacteria prior to the onset of any noticeable s reduction we conclude that s reduction affected the transport properties of as sorption only after s was removed from column effluents the extent of fe reduction in these columns was evidently limited by the availability of reactive doc assuming 1 mol of doc is required to reduce 4 mol of fe iii to 4 mol of fe ii postma et al 2007 3 mg l of entirely reactive doc supplied could have reduced 80 of the entire volume of the orange sand to gray after three weeks of flow period based on a simple stoichiometric calculation mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 visual inspection of sediment color however did not reveal such a dramatic change in the redox state of fe suggesting little as was released due fe reductive compared to the high concentration of 320 μg l as in the inflow water unlike as both fe and p were more effectively sequestered onto the orange sand than in gray sand figs 3d f j l and 4d f j l the average bulk fe content in the orange sediment columns 2 4 is about 1 higher than that in gray sand columns 1 5 the proportion of fe iii in orange sand is almost one order of magnitude higher than that in gray sand the data suggest sequestration of p and fe ii was enhanced in orange sands containing a higher proportion of fe iii minerals 4 2 modeling arsenic transport a direct comparison of as transport in gray and orange sediments is possible by comparing the early stage elution of as from columns adsorption and desorption of as was the predominant process during this interval and as breakthrough was observed in many columns figs 3a b and 4a c later in the experiment redox transformations became more important and likely affected as partitioning it is difficult to separate adsorption desorption processes from redox processes using a simple model for this reason our modeling effort is focused here on the first 3 5 days of as data that were largely unaffected by redox processes in order to simulate the observations an average input as concentration of 320 μg l porosity of 0 32 bulk density of 1 80 g cm3 and a reaction order of 0 4 a fitting parameter were used the variable transport parameters were the measured flow velocities corresponding dispersion coefficient initial sorbed phase as concentrations and associated forward k1 k3 and reverse k2 k4 rate constants for the two phase fully reversible kinetic model the initial sorbed phases s 1 and s 2 for the gray sand were 1 5 and 1 5 mg kg s 3 mg kg respectively whereas for the orange sand they were 0 3 and 1 7 mg kg s 2 mg kg respectively table s1 the adjusted initial sorbed as concentration for the single phase kinetic model were 2 and 0 5 mg kg for the gray and orange sediment columns respectively for the two phase transport model one single set of rate constants was used for all gray sediment columns and another single set for all orange sediment columns irrespective of pwv fig 6a and b the forward and reverse rate constants determined for the gray sediment columns associated with s 1 are 6 h 1 k1 and 0 17 h 1 k2 and for s 2 are 0 01 h 1 k3 and 0 008 h 1 k4 respectively the two phase model reproduced effluent concentrations with an initial release starting at c c0 0 1 as well as exceedance c c0 1 1 above the influent level in gray sediments a single solid phase model k1 6 h 1 and k2 0 17 h 1 can also predict as breakthrough with an initial release but fails to reproduce a higher concentration than that in the inflow i e c c0 1 fig 6d the initial release of as is a function of the amount of weakly retained pool of sorbed as that is susceptible to desorption fig 6f with the two phase model the forward and reverse rate constants determined for the orange sand columns for s 1 are 2 h 1 k 1 and 0 057 h 1 k 2 and for s 2 are 0 01 h 1 k3 and 0 008 h 1 k 4 fig 6a the rate constants associated with the fast reacting phase s 1 are three fold smaller than that in gray sand the rates associated with the slow reacting phase s 2 are the same derived for gray sand k3 0 01 h 1 and k4 0 008 h 1 because s 1 is 5 times smaller than that in gray sand 0 3 compared to 1 5 mg kg the initial release of as is insignificant fig 6a and c a single phase model k1 2 h 1 and k2 0 07 h 1 can also be used to adequately describe the breakthrough of as in orange sediment columns fig 6c due to a higher fraction of weakly bound as in the gray sand columns larger rate constants were needed to predict as breakthrough if we ignore the initial as release and overshoot c c0 1 portion of the effluent data and focus on the main breakthrough the same set of rate constants used for orange sand k 1 2 h 1 and k 2 0 07 h 1 could also be applied for gray sand e g fig 6e the shallow groundwater is generally low in p in the area and ideally will not desorb as at the rate we observed in these experimental columns the smaller set of rate constants are comparable to the sorption and desorption coefficients determined for arsenite in earlier studies elkhatib et al 1984a b barrachina et al 1996 4 3 retardation of arsenic the apparent retention of as in the experimental columns can be determined from the ratio of forward and reverse rate constants k 1 k 2 30 to 35 the as retention factor or retardation factor is the ratio of the adsorbed pool that is retained within the solid matrix to the much smaller desorbed pool that goes into the solution the transport of as in bangladesh groundwater therefore appears to be retarded by a factor of 30 35 relative to the flow of groundwater by both gray and orange sediments this is surprising but not inconsistent with recent findings from batch adsorption experiments conducted under carefully controlled conditions thi hoa mai et al 2014 a retardation factor rf of 30 35 corresponds to a kd of about 5 6 l kg according to the following equations assuming a sediment bulk density of 1 8 g cm3 and porosity of 0 32 5 r f 1 ρ θ k d 6 k d θ r f 1 ρ the estimated kd of about 5 6 l kg is similar to low range partition coefficients determined with batch equilibrium experiments for holocene gray sediments in bangladesh van geen et al 2008 and mid range estimates from field observations for pleistocene sands that were reduced over time in west bengal india mcarthur et al 2008 2011 and near hanoi in vietnam van geen et al 2013 4 4 vulnerability of low arsenic aquifers to pumping an earlier as breakthrough at accelerated flow rates in the experimental columns fig 6 suggest sedimentary aquifers of bangladesh that are perturbed by pumping are more vulnerable to as contamination irrespective of the redox status and age of aquifer sediment irrigation pumping for growing rice largely impacts the shallow groundwater flow system of bangladesh harvey et al 2002 van geen et al 2008 whereas municipal pumping has significantly altered the deeper flow systems over the past two decades michael and voss 2008 knappett et al 2016 khan et al 2016 mozumder et al 2020 mihajlov et al 2020 these perturbations are likely to reduce as retardation over time and accelerate the spread of as in adversely as affected rural areas at our study site in araihazar bangladesh a groundwater flow model constrained with hydraulic head measurements has shown that shallow groundwater 30 m can penetrate the intermediate 40 90 m low as aquifers within 7 83 years after recharge mozumder et al 2020 the simulations are consistent with the age of groundwater 11 69 years measured at 14 monitoring wells screened between 50 and 70 m on the basis of tritium helium 3h 3he dating technique stute et al 2007 no systematic correlation between high low as and detectable undetectable 3h in the intermediate aquifer indicated instead a different source of as than that from the shallow aquifer assuming shallow groundwater as is retarded by a factor of 30 as determined in the present study the intermediate wells are protected against the downward migration of as in the area for 1000 years average groundwater age of 35 years multiplied by 30 this is important because over the past decade the number of privately installed intermediate wells tapping the low as pleistocene aquifer has quadrupled in the study area and probably elsewhere in bangladesh mozumder et al 2020 if adsorption provides significant protection against the downward migration of as deep wells that are low in as 10 μg l today will remain low in as for many decades indeed more than a decade 2002 2015 of monitoring of a dozen deep community wells cw 2 5 7 34 36 41 43 45 48 installed between 90 and 170 m in araihazar indicates stable groundwater as concentrations of 1 to 10 μg l this appears to be the case in south central bangladesh where 13 years of continuous monitoring data in a total of 46 deep wells 150 m deep revealed a relatively stable groundwater composition ravenscroft et al 2013 the results do not mean as concentrations in deep aquifers of bangladesh will remain low everywhere nine out of 927 deep wells 90 m deep tested during a blanket survey in 2012 13 in the study area were elevated 50 μg l in as van geen et al 2014 choudhury et al 2016 intermediate aquifers affected by pumping appear to be especially vulnerable to as contamination and should therefore be monitored more frequently mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 5 conclusions field based column experiments require some effort to set up but allowed us to study the reactive transport of as through sediment with fewer perturbations than most previous experiments during the initial period as transport in the experimental columns was primarily controlled by adsorption and desorption allowing us to determine a set of rate constants using a multi reaction transport model the estimated apparent kd of 5 6 l kg suggests significant protection of low as deep aquifers against the intrusion of shallow high as groundwater apparently because of a delay in microbial responses the reduction of s and fe became important only during the

17756,groundwater flow has the potential to introduce arsenic as in previously uncontaminated aquifers the extent to which as transport is retarded by adsorption is particularly relevant in bangladesh where low as wells offer the best chance of reducing chronic exposure to as of a large rural population dependent on groundwater in this study column experiments were conducted with intact cores in the field to measure as retardation freshly collected cores of reduced iron fe ii dominated gray sediment of holocene age as well as oxidized fe iii coated orange sediment of pleistocene age were eluted at pore water velocities of 40 230 cm day with anoxic groundwater pumped directly from a well and containing 320 μg l as up to 100 μg l as was immediately released from gray sand but the main as breakthrough for both gray and orange sand occurred between 30 and 70 pore volumes depending on flow rate the early release of as from gray sand is attributed to the presence of a weakly bound pool of as the sorption of as was kinetically limited in both gray and orange sand columns we used a reversible multi reaction transport model to simulate as breakthrough curves while keeping the model parameters as constant as possible contrary to the notion that dissolved as is sorbed more strongly to orange sands we show that as was similarly retarded in both gray and orange sands in the field graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic groundwater transport column experiment kinetic model bangladesh 1 introduction millions of people in south and southeast asia drink groundwater pumped from low as 10 μg l alluvial aquifers typically composed of oxidized fe iii oxide coated orange sediment of pleistocene age dphe bgs 2001 ravenscroft et al 2009 fendorf et al 2010 these aquifers are often in close proximity to high as anoxic holocene aquifers composed of gray sediment often containing naturally elevated levels of as 100 μg l released by the microbial reduction of iron oxy hydroxides bhattacharya et al 1997 nickson et al 1998 dphe bgs 2001 berg et al 2001 ahmed et al 2004 low as aquifers can be contaminated by flow from high as aquifers but migration of as is affected by sorption to sediments during groundwater flow ravenscroft et al 2009 understanding the partitioning of as between groundwater and aquifer sediment that contain a sizeable pool 1 5 mg kg of adsorbed as zheng et al 2005 van geen et al 2008 is therefore important to predict the vulnerability of low as aquifers the partitioning of as between the solid and aqueous phase is often described using an empirical partition coefficient kd the ratio of the as concentration in the solid phase divided by the as concentration in the dissolved phase this approximation is useful to describe transport under near equilibrium and stable conditions baes and sharp 1983 kd estimates are affected by groundwater ph competing oxyanions such as phosphate bicarbonate and silicate the oxidation state of as and sediment mineralogy smedley and kinniburgh 2002 dixit and hering 2003 thi hoa mai et al 2014 the equilibrium assumption is less appropriate when groundwater flow is accelerated for example by pumping for irrigation or the municipal supply of large cities michael and voss 2008 knappett et al 2016 khan et al 2016 mozumder et al 2020 mihajlov et al 2020 indeed recent laboratory and field studies have suggested that as transport is a non equilibrium or rate limited process darland and inskeep 1997 zhang and selim 2005 2008 selim 2014 despite these limitations a kd can still be useful to predict as transport in aquifers where groundwater velocities are relatively well constrained by field measurements of environmental tracers isotopes in groundwater mozumder et al 2020 in gray holocene sediment as is thought to be efficiently transported because few sorption sites are available for as harvey et al 2002 swartz et al 2004 however laboratory and field experiments suggest adsorption can still occur in gray sand aquifers dphe bgs 2001 harvey et al 2002 swartz et al 2004 van geen et al 2008 itai et al 2010 jung et al 2012 thi hoa mai et al 2014 radloff et al 2015 the wide range of kd values of 0 15 46 l kg derived from these experiments corresponds to retardation factors of 2 300 assuming an aquifer material bulk density of 1 8 g cm3 and a porosity of 30 it is unclear to what extent this reflects variations in experimental conditions e g duration of experiment sediment properties or preservation or other factors such as kinetic limitations that prevent equilibrium adsorption desorption the extent of adsorption of as to orange sediments may differ from adsorption to gray sands and thought to provide significant protection against the intrusion of high as groundwater stollenwerk et al 2007 mcarthur et al 2011 robinson et al 2011 radloff et al 2011 van geen et al 2013 laboratory studies conducted in batch mode generally indicate higher kd values 20 70 l kg retardation of 120 420 in orange compared to gray sands some of these laboratory experiments may have been affected by sediment storage repacking of sediment and the use of artificial groundwater that is not representative of field conditions field based studies on the other hand are not affected by storage but are subject to different uncertainties such as aquifer mineralogy groundwater composition and the direction rate of groundwater flow field studies often indicate a lower kd of 1 10 l kg for originally orange sand that in some cases turned gray mihajlov et al 2020 and therefore lower retardation factors of 7 60 mcarthur et al 2011 radloff et al 2011 van geen et al 2013 here we used a novel hybrid of field and experimental research to study as transport in gray and orange sediments reacted with anaerobic groundwater under ambient conditions the fresh sediments used are from intact cores to ensure that their sediment microbial community mineralogy and redox state are unaffected by storage high as anoxic groundwater pumped directly from a shallow well was eluted for the present study at different rates through a series of columns containing intact fresh gray and orange aquifer sediment and monitored in the field under anaerobic conditions we hypothesized when designing this study that orange sands would show greater retention than gray sands and thus more effectively protect low as aquifers from the intrusion of as containing groundwater the need for a reliable measure of as retention in both reduced gray and oxidized orange sands to assess the long term vulnerability and sustainability of low as aquifers motivated the study 2 material and methods 2 1 sediment coring and column preparation sediment cores containing holocene gray sand and pleistocene orange sand were collected in araihazar bangladesh immediately before the experiment fig 1 intact cores were retrieved 30 cm long 1 8 cm outer diameter using a hammer driven soil corer ams 424 45 from drilling depths between 12 2 and 18 3 m immediately after retrieval the cores were refrigerated in nitrogen flushed mylar bags that were heat sealed after adding oxygen absorbers impak sorbent systems within 24 h and inside a nitrogen inflated glove chamber glas col04408 38 a total of 15 undisturbed sediment columns 8 gray and 7 orange sediment columns 7 5 cm in length and 1 6 cm in diameter were prepared from the central portion of the recovered cores using a precision tube cutter the inlets and outlets of the columns were enclosed with custom made plugs after inserting a thin layer of glass wool to prevent the loss of fine particles a column packed with pure sand acros organics 370942500 was prepared in parallel as a control 2 2 experimental setup the gray and orange sediment columns along with a sand column containing 99 8 sio2 quartz and 0 01 iron oxide mesh size 40 100 were eluted with groundwater directly at the wellhead from a shallow well screened from 18 to 20 m a depth where as concentrations typically peak in the study area fig s1c the influent groundwater from the shallow well was pumped continuously at a rate of 8 l min into a bag 50 l capacity shaped like a pyramid that was kept overflowing through a narrow opening at the top to ensure a constant supply of anoxic groundwater fig 2 the storage bag was placed at a higher elevation than the columns to ensure uninterrupted steady flow in the event of a pump stoppage or electricity failure the custom made bag ready containment llc facilitated escape of gas bubbles that tend to cling to the corners of a regular container groundwater from the storage bag reached a manifold that divided the flow into the columns at different rates using peristaltic pumps gilson minipuls 3 and various tubing diameters the columns were housed in custom made anoxic chambers modified becton dickinson 260672 with pouches that consume oxygen becton dickinson 260678 and anaerobic indicator strips becton dickinson 271051 the columns were placed inside the chamber in their natural orientation with the groundwater entering the top of each column fig 2 and with sufficient backpressure to prevent gravity flow and degassing of the experiments performed a total of 10 sediment columns 6 gray and 4 orange sand columns were successfully completed and 5 were compromised due to repeated flow interruption we focus here on the 10 successful columns most of the columns n 8 were eluted either at an average pore water velocity pwv of 154 10 cm day or 75 10 cm day in addition one orange sand column was eluted at 40 cm day and one column of gray sand was eluted at 230 cm day table 1 2 3 sampling and onsite measurements column effluents were collected in a manually operated fraction collector in acid leached 10 hcl 15 ml vials every 1 3 h for the first 10 days of the experiment followed by every 12 h for 2 weeks the sample volume was documented at the time of collection every other sample was acidified in the field with tracemetal grade hcl some of the remaining samples remained unacidified for anion analysis while others were acidified later in the lab with optima grade hcl for cation analysis after 20 days groundwater flow into the storage bag was interrupted and the retained water in the bag was spiked with sodium bromide fisher s255 500 at about 120 mg l and sodium phosphate monobasic dihydrate fisher s381 500 at about 6 mg l fig s2d and h the purpose of spiking with bromide and phosphate was to characterize sediment porosity and column dispersion and the effect of phosphate exchange respectively the influent groundwater was sampled daily at an outlet before it reached the storage bag and from the bottom of the storage bag fig 2 dissolved oxygen concentration in the influent water was tested daily with a visual kit chemetrics 0 40 ppb the input water was also monitored daily for ph orp oxidation reduction potential electrical conductivity and temperature using oakton probes ux 35650 10 and ux 35634 30 a ph flow through cell ux 05662 48 was used to measure ph in a subset of column effluents arsenic speciation cartridges were used in the field to separate as v from as iii in the influent water as well as in a subset of column effluents immediately after collection meng et al 2001 samples for dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic were collected in 22 ml clear glass vials sigma aldrich 27173 supelco the doc samples were acidified to 0 1 hcl while dic samples were left unacidified 2 4 sediment analyses 2 4 1 reflectance spectroscopy sediment cuttings collected while drilling were packed in plastic saran wrap a konica minolta cm 600d spectrophotometer was used to measure the difference in diffuse spectral reflectance between 530 and 520 nm horneman et al 2004 through the plastic wrap soon after the samples were collected as a proxy for the redox state of surficial fe oxides fig s1a b measurements were made in triplicate by the spectrophotometer and recorded for three different spots on each sample of cuttings 2 4 2 x ray fluorescence xrf and sediment phosphate extraction the saran wrapped sediment cuttings were also analyzed with a handheld x ray fluorescence analyzer innovx delta in 3 beam soil mode for bulk as concentration table 2 the internal calibration of the instrument was verified by analyzing

adjusted to a ph of 5 for 24 h zheng et al 2005 the extraction was conducted in an anaerobic chamber coy 120001 and the solutions were filtered through 0 45 μm media 2 4 3 x ray absorption spectroscopy xas iron fe k edge x ray absorption spectra were collected on pristine gray and orange sediment cuttings in fluorescence mode at the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource ssrl on beamlines 4 1 and 11 2 fe spectra were collected using either 32 or 100 element ge detectors windowed on the fe kα fluorescence peak using a 3μx mn filter spectra were calibrated using a fe metal foil 7112 0 ev no photooxidation or reduction was observed during data collection spectral analysis was performed as detailed in shoenfelt et al 2018 fe ii content and mineral composition were determined by linear combination fitting using a combination of five of 10 reference compounds pyrite siderite goethite hematite magnetite biotite augite hornblende nontronite ferrihydrite that produced the best fit this approach is effective at identifying major or more distinct minerals but less abundant minerals may be omitted from fits even when present at concentrations less than 10 silicate minerals are often similar so nontronite and biotite should be regarded as trioctahedral fe iii and dioctahedral fe ii phyllosilicates and augite fits are representative of fe ii iii silicates including hornblende errors in mineral composition usually within 5 of total fe are based on sensitivity analysis and fitting quality newville 2001 this method is effective for most iron minerals but combines ferrihydrite and nanocrystalline goethite into a single reactive fe iii oxyhydroxide group sun et al 2018 2 5 analyses of groundwater and sediment extracts all acidified 1 hcl samples collected from the input well

by fitting the bromide br breakthrough curve using the analytical solution for one dimensional advection dispersion equation assuming conservative transport of br i e a retardation factor of 1 in the sand columns fig s3 2 7 model formulation we used a single phase as well as a two phase reversible non linear kinetic model selim 2014 to predict the observed as breakthrough after modifying it to accommodate an initial exchangeable pool of as the central scenario is based on the two phase model because the retention and release of solute was time dependent under the experimental conditions kinetic reactions were employed instead of a local equilibrium assumption we used the one dimensional advection dispersion equation to formulate the transport of arsenic in the sediment columns

assumes a any initial release of as is due to desorption from an initial rapidly exchanged pool of sorbed as b the pool of total sorbed as s in the sediment is comprised of two components the first phase s 1 is the fast reacting phosphate extractable as and the second phase s 2 is a slow reacting phase which is the difference between the bulk sediment as concentration s and s 1 the adsorbed

n 7 table 2 bulk as concentrations in the pleistocene orange sediment ranged from 1 8 to 3 0 mg kg n 7 in gray sand iron fe and calcium ca concentrations averaged 1 5 and 6 9 g kg respectively overall the orange sediment contained a higher concentration of fe 2 5 and a lower concentration of ca 4 4 g kg than gray sediment the difference in reflectance δr 530 nm 520 nm averaged 0 22 n 11 for gray sands which corresponds to about 80 fe ii in the hot acid leachable fraction of fe ii iii oxides in the sediment the δr for the orange sands averaged 1 1 n 10 which indicates the absence of detectable fe ii in the fraction of hot acid leachable fe oxides the average proportions of fe ii measured by xas analysis in freshly collected gray and orange sediments were 82 6 and 8 3 n 2 respectively the most abundant fe mineral classes in the gray sediment were fe silicates 20 3 biotite and 57 4 fe ii iii silicates with small and variable proportion of goethite siderite and little if any reactive fe oxides table 3 in contrast the orange sediments were primarily composed of reactive fe oxides 65 6 and small quantities of goethite nontronite and fe ii iii silicates phosphate extractations were used to differentiate labile and nonlabile as pools the gray sediment contains an average of about 3 mg kg of total as and about half 50 of that is p extractable table 2 the orange sediment also contains an average of about 2 mg kg of as but only about 15 is p extractable therefore on an average the gray sediment contains five times more p extractable as than orange sediment 3 2 influent groundwater composition the source groundwater selected to elute the sediment columns was consistently high in dissolved as 320 11 μg l and fe 7 0 4 mg l over the course of the experiment fig s2a b and e the water contained moderately high levels of manganese 3 mg l mn phosphate 1 5 mg l as p sulfate 3 mg l as so4 s and bicarbonate 104 mg l as dic figs s1e g and s2c d f there was no detectable dissolved oxygen in the groundwater do kit reading of 0 ppb the orp readings remained negative 105 to 134 mv and the ph was consistent at 7 0 0 1 throughout the experimental period fig s2i j the composition of groundwater remained unaltered in the overflowing storage bag arsenic was present mainly as as iii 90 in groundwater collected from the well and the storage bag n 8 each fig s2e the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration in the input groundwater was about 3 mg l 3 3 initial effluent data for as and other redox sensitive parameters 3 3 1 pleistocene orange sediment columns concentrations of as remained below 10 μg l in the effluent for about 40 pore volumes pv in the two orange sand columns eluted at a pore water velocity pwv of about 80 cm day fig 3 b but only for 10 pv at pwvs of 156 cm day and 40 cm day fig 3a and c initial breakthrough of as 50 of the input concentration of 320 μg l was observed after about 50 pv at a pwv of 156 cm day and after 70 pv in a column with a pwv of 80 cm day breakthrough of as did not quite reach 50 in the 40 cm day pwv column in all columns fe concentrations in the effluent remained below 1 mg l despite a high input of 7 mg l of fe fig 3d f in contrast s levels in the effluent started immediately about 20 above the influent concentration of 3 mg l and dropped to 50 of the input 1 5 mg l after about 100 pv at 156 cm day pwv after 70 pv at 80 cm day pwv and after only 20 pv at a pwv of 40 cm day fig 3g i the inflow contained 1 5 mg l p most of which was retained in orange sand columns for the entire experiment fig 3j l 3 3 2 holocene gray sediment columns concentrations of as in the first 50 pv of effluent from the gray columns were consistently higher than for the orange columns and varied between 10 and 200 μg l fig 4 a c for the 4 fast flow columns at a pwv of 150 230 cm day as concentrations gradually increased to reach the inflow concentration of 320 μg l at about 60 70 pv and up to about 500 μg l at about 80 pv fig 4a and c for 1 out of the 2 slow flow gray sand columns eluted at a pwv of 72 cm day effluent as concentrations reached the influent level at about 40 pv while both slow flow columns reached the initial breakthrough at about 30 pv fig 4b in contrast to the orange columns concentrations of fe in the effluent reached inflow concentration of 7 mg l after 70 and 30 pv in the fast and slow flow columns of gray sand respectively fig 4d e about 10 20 pv later concentration of fe in effluent from the gray sediment columns reached 15 20 mg l as in the case of the orange sand columns concentrations of s in effluent from the gray sand columns started immediately at 3 5 mg l somewhat higher than the inflow and dropped below 50 of the input after 70 pv and at 30 pv for the fast and slow flow columns of gray sand respectively fig 4g and h unlike the orange sediment columns concentrations of p in effluent from the gray sediment columns gradually rose for both the fast flow and the slow flow columns fig 4j l 3 3 3 pure sand column arsenic and iron concentrations in effluent from the pure sand column reached levels of the inflow within about 10 pv and then showed fluctuations around an average that is slightly below that of the input fig 5 a and b concentration of p in the effluent took about 60 pv to reach about two thirds of the inflow concentration fig 5d as in the case of orange and gray columns figs 3g i and 4g i concentrations of s started a little above concentration in the inflow and then declined steadily to 0 5 mg l at about 100 pv fig 5c 3 4 effluent data from the later phase of the experiment the later phases of the experiment were affected by the redox chemistry of fe and s in most cases well after as breakthrough figs s4 and s5 the changes in fe and s concentrations during the experiments were distinct from the breakthrough curves and showed both transient pulses in fe and a rapid decline in effluent s concentrations figs s4d i and s5d i iron concentrations were generally low and only increased above 1 mg l after about 150 pv in the orange sand columns fig s4d and e sulfur concentrations in the effluent dropped to 0 5 mg l in both orange and gray sediment columns primarily after the initial breakthrough of as took place following the precipitous drop s in the effluent briefly rose above 0 5 mg l in the orange sand columns but only after 150 pv at 156 or 80 pwv and after 50 pv at 80 pwv fig s4g i the later effluent data also showed multiple breakthroughs of as in both gray and orange sand columns figs s4a b and s5a b the present study focuses on the early as breakthrough rather than the subsequent changes in effluent chemistry 4 discussion 4 1 transport of arsenic and other redox sensitive parameters typical breakthrough curves for reactive non conservative ion transport through sediments typically show strong retention until the mineral phases are saturated with ions and then rapid and complete breakthrough selim 2014 arsenic transport in the present experiments was more complex with early and partial breakthrough and effluent as levels that did not stabilize figs 3a c and 4a c despite these differences several common features were observed in most columns there are multiple pools of as in gray and orange sands and desorption from the more weakly retained pool by phosphate appears to enhance elution in gray columns in which about half of as was found in this phosphate extractable pool table 2 the data suggest that this as pool is efficiently released into the effluent from the onset of the experiment fig 4a c there was also a short lived pulse of as released into solution when four times higher than the input phosphate level was added to groundwater figs s2d and s7 suggesting the rise of effluent as beyond the input level could also be attributed to competitive desorption by phosphate the mechanism can also be described as a snow plough effect where an incoming solution with a high solute concentration displaces resident cations from the exchange sites barry et al 1983 in orange sediments the labile pool is much smaller and as is to a large extent retained during the early stages of transport fig 3a c the breakthrough of as after the initial release phase in the gray sediment columns is more rapid than that in orange sediment columns indicating a pool of as in orange sand becomes irreversibly adsorbed over time a rapid early rise in as concentrations followed by a slower approach to equilibrium is consistent with previous experiments conducted with orange sand radloff et al 2011 a possible alternative explanation is that gray sediments may have less effectively sorbed as than orange sediments under the experimental conditions in most of the columns the initial breakthrough of as occurred within 30 70 pv depending on the flow rate figs 3a b and 4a c the differences in as breakthrough as a function of pwv indicates that adsorption is kinetically limited under the range of experimental conditions darland and inskeep 1997 due to kinetic limitation the breakthrough of as takes place earlier at fast pwv as a function of time while slower flow allows for increased reaction times increased adsorption and delayed or partial breakthrough given kinetic limitation as transport is more consistent between columns when plotted as a function of time rather than pore volume fig 6 kinetic limitation was also reflected in other redox sensitive parameters sulfur in particular was consumed in the effluent earlier at slower pwv figs 3g i and 4g i but at around the same time when plotted as a function of time the initial effluent data show that as transport was affected primarily by adsorption and desorption which is consistent with the conclusion of previous studies e g stollenwerk et al 2007 changes in fe and s redox status were observed mostly during the later phases of the experiment when they affected both as speciation and fe mineralogy figs s4 and s5 the delay in redox transformation can be attributed to lag phase microbial growth which is widespread and occurs during the time microbes adapt to changing groundwater conditions for example a metabolic time lag of up to 20 days was observed between acetate addition and the onset of s reduction at the uranium mill tailings site in colorado druhan et al 2012 indicating prolonged suppression of s reducing bacterial activity similarly experimental data in our columns indicate a significant lag time of about 100 120 h in the build up of s reducing bacteria prior to the onset of any noticeable s reduction we conclude that s reduction affected the transport properties of as sorption only after s was removed from column effluents the extent of fe reduction in these columns was evidently limited by the availability of reactive doc assuming 1 mol of doc is required to reduce 4 mol of fe iii to 4 mol of fe ii postma et al 2007 3 mg l of entirely reactive doc supplied could have reduced 80 of the entire volume of the orange sand to gray after three weeks of flow period based on a simple stoichiometric calculation mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 visual inspection of sediment color however did not reveal such a dramatic change in the redox state of fe suggesting little as was released due fe reductive compared to the high concentration of 320 μg l as in the inflow water unlike as both fe and p were more effectively sequestered onto the orange sand than in gray sand figs 3d f j l and 4d f j l the average bulk fe content in the orange sediment columns 2 4 is about 1 higher than that in gray sand columns 1 5 the proportion of fe iii in orange sand is almost one order of magnitude higher than that in gray sand the data suggest sequestration of p and fe ii was enhanced in orange sands containing a higher proportion of fe iii minerals 4 2 modeling arsenic transport a direct comparison of as transport in gray and orange sediments is possible by comparing the early stage elution of as from columns adsorption and desorption of as was the predominant process during this interval and as breakthrough was observed in many columns figs 3a b and 4a c later in the experiment redox transformations became more important and likely affected as partitioning it is difficult to separate adsorption desorption processes from redox processes using a simple model for this reason our modeling effort is focused here on the first 3 5 days of as data that were largely unaffected by redox processes in order to simulate the observations an average input as concentration of 320 μg l porosity of 0 32 bulk density of 1 80 g cm3 and a reaction order of 0 4 a fitting parameter were used the variable transport parameters were the measured flow velocities corresponding dispersion coefficient initial sorbed phase as concentrations and associated forward k1 k3 and reverse k2 k4 rate constants for the two phase fully reversible kinetic model the initial sorbed phases s 1 and s 2 for the gray sand were 1 5 and 1 5 mg kg s 3 mg kg respectively whereas for the orange sand they were 0 3 and 1 7 mg kg s 2 mg kg respectively table s1 the adjusted initial sorbed as concentration for the single phase kinetic model were 2 and 0 5 mg kg for the gray and orange sediment columns respectively for the two phase transport model one single set of rate constants was used for all gray sediment columns and another single set for all orange sediment columns irrespective of pwv fig 6a and b the forward and reverse rate constants determined for the gray sediment columns associated with s 1 are 6 h 1 k1 and 0 17 h 1 k2 and for s 2 are 0 01 h 1 k3 and 0 008 h 1 k4 respectively the two phase model reproduced effluent concentrations with an initial release starting at c c0 0 1 as well as exceedance c c0 1 1 above the influent level in gray sediments a single solid phase model k1 6 h 1 and k2 0 17 h 1 can also predict as breakthrough with an initial release but fails to reproduce a higher concentration than that in the inflow i e c c0 1 fig 6d the initial release of as is a function of the amount of weakly retained pool of sorbed as that is susceptible to desorption fig 6f with the two phase model the forward and reverse rate constants determined for the orange sand columns for s 1 are 2 h 1 k 1 and 0 057 h 1 k 2 and for s 2 are 0 01 h 1 k3 and 0 008 h 1 k 4 fig 6a the rate constants associated with the fast reacting phase s 1 are three fold smaller than that in gray sand the rates associated with the slow reacting phase s 2 are the same derived for gray sand k3 0 01 h 1 and k4 0 008 h 1 because s 1 is 5 times smaller than that in gray sand 0 3 compared to 1 5 mg kg the initial release of as is insignificant fig 6a and c a single phase model k1 2 h 1 and k2 0 07 h 1 can also be used to adequately describe the breakthrough of as in orange sediment columns fig 6c due to a higher fraction of weakly bound as in the gray sand columns larger rate constants were needed to predict as breakthrough if we ignore the initial as release and overshoot c c0 1 portion of the effluent data and focus on the main breakthrough the same set of rate constants used for orange sand k 1 2 h 1 and k 2 0 07 h 1 could also be applied for gray sand e g fig 6e the shallow groundwater is generally low in p in the area and ideally will not desorb as at the rate we observed in these experimental columns the smaller set of rate constants are comparable to the sorption and desorption coefficients determined for arsenite in earlier studies elkhatib et al 1984a b barrachina et al 1996 4 3 retardation of arsenic the apparent retention of as in the experimental columns can be determined from the ratio of forward and reverse rate constants k 1 k 2 30 to 35 the as retention factor or retardation factor is the ratio of the adsorbed pool that is retained within the solid matrix to the much smaller desorbed pool that goes into the solution the transport of as in bangladesh groundwater therefore appears to be retarded by a factor of 30 35 relative to the flow of groundwater by both gray and orange sediments this is surprising but not inconsistent with recent findings from batch adsorption experiments conducted under carefully controlled conditions thi hoa mai et al 2014 a retardation factor rf of 30 35 corresponds to a kd of about 5 6 l kg according to the following equations assuming a sediment bulk density of 1 8 g cm3 and porosity of 0 32 5 r f 1 ρ θ k d 6 k d θ r f 1 ρ the estimated kd of about 5 6 l kg is similar to low range partition coefficients determined with batch equilibrium experiments for holocene gray sediments in bangladesh van geen et al 2008 and mid range estimates from field observations for pleistocene sands that were reduced over time in west bengal india mcarthur et al 2008 2011 and near hanoi in vietnam van geen et al 2013 4 4 vulnerability of low arsenic aquifers to pumping an earlier as breakthrough at accelerated flow rates in the experimental columns fig 6 suggest sedimentary aquifers of bangladesh that are perturbed by pumping are more vulnerable to as contamination irrespective of the redox status and age of aquifer sediment irrigation pumping for growing rice largely impacts the shallow groundwater flow system of bangladesh harvey et al 2002 van geen et al 2008 whereas municipal pumping has significantly altered the deeper flow systems over the past two decades michael and voss 2008 knappett et al 2016 khan et al 2016 mozumder et al 2020 mihajlov et al 2020 these perturbations are likely to reduce as retardation over time and accelerate the spread of as in adversely as affected rural areas at our study site in araihazar bangladesh a groundwater flow model constrained with hydraulic head measurements has shown that shallow groundwater 30 m can penetrate the intermediate 40 90 m low as aquifers within 7 83 years after recharge mozumder et al 2020 the simulations are consistent with the age of groundwater 11 69 years measured at 14 monitoring wells screened between 50 and 70 m on the basis of tritium helium 3h 3he dating technique stute et al 2007 no systematic correlation between high low as and detectable undetectable 3h in the intermediate aquifer indicated instead a different source of as than that from the shallow aquifer assuming shallow groundwater as is retarded by a factor of 30 as determined in the present study the intermediate wells are protected against the downward migration of as in the area for 1000 years average groundwater age of 35 years multiplied by 30 this is important because over the past decade the number of privately installed intermediate wells tapping the low as pleistocene aquifer has quadrupled in the study area and probably elsewhere in bangladesh mozumder et al 2020 if adsorption provides significant protection against the downward migration of as deep wells that are low in as 10 μg l today will remain low in as for many decades indeed more than a decade 2002 2015 of monitoring of a dozen deep community wells cw 2 5 7 34 36 41 43 45 48 installed between 90 and 170 m in araihazar indicates stable groundwater as concentrations of 1 to 10 μg l this appears to be the case in south central bangladesh where 13 years of continuous monitoring data in a total of 46 deep wells 150 m deep revealed a relatively stable groundwater composition ravenscroft et al 2013 the results do not mean as concentrations in deep aquifers of bangladesh will remain low everywhere nine out of 927 deep wells 90 m deep tested during a blanket survey in 2012 13 in the study area were elevated 50 μg l in as van geen et al 2014 choudhury et al 2016 intermediate aquifers affected by pumping appear to be especially vulnerable to as contamination and should therefore be monitored more frequently mihajlov et al 2020 mozumder et al 2020 5 conclusions field based column experiments require some effort to set up but allowed us to study the reactive transport of as through sediment with fewer perturbations than most previous experiments during the initial period as transport in the experimental columns was primarily controlled by adsorption and desorption allowing us to determine a set of rate constants using a multi reaction transport model the estimated apparent kd of 5 6 l kg suggests significant protection of low as deep aquifers against the intrusion of shallow high as groundwater apparently because of a delay in microbial responses the reduction of s and fe became important only during the later phases of the experiment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

17757,microcystins mcs are the most common cyanotoxins produced by harmful cyanobacterial blooms and pose an increasing global threat to human health and ecosystems microbial degradation represents an efficient and sustainable approach for the removal of mcs although the enzymatic pathway for biodegradation of mcs has been characterized the regulatory mechanisms underlying the degradation processes remain unclear quorum sensing qs is a cell density dependent regulatory mechanism that enables bacteria to orchestrate collective behaviors the acyl homoserine lactone ahl mediated qs system regulates the biodegradation of many organic pollutants however it is not known whether this qs system is involved in the degradation of mcs this study aimed to fill this knowledge gap in this study the proportion of culturable ahl producers increased significantly after enrichment of mcs and ahl based qs systems were present in all genome sequenced mc degrading strains supporting the hypothesis that qs participates in the degradation of mcs two bifunctional novosphingobium strains with mc degrading and ahl producing abilities were isolated using a novel primer pair targeting mlra the marker gene of mlr degradation pathway biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that the mc degrading bacterium novosphingobium sp erw19 encodes two hierarchical regulatory qs systems designated novr1 novi1 and novr2 novi2 gene knockout and complementation experiments indicated that both systems were required for efficient degradation of mcs transcriptomic analyses revealed that the qs systems positively regulate degradation of mcs through transcriptional activation of mc degrading genes especially mlra given that qs may be a common trait within mlr pathway dependent mc degrading bacterial strains and the degradation activity is directly regulated by qs manipulation of the qs systems may be a promising strategy to control biodegradation of mcs graphical abstract image 1 keywords quorum sensing qs acyl homoserine lactone ahl microcystin biodegradation mlr pathway novosphingobium 1 introduction harmful cyanobacterial blooms have increased in severity and frequency worldwide during the past few decades and this trend is likely to persist in the future owing to continued eutrophication rising atmospheric co2 concentrations and global warming huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 consequently the water supply crisis and aquatic ecological risks caused by cyanotoxins are increasingly challenging janssen 2019 microcystins mcs a group of cyclic heptapeptides are the most detected cyanotoxins in cyanobacterial blooms and at least 246 isomer types differing in amino acid composition and toxicity have been recorded spoof and catherine 2017 mcs inhibit protein phosphatases pp1 and pp2a and induce oxidative stress in eukaryotic organisms furthermore through their accumulation in food chains or drinking water supplies these cyanotoxins severely damage the ecosystem and human health carmichael 2001 zurawell et al 2005 a recent study detected mcs in the nasal mucosa of residents in florida a us state that has experienced severe cyanobacterial blooms in recent years indicating that even indirect contact with toxic water such as inhalation of aerosols can pose serious public health risks schaefer et al 2020 mcs are chemically stable in the natural environment and are resistant to common physical and chemical factors as well as non specific enzymes this is predominantly because of their cyclic structures wörmer et al 2010 rastogi et al 2014 this stability and severe toxicity of mcs coupled with the global threat they pose has attracted significant scientific interest in removal strategies for these cyanotoxins microbial biodegradation is one of the most efficient ways to remove mcs from aquatic environments dziga et al 2013 li et al 2017 the only identified and extensively studied enzymatic pathway involved in the biodegradation of mcs is encoded by the mlr gene cluster which comprises four sequentially arranged genes mlrc mlra mlrd and mlrb bourne et al 1996 2001 the first enzyme microcystinase encoded by mlra was recently identified as a glutamate protease previously postulated to be a metalloprotease xu et al 2019 mlra hydrolyzes microcystin lr mc lr at the adda arg peptide bond to yield a linearized intermediate product that is 160 fold less toxic than its precursor bourne et al 1996 for this reason mlra is considered to catalyze the first and most important step in the biodegradation of mcs and is also proposed as a genetic marker for detecting bacterial populations with capacity to degrade mcs saito et al 2003 hoefel et al 2009 lezcano et al 2016 2017 2018 morón lópez et al 2017 the second enzyme mlrb is a serine protease that breaks down linearized mcs into tetrapeptides while the third enzyme mlrc is a metalloprotease that degrades both tetrapeptides and linearized mcs the gene mlrd was presumed to encode an oligopeptide transporter but its true function remains unclear bourne et al 1996 2001 dziga et al 2012 2016 shimizu et al 2012 two adjacent genes located downstream of the mlrcadb cluster are mlre and mlrf which encode peptide modifying dipeptidase and d aminoacylase respectively and were identified by genome based analysis okano et al 2015 jin et al 2018 these two enzymes are predicted to play a role in the final step of the mc degradation pathway yang et al 2020 recently identified the phenylacetic acid paa degradation gene paaase gene upstream of mlrcadb in sphingomonas sp yf1 indicating that paa metabolism may be the downstream route for degradation of mcs as summarized in an updated review the mlr dependent pathway for degradation of mcs was almost exclusively distributed in the phylum proteobacteria and predominantly in the family sphingomonadaceae including the genera sphingomonas sphingopyxis and novosphingobium li et al 2017 however although this enzymatic pathway is being studied there have been limited reports on the regulatory factors involved in the degradation of mcs and the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the underlying processes remain largely unknown quorum sensing qs is a well studied regulation mechanism that orchestrates bacterial behaviors and relies on signaling molecules called autoinducers to mediate cell to cell communication processes fuqua et al 1994 papenfort and bassler 2016 qs enables bacteria to collectively control gene expression and thus synchronize social behaviors at a population level akin to a society parsek and greenberg 2005 zhou et al 2016 such behaviors include bioluminescence virulence factor secretion biofilm formation and the production of public goods eickhoff and bassler 2018 in the phylum proteobacteria acyl homoserine lactone ahl is the most common class of autoinducer ahl is synthesized by the luxi type ahl synthases and recognized by the cognate luxr type transcriptional regulators papenfort and bassler 2016 over the previous decade the concept of qs has been successfully applied to water and wastewater treatment technologies shrout and nerenberg 2012 described qs as bacterial twitter and indicated that many qs regulated genes related to biofilm formation and function such as production of extracellular polysaccharides eps are critical for some water and wastewater treatment biofilms the positive roles of the ahl mediated qs system in aerobic granular sludge have been widely acknowledged zhang et al 2020 because qs systems are chemically and genetically operable there has been increasing interest in using qs to develop enhanced biodegradation strategies yong et al 2015 huang et al 2016 overall qs regulates certain characteristics including biofilm formation eps production catabolic gene expression horizontal gene transfer biosurfactant production and bacterial motility and chemotaxis all of which are very useful for effective bioremediation technology chong et al 2012 huang et al 2013 yong and zhong 2013 mangwani et al 2016a 2016b to the best of our knowledge the qs system has not previously been characterized in mc degrading strains and furthermore it is not known whether the qs system is involved in regulation of the mcs degradation process despite current knowledge gaps in the qs systems of mc degrading bacteria there is a clear and significant phylogenetic overlap between mc degrading bacteria and ahl producing bacteria i e sphingomonadaceae in the existing literature of both research fields sphingomonadaceae is the most common mc degrading group li et al 2017 furthermore many sphingomonadaceae synthesize ahl signals d angelo picard et al 2005 gan et al 2009 2016 huang et al 2013 and genome based analysis has indicated that luxr luxi type qs circuits are prevalent in members of the family sphingomonadaceae gan et al 2015 these findings led us to speculate whether this qs system is universally present in mc degrading bacteria and whether it regulates the degradation behavior of mcs the present work aimed to address this question with the additional motive that targeting qs systems could be a potential strategy to control biodegradation of mcs bacterial strains with both mcs degradation and ahl production abilities were isolated from cyanobacterial bloom samples genomic analyses of all genome sequenced mc degrading strains were conducted to gain insights into the prevalence of luxr luxi type qs circuits within the mc degrading strains the complex qs circuitry of the mc degrading strain novosphingobium sp erw19 which served as a model organism in this study was then systematically dissected ultimately qs defective mutants and complemented strains were constructed to evaluate the regulatory role of the qs system in the biodegradation of mcs and transcriptomics and qrt pcr analyses were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of regulation this study represents the first detailed

for 12 h subsequently the bacteria were centrifuged 5000 g 20 min 4 c and the supernatant was used for ahl extraction 2 8 construction of qs defective mutants and complemented strains in frame gene deletion mutants were constructed as previously described kaczmarczyk et al 2012 briefly up and down stream flanking regions of the desired deletion gene each approximately 600 bp in length were separately amplified using the primers shown in table s2 after gel purification the two fragments were fused together via a complementary tag region using cross over pcr the resulting fusion product was cloned into the suicide vector pak405 via specific restriction enzyme sites and the recombinant pak405 derivative was transformed into competent e coli s17 1 λpir the pak405 derivative was subsequently integrated into novosphingobium sp erw19 by homologous recombination this process was facilitated by conjugal transfer between donor strain e coli s17 1 λpir harboring the pak405 derivative with the recipient strain a spontaneous rifampicin resistant derivative of novosphingobium sp erw19 correct integration of the recombinant suicide vector was verified by pcr analysis in the final step in order to obtain the deletion mutation of the target gene the integrated suicide plasmid was resolved from the chromosome through a second recombination event this was accomplished by growing the strain carrying the integrated suicide vector in antibiotic free r2a broth overnight followed by gradient dilutions of the culture and plating 100 μl aliquots of each dilution onto r2a

heterogeneously expressed by two ahl synthases of strain erw19 in e coli bl21 de3 as described in section 2 7 were also extracted with this method all experiments were performed in triplicate thin layer chromatography tlc was employed to determine ahl signal profiles according to a previously described method huang et al 2013 prior to tlc analysis the ahl signal strength and the amount of ea extract required for tlc was quantitatively estimated using the following method different volumes of ea extracts were separately spotted onto 5 mm diameter sterile filter papers and placed on lb soft agar plates containing the ahl biosensor a tumefaciens a136 and x gal plates were incubated at 30 c for 24 h then the diameters of the blue stains around the filter papers which represented the quantity of ahl signals were recorded subsequently appropriate amounts of ea extracts were loaded onto a tlc plate 20 20 cm tlc aluminum sheets rp 18 f254 s merck darmstadt germany that was then developed in a methanol water 60 40 v v mobile phase the plate was air dried covered with lb soft agar containing the biosensor a tumefaciens a136 and x gal and incubated at 30 c for 24 h ahl profiles

analyses were conducted to determine whether there were significant differences in mcs biodegradation or in functional gene expression between novosphingobium sp erw19 wild type and its derivative strains all assays were performed in triplicate and the results were presented as the mean standard deviation all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss 18 0 statistical software analyses of statistical differences were conducted with student s t test 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the proportion and composition of ahl producing bacteria during enrichment an enrichment experiment with cyanobacterial bloom samples as the seed inoculum was performed to isolate mc degrading strains with ahl producing ability during this enrichment process changes in the proportion and composition of ahl producing bacteria were investigated using a culture dependent method a total of 120 isolates were screened from the original cyanobacterial samples whereas only 41 strains were isolated from the enrichment cultures in the ahl bioassay 11 out of the 120 isolates obtained before enrichment could produce ahl this constituted around 9 2 of total cultivable isolates a proportion equivalent to the abundance of ahl producers in the natural freshwater environment huang et al 2012 this proportion increased to about 31 7 in the enrichment cultures with 13 out of the 41 isolates exhibiting the ability to produce ahl representative bioassay plates are shown in fig s1 these results suggest that the capacity for signal communication is significantly enhanced by the increased abundance of ahl producers which may in turn affect the biodegradation of mcs this novel observation provides new evidence to support the idea that qs may be involved in regulating and influencing the degradation behavior of mc degrading bacteria the 16s rrna sequence analysis revealed that all 24 ahl producing isolates belonged to proteobacteria and were assigned to two phylogenetic groups the classes alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria this is consistent with the finding that luxi and luxr homologs have only been found within proteobacterial genomes case et al 2008 members of the gammaproteobacteria were the predominant ahl producers before enrichment 81 8 whereas alphaproteobacterial members were dominant after enrichment 92 3 table s3 fig 1 showed the changes in the composition of ahl producing bacterial communities at the genus level before enrichment the predominant ahl producers were aeromonas 63 64 followed by rhizobium 18 18 pseudomonas 9 09 and serratia 9 09 the composition of the ahl producing bacterial community changed significantly after enrichment with novosphingobium one of the best known mc degrading genera becoming the major ahl producer 46 15 the remaining ahl positive strains after enrichment belonged to the genera rhizobium 15 38 methylopila 15 38 ensifer 15 38 and acinetobacter 7 69 there was only one overlapping ahl producing genus rhizobium which was isolated both before and after enrichment 3 2 screening ahl producers for mc degrading strains ahl producers were further screened using molecular methods to isolate strains that could degrade mcs the mlra protein is responsible for the initial hydrolytic cleavage of cyclic mcs and mlra targeted pcr has frequently been employed for qualitative detection of mc degrading bacteria in natural habitats and water treatment facilities saito et al 2003 bourne et al 2006 ho et al 2006 2007 chen et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 however previously reported primer sets were not designed with degenerate oligonucleotides to allow for variations that exist between different mlra homologs a novel degenerate primer set was therefore designed and used in this study thirty eight known mlra gene sequences from members of the genera sphingomonas sphingopyxis novosphingobium sphingosinicella bacillus brevundimonas catellibacterium kurthia rhizobium and stenotrophomonas as well as those for some uncultured bacteria were retrieved from the databases and used for sequence alignment two conserved dna domains were identified and used to design degenerate primers that were 20 bp long these primers mlra 271f and mlra 806r were expected to amplify a 500 bp fragment fig 2 a acclimated bacteria display increased efficiencies of mcs degradation and high adaptability under field conditions li and pan 2014 thus only ahl producers obtained from enrichment cultures were screened for the presence of mlra using pcr fragments of the expected size were successfully amplified from strains erw19 and ern07 fig 2b which are both affiliated to the genus novosphingobium table s3 blastx analysis revealed that the mlra gene sequences of strains erw19 and ern07 were 100 identical to that of novosphingobium sp thn1 jiang et al 2011 recently novel primer sets targeting the mc producing gene mcya were designed and these offer significant improvements over previously published probes in accurately identifying and quantifying mcya genes present in environmental samples lee et al 2020 similarly the novel primer set presented in this study is expected to serve as a useful genetic tool for rapid detection of mc degrading bacteria and for evaluating the mc degradation potential of environmental samples mc degradation capacities of novosphingobium sp strains erw19 and ern07 were confirmed by lc ms ms analysis strain erw19 had greater degradation activity towards both mc analogs mc lr and mc rr compared with strain ern07 fig 2c mc lr and mc rr were completely degraded by strain erw19 within 12 h without a lag phase however degradation by strain ern07 was slower with a longer lag phase of 6 h therefore novosphingobium sp erw19 which harbors both ahl based qs and efficient mc degrading systems was selected as the experimental strain for further analyses 3 3 identification of qs genes in genome sequenced mc degrading strains and functional verification of typical ahl synthases the genomes of novosphingobium sp strains erw19 and ern07 were sequenced and annotated prior to this study only five other mc degrading bacterial strains have had their whole genome sequenced the genomic features strain information and organization of qs related genes and mc degradation related genes of all currently sequenced mc degrading bacteria are presented in table 1 the genomes of all seven strains contain at least one complete ahl driven qs circuit strains erw19 and thn1 harbor two each while strain b9 has three all genome sequenced mc degrading bacteria summarized in table 1 belong to the family sphingomonadaceae the most comprehensive genome analysis of sphingomonadaceae to date indicated that 33 out of 62 members of the family sphingomonadaceae contain at least one complete ahl driven qs circuit gan et al 2015 however to our knowledge none of these 62 strains were reported to have mc degrading abilities therefore although the presence of a qs system is not uncommon among members of the sphingomonadaceae according to the available genome data all members of the sphingomonadaceae with mcs biodegradability harbor an ahl driven qs circuit without exception this implies that the ahl based qs system is a common trait within mc degrading bacteria and reflects the close correlation between qs and degradation of mcs notably the genomic surveillance of mc degrading bacteria for the distribution of luxr luxi type qs circuits in this study is the most comprehensive to date fig 3 a illustrates the linear comparison of luxr luxi pairs and flanking gene arrangements in the seven genome sequenced mc degrading strains among which a total of 11 luxi homologs were identified conserved topology was found where all identified luxr homologs are located immediately upstream of and convergently oriented with respect to the luxi genes a genomic character commonly found in the qs system of alphaproteobacteria gan et al 2013 ten of the 11 luxi homologs were genetically proximal to the downstream phytanoyl coa dioxygenase gene phyh which was also often observed in the qs system of sphingomonadaceae without mc degrading abilities gan et al 2015 however a conserved gntr family transcriptional regulator benenodin family lasso peptide lasso peptide biosynthesis b2 protein asparagine synthase b arrangement was found immediately downstream of seven of the 10 phyh genes which has not previously been reported this may constitute a signature feature for mc degrading bacteria because all seven analyzed strains harbor one such genomic topology associated with a qs circuit while members of the sphingomonadaceae without biodegradability do not contain this feature in addition to these common characteristics some strain specific features were identified for example various mobile elements involved in horizontal gene transfer hgt including transposases and integrases were found to be located upstream of the luxr luxi pairs on scaffold 14 of strain erw19 and on the plasmid pthn of strain thn1 hgt is the driving force that contributes to genome evolution diversification and adaptation of microorganisms juhas et al 2009 it is possible that some mc degrading strains acquire qs elements via hgt which might in turn affect the mc degrading behavior through qs dependent regulation an amino acid pairwise identity matrix of all identified luxi homologs in mc degrading strains was constructed fig 3b pairwise identity between different luxi homologs varied from 22 to 100 luxi homologs of mc degrading strains can be grouped into three different categories based on neighbor gene arrangement fig 3a and pairwise identity fig 3b the ahl synthases erw19 novi1 ern07 novi md 1 novi thn1 novi1 c1 sphi yf1 sphi and b9 sphi2 form category a owing to their relatively high pairwise identities with each other 46 2 100 and similar gene topologies downstream of luxr luxi pairs each of the seven mc degrading strains has one luxi included in category a the luxi homologs erw19 novi2 and thn1 novi2 are classified as category b because they share a very high sequence identity of 93 7 and mobile genetic elements involved in hgt events are found in their vicinity category c comprises the other two luxi homologs of sphingosinicella microcystinivorans b 9 b9 sphi1 and b9 sphi3 which are quite divergent ahl synthases from each other and from luxi of other strains this categorization raises the question of whether different ahl synthases exhibit similar regulatory effects on the biodegradation of mcs especially when multiple ahl synthases exist in one mc degrading strain for instance strain erw19 encodes two ahl synthases namely erw19 novi1 and erw19 novi2 which belong to category a and b respectively the qs system of novosphingobium sp erw19 was selected as a typical representative the biochemical function of the two putative ahl synthases of this strain was verified by heterologous expression in e coli bl21 de3 and identification of ahl profiles by comparing the retention time from tlc with that of standard ahl tlc analysis revealed that erw19 novi1 directed the production of medium length 3 oh c8 hsl and c8 hsl while erw19 novi2 was responsible for the production of multiple short to medium length ahl signals including 3 oh c8 hsl c8 hsl and three unknown ahls nd1 nd2 and nd3 all refer to ahls that cannot be determined based on standards available in our laboratory fig 3c the ahl profiles produced by these two ahl synthases are summarized in table s4 3 oh c8 hsl seems to be the predominant and integral ahl signal produced by sphingomonadaceae when considering data from previous studies d angelo picard et al 2005 gan et al 2016 3 4 biochemical and genetic characterization of the qs systems of mc degrading strain novosphingobium sp erw19 3 4 1 function of the two qs systems in ahl synthesis the genome of the mc degrading strain novosphingobium sp erw19 encodes two complete luxr luxi type qs systems designated novr1 novi1 and novr2 novi2 fig 3a these two qs systems were systematically characterized at chemical and genetic levels in order to elucidate their qs regulated behaviors subsequently four qs defective mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 δnovi2 and δnovr2 were constructed by in frame deletion mutagenesis kaczmarczyk et al 2012 a cross feeding assay showed that wild type wt erw19 induced blue coloration of the ahl reporter strain a tumefaciens a136 within 24 h indicating strong ahl activity compared with the wt strain only δnovr2 displayed significant ahl activity while the other three mutants showed weak coloration after incubation for 48 h fig 4 a similar results were obtained in the ahl extracts bioassay fig 4b supernatant extracts of both the wt strain and mutant δnovr2 presented strong ahl activity with the latter appearing to have produced more ahl this suggests that novr2 may also act as a transcriptional repressor in ahl synthesis in the qs hierarchy similar to the finding of churchill and chen that luxr inhibits the luxi gene in some cases ahl activities of mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 could only be detected when their supernatant extracts were concentrated 10 times ahl profiles determined by tlc assay revealed that two types of ahl including the dominant 3 oh c8 hsl and tiny amounts of nd2 nd refers to ahl with undetermined structure were identified in the supernatant extracts of the wt strain fig 4c deletion of novr2 increased the diversity of ahl species as three types of ahl 3 oh c8 hsl nd1 and nd2 were detected in the supernatant extracts of the δnovr2 mutant the mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 only produced trace amounts of 3 oh c8 hsl in summary the absence of novr2 promoted ahl production both in quantity and type while individually knocking out of novi1 novr1 and novi2 dramatically reduced the ahl activity of the mc degrading strain erw19 table s4 furthermore we have also constructed the double knockout mutant δnovi1novi2 as expected ahl bioassay result showed that the mutant δnovi1novi2 could not produce ahl fig s2 which confirmed our conclusion that strain erw19 only encodes two ahl synthases functional complementation was conducted by introducing a plasmid borne copy of the deleted genes into the respective qs defective mutants to exclude possible polar effects of gene disruption on other genes as expected all complemented strains showed restored ahl production ability compared with the wt strain and corresponding mutant genotypes fig s3a and fig 4a specifically complementation of novi1 or novr1 partially restored ahl activity to the wild type level while complementation of novi2 or novr2 almost fully recovered the ahl producing capacity compared with that of the wt strain fig s3b ahl profiles revealed by tlc analysis were congruent with this result with only the 3 oh c8 hsl signal being synthesized by complemented strains δnovi1 pcm62 novi1 and δnovr1 pcm62 novr1 while both δnovi2 pcm62 novi2 and δnovr2 pcm62 novr2 produced identical ahl profiles to the wt strain fig s3c and table s4 we suspected that the expression of novi1 or novr1 from an inducible promoter complemented its own expression but not that of all downstream genes as has been reported previously van kessel et al 2015 3 4 2 regulatory relationships between the two qs systems to determine whether there was a hierarchical relationship between the novr1 novi1 and novr2 novi2 qs systems qrt pcr analysis of two ahl synthase genes novi1 and novi2 was performed to examine their expression in the wt strain and qs mutants rna samples were prepared from the wt strain and qs mutants grown at 30 c in r2a broth for 48 h consistent with the culture conditions used for ahl extraction deletion of novr1 and novr2 significantly decreased the expression of novi1 and novi2 compared to the wt strain p 0 001 respectively fig 5 indicating that both ahl synthase genes were positively regulated by corresponding receptors this is a typical feature of the luxr luxi type qs system papenfort and bassler 2016 mutation of novr1 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the expression of novi2 compared to the wt strain p 0 001 suggesting that the novr1 novi1 system has a positive regulatory effect on the novr2 novi2 system this explains why the δnovr1 mutant produced limited quantities of ahl because the absence of novr1 significantly decreased the expression of both ahl synthase genes furthermore the knockout of novr2 significantly up regulated the expression of novi1 compared to the wt strain p 0 01 therefore the increased production of ahl in δnovr2 mutant fig 4 is mainly attributed to the increased expression of novi1 compared to the wt strain in other words the repression function of novr2 in ahl synthesis mainly lies in its inhibition effect on novi1 which can be relieved by mutation of novr2 inhibition of the expression of novi1 by novr2 is probably due to competition for common substrates both ahl synthases novi1 and novi2 mainly catalyze the production of 3 oh c8 hsl fig 3c and may be competing for 3 hydroxy acyl acyl carrier protein conjugates churchill and chen 2011 zan et al 2012 the hyper production of ahl by the δnovr2 mutant may result from the absence of the novr2 novi2 system for competition for substrates however despite the significantly higher expression level of novi1 p 0 05 and also the absence of substrate competition in the δnovi2 mutant compared with that in the wt strain the δnovi2 mutant displayed very low ahl activity fig 4b this could be because in addition to gene transcription and substrate competition various factors at the levels of post transcription translation protein activity and signal degradation affect the secretion and accumulation of ahl baumgardt et al 2014 more in depth future works are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms to summarize the two qs systems of mc degrading bacterium novosphingobium sp erw19 form a regulatory hierarchy in which novr1 positively regulates the expression of novi2 whereas novr2 has a negative feedback effect on novi1 thereby creating a positive negative feedback loop 3 5 regulatory roles of the two qs systems in degradation of mcs 3 5 1 effect of the two qs systems on mc degrading activity the mc degrading activity of the wt strain and qs defective mutants was compared to examine whether the qs systems of novosphingobium sp erw19 were involved in biodegradation of mcs all qs deficient mutants exhibited reduced capacity to degrade mcs compared with that of the wt strain which completely degraded both mc analogs within 12 h mc lr fig 6 a mc rr fig 6c the mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 displayed more significant decline in biodegradability than δnovr2 which was congruent with the remarkable ahl deficiency in the former three mutants however although the deletion of novr2 promoted ahl production capacity the δnovr2 mutant showed slighter decrease in the mc degradation rate we suspected that this was because the absence of novr2 significantly decreased the expression of novi2 which has the most significant inhibitory effect on the degradation of mcs as revealed in the δnovi2 mutant fig 6a c more specifically in the mutant δnovr2 the inhibition of mcs degradation resulting from decreased expression of novi2 may be greater than that of the degradation activation caused by increased expression of novi1 leading to lower degradation rate compared with the wild type strain therefore both the novr1 novi1 and the novr2 novi2 qs systems of novosphingobium sp erw19 are required for enhanced degradation of mcs and the absence of any of the qs elements results in the attenuation of the degradation of mcs to some extent as expected repression of mcs degradation in all qs defective mutants could be relieved by genetic complementation the degradation deficiency in the mutants δnovi2 and δnovr2 was restored to degradation levels in excess of those of the wt strain when complemented with the plasmid borne copy of novi2 and novr2 respectively fig 6b d however mc degrading activities were only partially recovered in the complemented strains δnovi1 pcm62 novi1 and δnovr1 pcm62 novr1 this could be attributed to ahl synthesis not being fully restored in these two strains as shown in fig s3b positive roles for ahl mediated qs systems in the biodegradation of many organic pollutants have been reported for example in phenanthrene and pyrene mangwani et al 2016a phenol valle et al 2004 yong and zhong 2010 2013 denitrification toyofuku et al 2007 anthranilate degradation chugani and greenberg 2010 and ammonium oxidation de clippeleir et al 2011 however previous studies have often relied on exogenous addition of ahl chemicals or ahl producing strains and genetic manipulations such as gene knockout and complementation which provide more direct genetic evidence of qs regulated behaviors were rarely used toyofuku et al 2007 yong and zhong 2013 to our knowledge this is the first report proving that qs regulates biodegradation of mcs thus expanding the range of known qs regulated behaviors in bacteria 3 5 2 transcriptional regulation of mc degradation related genes by the two qs systems transcriptional differences in mc degradation related genes between the wt strain and qs defective mutants during the degradation process at 6 h and 18 h respectively were determined to further elucidate regulatory mechanisms of the two qs systems in the degradation of mcs fig s4 presents the heatmap of relative expression levels of genes involved in ahl synthesis and degradation of mcs in the wt and qs mutants at 6 h as determined by rna seq in general although expression patterns of mc degradation related genes in the wt strain and δnovr2 mutant were similar those in mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 were more alike fig s4 this trend was consistent with their mc degrading activities fig 4a b and fig 6a c although ahl production activity was not measured during degradation of mcs similar relative expression patterns of ahl synthase genes novi1 and novi2 between the wt and qs mutants were observed in fig 5 and fig s4 this provided an evidence to support that the wt strain and four qs mutants may possess similar relative ahl production capacity as shown in fig 4a b during degradation of mcs more specifically except for mlrc the transcription levels of mlra mlrb mlrd mlre mlrf and paaase genes were all significantly decreased in δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 mutants compared with those in the wt p 0 001 table s5 this was in accordance with the significantly repressed mc degrading activities in the three mutants notably the most significantly down regulated gene was mlra the first and most important gene in the mlr pathway bourne et al 1996 absolute log2 fold change values between each of the three mutants and the wt strain were 4 table s5 in the δnovr2 mutant only mlra among the various mc degradation related genes was significantly down regulated p 0 001 but the absolute log2 fold change values versus the wt strain were much lower than that of the other three mutants 1 46 at 6 h and 1 9 at 18 h table s5 this explained why the δnovr2 mutant showed the least reduction in degradation of mcs among the four qs deficient mutants these results indicate that both qs systems of novosphingobium sp erw19 positively regulate biodegradation of mcs through transcriptional induction of the mlr pathway especially transcription of mlra this conclusion was verified by qrt pcr analysis fig 7 furthermore in accordance with the effect of gene complementation on the mc degrading ability of the qs mutants fig 6b d partially restored expression levels of mc degradation related genes were observed in the complemented strains δnovi1 pcm62 novi1 and δnovr1 pcm62 novr1 while the transcriptional levels of these genes were higher in δnovi2 pcm62 novi2 and δnovr2 pcm62 novr2 than those in the wt strain fig 7 this was presumably due to the presence of multiple plasmid borne copies of the complemented genes atkinson et al 2008 qs also positively regulated the transcription of phenylacetic acid paa degradation gene paaase gene table s5 and fig 7 which has recently been shown to be involved in the downstream pathway of mc degradation yang et al 2020 the mc degrading intermediate adda was proposed to be degraded via paa metabolism and eventually completely converted into co2 via the tca cycle yang et al 2020 based on our data it is plausible that the enhanced mlr pathway and paa metabolism regulated by qs could accelerate the carbon source supply for the tca cycle provide an energy source for cell growth and promote bacterial survival and adaptation in such a toxic environment the results of this study were used as a basis to propose a conceptual model for qs regulation mechanisms during biodegradation of mcs fig 8 by using genomic mutational and complementary analyses this work confirmed our hypothesis that ahl based qs is a common trait among mlr pathway dependent mc degrading bacterial strains and qs system positively regulates mcs degradation activity through transcriptional induction of mc degrading genes especially mlra the first and most important gene in the mlr pathway due to the prevalence of qs system and the key role of mlr pathway in the biodegradation of mcs as well as the chemical and genetic operability of qs systems targeting qs systems could be a potential strategy to control biodegradation of mcs our work provides new insights into the development of more effective biological methods for the remediation of mcs pollution in water bodies 4 conclusions in this study the observation that the proportion of culturable ahl producers increased significantly after enrichment of mcs prompted us to speculate that mcs generated during cyanobacterial blooms are preferentially utilized by bacteria with qs systems this speculation is coincident with the finding that all genome sequenced mlr pathway dependent mc degrading strains harbor ahl based qs system suggesting that qs is a common feature among these strains systematic characterization of the two qs systems of mc degrading strain novosphingobium sp erw19 reveal that novr1 positively regulates the expression of novi2 whereas novr2 has a negative feedback effect on the expression of novi1 thus creating a hierarchy qs network it is precisely because of this interconnected relationship both qs systems were proved to play positive regulatory roles in mcs degradation transcriptomic results demonstrated that the activation of degradation activity by qs systems relies on the transcriptional induction of mc degrading genes especially mlra this work provides new insights into the regulatory role of qs in the biodegradation of mcs during cyanobacterial blooms and a novel approach for developing more effective biological

17757,microcystins mcs are the most common cyanotoxins produced by harmful cyanobacterial blooms and pose an increasing global threat to human health and ecosystems microbial degradation represents an efficient and sustainable approach for the removal of mcs although the enzymatic pathway for biodegradation of mcs has been characterized the regulatory mechanisms underlying the degradation processes remain unclear quorum sensing qs is a cell density dependent regulatory mechanism that enables bacteria to orchestrate collective behaviors the acyl homoserine lactone ahl mediated qs system regulates the biodegradation of many organic pollutants however it is not known whether this qs system is involved in the degradation of mcs this study aimed to fill this knowledge gap in this study the proportion of culturable ahl producers increased significantly after enrichment of mcs and ahl based qs systems were present in all genome sequenced mc degrading strains supporting the hypothesis that qs participates in the degradation of mcs two bifunctional novosphingobium strains with mc degrading and ahl producing abilities were isolated using a novel primer pair targeting mlra the marker gene of mlr degradation pathway biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that the mc degrading bacterium novosphingobium sp erw19 encodes two hierarchical regulatory qs systems designated novr1 novi1 and novr2 novi2 gene knockout and complementation experiments indicated that both systems were required for efficient degradation of mcs transcriptomic analyses revealed that the qs systems positively regulate degradation of mcs through transcriptional activation of mc degrading genes especially mlra given that qs may be a common trait within mlr pathway dependent mc degrading bacterial strains and the degradation activity is directly regulated by qs manipulation of the qs systems may be a promising strategy to control biodegradation of mcs graphical abstract image 1 keywords quorum sensing qs acyl homoserine lactone ahl microcystin biodegradation mlr pathway novosphingobium 1 introduction harmful cyanobacterial blooms have increased in severity and frequency worldwide during the past few decades and this trend is likely to persist in the future owing to continued eutrophication rising atmospheric co2 concentrations and global warming huisman et al 2018 ho et al 2019 consequently the water supply crisis and aquatic ecological risks caused by cyanotoxins are increasingly challenging janssen 2019 microcystins mcs a group of cyclic heptapeptides are the most detected cyanotoxins in cyanobacterial blooms and at least 246 isomer types differing in amino acid composition and toxicity have been recorded spoof and catherine 2017 mcs inhibit protein phosphatases pp1 and pp2a and induce oxidative stress in eukaryotic organisms furthermore through their accumulation in food chains or drinking water supplies these cyanotoxins severely damage the ecosystem and human health carmichael 2001 zurawell et al 2005 a recent study detected mcs in the nasal mucosa of residents in florida a us state that has experienced severe cyanobacterial blooms in recent years indicating that even indirect contact with toxic water such as inhalation of aerosols can pose serious public health risks schaefer et al 2020 mcs are chemically stable in the natural environment and are resistant to common physical and chemical factors as well as non specific enzymes this is predominantly because of their cyclic structures wörmer et al 2010 rastogi et al 2014 this stability and severe toxicity of mcs coupled with the global threat they pose has attracted significant scientific interest in removal strategies for these cyanotoxins microbial biodegradation is one of the most efficient ways to remove mcs from aquatic environments dziga et al 2013 li et al 2017 the only identified and extensively studied enzymatic pathway involved in the biodegradation of mcs is encoded by the mlr gene cluster which comprises four sequentially arranged genes mlrc mlra mlrd and mlrb bourne et al 1996 2001 the first enzyme microcystinase encoded by mlra was recently identified as a glutamate protease previously postulated to be a metalloprotease xu et al 2019 mlra hydrolyzes microcystin lr mc lr at the adda arg peptide bond to yield a linearized intermediate product that is 160 fold less toxic than its precursor bourne et al 1996 for this reason mlra is considered to catalyze the first and most important step in the biodegradation of mcs and is also proposed as a genetic marker for detecting bacterial populations with capacity to degrade mcs saito et al 2003 hoefel et al 2009 lezcano et al 2016 2017 2018 morón lópez et al 2017 the second enzyme mlrb is a serine protease that breaks down linearized mcs into tetrapeptides while the third enzyme mlrc is a metalloprotease that degrades both tetrapeptides and linearized mcs the gene mlrd was presumed to encode an oligopeptide transporter but its true function remains unclear bourne et al 1996 2001 dziga et al 2012 2016 shimizu et al 2012 two adjacent genes located downstream of the mlrcadb cluster are mlre and mlrf which encode peptide modifying dipeptidase and d aminoacylase respectively and were identified by genome based analysis okano et al 2015 jin et al 2018 these two enzymes are predicted to play a role in the final step of the mc degradation pathway yang et al 2020 recently identified the phenylacetic acid paa degradation gene paaase gene upstream of mlrcadb in sphingomonas sp yf1 indicating that paa metabolism may be the downstream route for degradation of mcs as summarized in an updated review the mlr dependent pathway for degradation of mcs was almost exclusively distributed in the phylum proteobacteria and predominantly in the family sphingomonadaceae including the genera sphingomonas sphingopyxis and novosphingobium li et al 2017 however although this enzymatic pathway is being studied there have been limited reports on the regulatory factors involved in the degradation of mcs and the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of the underlying processes remain largely unknown quorum sensing qs is a well studied regulation mechanism that orchestrates bacterial behaviors and relies on signaling molecules called autoinducers to mediate cell to cell communication processes fuqua et al 1994 papenfort and bassler 2016 qs enables bacteria to collectively control gene expression and thus synchronize social behaviors at a population level akin to a society parsek and greenberg 2005 zhou et al 2016 such behaviors include bioluminescence virulence factor secretion biofilm formation and the production of public goods eickhoff and bassler 2018 in the phylum proteobacteria acyl homoserine lactone ahl is the most common class of autoinducer ahl is synthesized by the luxi type ahl synthases and recognized by the cognate luxr type transcriptional regulators papenfort and bassler 2016 over the previous decade the concept of qs has been successfully applied to water and wastewater treatment technologies shrout and nerenberg 2012 described qs as bacterial twitter and indicated that many qs regulated genes related to biofilm formation and function such as production of extracellular polysaccharides eps are critical for some water and wastewater treatment biofilms the positive roles of the ahl mediated qs system in aerobic granular sludge have been widely acknowledged zhang et al 2020 because qs systems are chemically and genetically operable there has been increasing interest in using qs to develop enhanced biodegradation strategies yong et al 2015 huang et al 2016 overall qs regulates certain characteristics including biofilm formation eps production catabolic gene expression horizontal gene transfer biosurfactant production and bacterial motility and chemotaxis all of which are very useful for effective bioremediation technology chong et al 2012 huang et al 2013 yong and zhong 2013 mangwani et al 2016a 2016b to the best of our knowledge the qs system has not previously been characterized in mc degrading strains and furthermore it is not known whether the qs system is involved in regulation of the mcs degradation process despite current knowledge gaps in the qs systems of mc degrading bacteria there is a clear and significant phylogenetic overlap between mc degrading bacteria and ahl producing bacteria i e sphingomonadaceae in the existing literature of both research fields sphingomonadaceae is the most common mc degrading group li et al 2017 furthermore many sphingomonadaceae synthesize ahl signals d angelo picard et al 2005 gan et al 2009 2016 huang et al 2013 and genome based analysis has indicated that luxr luxi type qs circuits are prevalent in members of the family sphingomonadaceae gan et al 2015 these findings led us to speculate whether this qs system is universally present in mc degrading bacteria and whether it regulates the degradation behavior of mcs the present work aimed to address this question with the additional motive that targeting qs systems could be a potential strategy to control biodegradation of mcs bacterial strains with both mcs degradation and ahl production abilities were isolated from cyanobacterial bloom samples genomic analyses of all genome sequenced mc degrading strains were conducted to gain insights into the prevalence of luxr luxi type qs circuits within the mc degrading strains the complex qs circuitry of the mc degrading strain novosphingobium sp erw19 which served as a model organism in this study was then systematically dissected ultimately qs defective mutants and complemented strains were constructed to evaluate the regulatory role of the qs system in the biodegradation of mcs and transcriptomics and qrt pcr analyses were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms of regulation this study represents the first detailed biochemical and genetic characterization of qs systems in mc degrading bacteria and uncovers the qs regulatory mechanism in the biodegradation process of mcs 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

deletion mutants were constructed as previously described kaczmarczyk et al 2012 briefly up and down stream flanking regions of the desired deletion gene each approximately 600 bp in length were separately amplified using the primers shown in table s2 after gel purification the two fragments were fused together via a complementary tag region using cross over pcr the resulting fusion product was cloned into the suicide vector pak405 via specific restriction enzyme sites and the recombinant pak405 derivative was transformed into competent e coli s17 1 λpir the pak405 derivative was subsequently integrated into novosphingobium sp erw19 by homologous recombination this process was facilitated by conjugal transfer between donor strain e coli s17 1 λpir harboring the pak405 derivative with the recipient strain a spontaneous rifampicin resistant derivative of novosphingobium sp erw19 correct integration of the recombinant suicide vector was verified by pcr analysis in the final step in order to obtain the deletion mutation of the target gene the integrated suicide plasmid was resolved from the chromosome through a second recombination event this was accomplished by growing the strain carrying the integrated suicide vector in antibiotic free r2a broth overnight followed by gradient dilutions of the culture and plating 100 μl aliquots of each dilution onto r2a

analyses were conducted to determine whether there were significant differences in mcs biodegradation or in functional gene expression between novosphingobium sp erw19 wild type and its derivative strains all assays were performed in triplicate and the results were presented as the mean standard deviation all statistical analyses were carried out using the spss 18 0 statistical software analyses of statistical differences were conducted with student s t test 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in the proportion and composition of ahl producing bacteria during enrichment an enrichment experiment with cyanobacterial bloom samples as the seed inoculum was performed to isolate mc degrading strains with ahl producing ability during this enrichment process changes in the proportion and composition of ahl producing bacteria were investigated using a culture dependent method a total of 120 isolates were screened from the original cyanobacterial samples whereas only 41 strains were isolated from the enrichment cultures in the ahl bioassay 11 out of the 120 isolates obtained before enrichment could produce ahl this constituted around 9 2 of total cultivable isolates a proportion equivalent to the abundance of ahl producers in the natural freshwater environment huang et al 2012 this proportion increased to about 31 7 in the enrichment cultures with 13 out of the 41 isolates exhibiting the ability to produce ahl representative bioassay plates are shown in fig s1 these results suggest that the capacity for signal communication is significantly enhanced by the increased abundance of ahl producers which may in turn affect the biodegradation of mcs this novel observation provides new evidence to support the idea that qs may be involved in regulating and influencing the degradation behavior of mc degrading bacteria the 16s rrna sequence analysis revealed that all 24 ahl producing isolates belonged to proteobacteria and were assigned to two phylogenetic groups the classes alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria this is consistent with the finding that luxi and luxr homologs have only been found within proteobacterial genomes case et al 2008 members of the gammaproteobacteria were the predominant ahl producers before enrichment 81 8 whereas alphaproteobacterial members were dominant after enrichment 92 3 table s3 fig 1 showed the changes in the composition of ahl producing bacterial communities at the genus level before enrichment the predominant ahl producers were aeromonas 63 64 followed by rhizobium 18 18 pseudomonas 9 09 and serratia 9 09 the composition of the ahl producing bacterial community changed significantly after enrichment with novosphingobium one of the best known mc degrading genera becoming the major ahl producer 46 15 the remaining ahl positive strains after enrichment belonged to the genera rhizobium 15 38 methylopila 15 38 ensifer 15 38 and acinetobacter 7 69 there was only one overlapping ahl producing genus rhizobium which was isolated both before and after enrichment 3 2 screening ahl producers for mc degrading strains ahl producers were further screened using molecular methods to isolate strains that could degrade mcs the mlra protein is responsible for the initial hydrolytic cleavage of cyclic mcs and mlra targeted pcr has frequently been employed for qualitative detection of mc degrading bacteria in natural habitats and water treatment facilities saito et al 2003 bourne et al 2006 ho et al 2006 2007 chen et al 2010 jiang et al 2011 however previously reported primer sets were not designed with degenerate oligonucleotides to allow for variations that exist between different mlra homologs a novel degenerate primer set was therefore designed and used in this study thirty eight known mlra gene sequences from members of the genera sphingomonas sphingopyxis novosphingobium sphingosinicella bacillus brevundimonas catellibacterium kurthia rhizobium and stenotrophomonas as well as those for some uncultured bacteria were retrieved from the databases and used for sequence alignment two conserved dna domains were identified and used to design degenerate primers that were 20 bp long these primers mlra 271f and mlra 806r were expected to amplify a 500 bp fragment fig 2 a acclimated bacteria display increased efficiencies of mcs degradation and high adaptability under field conditions li and pan 2014 thus only ahl producers obtained from enrichment cultures were screened for the presence of mlra using pcr fragments of the expected size were successfully amplified from strains erw19 and ern07 fig 2b which are both affiliated to the genus novosphingobium table s3 blastx analysis revealed that the mlra gene sequences of strains erw19 and ern07 were 100 identical to that of novosphingobium sp thn1 jiang et al 2011 recently novel primer sets targeting the mc producing gene mcya were designed and these offer significant improvements over previously published probes in accurately identifying and quantifying mcya genes present in environmental samples lee et al 2020 similarly the novel primer set presented in this study is expected to serve as a useful genetic tool for rapid detection of mc degrading bacteria and for evaluating the mc degradation potential of environmental samples mc degradation capacities of novosphingobium sp strains erw19 and ern07 were confirmed by lc ms ms analysis strain erw19 had greater degradation activity towards both mc analogs mc lr and mc rr compared with strain ern07 fig 2c mc lr and mc rr were completely degraded by strain erw19 within 12 h without a lag phase however degradation by strain ern07 was slower with a longer lag phase of 6 h therefore novosphingobium sp erw19 which harbors both ahl based qs and efficient mc degrading systems was selected as the experimental strain for further analyses 3 3 identification of qs genes in genome sequenced mc degrading strains and functional verification of typical ahl synthases the genomes of novosphingobium sp strains erw19 and ern07 were sequenced and annotated prior to this study only five other mc degrading bacterial strains have had their whole genome sequenced the genomic features strain information and organization of qs related genes and mc degradation related genes of all currently sequenced mc degrading bacteria are presented in table 1 the genomes of all seven strains contain at least one complete ahl driven qs circuit strains erw19 and thn1 harbor two each while strain b9 has three all genome sequenced mc degrading bacteria summarized in table 1 belong to the family sphingomonadaceae the most comprehensive genome analysis of sphingomonadaceae to date indicated that 33 out of 62 members of the family sphingomonadaceae contain at least one complete ahl driven qs circuit gan et al 2015 however to our knowledge none of these 62 strains were reported to have mc degrading abilities therefore although the presence of a qs system is not uncommon among members of the sphingomonadaceae according to the available genome data all members of the sphingomonadaceae with mcs biodegradability harbor an ahl driven qs circuit without exception this implies that the ahl based qs system is a common trait within mc degrading bacteria and reflects the close correlation between qs and degradation of mcs notably the genomic surveillance of mc degrading bacteria for the distribution of luxr luxi type qs circuits in this study is the most comprehensive to date fig 3 a illustrates the linear comparison of luxr luxi pairs and flanking gene arrangements in the seven genome sequenced mc degrading strains among which a total of 11 luxi homologs were identified conserved topology was found where all identified luxr homologs are located immediately upstream of and convergently oriented with respect to the luxi genes a genomic character commonly found in the qs system of alphaproteobacteria gan et al 2013 ten of the 11 luxi homologs were genetically proximal to the downstream phytanoyl coa dioxygenase gene phyh which was also often observed in the qs system of sphingomonadaceae without mc degrading abilities gan et al 2015 however a conserved gntr family transcriptional regulator benenodin family lasso peptide lasso peptide biosynthesis b2 protein asparagine synthase b arrangement was found immediately downstream of seven of the 10 phyh genes which has not previously been reported this may constitute a signature feature for mc degrading bacteria because all seven analyzed strains harbor one such genomic topology associated with a qs circuit while members of the sphingomonadaceae without biodegradability do not contain this feature in addition to these common characteristics some strain specific features were identified for example various mobile elements involved in horizontal gene transfer hgt including transposases and integrases were found to be located upstream of the luxr luxi pairs on scaffold 14 of strain erw19 and on the plasmid pthn of strain thn1 hgt is the driving force that contributes to genome evolution diversification and adaptation of microorganisms juhas et al 2009 it is possible that some mc degrading strains acquire qs elements via hgt which might in turn affect the mc degrading behavior through qs dependent regulation an amino acid pairwise identity matrix of all identified luxi homologs in mc degrading strains was constructed fig 3b pairwise identity between different luxi homologs varied from 22 to 100 luxi homologs of mc degrading strains can be grouped into three different categories based on neighbor gene arrangement fig 3a and pairwise identity fig 3b the ahl synthases erw19 novi1 ern07 novi md 1 novi thn1 novi1 c1 sphi yf1 sphi and b9 sphi2 form category a owing to their relatively high pairwise identities with each other 46 2 100 and similar gene topologies downstream of luxr luxi pairs each of the seven mc degrading strains has one luxi included in category a the luxi homologs erw19 novi2 and thn1 novi2 are classified as category b because they share a very high sequence identity of 93 7 and mobile genetic elements involved in hgt events are found in their vicinity category c comprises the other two luxi homologs of sphingosinicella microcystinivorans b 9 b9 sphi1 and b9 sphi3 which are quite divergent ahl synthases from each other and from luxi of other strains this categorization raises the question of whether different ahl synthases exhibit similar regulatory effects on the biodegradation of mcs especially when multiple ahl synthases exist in one mc degrading strain for instance strain erw19 encodes two ahl synthases namely erw19 novi1 and erw19 novi2 which belong to category a and b respectively the qs system of novosphingobium sp erw19 was selected as a typical representative the biochemical function of the two putative ahl synthases of this strain was verified by heterologous expression in e coli bl21 de3 and identification of ahl profiles by comparing the retention time from tlc with that of standard ahl tlc analysis revealed that erw19 novi1 directed the production of medium length 3 oh c8 hsl and c8 hsl while erw19 novi2 was responsible for the production of multiple short to medium length ahl signals including 3 oh c8 hsl c8 hsl and three unknown ahls nd1 nd2 and nd3 all refer to ahls that cannot be determined based on standards available in our laboratory fig 3c the ahl profiles produced by these two ahl synthases are summarized in table s4 3 oh c8 hsl seems to be the predominant and integral ahl signal produced by sphingomonadaceae when considering data from previous studies d angelo picard et al 2005 gan et al 2016 3 4 biochemical and genetic characterization of the qs systems of mc degrading strain novosphingobium sp erw19 3 4 1 function of the two qs systems in ahl synthesis the genome of the mc degrading strain novosphingobium sp erw19 encodes two complete luxr luxi type qs systems designated novr1 novi1 and novr2 novi2 fig 3a these two qs systems were systematically characterized at chemical and genetic levels in order to elucidate their qs regulated behaviors subsequently four qs defective mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 δnovi2 and δnovr2 were constructed by in frame deletion mutagenesis kaczmarczyk et al 2012 a cross feeding assay showed that wild type wt erw19 induced blue coloration of the ahl reporter strain a tumefaciens a136 within 24 h indicating strong ahl activity compared with the wt strain only δnovr2 displayed significant ahl activity while the other three mutants showed weak coloration after incubation for 48 h fig 4 a similar results were obtained in the ahl extracts bioassay fig 4b supernatant extracts of both the wt strain and mutant δnovr2 presented strong ahl activity with the latter appearing to have produced more ahl this suggests that novr2 may also act as a transcriptional repressor in ahl synthesis in the qs hierarchy similar to the finding of churchill and chen that luxr inhibits the luxi gene in some cases ahl activities of mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 could only be detected when their supernatant extracts were concentrated 10 times ahl profiles determined by tlc assay revealed that two types of ahl including the dominant 3 oh c8 hsl and tiny amounts of nd2 nd refers to ahl with undetermined structure were identified in the supernatant extracts of the wt strain fig 4c deletion of novr2 increased the diversity of ahl species as three types of ahl 3 oh c8 hsl nd1 and nd2 were detected in the supernatant extracts of the δnovr2 mutant the mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 only produced trace amounts of 3 oh c8 hsl in summary the absence of novr2 promoted ahl production both in quantity and type while individually knocking out of novi1 novr1 and novi2 dramatically reduced the ahl activity of the mc degrading strain erw19 table s4 furthermore we have also constructed the double knockout mutant δnovi1novi2 as expected ahl bioassay result showed that the mutant δnovi1novi2 could not produce ahl fig s2 which confirmed our conclusion that strain erw19 only encodes two ahl synthases functional complementation was conducted by introducing a plasmid borne copy of the deleted genes into the respective qs defective mutants to exclude possible polar effects of gene disruption on other genes as expected all complemented strains showed restored ahl production ability compared with the wt strain and corresponding mutant genotypes fig s3a and fig 4a specifically complementation of novi1 or novr1 partially restored ahl activity to the wild type level while complementation of novi2 or novr2 almost fully recovered the ahl producing capacity compared with that of the wt strain fig s3b ahl profiles revealed by tlc analysis were congruent with this result with only the 3 oh c8 hsl signal being synthesized by complemented strains δnovi1 pcm62 novi1 and δnovr1 pcm62 novr1 while both δnovi2 pcm62 novi2 and δnovr2 pcm62 novr2 produced identical ahl profiles to the wt strain fig s3c and table s4 we suspected that the expression of novi1 or novr1 from an inducible promoter complemented its own expression but not that of all downstream genes as has been reported previously van kessel et al 2015 3 4 2 regulatory relationships between the two qs systems to determine whether there was a hierarchical relationship between the novr1 novi1 and novr2 novi2 qs systems qrt pcr analysis of two ahl synthase genes novi1 and novi2 was performed to examine their expression in the wt strain and qs mutants rna samples were prepared from the wt strain and qs mutants grown at 30 c in r2a broth for 48 h consistent with the culture conditions used for ahl extraction deletion of novr1 and novr2 significantly decreased the expression of novi1 and novi2 compared to the wt strain p 0 001 respectively fig 5 indicating that both ahl synthase genes were positively regulated by corresponding receptors this is a typical feature of the luxr luxi type qs system papenfort and bassler 2016 mutation of novr1 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the expression of novi2 compared to the wt strain p 0 001 suggesting that the novr1 novi1 system has a positive regulatory effect on the novr2 novi2 system this explains why the δnovr1 mutant produced limited quantities of ahl because the absence of novr1 significantly decreased the expression of both ahl synthase genes furthermore the knockout of novr2 significantly up regulated the expression of novi1 compared to the wt strain p 0 01 therefore the increased production of ahl in δnovr2 mutant fig 4 is mainly attributed to the increased expression of novi1 compared to the wt strain in other words the repression function of novr2 in ahl synthesis mainly lies in its inhibition effect on novi1 which can be relieved by mutation of novr2 inhibition of the expression of novi1 by novr2 is probably due to competition for common substrates both ahl synthases novi1 and novi2 mainly catalyze the production of 3 oh c8 hsl fig 3c and may be competing for 3 hydroxy acyl acyl carrier protein conjugates churchill and chen 2011 zan et al 2012 the hyper production of ahl by the δnovr2 mutant may result from the absence of the novr2 novi2 system for competition for substrates however despite the significantly higher expression level of novi1 p 0 05 and also the absence of substrate competition in the δnovi2 mutant compared with that in the wt strain the δnovi2 mutant displayed very low ahl activity fig 4b this could be because in addition to gene transcription and substrate competition various factors at the levels of post transcription translation protein activity and signal degradation affect the secretion and accumulation of ahl baumgardt et al 2014 more in depth future works are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms to summarize the two qs systems of mc degrading bacterium novosphingobium sp erw19 form a regulatory hierarchy in which novr1 positively regulates the expression of novi2 whereas novr2 has a negative feedback effect on novi1 thereby creating a positive negative feedback loop 3 5 regulatory roles of the two qs systems in degradation of mcs 3 5 1 effect of the two qs systems on mc degrading activity the mc degrading activity of the wt strain and qs defective mutants was compared to examine whether the qs systems of novosphingobium sp erw19 were involved in biodegradation of mcs all qs deficient mutants exhibited reduced capacity to degrade mcs compared with that of the wt strain which completely degraded both mc analogs within 12 h mc lr fig 6 a mc rr fig 6c the mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 displayed more significant decline in biodegradability than δnovr2 which was congruent with the remarkable ahl deficiency in the former three mutants however although the deletion of novr2 promoted ahl production capacity the δnovr2 mutant showed slighter decrease in the mc degradation rate we suspected that this was because the absence of novr2 significantly decreased the expression of novi2 which has the most significant inhibitory effect on the degradation of mcs as revealed in the δnovi2 mutant fig 6a c more specifically in the mutant δnovr2 the inhibition of mcs degradation resulting from decreased expression of novi2 may be greater than that of the degradation activation caused by increased expression of novi1 leading to lower degradation rate compared with the wild type strain therefore both the novr1 novi1 and the novr2 novi2 qs systems of novosphingobium sp erw19 are required for enhanced degradation of mcs and the absence of any of the qs elements results in the attenuation of the degradation of mcs to some extent as expected repression of mcs degradation in all qs defective mutants could be relieved by genetic complementation the degradation deficiency in the mutants δnovi2 and δnovr2 was restored to degradation levels in excess of those of the wt strain when complemented with the plasmid borne copy of novi2 and novr2 respectively fig 6b d however mc degrading activities were only partially recovered in the complemented strains δnovi1 pcm62 novi1 and δnovr1 pcm62 novr1 this could be attributed to ahl synthesis not being fully restored in these two strains as shown in fig s3b positive roles for ahl mediated qs systems in the biodegradation of many organic pollutants have been reported for example in phenanthrene and pyrene mangwani et al 2016a phenol valle et al 2004 yong and zhong 2010 2013 denitrification toyofuku et al 2007 anthranilate degradation chugani and greenberg 2010 and ammonium oxidation de clippeleir et al 2011 however previous studies have often relied on exogenous addition of ahl chemicals or ahl producing strains and genetic manipulations such as gene knockout and complementation which provide more direct genetic evidence of qs regulated behaviors were rarely used toyofuku et al 2007 yong and zhong 2013 to our knowledge this is the first report proving that qs regulates biodegradation of mcs thus expanding the range of known qs regulated behaviors in bacteria 3 5 2 transcriptional regulation of mc degradation related genes by the two qs systems transcriptional differences in mc degradation related genes between the wt strain and qs defective mutants during the degradation process at 6 h and 18 h respectively were determined to further elucidate regulatory mechanisms of the two qs systems in the degradation of mcs fig s4 presents the heatmap of relative expression levels of genes involved in ahl synthesis and degradation of mcs in the wt and qs mutants at 6 h as determined by rna seq in general although expression patterns of mc degradation related genes in the wt strain and δnovr2 mutant were similar those in mutants δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 were more alike fig s4 this trend was consistent with their mc degrading activities fig 4a b and fig 6a c although ahl production activity was not measured during degradation of mcs similar relative expression patterns of ahl synthase genes novi1 and novi2 between the wt and qs mutants were observed in fig 5 and fig s4 this provided an evidence to support that the wt strain and four qs mutants may possess similar relative ahl production capacity as shown in fig 4a b during degradation of mcs more specifically except for mlrc the transcription levels of mlra mlrb mlrd mlre mlrf and paaase genes were all significantly decreased in δnovi1 δnovr1 and δnovi2 mutants compared with those in the wt p 0 001 table s5 this was in accordance with the significantly repressed mc degrading activities in the three mutants notably the most significantly down regulated gene was mlra the first and most important gene in the mlr pathway bourne et al 1996 absolute log2 fold change values between each of the three mutants and the wt strain were 4 table s5 in the δnovr2 mutant only mlra among the various mc degradation related genes was significantly down regulated p 0 001 but the absolute log2 fold change values versus the wt strain were much lower than that of the other three mutants 1 46 at 6 h and 1 9 at 18 h table s5 this explained why the δnovr2 mutant showed the least reduction in degradation of mcs among the four qs deficient mutants these results indicate that both qs systems of novosphingobium sp erw19 positively regulate biodegradation of mcs through transcriptional induction of the mlr pathway especially transcription of mlra this conclusion was verified by qrt pcr analysis fig 7 furthermore in accordance with the effect of gene complementation on the mc degrading ability of the qs mutants fig 6b d partially restored expression levels of mc degradation related genes were observed in the complemented strains δnovi1 pcm62 novi1 and δnovr1 pcm62 novr1 while the transcriptional levels of these genes were higher in δnovi2 pcm62 novi2 and δnovr2 pcm62 novr2 than those in the wt strain fig 7 this was presumably due to the presence of multiple plasmid borne copies of the complemented genes atkinson et al 2008 qs also positively regulated the transcription of phenylacetic acid paa degradation gene paaase gene table s5 and fig 7 which has recently been shown to be involved in the downstream pathway of mc degradation yang et al 2020 the mc degrading intermediate adda was proposed to be degraded via paa metabolism and eventually completely converted into co2 via the tca cycle yang et al 2020 based on our data it is plausible that the enhanced mlr pathway and paa metabolism regulated by qs could accelerate the carbon source supply for the tca cycle provide an energy source for cell growth and promote bacterial survival and adaptation in such a toxic environment the results of this study were used as a basis to propose a conceptual model for qs regulation mechanisms during biodegradation of mcs fig 8 by using genomic mutational and complementary analyses this work confirmed our hypothesis that ahl based qs is a common trait among mlr pathway dependent mc degrading bacterial strains and qs system positively regulates mcs degradation activity through transcriptional induction of mc degrading genes especially mlra the first and most important gene in the mlr pathway due to the prevalence of qs system and the key role of mlr pathway in the biodegradation of mcs as well as the chemical and genetic operability of qs systems targeting qs systems could be a potential strategy to control biodegradation of mcs our work provides new insights into the development of more effective biological methods for the remediation of mcs pollution in water bodies 4 conclusions in this study the observation that the proportion of culturable ahl producers increased significantly after enrichment of mcs prompted us to speculate that mcs generated during cyanobacterial blooms are preferentially utilized by bacteria with qs systems this speculation is coincident with the finding that all genome sequenced mlr pathway dependent mc degrading strains harbor ahl based qs system suggesting that qs is a common feature among these strains systematic characterization of the two qs systems of mc degrading strain novosphingobium sp erw19 reveal that novr1 positively regulates the expression of novi2 whereas novr2 has a negative feedback effect on the expression of novi1 thus creating a hierarchy qs network it is precisely because of this interconnected relationship both qs systems were proved to play positive regulatory roles in mcs degradation transcriptomic results demonstrated that the activation of degradation activity by qs systems relies on the transcriptional induction of mc degrading genes especially mlra this work provides new insights into the regulatory role of qs in the biodegradation of mcs during cyanobacterial blooms and a novel approach for developing more effective biological

al 2020 in fact args have been detected in tap water at an abundance of 2 8 10 2 to 4 2 10 1 copies cell in 25 cities worldwide ma et al 2017 at 2 25 10 2 copies cell after o3 cl2 disinfection zhang et al 2019a and at 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell in small sized microbes ma et al 2019 at the same time waterborne pathogens especially arg carrying opportunistic bacterial pathogens in drinking water systems are a key source of waterborne diseases paul mcclung et al 2018 as args and waterborne pathogens in drinking water sources can migrate to tap water systematic depiction of antibiotic resistomes and their host pathogens in drinking water sources is essential for water source protection and optimization of drinking water biosafety however studies on the co occurrence of args and pathogens in drinking water microbiomes remain limited which has hindered risk assessment of opportunistic pathogens in drinking water sources the complexity of drinking water sources also hampers our understanding of antibiotic resistomes bacterial communities and mobile genetic elements mges are associated with the vertical and horizontal dissemination of args respectively forsberg et al 2014 gillings et al 2015 concretely args vertically transfer during the reproduction of bacterial hosts and the close links between bacterial community shifts and arg dynamics indicate the contribution of vertical pathway of arg dissemination args also horizontally transfer between different bacterial cells via transformation transduction or conjugation and diverse mges have been reported to accelerate the horizontal pathway antibiotics can exert direct selection on antibiotic resistant bacteria arb chen et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 these variables may contribute to the considerable arg variation found in drinking water sources in addition drinking water sources are highly diverse among the different types e g river lake reservoir and groundwater and at different geographical scales recent investigations on single rivers and reservoirs revealed seasonal variation and anthropogenic promotion of args dang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b zheng et al 2018 furthermore a large scale survey of args in lakes reservoirs from central and eastern china identified environmental selection and dispersal limitations or barriers as the ecological mechanisms of the biogeographical patterns liu et al 2018 however most previous investigations on the determinants of args have been spatially limited or have only focused on a single type often neglecting the common occurrences indicators and influencing factors of antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources at large geographical scales to clarify the multiple drivers and co occurrence with opportunistic pathogens of the antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources we carried out a systematic survey to profile the relationships among args and sample types e g river reservoir and groundwater geographical positions antibiotics bacterial communities mges and opportunistic bacterial pathogens in total 53 water samples were collected from the inlet of drinking water treatment plants across china and the above mentioned variables were profiled with multivariate statistical approaches the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the co occurrence of args mges and specific opportunistic pathogens in drinking water sources 2 investigate variations in args and mges across sample types and geographical location and 3 disentangle the interactions among the multiple environmental factors e g antibiotics bacterial communities and mges shaping arg structure at a large geographical scale by collecting samples spanning across 4 000 km with highly diverse antibiotic resistomes and local conditions our results could decrease stochastic variabilities and reveal universal patterns of antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and antibiotic analysis a total of 53

methods were conducted using r 3 4 3 network analysis has been used extensively in ecological and biological studies to visualize the underlying associations among microbial taxa functional genes and proteins in complex microbial communities gómez et al 2010 ju and zhang 2014 here a correlation matrix was constructed by calculating all pairwise spearman s correlations among arg and mge subtypes using the hmisc package in r 3 4 3 harrell and frank 2008 the args and mges that occurred in 50 of all samples were discarded to reduce the complexity of computation and avoid spurious correlation

assay were detected in at least one sample and the detection frequencies ranged from 47 to 165 fig s1c among sample types arg diversity exhibited significant differences with the average number of

sample types with args fig 1 s2 and s3 table s4 in total 101 genes were shared among 50 samples which accounted for 98 21 of total abundance of the resistome these frequently occurring genes in drinking water sources which were share among 50 samples were defined as the common resistome by previous study yan et al 2019 as shown in fig 1c a total of 28 genes were shared among 80 samples fig s4 and aada aada2 qaceδ1 and tnpa were found in all samples fig s4 3 2 characterization of bacterial community bacterial abundance measured by the copy number of the 16s rrna gene ranged from 3 16 105

distinct among the three sample types permanova f 2 968 p 0 001 table s4 3 3 geographical distribution of bacterial communities args and mges the collected drinking water source samples spanned 4 000 km across china thus providing an opportunity to explore the geographical distribution of bacterial communities and resistomes both args and mges showed distance decay relationships but significance was weaker than that of bacterial communities fig 3a c the bacterial community arg and mge diversities were also negatively correlated with latitude p 0 05 fig 3d f indicating the important effects of spatial factors 3 4 co occurrence of opportunistic pathogens args and mges escherichia coli mycobacterium spp clostridium perfringens bacillus cereus group and aeromonas hydrophila were quantified in the drinking water samples abundance of mycobacterium spp 0 0013 copies 16s rrna gene on average was higher than that of the other four detected opportunistic pathogens p 0 05 fig s6d significant correlations between pathogens and args and mges were found except for aeromonas hydrophila fig 2 in total 19 args and one mge were positively correlated with clostridium perfringens indicating that this pathogen may carry multiple args at the same time fig 2 the co occurrence patterns of args and mges were visualized using network analysis and the modularity features were obtained args blaveb beta lactamase resistance gene vantg vancomycin resistance gene and erea mlsb resistance gene were identified as hub genes for three largest modules modules i ii and iii respectively and consequently could be used as indicators for co occurring args in each module fig s5 table s5 args with similar resistome phenotypes tetracycline in module i vancomycin in module ii and multidrug in module iii were also clustered together fig s5 3 5 relationships among args mges bacterial communities and antibiotics the absolute abundance relative abundance normalized by 16s rrna gene copy number and diversity of args were significantly correlated with those of mges p 0 001 fig 4a and s7 positive correlations between arg and mge types were also widespread fig 4 b indicating the important role of horizontal transfer during arg dissemination the procrustes tests depicted significant correlations between arg structure and bacterial community structure based on the bray curtis dissimilarity

chloroflexi firmicutes and bacteroidetes respectively were positively related to specific arg mge subtypes spearman s r 0 7 p 0 001 suggesting these bacterial taxa were potential hosts of the corresponding args or mges in addition absolute abundance of bacteria was significantly correlated with absolute abundance of args and mges both total and type fig s8 hinting that antibiotic resistome abundance may be in scale with bacterial cell number antibiotics in drinking water sources were diverse fig s9a with total concentrations of sas mls fqs and tcs ranging from 0 10 to 1 454 60 ng l and total concentrations differing among the three sample types kw test p 0 01 fig s9b the average concentrations of the four antibiotic categories were sas 115 76 ng l mls 86 92 ng l fqs 9 45 ng l tcs 0 51 ng l fig 4e correlation analysis indicated that the concentrations of sas mls and ʃantibiotics i e the sum of detected antibiotics were correlated with abundance and diversity of args mges and some specific args and mges types p 0 05 but the correlations between fqs and tcs with args and mges were weak fig 4f suggesting that the selective pressure of antibiotics on organisms carrying args in water was dose dependent 3 6 multiple factors influenced arg profiles interactively redundancy analysis rda was performed to better understand the effects of environmental factors on arg structure fig 5 a in addition rda based variation partitioning analysis vpa further differentiated the contributions of space mges bacterial communities and antibiotics on arg variation fig 5b the bacterial community 14 60 showed greater contribution to args followed by antibiotics 11 60 mges 9 26 and space 5 20 the joint effects of multiple factors explained 5 85 of arg variation leaving 53 49 of arg variation unexplained the sems quantified the indirect and direct effects of space sample type bacterial abundance bacterial diversity antibiotics and mges on arg profiles from a holistic view all variables explained 62 of arg structure variance figs 5c and 69 of arg abundance variation fig s10 importantly although space and sample type did not affect arg profiles directly when accounting for multiple factors they exerted an indirect influence based on changing bacterial communities antibiotics and mges space influenced bacterial abundance λ 0 32 p 0 01 bacterial diversity λ 0 55 p 0 001 and mges λ 0 52 p 0 001 in the sems in line with the geographical distribution patterns of the bacterial communities and mges fig 3 sample type showed a significant influence on bacterial abundance λ 0 42 p 0 01 bacterial diversity λ 0 29 p 0 01 and antibiotic concentration λ 0 36 p 0 01 as confirmed by comparison tests figs s2 s3 and s9b both the vpa and sem results demonstrated that potential causal relationships may occur among args and their multiple influencing factors and these factors shape arg profiles interactively 4 discussion drinking water treatment processes cannot eliminate args from drinking water sources absolutely and thus drinking water supply systems may be a primary dissemination route of args from the environment to host causing potential risks to human health understanding the antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources could provide important information to improve drinking water management strategies given the great variation and multiple drivers of args in drinking water sources systematic data mining of args and related variables is urgent to the best of our knowledge this study presents the most comprehensive investigation on antibiotic resistomes in different drinking water sources with consideration of biotic factors vertical and horizontal transfer potential abiotic factors antibiotic pollution spatial distribution sample types river reservoir and groundwater and relationships with opportunistic pathogens due to the 4 000 km scale variations among samples we collected diverse bacterial community and arg data to be random and not biased 4 1 occurrence and biogeography of antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources antibiotic resistomes were widely found in the tested samples fig 1 and s1 however the abundance of args detected in the current study was lower than that reported in manure han et al 2018 and estuarine sediment zhu et al 2017 using the same ht qpcr platform it is not surprising that args were prevalent in drinking water sources as intrinsic antibiotic resistomes also occur in natural ecosystems such as forest biomes with low human disturbance hu et al 2018 caves isolated from the surface for over four million years pawlowski et al 2016 and 30 000 year old beringian permafrost sediment d costa et al 2011 although it is accepted that args are ancient and widespread each ecosystem contains different bacterial community and thus contains different dominate args on the other hand drinking water sources are disturbed by human activities the influencing factors of antibiotic resistome might be more complex and multiple by large scale sampling we identified a more universal pattern of args in drinking water sources similar to previous research chen et al 2018 liu et al 2018 our study revealed that multidrug aminoglycoside and betalactamase resistance genes were dominant in drinking water sources with multidrug resistance genes also dominant in treated drinking water ma et al 2019 despite the great diversity in arg composition a common resistome was identified in the drinking water samples fig 1c s4 we found 101 and 28 args were shared among 50 and 80 of all samples respectively fig 1c s4 indicating dominant and stable args shared by drinking water sources spanning the 31 cities over 4 000 km across china notably aminoglycoside resistance gene aada multidrug resistance gene qaceδ1 and transposase gene tnpa were found in all samples fig s4 the aada and qaceδ genes are known components of integron gene cassettes gillings 2014 partridge et al 2009 thus hinting the potential of horizontal gene transfer during arg dissemination in natural waters transposon is a kind of common mobile element in bacteria aziz et al 2010 transposon could carry diverse args including tet a tet b tet e and tet 31 shi et al 2020 and mediate efficient dissemination of antibiotic resistance among bacterial communities partridge 2011 the widespread tnpa genes in drinking water sources could accelerate the dissemination of args through horizontal gene transfer in addition considerable arg diversity and abundance was found in the drinking water sources suggesting that different risk levels of antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources require different treatment strategies to improve drinking water biosafety biogeographical distribution is a common phenomenon in natural ecosystems martiny et al 2006 and engineered systems wu et al 2019 the distance decay relationship i e decrease in similarity with increasing geographical distance can be used to confirm biogeographical patterns hanson et al 2012 dispersal limitation of microbe is the reason of distance decay relationship and has been considered as a basic rule of bacterial community assembly martiny et al 2006 the spatial distribution of args has been studied in sediments along the yangtze estuary china guo et al 2018 and in lakes in eastern china liu et al 2018 our study further verified this in drinking water sources at the national scale there might be several reasons behind this phenomenon firstly the hosts of args i e the bacterial community showed clear geographical patterns fig 3a and d secondly antibiotic concentrations also showed geographical patterns spearman s correlation between antibiotic concentration and latitude r 0 331 p 0 015 which might be correlated with human activity density in different areas in china zhang et al 2015 thirdly rapid spatial turnover of the integron gene was found which could be a contributor of arg biogeographical distribution ghaly et al 2019 in addition the significance of distance decay relationship of args and mges was weaker than that of bacterial community indicating the contributions of geographical location to the arg variation mge variation were weaker than bacterial community variation args and mges might be shaped by more complex environmental variables than bacterial community 4 2 potential pathogenic hosts of args opportunistic pathogens in bulk water wang et al 2012 biofilms gomez smith et al 2015 cooling towers pereira et al 2017 and water storage tanks li et al 2018 have been profiled and qpcr protocols targeting them are well established wang et al 2017 drinking water sources are important origins of opportunistic pathogens in tap water opportunistic pathogens in drinking water sources such as mycobacterium do not disappear after water treatment and can even increase after disinfection dias et al 2020 hull et al 2017 arg carrying pathogens are among the most important risk factors to drinking water safety wang et al 2017 and thus the occurrence and co occurrence of args with opportunistic pathogens were explored in the present study we observed the prevalence of five opportunistic pathogens in drinking water sources based on network analysis the abundances of escherichia coli mycobacterium spp clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus group were significantly correlated with args with 19 args and one mge found to be positively correlated with clostridium perfringens previous research has reported resistance rates of clostridium perfringens isolated from diarrheal neonatal piglets for erythromycin and lincomycin of over 50 with 82 of resistant isolates resistant to at least two antibiotics ngamwongsatit et al 2016 mycobacterium gordonae has also been detected as an arg carrying pathogen in drinking water ma et al 2019 our results suggested that the four opportunistic pathogens might act as hosts of args fig 2 highlighting the importance of considering multidrug resistance in opportunistic bacterial pathogens in drinking water sources it should be noted that our results on the co occurrence of args and opportunistic pathogens relied on correlation methods and additional molecular detection of arg host pathogens needs to be done in the future although it has been reported that aeromonas hydrophila acquired resistance to oxytetracycline hatha et al 2005 and carried tetracycline efflux protein gene tet e shi et al 2020 it was not found as potential host of args in the present study the limitation of correlation analysis the limited amount of tested args and low selective pressure of tetracycline might explain this phenomenon and future studies are needed 4 3 integrated effects of multiple factors on antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources from a holistic perspective this study revealed the integrated influences of diverse variables on the antibiotic resistomes of drinking water sources which were multiple and interactive these results reflected actual environmental processes as much as possible and suggested the need for compositive monitoring systems for drinking water sources the close relationships among bacterial communities args and mges were revealed by vpa and sem analyses as reported in previous study forsberg et al 2014 from the sem results the concentration of antibiotics did not exert a significant influence on bacterial abundance and diversity λ 0 14 p 0 05 and λ 0 03 p 0 05 respectively however it still showed potential selective pressure on args λ 0 21 p 0 05 and mges λ 0 46 p 0 001 fig 5c similar trends have also been reported in river reservoir systems with anthropogenic activities chen et al 2018 in the pearl river in southern china chen et al 2015 and in sediment samples along the chinese coastline zhu et al 2017 here antibiotic concentrations followed the trend sas 115 76 ng l mls 86 92 ng l fqs 9 45 ng l tcs 0 51 ng l fig 4e and only two antibiotic groups with higher concentrations i e sas and mls showed close correlation with args fig 4e and f waterbodies act as the sink of pollution from human activities and the relative high concentration of sas 115 76 ng l in drinking water sources might be explained by the wide use of sas in clinical and animal environment zhang et al 2015 compared to antibiotic production wastewater bengtsson palme et al 2019 the concentrations of each antibiotic in the current study were very low fig s9 however the correlation between args and antibiotics was still significant and dose dependent the possible reasons were firstly the complex arg co selection features of diverse antibiotics which could be also called as the joint selective pressure of diverse antibiotics may exist kovacevic et al 2013 secondly antibiotic concentrations may reflect the human activity density and anthropogenic factors which could promote the widespread dissemination of args zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 the vpa results implied that the joint effects of multiple factors contributed to arg variation with the sem results disentangling the causal relationships among the multiple variables to a certain extent fig 5 space and sample type of drinking water sources showed indirect effects through bacterial communities antibiotics and mges on args concretely the differences in bacteria and antibiotics among sample type were the main reason for their influence on antibiotic resistome and the shift in bacterial abundance diversity and mges along the geographical gradient was the main reason for the spatial variable structuring of the antibiotic resistome fig 5c in brief overall variation of the antibiotic resistome was the result of interactions among natural and anthropogenic factors 4 4 implications for drinking water source management on controlling args selection and protection of drinking water sources is a key issue in drinking water safety our results showed that the bacterial community was a major driver of the antibiotic resistome arg abundance was associated with abundance of several opportunistic pathogens and antibiotics were linked to antibiotic resistome trends fig 5b therefore protecting drinking water sources from antibiotic and biological contamination by strict policies may be practical actions toward future drinking water source management livestock and poultry breeding wastewater awad et al 2014 clinical wastewater hocquet et al 2016 and antibiotic production wastewater li et al 2010 are priority targets although limited groundwater samples were studied here our research showed that drinking water from groundwater sources contained lower antibiotic concentrations bacterial biomass and arg abundance and diversity suggesting that groundwater may be a safer and healthier drinking water source in the future more groundwater samples need to be collected at large scale to obtain more understanding on microbiome and args in groundwater opportunistic pathogens especially arg host pathogens may be more important monitoring objectives than args themselves we found that args co occurred with four opportunistic pathogens and qpcr and high throughput sequencing protocols could be used for daily monitoring and risk assessment of drinking water sources in the future because args can survive treatment such monitoring and assessment are also essential for tap water in addition as natural conditions also affected bacterial biomass and arg abundance the background values of the antibiotic resistomes may be a function of the climatic region and waterbody type assessment and optimization of techniques for antibiotic and arg removal are essential disinfection can degrade and deactivate args especially extracellular args he et al 2019 and integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration can effectively reduce args li et al 2019 because of the great diversity in antibiotic contamination in drinking water sources stringent purification strategies in drinking water treatment plants should be considered monitoring of drinking water sources could help us assess the potential health risks of args and pathogens and drinking water sources with high risk of biological pollution need stricter disinfection or membrane treatment in addition to conventional water treatment processes 5 conclusions this study performed a comprehensive survey of the antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources at a large geographical scale drinking water sources were found to be reservoirs of args which may be hosted by some opportunistic bacterial pathogens based on large scale sampling our results indicated that the determinants of arg patterns were multiple and interactive bacterial communities antibiotic concentrations and mges were directly associated with args and these direct factors were restricted by geographical location and sample type these findings extend our knowledge regarding the occurrence and distribution of args in drinking water sources and have implications for the optimization of water source protection and drinking water treatment to mitigate the dissemination of environmental args to hosts declaration of competing interest the authors

17758,antibiotic resistance genes args can survive the water treatment process however the prevalence patterns key drivers and relationships with opportunistic pathogens of the antibiotic resistome harbored in drinking water sources remain unclear herein 53 drinking water samples collected across a large geographical scale in china were characterized based on args mobile genetic elements mges bacterial communities antibiotics and opportunistic bacterial pathogens a total of 265 unique args and mges were detected by high throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction ht qpcr and 101 genes were shared among over 50 of samples arg abundance was higher in rivers than in reservoirs or groundwater and arg similarity showed a distance decay relationship at the 4 000 km scale four out of the five detected opportunistic pathogens i e escherichia coli mycobacterium spp clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus group were potential hosts of args based on multivariate statistics our results demonstrated that the factors influencing the antibiotic resistome in drinking water sources were multiple and interactive the bacterial community greatly contributed to arg structure and antibiotic concentrations and mges also affected arg proliferation the structural equation model indicated that geographical location and sample types i e river reservoir and groundwater had indirect effects on args by changing the bacterial community and antibiotic concentration holistic consideration of natural and anthropogenic factors is recommended to understand antibiotic resistome variation in drinking water sources at a large geographical scale furthermore large scale diverse samples are suggested to minimize the potential influence of accident or stochasticity our findings provide

drinking water is an important medium for the propagation of args and pathogens between the environment and humans o flaherty et al 2018 drinking water sources can host diverse args and pathogens due to their links with pollution from manure contaminated soil udikovic kolic et al 2014 antibiotic production wastewater li et al 2010 and urban and hospital sewage szekeres et al 2017 our recent large scale investigation reported that drinking water sources are bacterial community seeds for tap water and this biological contribution may not be eliminated by drinking water treatment processes han et al 2020 in fact args have been detected in tap water at an abundance of 2 8 10 2 to 4 2 10 1 copies cell in 25 cities worldwide ma et al 2017 at 2 25 10 2 copies cell after o3 cl2 disinfection zhang et al 2019a and at 4 0 10 2 to 1 0 100 copies cell in small sized microbes ma et al 2019 at the same time waterborne pathogens especially arg carrying opportunistic bacterial pathogens in drinking water systems are a key source of waterborne diseases paul mcclung et al 2018 as args and waterborne pathogens in drinking water sources can migrate to tap water systematic depiction of antibiotic resistomes and their host pathogens in drinking water sources is essential for water source protection and optimization of drinking water biosafety however studies on the co occurrence of args and pathogens in drinking water microbiomes remain limited which has hindered risk assessment of opportunistic pathogens in drinking water sources the complexity of drinking water sources also hampers our understanding of antibiotic resistomes bacterial communities and mobile genetic elements mges are associated with the vertical and horizontal dissemination of args respectively forsberg et al 2014 gillings et al 2015 concretely args vertically transfer during the reproduction of bacterial hosts and the close links between bacterial community shifts and arg dynamics indicate the contribution of vertical pathway of arg dissemination args also horizontally transfer between different bacterial cells via transformation transduction or conjugation and diverse mges have been reported to accelerate the horizontal pathway antibiotics can exert direct selection on antibiotic resistant bacteria arb chen et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 these variables may contribute to the considerable arg variation found in drinking water sources in addition drinking water sources are highly diverse among the different types e g river lake reservoir and groundwater and at different geographical scales recent investigations on single rivers and reservoirs revealed seasonal variation and anthropogenic promotion of args dang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b zheng et al 2018 furthermore a large scale survey of args in lakes reservoirs from central and eastern china identified environmental selection and dispersal limitations or barriers as the ecological mechanisms of the biogeographical patterns liu et al 2018 however most previous investigations on the determinants of args have been spatially limited or have only focused on a single type often neglecting the common occurrences indicators and influencing factors of antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources at large geographical scales to clarify the multiple drivers and co occurrence with opportunistic pathogens of the antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources we carried out a systematic survey to profile the relationships among args and sample types e g river reservoir and groundwater geographical positions antibiotics bacterial communities mges and opportunistic bacterial pathogens in total 53 water samples were collected from the inlet of drinking water treatment plants across china and the above mentioned variables were profiled with multivariate statistical approaches the objectives of this study were to 1 explore the co occurrence of args mges and specific opportunistic pathogens in drinking water sources 2 investigate variations in args and mges across sample types and geographical location and 3 disentangle the interactions among the multiple environmental factors e g antibiotics bacterial communities and mges shaping arg structure at a large geographical scale by collecting samples spanning across 4 000 km with highly diverse antibiotic resistomes and local conditions our results could decrease stochastic variabilities and reveal universal patterns of antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and antibiotic analysis a total of 53

were performed using the vegan package dixon 2003 principal coordinate analysis pcoa permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova analysis of similarities anosim and multi response permutation procedures mrpp were used to investigate differences in the bray curtis similarity of composition of the bacterial community args and mges between samples anderson 2001 distance decay relationships between geographical distances and bray curtis similarities of the bacterial community args and mges were calculated based on linear regression using vegan and soda packages mantel test procrustes test redundancy analysis rda and variation partition analysis vpa were used to explore the relationships among arg profiles based on args and potential influencing factors with the vegan

the vegan and soda packages vincenty 1975 data were normalized using log transformation when necessary prior to statistical analysis the threshold for significance was p 0 05 the above mentioned methods were conducted using r 3 4 3 network analysis has been used extensively in ecological and biological studies to visualize the underlying associations among microbial taxa functional genes and proteins in complex microbial communities gómez et al 2010 ju and zhang 2014 here a correlation matrix was constructed by calculating all pairwise spearman s correlations among arg and mge subtypes using the hmisc package in r 3 4 3 harrell and frank 2008 the args and mges that occurred in 50 of all samples were discarded to reduce the complexity of computation and avoid spurious correlation

assay were detected in at least one sample and the detection frequencies ranged from 47 to 165 fig s1c among sample types arg diversity exhibited significant differences with the average number of

eight transposase genes were detected in at least one sample and the detection frequency ranged from 3 to 10 both mge diversity and abundance showed similar trends in variation among the different sample types with args fig 1 s2 and s3 table s4 in total 101 genes were shared among 50 samples which accounted for 98 21 of total abundance of the resistome these frequently occurring genes in drinking water sources which were share among 50 samples were defined as the common resistome by previous study yan et al 2019 as shown in fig 1c a total of 28 genes were shared among 80 samples fig s4 and aada aada2 qaceδ1 and tnpa were found in all samples fig s4 3 2 characterization of bacterial community bacterial abundance measured by the copy number of the 16s rrna gene ranged from 3 16 105 to 3 39 107 copies ml in the drinking water samples average bacterial abundance followed the order river 8 48 106 copies ml reservoir 4 47 106 copies ml groundwater 9 88 105 copies ml kw test p 0 05

river samples 5 44 0 83 was higher than that in reservoir 4 05 1 09 or groundwater samples 3 42 0 51 kw test p 0 01 fig s6a c dissimilarity tests revealed that the bacterial community structure was distinct among the three sample types permanova f 2 968 p 0 001 table s4 3 3 geographical distribution of bacterial communities args and mges the collected drinking water source samples spanned 4 000 km across china thus providing an opportunity to explore the geographical distribution of bacterial communities and resistomes both args and mges showed distance decay relationships but significance was weaker than that of bacterial communities fig 3a c the bacterial community arg and mge diversities were also negatively correlated with latitude p 0 05 fig 3d f indicating the important effects of spatial factors 3 4 co occurrence of opportunistic pathogens args and mges escherichia coli mycobacterium spp clostridium perfringens bacillus cereus group and aeromonas hydrophila were quantified in the drinking water samples abundance of mycobacterium spp 0 0013 copies 16s rrna gene on average was higher than that of the other four detected opportunistic pathogens p 0 05 fig s6d significant correlations between pathogens and args and mges were found except for aeromonas hydrophila fig 2 in total 19 args and one mge were positively correlated with clostridium perfringens indicating that this pathogen may carry multiple args at the same time fig 2 the co occurrence patterns of args and mges were visualized using network analysis and the modularity features were obtained args blaveb beta lactamase resistance gene vantg vancomycin resistance gene and erea mlsb resistance gene were identified as hub genes for three largest modules modules i ii and iii respectively and consequently could be used as indicators for co occurring args in each module fig s5 table s5 args with similar resistome phenotypes tetracycline in module i vancomycin in module ii and multidrug in module iii were also clustered together fig s5 3 5 relationships among args mges bacterial communities and antibiotics the absolute abundance relative abundance normalized by 16s rrna gene copy number and diversity of args were significantly correlated with those of mges p 0 001 fig 4a and s7 positive correlations between arg and mge types were also widespread fig 4 b indicating the important role of horizontal transfer during arg dissemination the procrustes tests depicted significant correlations between arg structure and bacterial community structure based on the bray curtis dissimilarity

mges and 65 edges was visualized to explore the interactions among args mges and bacterial taxa fig 4d table s6 a total of 11 3 3 3 and 2 genera affiliated with proteobacteria actinobacteria chloroflexi firmicutes and bacteroidetes respectively were positively related to specific arg mge subtypes spearman s r 0 7 p 0 001 suggesting these bacterial taxa were potential hosts of the corresponding args or mges in addition absolute abundance of bacteria was significantly correlated with absolute abundance of args and mges both total and type fig s8 hinting that antibiotic resistome abundance may be in scale with bacterial cell number antibiotics in drinking water sources were diverse fig s9a with total concentrations of sas mls fqs and tcs ranging from 0 10 to 1 454 60 ng l and total concentrations differing among the three sample types kw test p 0 01 fig s9b the average concentrations of the four antibiotic categories were sas 115 76 ng l mls 86 92 ng l fqs 9 45 ng l tcs 0 51 ng l fig 4e correlation analysis indicated that the concentrations of sas mls and ʃantibiotics i e the sum of detected antibiotics were correlated with abundance and diversity of args mges and some specific args and mges types p 0 05 but the correlations between fqs and tcs with args and mges were weak fig 4f suggesting that the selective pressure of antibiotics on organisms carrying args in water was dose dependent 3 6 multiple factors influenced arg profiles interactively redundancy analysis rda was performed to better understand the effects of environmental factors on arg structure fig 5 a in addition rda based variation partitioning analysis vpa further differentiated the contributions of space mges bacterial communities and antibiotics on arg variation fig 5b the bacterial community 14 60 showed greater contribution to args followed by antibiotics 11 60 mges 9 26 and space 5 20 the joint effects of multiple factors explained 5 85 of arg variation leaving 53 49 of arg variation unexplained the sems quantified the indirect and direct effects of space sample type bacterial abundance bacterial diversity antibiotics and mges on arg profiles from a holistic view all variables explained 62 of arg structure variance figs 5c and 69 of arg abundance variation fig s10 importantly although space and sample type did not affect arg profiles directly when accounting for multiple factors they exerted an indirect influence based on changing bacterial communities antibiotics and mges space influenced bacterial abundance λ 0 32 p 0 01 bacterial diversity λ 0 55 p 0 001 and mges λ 0 52 p 0 001 in the sems in line with the geographical distribution patterns of the bacterial communities and mges fig 3 sample type showed a significant influence on bacterial abundance λ 0 42 p 0 01 bacterial diversity λ 0 29 p 0 01 and antibiotic concentration λ 0 36 p 0 01 as confirmed by comparison tests figs s2 s3 and s9b both the vpa and sem results demonstrated that potential causal relationships may occur among args and their multiple influencing factors and these factors shape arg profiles interactively 4 discussion drinking water treatment processes cannot eliminate args from drinking water sources absolutely and thus drinking water supply systems may be a primary dissemination route of args from the environment to host causing potential risks to human health understanding the antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources could provide important information to improve drinking water management strategies given the great variation and multiple drivers of args in drinking water sources systematic data mining of args and related variables is urgent to the best of our knowledge this study presents the most comprehensive investigation on antibiotic resistomes in different drinking water sources with consideration of biotic factors vertical and horizontal transfer potential abiotic factors antibiotic pollution spatial distribution sample types river reservoir and groundwater and relationships with opportunistic pathogens due to the 4 000 km scale variations among samples we collected diverse bacterial community and arg data to be random and not biased 4 1 occurrence and biogeography of antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources antibiotic resistomes were widely found in the tested samples fig 1 and s1 however the abundance of args detected in the current study was lower than that reported in manure han et al 2018 and estuarine sediment zhu et al 2017 using the same ht qpcr platform it is not surprising that args were prevalent in drinking water sources as intrinsic antibiotic resistomes also occur in natural ecosystems such as forest biomes with low human disturbance hu et al 2018 caves isolated from the surface for over four million years pawlowski et al 2016 and 30 000 year old beringian permafrost sediment d costa et al 2011 although it is accepted that args are ancient and widespread each ecosystem contains different bacterial community and thus contains different dominate args on the other hand drinking water sources are disturbed by human activities the influencing factors of antibiotic resistome might be more complex and multiple by large scale sampling we identified a more universal pattern of args in drinking water sources similar to previous research chen et al 2018 liu et al 2018 our study revealed that multidrug aminoglycoside and betalactamase resistance genes were dominant in drinking water sources with multidrug resistance genes also dominant in treated drinking water ma et al 2019 despite the great diversity in arg composition a common resistome was identified in the drinking water samples fig 1c s4 we found 101 and 28 args were shared among 50 and 80 of all samples respectively fig 1c s4 indicating dominant and stable args shared by drinking water sources spanning the 31 cities over 4 000 km across china notably aminoglycoside resistance gene aada multidrug resistance gene qaceδ1 and transposase gene tnpa were found in all samples fig s4 the aada and qaceδ genes are known components of integron gene cassettes gillings 2014 partridge et al 2009 thus hinting the potential of horizontal gene transfer during arg dissemination in natural waters transposon is a kind of common mobile element in bacteria aziz et al 2010 transposon could carry diverse args including tet a tet b tet e and tet 31 shi et al 2020 and mediate efficient dissemination of antibiotic resistance among bacterial communities partridge 2011 the widespread tnpa genes in drinking water sources could accelerate the dissemination of args through horizontal gene transfer in addition considerable arg diversity and abundance was found in the drinking water sources suggesting that different risk levels of antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources require different treatment strategies to improve drinking water biosafety biogeographical distribution is a common phenomenon in natural ecosystems martiny et al 2006 and engineered systems wu et al 2019 the distance decay relationship i e decrease in similarity with increasing geographical distance can be used to confirm biogeographical patterns hanson et al 2012 dispersal limitation of microbe is the reason of distance decay relationship and has been considered as a basic rule of bacterial community assembly martiny et al 2006 the spatial distribution of args has been studied in sediments along the yangtze estuary china guo et al 2018 and in lakes in eastern china liu et al 2018 our study further verified this in drinking water sources at the national scale there might be several reasons behind this phenomenon firstly the hosts of args i e the bacterial community showed clear geographical patterns fig 3a and d secondly antibiotic concentrations also showed geographical patterns spearman s correlation between antibiotic concentration and latitude r 0 331 p 0 015 which might be correlated with human activity density in different areas in china zhang et al 2015 thirdly rapid spatial turnover of the integron gene was found which could be a contributor of arg biogeographical distribution ghaly et al 2019 in addition the significance of distance decay relationship of args and mges was weaker than that of bacterial community indicating the contributions of geographical location to the arg variation mge variation were weaker than bacterial community variation args and mges might be shaped by more complex environmental variables than bacterial community 4 2 potential pathogenic hosts of args opportunistic pathogens in bulk water wang et al 2012 biofilms gomez smith et al 2015 cooling towers pereira et al 2017 and water storage tanks li et al 2018 have been profiled and qpcr protocols targeting them are well established wang et al 2017 drinking water sources are important origins of opportunistic pathogens in tap water opportunistic pathogens in drinking water sources such as mycobacterium do not disappear after water treatment and can even increase after disinfection dias et al 2020 hull et al 2017 arg carrying pathogens are among the most important risk factors to drinking water safety wang et al 2017 and thus the occurrence and co occurrence of args with opportunistic pathogens were explored in the present study we observed the prevalence of five opportunistic pathogens in drinking water sources based on network analysis the abundances of escherichia coli mycobacterium spp clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus group were significantly correlated with args with 19 args and one mge found to be positively correlated with clostridium perfringens previous research has reported resistance rates of clostridium perfringens isolated from diarrheal neonatal piglets for erythromycin and lincomycin of over 50 with 82 of resistant isolates resistant to at least two antibiotics ngamwongsatit et al 2016 mycobacterium gordonae has also been detected as an arg carrying pathogen in drinking water ma et al 2019 our results suggested that the four opportunistic pathogens might act as hosts of args fig 2 highlighting the importance of considering multidrug resistance in opportunistic bacterial pathogens in drinking water sources it should be noted that our results on the co occurrence of args and opportunistic pathogens relied on correlation methods and additional molecular detection of arg host pathogens needs to be done in the future although it has been reported that aeromonas hydrophila acquired resistance to oxytetracycline hatha et al 2005 and carried tetracycline efflux protein gene tet e shi et al 2020 it was not found as potential host of args in the present study the limitation of correlation analysis the limited amount of tested args and low selective pressure of tetracycline might explain this phenomenon and future studies are needed 4 3 integrated effects of multiple factors on antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources from a holistic perspective this study revealed the integrated influences of diverse variables on the antibiotic resistomes of drinking water sources which were multiple and interactive these results reflected actual environmental processes as much as possible and suggested the need for compositive monitoring systems for drinking water sources the close relationships among bacterial communities args and mges were revealed by vpa and sem analyses as reported in previous study forsberg et al 2014 from the sem results the concentration of antibiotics did not exert a significant influence on bacterial abundance and diversity λ 0 14 p 0 05 and λ 0 03 p 0 05 respectively however it still showed potential selective pressure on args λ 0 21 p 0 05 and mges λ 0 46 p 0 001 fig 5c similar trends have also been reported in river reservoir systems with anthropogenic activities chen et al 2018 in the pearl river in southern china chen et al 2015 and in sediment samples along the chinese coastline zhu et al 2017 here antibiotic concentrations followed the trend sas 115 76 ng l mls 86 92 ng l fqs 9 45 ng l tcs 0 51 ng l fig 4e and only two antibiotic groups with higher concentrations i e sas and mls showed close correlation with args fig 4e and f waterbodies act as the sink of pollution from human activities and the relative high concentration of sas 115 76 ng l in drinking water sources might be explained by the wide use of sas in clinical and animal environment zhang et al 2015 compared to antibiotic production wastewater bengtsson palme et al 2019 the concentrations of each antibiotic in the current study were very low fig s9 however the correlation between args and antibiotics was still significant and dose dependent the possible reasons were firstly the complex arg co selection features of diverse antibiotics which could be also called as the joint selective pressure of diverse antibiotics may exist kovacevic et al 2013 secondly antibiotic concentrations may reflect the human activity density and anthropogenic factors which could promote the widespread dissemination of args zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2017 the vpa results implied that the joint effects of multiple factors contributed to arg variation with the sem results disentangling the causal relationships among the multiple variables to a certain extent fig 5 space and sample type of drinking water sources showed indirect effects through bacterial communities antibiotics and mges on args concretely the differences in bacteria and antibiotics among sample type were the main reason for their influence on antibiotic resistome and the shift in bacterial abundance diversity and mges along the geographical gradient was the main reason for the spatial variable structuring of the antibiotic resistome fig 5c in brief overall variation of the antibiotic resistome was the result of interactions among natural and anthropogenic factors 4 4 implications for drinking water source management on controlling args selection and protection of drinking water sources is a key issue in drinking water safety our results showed that the bacterial community was a major driver of the antibiotic resistome arg abundance was associated with abundance of several opportunistic pathogens and antibiotics were linked to antibiotic resistome trends fig 5b therefore protecting drinking water sources from antibiotic and biological contamination by strict policies may be practical actions toward future drinking water source management livestock and poultry breeding wastewater awad et al 2014 clinical wastewater hocquet et al 2016 and antibiotic production wastewater li et al 2010 are priority targets although limited groundwater samples were studied here our research showed that drinking water from groundwater sources contained lower antibiotic concentrations bacterial biomass and arg abundance and diversity suggesting that groundwater may be a safer and healthier drinking water source in the future more groundwater samples need to be collected at large scale to obtain more understanding on microbiome and args in groundwater opportunistic pathogens especially arg host pathogens may be more important monitoring objectives than args themselves we found that args co occurred with four opportunistic pathogens and qpcr and high throughput sequencing protocols could be used for daily monitoring and risk assessment of drinking water sources in the future because args can survive treatment such monitoring and assessment are also essential for tap water in addition as natural conditions also affected bacterial biomass and arg abundance the background values of the antibiotic resistomes may be a function of the climatic region and waterbody type assessment and optimization of techniques for antibiotic and arg removal are essential disinfection can degrade and deactivate args especially extracellular args he et al 2019 and integrated pre coagulation and microfiltration can effectively reduce args li et al 2019 because of the great diversity in antibiotic contamination in drinking water sources stringent purification strategies in drinking water treatment plants should be considered monitoring of drinking water sources could help us assess the potential health risks of args and pathogens and drinking water sources with high risk of biological pollution need stricter disinfection or membrane treatment in addition to conventional water treatment processes 5 conclusions this study performed a comprehensive survey of the antibiotic resistomes in drinking water sources at a large geographical scale drinking water sources were found to be reservoirs of args which may be hosted by some opportunistic bacterial pathogens based on large scale sampling our results indicated that the determinants of arg patterns were multiple and interactive bacterial communities antibiotic concentrations and mges were directly associated with args and these direct factors were restricted by geographical location and sample type these findings extend our knowledge regarding the occurrence and distribution of args in drinking water sources and have implications for the optimization of water source protection and drinking water treatment to mitigate the dissemination of environmental args to hosts declaration of competing interest the authors

results from this study showed that the use of paa with lp uv at reasonable concentrations 1 5 mg l and fluence 20 mj cm2 can significantly reduce the paa use and meet wastewater disinfection goals

disinfection doses and fluence 2 materials and methods fig 1 illustrates a flowchart of experimental design used in this study 2 1 experimental procedure overview disinfection experiments were carried out on secondary ww effluent before disinfection collected from a conventional activated sludge treatment plant in ontario canada over the course of the study 11 batches of secondary wastewater effluent before disinfection were collected before use the ww effluent was decontaminated with medium pressure uv mp uv polychromatic irradiation 200 300 nm at 3000 mj cm2 using a custom built collimating beam apparatus to eliminate microbial contamination in the recovery growth media used for efficacy testing this test matrix preparation technique was adopted after experimentation and comparison with autoclave sterilization of wastewater and observing the limitations of autoclaved wastewater particularly for paa disinfection details are presented in section 3 1 the mp uv decontaminated secondary ww matrix was spiked with either e coli or cvb3 in 150 ml glass dishes kept at 20 2 c in the dark and continually stirred throughout each experiment to maintain homogeneity the target challenge concentration for e coli was 5 log10 cfu 100 ml and 6 log10 tcid50 100 ml for cvb3 peracetic acid was pipetted directly into the reaction dishes containing ww and the challenge microorganism at the appropriate concentration paa measurements were taken for each experiment at the beginning and end of the contact time to record dosage and estimate the overall demand of the spiked ww sample matrix before neutralization three experiments for each disinfection test were done for both e coli and cvb3 with three replicates e coli and cvb3 were recovered and enumerated on trypticase soy agar tsa and mug agar plates using the membrane filtration technique and tcid50 method with bgm cells respectively the mug plates were used as a differential medium to distinguish the e coli from the rest of the wastewater bacteria in the initial range finding experiments the fluence used for all efficacy experiments was 20 mj cm2 and achieved using a collimated beam uv apparatus wastewater quality parameters were measured for the untreated and mp uv decontaminated ww matrix for each paa formulation at its working concentration table 1 2 2 peracetic acid formulations both paa formulations tested were stabilized equilibrium mixtures the first containing 15 peracetic acid 22 hydrogen peroxide 16 acetic acid and the second containing 22 peracetic acid 4 5 hydrogen peroxide 51 6 acetic acid the formulations were individually tested at 1 5 and 3 mg l concentrations measured before and after the contact time 2 3 measurement of peracetic acid the paa concentration was measured using the hach dpd total chlorine method on the hach dr2800 program 88 the reactions were read three times and mean concentrations reported although this method is designed for total chlorine hach application note l2214 describes the procedure for paa determinations in the range of 0 1 10 mg l the total chlorine concentration values generated by the dr2800 were multiplied by a factor of 1 07 to determine the paa concentration mg l paa 1 07 mg l total chlorine the paa concentration was measured after a 2 min mix at 90 rpm on the magnetic stirrer as well as at the end of the exposure time 2 4 lp uv the fluence used in all efficacy experiments was 20 mj cm2 using a custom built collimating beam apparatus the fluence was calculated by measuring uv absorbance of the spiked ww matrix at 254 nm with a cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer and uv light intensity with an international light nis traceable radiometer photometer model il 1399a following the protocol reported in bolton and linden 2003 2 5 preparation of escherichia coli culture e coli atcc 19853 was grown in 10 ml autoclave sterilized trypticase soy broth tsb by inoculating 100 μl of a thawed 80 c glycerol tsb oxoid cm129 frozen stock culture and incubated for 20 h at 36 1 c the culture was washed twice by centrifugation for 5 min at 8000 g with phosphate buffered saline pbs and stored at 4 c between experiment replicates performed on that day 2 6 enumeration of e coli membrane filtration was carried out according to method 9222 in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2017 tsa and mug agar were prepared and poured into petri dishes according to manufacturer instructions aliquots of the e coli spiked ww were vacuum filtered through a 47 mm 0 2 μm supor hydrophilic polyethersulfone membrane filter pall corporation using a sterile millipore filtration unit the membrane filter was then placed on the tsa petri plate incubated for 24 h at 36 1 c and colony forming units cfu assessed at 24 h incubation and each day up to 5 days the lp uv exposure experiments had 101 ml total volume 1 ml for baseline determination and 100 ml filtered for efficacy evaluation the paa disinfection experiments had 121 ml total volume 2 10 ml paa measurements 1 ml for baseline determination and 100 ml filtered for efficacy evaluation 2 7 preparation of coxsackievirus b3 coxsackievirus b3 atcc vr

streptomycin and 25 ng ml amphotericin b 2 mm l glutamine g7513 and 10 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum f1051 100 μl of a thawed 10 dmso emem frozen stock of cvb3 was inoculated into t 75 tissue culture flasks with 2 3 day old 95 100 confluent bgm cell monolayers and incubated at 37 c in 5 co2 for 72 h the virus laden supernatant was prepared by centrifugation after a series of 3 freeze thaw cycles 80 c for 30 min aliquoted and stored at 80 c until use 2 8 enumeration of coxsackievirus b3 the tcid50 tissue culture infectious dose 50 assay for enumeration of the cvb3 was carried out according to method 9510a g in standard methods apha 2017 and usepa 2003 bgm cells were grown as a monolayer in pre treated vented t 75 polycarbonate flasks in 5 co2 at 37 c for 2 3 days before being split and 48 well tissue culture plates prepared the 48 well plates were incubated in the aforementioned capneic conditions until monolayers were 95 100 confluent the plates at this point were ready for infection with 100 μl diluted virus stock cultures and or spiked wastewater samples and incubated for 14 days the infectious dose was deduced by assessing the cytopathic effect cpe daily by microscopy using a leica inverted phase contrast microscope with an absolute magnification of 100 for the duration of the incubation tcid50 was calculated using the spearman karber algorithm 2 9 sample matrix preparation four types of secondary effluent samples were used in this study as needed all samples were mixed thoroughly and brought to room temperature before use 1 untreated wastewater secondary effluent was used as is without any processing or treatment for characterization of wastewater and disinfection efficacy experiments with paa for e coli the untreated ww effluent was used on the day of collection 2 decontamination of the wastewater is required for the efficacy testing of cvb3 and this was initially done with autoclaving autoclaved wastewater aww was used for disinfection efficacy experiments with paa for e coli and cvb3 3 autoclaving resulted in a substantial increase in wastewater ph which was suspected to reduce the biocidal properties of paa as a result ph adjusted aww was used for disinfection efficacy experiments with paa for e coli and cvb3 4 due to significant changes in ww characteristics due to autoclaving mp uv was employed for decontamination of wastewater and was used for disinfection efficacy experiments with paa lp uv and paa lp uv for inactivation of e coli and cvb3 one litre of secondary ww effluent was prepared fresh for each set of experiments using an mp collimated beam apparatus with a fluence of 3000 mj cm2 the temperature during the mp uv treatment was monitored and increased no higher than a few degrees celsius above the ambient room temperature secondary ww effluent was prepared mp uv irradiated on the day of collection and stored at 4 c for no more than 5 days before use 2 10 efficacy experiments with paa paa lp uv and lp uv alone in each paa and paa lp uv experiment 121 ml of ww effluent was spiked with either 1 μl of a 20 h culture of e coli at a concentration of 5 log10 cfu 100 ml or 10 μl of a thawed frozen stock of cvb3 at a concentration of 6 log10 tcid50 100 ml and exposed to paa alone at either 1 5 or 3 mg l or paa and lp uv at 20 mj cm2 concomitantly for an exposure time of 15 min the lp uv light source was turned off after the calculated fluence was achieved the concentrations used in this study are representative of e coli and enteroviruses found in secondary ww effluent before disinfection the paa was diluted by adding it directly into the ww matrix and not beforehand separately the spiked ww was stirred continuously on a magnetic stir plate at 90 rpm to maintain homogeneity after the exposure time 0 1 n sodium thiosulfate was added and allowed to mix for 2 min before enumeration each 121 ml reaction dish volume was divided into 3 parts 1 ml was transferred to a 2 ml cryovial sarstedt before the addition of the paa and after a stir of 2 min which was used to determine the baseline cfu tcid50 two samples of 10 ml volumes were used for paa concentration measurements at 2 and 15 min to determine the demand from the matrix microbial load and the remaining 100 ml was used for efficacy evaluation in each lp uv experiment 101 ml of ww effluent was spiked with either 1 μl of a 20 h culture of e coli or 10 μl of a thawed frozen stock of cvb3 and irradiated at a fluence of 20 mj cm2 the spiked ww was stirred continuously on a magnetic stir plate at 90 rpm to maintain homogeneity each 101 ml reaction dish volume was divided into 2 parts 1 ml was transferred to a 2 ml cryovial sarstedt before the lp uv irradiation and taken after a stir of 2 min which was used to determine the baseline cfu tcid50 and the remaining 100 ml was used for efficacy evaluation 2 11 neutralization confirmation for both e coli and cvb3 paa was added to the ww matrix and allowed to mix for 15 min on a stir plate at 90 rpm then neutralized with 0 1 n sodium thiosulfate the paa was measured at t 0 and t 15 min and after neutralization to confirm neutralization of the paa had occurred immediately after neutralization either 102 cfu 100 ml or 102 tcid50 ml virus particles were added allowed to mix for 15 min then enumerated cell culture cytotoxicity controls were also done by adding the neutralized sample matrix directly onto the cells and observing cpe throughout the 14 day incubation the neutralization confirmation was done for the highest dose of the 22 paa at 3 mg l the neutralizer is regarded as effective if the number of cfu recovered on the test plates is between 50 and 120 as compared to the pbs control plate usepa 2017 and a tcid50 value no more than 0 5 log10 lower than the ebss control is regarded as acceptable astm 1998 2 12 experiment controls for each e coli efficacy experiment an uninoculated negative control petri plate and pbs dilution fluid membrane filter rinse control which consisted of 30 ml pbs solution filtered through the 0 2 μm membrane filter were done and incubated for 5 days all control plates should exhibit no microbial contamination each cvb3 efficacy experiment included uninoculated earl s balanced saline solution ebss and cvb3 inoculated monolayers with 5 log10 pfu ml representing negative and positive cytopathic effect cpe controls respectively the negative controls were monitored throughout the 14 day incubation time and compared to negative test wells of uninfected cells the ebss controls should maintain an intact monolayer for neutralization of paa with sodium thiosulfate cell culture cytotoxicity controls were carried out by adding the neutralized sample after the addition of sodium thiosulfate directly onto the cells and observing cpe throughout the 14 day incubation 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample matrices and ph for the cvb3 efficacy testing the use of a decontaminated ww matrix was essential as it was imperative to eliminate all viable microorganisms that may contaminate the cell culture assay medium as the quantification of virus particles is based on cytopathic effects cpe and it would make it difficult to distinguish bacterial viral mycoplasma cpe from that of the virus tested in disinfection studies it is common to use an autoclave to achieve decontamination of ww which was tried first in this study however a significant increase in ph was noted after the ww samples were autoclaved the initial ph of the wastewater samples was measured immediately after collection when received at the lab and ranged from 7 5 to 7 71 autoclaved ww samples tested ranged in ph from 8 67 to 9 2 after the preliminary experiments with e coli and cvb3 using the autoclaved ww it was deduced that the ph increase due to autoclaving reduced the efficacy of paa against the target microorganisms as peracetic acid loses its effectiveness when ph is higher than 8 2 kitis 2004 successive experiments confirmed that the high ph reduced disinfection efficacy and was restored when the ph was adjusted to natural levels in wastewater the ph had a great impact on the level of activity of the paa on the spiked e coli tests autoclaved wastewater aww without ph adjustment resulted in an average of 0 01 log10 cfu 100 ml reduction whereas untreated ww and ph adjusted 7 6 0 1 aww matrix experiments showed cfu reductions close to 3 and 6 log10 100 ml respectively although the paa activity against cvb3 was not significant the efficacy did increase with the use of the mp uv decontaminated ww matrix where the autoclaved wastewater aww showed a 0 11 log10 tcid50 100 ml reduction and 0 12 0 29 log10 tcid50 100 ml reduction with the mp uv ww matrix in mp uv treated wastewater ph increased by an average of 0 11 from 7 55 to 7 66 which is within the effective range of paa activity of 5 5 8 2 kitis 2004 in addition the mp uv decontaminated ww showed no toxic effects to the bgm cells 3 2 changes in wastewater parameters mp uv treatment and paa at 1 5 and 3 mg l for both products did not significantly change the wastewater parameters the parameter of most concern is cbod5 as a significant increase in the organic load from the acetic acid content in paa could put levels beyond regulatory limits for secondary effluent discharge into receiving waters as seen in table 1 the cbod5 for both paa concentrations did not exceed the typical regulatory compliance limit of 25 mg l similar results were seen in previous studies luukkonen et al 2014 3 3 peracetic acid residual concentrations for each test the residual concentration of paa was measured 2 min after introduction into the ww matrix as well as at the end of the contact time three replicate readings were done for each of the three tests per condition the overall demand was low over the 15 min contact time showing average mean reductions of 0 28 0 07 18 and 0 42 0 19 13 for 1 5 and 3 mg l respectively fig 2 these results confirmed that there was adequate residual paa in samples to achieve disinfection during the experiments and paa loss due to wastewater demand was minimal the demand was also assessed for the untreated wastewater matrix for comparison and showed no significant difference in demand compared to the mp uv ww matrix 3 4 neutralization confirmation immediate neutralization of the paa formulations is necessary to ensure accurate detection of the challenge microorganisms over the sampling period neutralization confirmation experiments for both e coli and cvb3 showed effective neutralization as seen in section 3 4 1 and 3 4 2 3 4 1 e coli neutralization confirmation was achieved showing a 94 6 cfu recovery compared to the pbs control table 2 this indicates that sodium thiosulfate was able to completely quench the antimicrobial activity of the paa 3 4 2 coxsackievirus b3 neutralization confirmation was done on the mp uv decontaminated ww sample matrix and showed effective neutralization of the active agents with mean infectivity of 86 7 no significant cytotoxicity was observed when cells were exposed to undiluted sample matrices observations showed a slight increase in vacuolization within the first 24 h but the cells recovered their normal appearance at 48 h and throughout the 12 remaining days of incubation the ebss control represents 100 infection and the mp uv ww matrix was compared to it table 3 3 5 efficacy tests the efficacy of both the 15 and 22 paa formulations were tested at 1 5 and 3 mg l paa against individually spiked e coli and cvb3 in the mp uv ww sample matrix as well as preliminary range finding and method development experiments in untreated aww and ph adjusted aww matrices at 3 mg l with just the 22 paa formulation the aww log10 reductions of the e coli and cvb3 were very low at 0 01 and 0 13 from 5 5 to 6 67 respectively the ph adjusted aww matrix gave a complete reduction of the spiked e coli from 5 67 log10 cfu 100 ml and a 0 25 log10 tcid50 100 ml reduction in cvb3 the untreated ww matrix showed a log10 cfu 100 ml reduction in e coli viability of 2 83 from 5 5 it appeared that the ph adjusted autoclaved wastewater significantly increased the effectiveness of the paa compared to the untreated ww sample matrix but this was likely due to overcrowding of the mug recovery medium with other bacteria present in wastewater other factors which may influence efficacy data include selective differential chemical components in the recovery medium mug agar in this case suppressing the growth of e coli competition for available nutrients in the recovery media and increased population density on the recovery media causing bacterial cells to slow or cease replication swift et al 1996 mckillip 2001 fouladkhah et al 2013 as a result the ph adjusted ww test matrix was replaced with mp uv decontaminated wastewater which allowed for the use of a general isolation medium tsa free of selective and differential components decreased population density in turn and decreased nutrient competition allowing for viable cells to grow uninhibited the mp uv decontaminated wastewater matrix experiments with e coli showed complete log10 cfu reductions for both products at 3 mg l paa and partial reductions of 0 15 and 1 92 for the 15 and 22 at 1 5 mg l paa respectively fig 3 the 2 log10 higher reduction in cfu may be due to the significantly higher level of acetic acid in the 22 formulation compared to the 15 paa formulation lp uv and lp uv 1 5 mg l paa for both products showed complete log10 cfu reductions for e coli the cvb3 showed 0 3 log10 reductions in tcid50 100 ml for both 1 5 and 3 mg l paa however the lp uv experiments with both formulations and lp uv alone completely inhibited the viral infectivity of cvb3 within the detection limit fig 4 a susceptibility curve using higher doses of paa was also done demonstrating a high resistance of cvb3 to paa up to 50 mg l fig 5 the log10 reductions achieved in this study are in alignment with those found in published literature for both e coli and cvb3 when treated with paa and uv alone caretti and lubello 2003 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005b 2005a rossi et al 2007 overall the results of this study show that paa alone would not be effective even at very high doses of 10 15 and 50 mg l in disinfecting cvb3 this indicates paa would not be an effective disinfectant for enteroviruses if used alone at 3 mg l paa could achieve complete disinfection of e coli but at 1 5 mg l paa could achieve less than 2 log10 reduction in e coli which is not sufficient for wastewater disinfection interestingly at 1 5 mg l paa there was a significant inactivation difference 1 8 log10 between the two formulations of the paa 15 peracetic acid 22 hydrogen peroxide 16 acetic acid and 22 peracetic acid 4 5 hydrogen peroxide 51 6 acetic acid against e coli indicating that the composition of the paa solution and the percentages of peracetic acid hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid play a role in determining the disinfection efficacy paa solutions with different peracetic acid hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid percentages could be more effective on bacteria viruses or protozoa as well as on different strains this should be investigated further in future studies and paa formulations can potentially be optimized for specific applications of individual or synergistic use of paa with other disinfectants concurrent use of 1 5 mg l of paa with 20 mj cm2 lp uv inactivated e coli by over 5 log10 and 3 mg l of paa with 20 mj cm2 lp uv completely inhibited the viral infectivity of cvb3 at 6 log10 however 20 mj cm2 lp uv alone was able to achieve similar log10 reductions for both e coli and cvb3 and no significant synergistic effect of paa and lp uv was observed for synergistic effect to occur disinfection efficacy resulting from the concurrent use of paa and lp uv should be higher than the sum of their individual efficacies de souza et al 2015 compared the individual and sequential use of paa and uv on e coli and coliphages and reported very little synergistic effect with paa and uv and only for a few of the samples weng et al 2018 also reported little synergistic effect on ms2 and murine norovirus with combined use of paa and uv in wastewater at paa doses of 0 5 2 mg l significant synergistic effect was observed in pbs under similar conditions in the same study the presence of radical scavengers due to organics and other constituents in wastewater quickly consumes the hydroxyl radical and active oxygen formed from the photolysis of paa and may prevent significant synergistic effect from occuring at typical paa doses employed at treatment plants however the concurrent use of paa and uv still offers some advantages such as reducing the paa use and thus residual paa which can increase cbod5 in treated effluent meeting disinfection goals for a wide range of microorganisms bacteria viruses and protozoa due to the individual effects of paa and uv providing some advanced oxidation benefits and reduction in emerging and other contaminants of concern and improving the overall effluent quality 4 conclusions the two formulations of paa 15 and 22 peracetic acid were not effective at significantly reducing the level of cvb3 infectivity at 1 5 and 3 mg l in wastewater the concurrent use of both formulations of 3 mg l paa with 20 mj cm2 lp uv as well as 20 mj cm2 lp uv alone inactivated 4 log10 cvb3 complete inactivation of e coli was achieved for both paa formulations at 3 mg l at 1 5 mg l paa log10 reductions of 0 15 and 1 92 were obtained for the 15 and 22 formulations respectively concurrent use of 1 5 mg l of paa with 20 mj cm2 lp uv and 20 mj cm2 lp uv alone inactivated e coli by over 5 log10 the concurrent use of paa 1 5 and 3 mg l with lp uv 20 mj cm2 did not lead to significant synergy in disinfection of e coli and cvb3 in wastewater

the first study showing the efficacy of paa and lp uv as an advanced oxidation process against the clinically significant enterovirus surrogate cvb3 under wastewater treatment plant wwtp operating disinfection doses and fluence 2 materials and methods fig 1 illustrates a flowchart of experimental design used in this study 2 1 experimental procedure overview disinfection experiments were carried out on secondary ww effluent before disinfection collected from a conventional activated sludge treatment plant in ontario canada over the course of the study 11 batches of secondary wastewater effluent before disinfection were collected before use the ww effluent was decontaminated with medium pressure uv mp uv polychromatic irradiation 200 300 nm at 3000 mj cm2 using a custom built collimating beam apparatus to eliminate microbial contamination in the recovery growth media used for efficacy testing this test matrix preparation technique was adopted after experimentation and comparison with autoclave sterilization of wastewater and observing the limitations of autoclaved wastewater particularly for paa disinfection details are presented in section 3 1 the mp uv decontaminated secondary ww matrix was spiked with either e coli or cvb3 in 150 ml glass dishes kept at 20 2 c in the dark and continually stirred throughout each experiment to maintain homogeneity the target challenge concentration for e coli was 5 log10 cfu 100 ml and 6 log10 tcid50 100 ml for cvb3 peracetic acid was pipetted directly into the reaction dishes containing ww and the challenge microorganism at the appropriate concentration paa measurements were taken for each experiment at the beginning and end of the contact time to record dosage and estimate the overall demand of the spiked ww sample matrix before neutralization three experiments for each disinfection test were done for both e coli and cvb3 with three replicates e coli and cvb3 were recovered and enumerated on trypticase soy agar tsa and mug agar plates using the membrane filtration technique and tcid50 method with bgm cells respectively the mug plates were used as a differential medium to distinguish the e coli from the rest of the wastewater bacteria in the initial range finding experiments the fluence used for all efficacy experiments was 20 mj cm2 and achieved using a collimated beam uv apparatus wastewater quality parameters were measured for the untreated and mp uv decontaminated ww matrix for each paa formulation at its working concentration table 1 2 2 peracetic acid formulations both paa formulations tested were stabilized equilibrium mixtures the first containing 15 peracetic acid 22 hydrogen peroxide 16 acetic acid and the second containing 22 peracetic acid 4 5 hydrogen peroxide 51 6 acetic acid the formulations were individually tested at 1 5 and 3 mg l concentrations measured before and after the contact time 2 3 measurement of peracetic acid the paa concentration was measured using the hach dpd total chlorine method on the hach dr2800 program 88 the reactions were read three times and mean concentrations reported although this method is designed for total chlorine hach application note l2214 describes the procedure for paa determinations in the range of 0 1 10 mg l the total chlorine concentration values generated by the dr2800 were multiplied by a factor of 1 07 to determine the paa concentration mg l paa 1 07 mg l total chlorine the paa concentration was measured after a 2 min mix at 90 rpm on the magnetic stirrer as well as at the end of the exposure time 2 4 lp uv the fluence used in all efficacy experiments was 20 mj cm2 using a custom built collimating beam apparatus the fluence was calculated by measuring uv absorbance of the spiked ww matrix at 254 nm with a cary 100 uv vis spectrophotometer and uv light intensity with an international light nis traceable radiometer photometer model il 1399a following the protocol reported in bolton and linden 2003 2 5 preparation of escherichia coli culture e coli atcc 19853 was grown in 10 ml autoclave sterilized trypticase soy broth tsb by inoculating 100 μl of a thawed 80 c glycerol tsb oxoid cm129 frozen stock culture and incubated for 20 h at 36 1 c the culture was washed twice by centrifugation for 5 min at 8000 g with phosphate buffered saline pbs and stored at 4 c between experiment replicates performed on that day 2 6 enumeration of e coli membrane filtration was carried out according to method 9222 in standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater apha 2017 tsa and mug agar were prepared and poured into petri dishes according to manufacturer instructions aliquots of the e coli spiked ww were vacuum filtered through a 47 mm 0 2 μm supor hydrophilic polyethersulfone membrane filter pall corporation using a sterile millipore filtration unit the membrane filter was then placed on the tsa petri plate incubated for 24 h at 36 1 c and colony forming units cfu assessed at 24 h incubation and each day up to 5 days the lp uv exposure experiments had 101 ml total volume 1 ml for baseline determination and 100 ml filtered for efficacy evaluation the paa disinfection experiments had 121 ml total volume 2 10 ml paa measurements 1 ml for baseline determination and 100 ml filtered for efficacy evaluation 2 7 preparation of coxsackievirus b3 coxsackievirus b3 atcc vr 688 was propagated in buffalo green monkey kidney bgm cells grown in eagle s minimum essential medium emem sigma m2279 supplemented with 1 non essential amino acids m7145 10 u penicillin 10 μg ml streptomycin and 25 ng ml amphotericin b 2 mm l glutamine g7513 and 10 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum f1051 100 μl of a thawed 10 dmso emem frozen stock of cvb3 was inoculated into t 75 tissue culture flasks with 2 3 day old 95 100 confluent bgm cell monolayers and incubated at 37 c in 5 co2 for 72 h the virus laden supernatant was prepared by centrifugation after a series of 3 freeze thaw cycles 80 c for 30 min aliquoted and stored at 80 c until use 2 8 enumeration of coxsackievirus b3 the tcid50 tissue culture infectious dose 50 assay for enumeration of the cvb3 was carried out according to method 9510a g in standard methods apha 2017 and usepa 2003 bgm cells were grown as a monolayer in pre treated vented t 75 polycarbonate flasks in 5 co2 at 37 c for 2 3 days before being split and 48 well tissue culture plates prepared the 48 well plates were incubated in the aforementioned capneic conditions until monolayers were 95 100 confluent the plates at this point were ready for infection with 100 μl diluted virus stock cultures and or spiked wastewater samples and incubated for 14 days the infectious dose was deduced by assessing the cytopathic effect cpe daily by microscopy using a leica inverted phase contrast microscope with an absolute magnification of 100 for the duration of the incubation tcid50 was calculated using the spearman karber algorithm 2 9 sample matrix preparation four types of secondary effluent samples were used in this study as needed all samples were mixed thoroughly and brought to room temperature before use 1 untreated wastewater secondary effluent was used as is without any processing or treatment for characterization of wastewater and disinfection efficacy experiments with paa for e coli the untreated ww effluent was used on the day of collection 2 decontamination of the wastewater is required for the efficacy testing of cvb3 and this was initially done with autoclaving autoclaved wastewater aww was used for disinfection efficacy experiments with paa for e coli and cvb3 3 autoclaving resulted in a substantial increase in wastewater ph which was suspected to reduce the biocidal properties of paa as a result ph adjusted aww was used for disinfection efficacy experiments with paa for e coli and cvb3 4 due to significant changes in ww characteristics due to autoclaving mp uv was employed for decontamination of wastewater and was used for disinfection efficacy experiments with paa lp uv and paa lp uv for inactivation of e coli and cvb3 one litre of secondary ww effluent was prepared fresh for each set of experiments using an mp collimated beam apparatus with a fluence of 3000 mj cm2 the temperature during the mp uv treatment was monitored and increased no higher than a few degrees celsius above the ambient room temperature secondary ww effluent was prepared mp uv irradiated on the day of collection and stored at 4 c for no more than 5 days before use 2 10 efficacy experiments with paa paa lp uv and lp uv alone in each paa and paa lp uv experiment 121 ml of ww effluent was spiked with either 1 μl of a 20 h culture of e coli at a concentration of 5 log10 cfu 100 ml or 10 μl of a thawed frozen stock of cvb3 at a concentration of 6 log10 tcid50 100 ml and exposed to paa alone at either 1 5 or 3 mg l or paa and lp uv at 20 mj cm2 concomitantly for an exposure time of 15 min the lp uv light source was turned off after the calculated fluence was achieved the concentrations used in this study are representative of e coli and enteroviruses found in secondary ww effluent before disinfection the paa was diluted by adding it directly into the ww matrix and not beforehand separately the spiked ww was stirred continuously on a magnetic stir plate at 90 rpm to maintain homogeneity after the exposure time 0 1 n sodium thiosulfate was added and allowed to mix for 2 min before enumeration each 121 ml reaction dish volume was divided into 3 parts 1 ml was transferred to a 2 ml cryovial sarstedt before the addition of the paa and after a stir of 2 min which was used to determine the baseline cfu tcid50 two samples of 10 ml volumes were used for paa concentration measurements at 2 and 15 min to determine the demand from the matrix microbial load and the remaining 100 ml was used for efficacy evaluation in each lp uv experiment 101 ml of ww effluent was spiked with either 1 μl of a 20 h culture of e coli or 10 μl of a thawed frozen stock of cvb3 and irradiated at a fluence of 20 mj cm2 the spiked ww was stirred continuously on a magnetic stir plate at 90 rpm to maintain homogeneity each 101 ml reaction dish volume was divided into 2 parts 1 ml was transferred to a 2 ml cryovial sarstedt before the lp uv irradiation and taken after a stir of 2 min which was used to determine the baseline cfu tcid50 and the remaining 100 ml was used for efficacy evaluation 2 11 neutralization confirmation for both e coli and cvb3 paa was added to the ww matrix and allowed to mix for 15 min on a stir plate at 90 rpm then neutralized with 0 1 n sodium thiosulfate the paa was measured at t 0 and t 15 min and after neutralization to confirm neutralization of the paa had occurred immediately after neutralization either 102 cfu 100 ml or 102 tcid50 ml virus particles were added allowed to mix for 15 min then enumerated cell culture cytotoxicity controls were also done by adding the neutralized sample matrix directly onto the cells and observing cpe throughout the 14 day incubation the neutralization confirmation was done for the highest dose of the 22 paa at 3 mg l the neutralizer is regarded as effective if the number of cfu recovered on the test plates is between 50 and 120 as compared to the pbs control plate usepa 2017 and a tcid50 value no more than 0 5 log10 lower than the ebss control is regarded as acceptable astm 1998 2 12 experiment controls for each e coli efficacy experiment an uninoculated negative control petri plate and pbs dilution fluid membrane filter rinse control which consisted of 30 ml pbs solution filtered through the 0 2 μm membrane filter were done and incubated for 5 days all control plates should exhibit no microbial contamination each cvb3 efficacy experiment included uninoculated earl s balanced saline solution ebss and cvb3 inoculated monolayers with 5 log10 pfu ml representing negative and positive cytopathic effect cpe controls respectively the negative controls were monitored throughout the 14 day incubation time and compared to negative test wells of uninfected cells the ebss controls should maintain an intact monolayer for neutralization of paa with sodium thiosulfate cell culture cytotoxicity controls were carried out by adding the neutralized sample after the addition of sodium thiosulfate directly onto the cells and observing cpe throughout the 14 day incubation 3 results and discussion 3 1 sample matrices and ph for the cvb3 efficacy testing the use of a decontaminated ww matrix was essential as it was imperative to eliminate all viable microorganisms that may contaminate the cell culture assay medium as the quantification of virus particles is based on cytopathic effects cpe and it would make it difficult to distinguish bacterial viral mycoplasma cpe from that of the virus tested in disinfection studies it is common to use an autoclave to achieve decontamination of ww which was tried first in this study however a significant increase in ph was noted after the ww samples were autoclaved the initial ph of the wastewater samples was measured immediately after collection when received at the lab and ranged from 7 5 to 7 71 autoclaved ww samples tested ranged in ph from 8 67 to 9 2 after the preliminary experiments with e coli and cvb3 using the autoclaved ww it was deduced that the ph increase due to autoclaving reduced the efficacy of paa against the target microorganisms as peracetic acid loses its effectiveness when ph is higher than 8 2 kitis 2004 successive experiments confirmed that the high ph reduced disinfection efficacy and was restored when the ph was adjusted to natural levels in wastewater the ph had a great impact on the level of activity of the paa on the spiked e coli tests autoclaved wastewater aww without ph adjustment resulted in an average of 0 01 log10 cfu 100 ml reduction whereas untreated ww and ph adjusted 7 6 0 1 aww matrix experiments showed cfu reductions close to 3 and 6 log10 100 ml respectively although the paa activity against cvb3 was not significant the efficacy did increase with the use of the mp uv decontaminated ww matrix where the autoclaved wastewater aww showed a 0 11 log10 tcid50 100 ml reduction and 0 12 0 29 log10 tcid50 100 ml reduction with the mp uv ww matrix in mp uv treated wastewater ph increased by an average of 0 11 from 7 55 to 7 66 which is within the effective range of paa activity of 5 5 8 2 kitis 2004 in addition the mp uv decontaminated ww showed no toxic effects to the bgm cells 3 2 changes in wastewater parameters mp uv treatment and paa at 1 5 and 3 mg l for both products did not significantly change the wastewater parameters the parameter of most concern is cbod5 as a significant increase in the organic load from the acetic acid content in paa could put levels beyond regulatory limits for secondary effluent discharge into receiving waters as seen in table 1 the cbod5 for both paa concentrations did not exceed the typical regulatory compliance limit of 25 mg l similar results were seen in previous studies luukkonen et al 2014 3 3 peracetic acid residual concentrations for each test the residual concentration of paa was measured 2 min after introduction into the ww matrix as well as at the end of the contact time three replicate readings were done for each of the three tests per condition the overall demand was low over the 15 min contact time showing average mean reductions of 0 28 0 07 18 and 0 42 0 19 13 for 1 5 and 3 mg l respectively fig 2 these results confirmed that there was adequate residual paa in samples to achieve disinfection during the experiments and paa loss due to wastewater demand was minimal the demand was also assessed for the untreated wastewater matrix for comparison and showed no significant difference in demand compared to the mp uv ww matrix 3 4 neutralization confirmation immediate neutralization of the paa formulations is necessary to ensure accurate detection of the challenge microorganisms over the sampling period neutralization confirmation experiments for both e coli and cvb3 showed effective neutralization as seen in section 3 4 1 and 3 4 2 3 4 1 e coli neutralization confirmation was achieved showing a 94 6 cfu recovery compared to the pbs control table 2 this indicates that sodium thiosulfate was able to completely quench the antimicrobial activity of the paa 3 4 2 coxsackievirus b3 neutralization confirmation was done on the mp uv decontaminated ww sample matrix and showed effective neutralization of the active agents with mean infectivity of 86 7 no significant cytotoxicity was observed when cells were exposed to undiluted sample matrices observations showed a slight increase in vacuolization within the first 24 h but the cells recovered their normal appearance at 48 h and throughout the 12 remaining days of incubation the ebss control represents 100 infection and the mp uv ww matrix was compared to it table 3 3 5 efficacy tests the efficacy of both the 15 and 22 paa formulations were tested at 1 5 and 3 mg l paa against individually spiked e coli and cvb3 in the mp uv ww sample matrix as well as preliminary range finding and method development experiments in untreated aww and ph adjusted aww matrices at 3 mg l with just the 22 paa formulation the aww log10 reductions of the e coli and cvb3 were very low at 0 01 and 0 13 from 5 5 to 6 67 respectively the ph adjusted aww matrix gave a complete reduction of the spiked e coli from 5 67 log10 cfu 100 ml and a 0 25 log10 tcid50 100 ml reduction in cvb3 the untreated ww matrix showed a log10 cfu 100 ml reduction in e coli viability of 2 83 from 5 5 it appeared that the ph adjusted autoclaved wastewater significantly increased the effectiveness of the paa compared to the untreated ww sample matrix but this was likely due to overcrowding of the mug recovery medium with other bacteria present in wastewater other factors which may influence efficacy data include selective differential chemical components in the recovery medium mug agar in this case suppressing the growth of e coli competition for available nutrients in the recovery media and increased population density on the recovery media causing bacterial cells to slow or cease replication swift et al 1996 mckillip 2001 fouladkhah et al 2013 as a result the ph adjusted ww test matrix was replaced with mp uv decontaminated wastewater which allowed for the use of a general isolation medium tsa free of selective and differential components decreased population density in turn and decreased nutrient competition allowing for viable cells to grow uninhibited the mp uv decontaminated wastewater matrix experiments with e coli showed complete log10 cfu reductions for both products at 3 mg l paa and partial reductions of 0 15 and 1 92 for the 15 and 22 at 1 5 mg l paa respectively fig 3 the 2 log10 higher reduction in cfu may be due to the significantly higher level of acetic acid in the 22 formulation compared to the 15 paa formulation lp uv and lp uv 1 5 mg l paa for both products showed complete log10 cfu reductions for e coli the cvb3 showed 0 3 log10 reductions in tcid50 100 ml for both 1 5 and 3 mg l paa however the lp uv experiments with both formulations and lp uv alone completely inhibited the viral infectivity of cvb3 within the detection limit fig 4 a susceptibility curve using higher doses of paa was also done demonstrating a high resistance of cvb3 to paa up to 50 mg l fig 5 the log10 reductions achieved in this study are in alignment with those found in published literature for both e coli and cvb3 when treated with paa and uv alone caretti and lubello 2003 koivunen and heinonen tanski 2005b 2005a rossi et al 2007 overall the results of this study show that paa alone would not be effective even at very high doses of 10 15 and 50 mg l in disinfecting cvb3 this indicates paa would not be an effective disinfectant for enteroviruses if used alone at 3 mg l paa could achieve complete disinfection of e coli but at 1 5 mg l paa could achieve less than 2 log10 reduction in e coli which is not sufficient for wastewater disinfection interestingly at 1 5 mg l paa there was a significant inactivation difference 1 8 log10 between the two formulations of the paa 15 peracetic acid 22 hydrogen peroxide 16 acetic acid and 22 peracetic acid 4 5 hydrogen peroxide 51 6 acetic acid against e coli indicating that the composition of the paa solution and the percentages of peracetic acid hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid play a role in determining the disinfection efficacy paa solutions with different peracetic acid hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid percentages could be more effective on bacteria viruses or protozoa as well as on different strains this should be investigated further in future studies and paa formulations can potentially be optimized for specific applications of individual or synergistic use of paa with other disinfectants concurrent use of 1 5 mg l of paa with 20 mj cm2 lp uv inactivated e coli by over 5 log10 and 3 mg l of paa with 20 mj cm2 lp uv completely inhibited the viral infectivity of cvb3 at 6 log10 however 20 mj cm2 lp uv alone was able to achieve similar log10 reductions for both e coli and cvb3 and no significant synergistic effect of paa and lp uv was observed for synergistic effect to occur disinfection efficacy resulting from the concurrent use of paa and lp uv should be higher than the sum of their individual efficacies de souza et al 2015 compared the individual and sequential use of paa and uv on e coli and coliphages and reported very little synergistic effect with paa and uv and only for a few of the samples weng et al 2018 also reported little synergistic effect on ms2 and murine norovirus with combined use of paa and uv in wastewater at paa doses of 0 5 2 mg l significant synergistic effect was observed in pbs under similar conditions in the same study the presence of radical scavengers due to organics and other constituents in wastewater quickly consumes the hydroxyl radical and active oxygen formed from the photolysis of paa and may prevent significant synergistic effect from occuring at typical paa doses employed at treatment plants however the concurrent use of paa and uv still offers some advantages such as reducing the paa use and thus residual paa which can increase cbod5 in treated effluent meeting disinfection goals for a wide range of microorganisms bacteria viruses and protozoa due to the individual effects of paa and uv providing some advanced oxidation benefits and reduction in emerging and other contaminants of concern and improving the overall effluent quality 4 conclusions the two formulations of paa 15 and 22 peracetic acid were not effective at significantly reducing the level of cvb3 infectivity at 1 5 and 3 mg l in wastewater the concurrent use of both formulations of 3 mg l paa with 20 mj cm2 lp uv as well as 20 mj cm2 lp uv alone inactivated 4 log10 cvb3 complete inactivation of e coli was achieved for both paa formulations at 3 mg l at 1 5 mg l paa log10 reductions of 0 15 and 1 92 were obtained for the 15 and 22 formulations respectively concurrent use of 1 5 mg l of paa with 20 mj cm2 lp uv and 20 mj cm2 lp uv alone inactivated e coli by over 5 log10 the concurrent use of paa 1 5 and 3 mg l with lp uv 20 mj cm2 did not lead to significant synergy in disinfection of e coli and cvb3 in wastewater
