9275,nocturnal water uses q n significantly affect global water budgets and diurnal water cycles which are currently suffering from restrictions of soil drought and soil water depletion caused by climate change and worldwide greening recent studies have recognized the vital influence of soil water availability on q n but responses of nocturnal water use strategy to soil moisture variation were not fully understood for example the effect of soil water content θ on the trade offs between two components of q n stem water refilling r e and nocturnal transpiration t n was rarely involved and remained unclear this study analyzed the nocturnal sap flow of typical afforestation species poplar plantation under different soil water conditions in a seasonal arid region of northern china results indicated that higher θ significantly promoted q n through enhancing the stomatal conductance but had less influence on the proportion of nocturnal water use to daily water use q n 7 10 with the decline of soil water conditions significant linear correlations between q n and θ shifted from deep soil layers to the soil surface the influence of meteorological factors on q n depended on soil water condition and the explanation of nocturnal vapor pressure deficit vpd n to q n became weaker with increasing soil moisture negative linear relations between the proportion of stem water refilling to q n r e and θ were shown within treatments but a significantly higher r e was observed under more sufficient soil water these opposite responses of r e to θ reflected the different adaptions of q n to soil water availability on short and long scales this study highlights the crucial role of soil moisture in the nocturnal water use and balance strategy of a seasonal arid poplar plantation our results help better understand the nocturnal transpiration processes in the context of global climate change keywords nocturnal sap flow trade offs soil water content meteorological drivers populus tomentosa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global climate change and worldwide greening have been sustained for decades leading to considerable temperature rise and increase in leaf area of vegetation chen et al 2019 gistemp team 2018 the consistently elevated potential evapotranspiration demand and leaf area can prominently affect global water and energy flux and budget through their effects on the transpiration of plants zeppel et al 2014 as daytime transpiration represents the majority of the contribution to total water use more abundant studies have been devoted to illustrating responses of daytime physiological processes to climate change than nighttime such as elevated temperature and co2 atmospheric and soil drought sperry et al 2019 mackay et al 2015 ainsworth et al 2005 although nocturnal water use q n only accounted for about 6 3 of daily water use on a global average padrón et al 2020 a growing body of evidence suggests that it contributed to both improving tree growth caird et al 2007 and avoiding tree mortality caused by hydraulic failure klein et al 2018 zeppel et al 2019 besides the more considerable temperature increase at night xia et al 2014 folland et al 2001 signifies a stronger enhancement in atmospheric water demand during nighttime than daytime further proofing the non negligible water use at night nocturnal water use is projected to increase continuously worldwide padrón et al 2020 in addition to daytime water consumption extra root water uptake caused by q n accelerates soil moisture depletion wang et al 2021 meanwhile the soil drought induced by climate change also threatens plants especially in water limited areas it has been found that drought induced tree mortality was accelerated under nocturnal climate warming lu et al 2022 therefore nocturnal temperature increase coupled with soil water deficit tends to strengthen the dieback and mortality rate in forests there is an urgent need to understand the influencing mechanisms of soil water availability on nocturnal sap flow to improve tree competitiveness and forest quality under climate change as yet sufficient soil water has been verified to promote the nocturnal sap flow han et al 2021 chen et al 2020 montoro et al 2020 but the effect of soil water content θ on the proportion of nocturnal water use to daily water use q n was less focused convergence in q n was reported across species and tree ages on the same site chen et al 2020 phillips et al 2010 zeppel et al 2010 while a noticeable variation in q n was found among sites han et al 2021 forster 2014 consequently at a specific site q n may respond more to varying soil moisture than q n a hypothesis can be proposed that q n will be distinctly promoted under well watered conditions while q n may maintain relatively stable at the same site regardless of θ besides the different contributions of soil water at various depths to the variation of daily total transpiration have been found by xi et al 2017 on this basis we can reasonably speculate that q n should also be differently impacted by θ at different depths but such speculation has not been verified by previous studies among diversified environmental impact factors vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed ws and θ can independently or interactively affect nocturnal sap flow globally han et al 2021 hayat et al 2021 padrón et al 2020 siddiq and cao 2018 zeppel et al 2014 the influence mechanism of θ on nocturnal sap flow should be different from the meteorological factors as θ determines the amount of available soil water that can be absorbed by trees instead of their water demand when the potential water demand cannot be met by root water uptake the driving force of meteorological factors on nocturnal sap flow might change leitgeb et al 2002 this speculation was partially verified by hayat et al 2021 who reported that the relationships between stomatal conductance and meteorological factors were modified by θ but it still needs further exploration into whether and how soil water affects the relationships between nocturnal sap flow and meteorological factors therefore we hypothesized that the nocturnal sap flow variation could be better explained by meteorological factors when there is sufficient soil water not limiting the root water uptake two ecophysiological and ecohydrological components are involved in the nocturnal sap flow process stem water refilling r e and nocturnal transpiration t n these two components cooccur temporally and spatially but represent opposite water use directions water storage in the stem and water loss to the atmosphere although the methods for precise partitioning between r e and t n remain debated researchers have tried different ways to quantify these two components liu et al 2021 di et al 2019b siddiq and cao 2018 buckley et al 2011 zeppel et al 2010 when most studies focused on the seasonal variation and the interspecific differences of r e and t n yu et al 2018 alvarado barrientos et al 2015 phillips et al 2010 it was seldomly investigated whether there is a trade off between these two components several case studies reported that a lower proportion of r e to q n r e existed in a temperate and humid montane forest alvarado barrientos et al 2015 while it increased in seasonal arid di et al 2019b and desert environments yu et al 2018 considering that the reliance on stored water in the stem tends to occur more in water limited regions we hypothesize that trees have a relatively higher r e when experiencing more severe soil water deficit and r e decreases with increasing θ as the dominant contributor to global greening china has the largest area of planted forests around the world thanks to the afforestation and reforestation during recent decades chen et al 2019 song et al 2018 poplar the principal and widely distributed tree species in northern china plays a crucial role in both timber production and ecological restoration zhang et al 2012 given the extensive degradation of poplar plantations in northern china sun et al 2018 their productivity quality and health may be further threatened by the coupled effects of increasing water scarcity and rising nighttime temperatures to better understand the nocturnal tree water consumption patterns and alterations in typical plantation ecosystems under climate change the nocturnal water use strategy of poplar plantations experiencing different soil water conditions was investigated in a seasonal arid region the overarching objectives of this study were 1 to explore the variations in q n and q n with soil water conditions 2 to elucidate the effects of soil moisture on the environmental driving force of q n and 3 to test the hypothesis that there will be a trade off between r e and t n i e r e and this trade off depends on soil water availability 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and experimental design this experiment was carried out in a 3 9 ha mature poplar plantation 36 58 n 116 14 e 27 m elevation in gaotang county shandong province northern china this region has a predominant warm temperate monsoon climate with the average annual air temperature precipitation and open pan evaporation of 13 2 c 545 mm and 1880 mm respectively during the experimental period the mean air temperatures in the growing season were 25 7 c and 21 2 c respectively at daytime and nighttime an apparent wet season is generally observed in july and august when 52 80 of precipitation distributes the soil of this experimental site is an alluvial silt loam with a ph of 8 1 and the bulk density for different soil layers varied within 1 47 1 63 g cm 3 other details regarding the soil profile including soil hydraulic and chemical characteristics can be referred to xi et al 2016 the clone b301 populus tomentosa p bolleana p tomentosa was planted in the spring of 2005 at a stand density of 2500 trees ha 1 using an alternate wide and narrow row spacing scheme 1 m 2 m 6 m a subsurface drip irrigation system was applied in the experimental plantation at 20 cm depth with three drip laterals for every two tree rows one drip lateral 2 l h 1 drippers 50 cm apart was set in the middle of the narrow row while the other two laterals were arranged in the wide rows at a 60 cm distance from the tree lines three irrigation treatments t25 t50 t75 and a rainfed control ck were designed in this study with three replications trees in t25 t50 and t75 were irrigated when the mean soil matric potential at 20 cm depth and 10 cm distance from drippers reached 25 50 and 75 kpa respectively more information on irrigation scheduling and experimental design can be found in xi et al 2014 this study was conducted in the second replication of the irrigation experiment over two consecutive growing seasons i e 2010 2011 at the beginning of this study the mean diameter at breast height dbh and the mean tree height were 9 26 cm and 12 26 m in t25 9 01 cm and 11 98 m in t50 8 96 cm and 11 94 m in t75 and 9 17 cm and 12 03 m in ck respectively with no significant difference among treatments p 0 05 2 2 environmental factors meteorological data were continuously monitored by a standard automatic weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk located in an open field about 250 m away from the experimental stand meteorological variables were recorded every 10 min for two consecutive years including global solar radiation r s kw m 2 photosynthetically active radiation par mol m 2 d 1 relative air humidity h air temperature t a ws m s 1 and precipitation p mm nocturnal meteorological data were filtered following the principle of r s 0 005 kw m 2 daley and phillips 2006 nocturnal t a t an and h h n were used to calculate the nocturnal vapor pressure deficit vpd n kpa campbell and norman 1998 to represent the nocturnal atmospheric water demand seasonal variations in nocturnal meteorological factors mentioned above have been detailly described in di et al 2019b in each treatment tdr probes tdc220 sinton technology ltd beijing china were installed under two representative drippers for θ cm3 cm 3 measurement the probes were inserted horizontally into the soil at 20 50 80 and 110 cm soil depths respectively and the measurements were taken half hourly the oven drying method was used to calibrate the tdr probes before their installation in each growing season the measurement of θ was initiated in early april and terminated at the end of october seasonal variation in θ at different soil depths has been exhibited by di et al 2019a 2 3 sapwood area and width the sapwood area sa was estimated by its allometric regression relation with dbh as described in our previous study xi et al 2017 a total of 67 pairs of dbh and sa data were used to establish this relationship with an r 2 of 0 981 based on the measurements of 90 felled trees the linear relation between sapwood width and dbh fig s1 was established and used for sapwood width determination the heartwood area was identified by observing the dark color often associated with heartwood burgess et al 2001 at the beginning of this study the sapwood width in t25 t50 t75 and ck were 4 07 3 97 3 94 and 4 03 cm respectively 2 4 nocturnal sap flow sap flux density vsf cm s 1 was measured by a thermal dissipation probe tdp30 dynamax inc tx usa at the breast height of 1 3 m above the ground for each treatment three average sized sample trees or five sample trees covering different dbh classes were selected for sap flow measurement as particularly described in our previous study di et al 2019a according to the sapwood width of sample trees the probes with a length of 3 cm were chosen to minimize the potential estimation errors caused by inserting probes into the heartwood the probes were installed on the south aspect of the stems and the stems were wrapped with aluminum foil from the ground to the height of the installed sensors to shield them from solar radiation and rainwater measurements were taken every 10 s and the average values for each 10 min were recorded then the temperature differences δt c between the heated and reference probes were converted into vsf following the commonly used calibration equation proposed by granier 1987 1 vsf 0 0119 t m t t 1 231 where δt m indicates the maximal δt when vsf is zero considering the vsf might not reach zero every night the daily maximum values of δt could lead to an underestimation of nocturnal vsf thus the maximum value of daily δt m over 7 10 days lu et al 2004 was used to represent the zero value of vsf by using the baseliner software oishi et al 2016 after the calculation of vsf the nocturnal and diurnal data were separated when r s was less or more than 0 005 kw m 2 daley and phillips 2006 respectively for further analysis results of the whole tree potometer experiment conducted on the same plantation li et al 2014 verified that when the vsf difference across the sapwood and among azimuths was ignored the commonly used eq 1 is believed to be accurate and valid for our p tomentosa plantation di et al 2019b then the daily water use q mm d 1 was calculated as follows 2 q vsf t sa a g where vsf cm s 1 is the arithmetic or weighted mean stand sap flux density t s is the time duration of day and night sa cm2 is the total sapwood area at the position of probe installation and a g cm2 is the area of the experimental stand here the water use was assumed to represent the water absorbed from the soil including both the water loss to the atmosphere i e transpiration and the xylem refilling for recovering the water capacitance of both stem and branch the q n and diurnal q q day were calculated following eq 2 by using the nocturnal and diurnal vsf respectively 2 5 differentiating xylem refilling from nocturnal transpiration the t n and r e were distinguished using the forecasted refilling approach which was proposed based on the assumptions of 1 r e and t n occur at the same time 2 any sap flow occurring at night is regarded as refilling when the nocturnal driving force vpd was minimized and 3 sap flow declines with decreasing solar radiation in the evening and tailing off to zero if no water loss occurred fisher et al 2007 thus the sap flow was fitted by an exponential decay function according to the initial steep slope of the sap flow trend at night the integral of the fitted line was calculated to represent the amount of r e while the area surrounded by the fitted curve and actual sap flow data was regarded as t n then the ratio of r e to q n r e was determined to show the trade off between the two components of q n more details about the process of the partitioning of r e and t n can be referred to di et al 2019b 2 6 nocturnal stomatal conductance a strong linear relation between stomatal conductance and the ratio of sap flow density to vpd has been found for p tomentosa in previous studies li et al 2021 the ratio of transpiration to vpd can be calculated thus to show the variation in stomatal conductance in this study q n vpd n was calculated to represent nocturnal stomatal conductance 2 7 leaf area index the seasonal dynamic of leaf area index lai was measured using a winscanopy plant canopy analyzer régent instruments inc quebec canada throughout the experimental period ten measuring points were randomly chosen for lai measurement in each treatment at an interval of about 15 days then a non linear regression was employed for lai interpolation more details about the measurement and seasonal variation of lai can be referred to di et al 2019a in this study lai was simply described as it was only used to eliminate the impact of canopy development on nocturnal stand water use in different treatments 2 8 data analysis to minimize the effect of noisy sap flow data on rainy days all statistical analyses of sap flow were conducted on non rainy days the exponential decay function y aebx was applied to calculate the nocturnal xylem refilling following the forecasted refilling approach mentioned above differences in q n q n r e t n and r e among treatments were compared based on the one way anova a corresponding non parametric test was applied for data that did not meet the normal distribution the product of nocturnal meteorological factors and lai was used in the linear correlation analyses to eliminate the difference in canopy development among treatments additionally boundary regression was performed to simulate the relation between r e and q day the upper boundary was adjusted to the 90 envelope of q day data points and the r e corresponding to the peak value of the fitted curve was calculated based on the fitting formula variations of q n and q n among treatments were calculated according to phillips et al 2010 all statistical analyses were performed using origin ver 2021 originlab usa and matlab ver r2021a mathworks inc usa at a critical probability value of 0 05 3 results 3 1 qn and qn under different soil water conditions variations in q n and q day among different treatments were similar during the study periods fig 1 in 2010 q n and q day were 0 12 and 2 42 mm d 1 in t25 and 0 10 and 2 28 mm d 1 in t75 respectively which were significantly higher than t50 and ck p 0 05 in 2011 the average q n and q day over the four treatments increased by 91 and 54 respectively the larger increments of q n and q day in t50 and ck led to the differences among treatments disappearing in 2011 only leaving a significantly higher q n in t25 than in other treatments p 0 05 fig 1 the two year average daily q n for t25 t50 t75 and ck were 9 7 7 1 8 6 and 8 2 respectively with q n being significantly higher in t25 than in the other three treatments in both two years fig 1 the seasonal variation of q n was much greater than that of q n as q n increased apparently in late growing season due to strong decrease of q day fig 2 besides the variation of q n cv 0 27 among treatments was less than that of q n cv 0 37 3 2 relationships between qn and environmental and biological factors the q n generally increased with θ p 0 05 but this relationship was detected in different soil layers for different treatments fig 3 the q n in t25 and t50 was significantly related to θ in the deep soil layer θ 80 and θ 110 p 0 05 while q n in t75 and ck was mainly impacted by θ in surface soil θ 20 r 2 0 30 p 0 01 fig 3 additionally meteorological factors also had significant effects on q n in all the treatments except for t25 fig 4 the q n in t50 t75 and ck was negatively and significantly related to ws n lai p 0 01 fig 4 for vpd n lai only q n in t75 and ck showed a significant correlation with it with pearson r of 0 28 p 0 001 and 0 37 p 0 0001 respectively fig 4 in all treatments q n increased sharply with increasing nocturnal stomatal conductance indicated by q n vpd n and then the increase of q n gradually slowed down fig 5 when q n vpd n exceeded a critical value about 0 6 mm d 1 kpa 1 q n maintained within a relatively stable range the t25 had the highest q n vpd n with its average and minimum values of 0 155 and 0 035 mm d 1 kpa 1 respectively while the corresponding values for the other treatments were 0 106 and 0 017 t50 0 133 and 0 016 t75 0 120 and 0 016 mm d 1 kpa 1 ck respectively fig 5 3 3 re tn and re under different soil water conditions for non rainy days during the study period significant differences among treatments were observed in r e with the highest value appearing in t25 0 109 mm d 1 and followed by t75 0 076 mm d 1 t50 0 065 mm d 1 and ck 0 068 mm d 1 in contrast there was relatively less variation in t n among treatments a significant difference in t n was only detected between t25 and t50 fig 6 mean daily r e for t25 t50 t75 and ck were 70 65 66 and 62 respectively fig 6 significantly higher r e was detected in t25 p 0 05 while there was no significant difference among the other treatments 3 4 effects of θ and qday on re in different treatments r e was significantly and negatively impacted by θ in different depths fig 7 the r e in t25 and t75 decreased with increasing θ 20 p 0 01 while r e in t50 was negatively correlated with both θ 20 p 0 01 and θ 50 p 0 05 fig 7 in contrast no significant relation was detected between r e and θ 20 in ck but its r e had strong linear relations with θ at 50 80 and 110 cm soil depths fig 7 a significant quadratic polynomial relation was found between r e and the maximal q day which was indicated by the 90 upper boundary of q day fig 8 the r e value corresponding to the peak of the fitted curve in each treatment was 66 t25 64 t50 61 t75 and 58 ck respectively in addition the mean maximal q day i e the average of data points on the fitted curve for t25 t50 t75 and ck was 3 91 3 71 3 58 and 3 53 mm d 1 respectively this finding indicated that the relatively higher mean r e under a better soil water condition was attributed to maintaining a higher maximum of q day fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 different responses of qn and qn to soil water content by eliminating the potential effects of tree species age site and climate on q n we confirmed the hypothesis that higher θ significantly promotes q n but has less influence on q n in our mature poplar plantation fig 1 dominant control force of θ on q n has been reported in early studies han et al 2021 hayat et al 2021 zeppel et al 2014 through its effect on stomatal conductance howard and donovan 2007 similarly a relatively higher average of nocturnal stomatal conductance was also found in the well watered treatment t25 of this study fig 5 meanwhile a larger sap flux under a given q n vpd n promoted by sufficient soil moisture also explained the significant increment of q n in t25 figs 1 and 5 while variation in stomatal conductance mainly affects the magnitude of nocturnal transpiration tree size was detected to be coupled to the other component of q n that is nighttime water recharge wang et al 2008 phillips et al 2003 thus a larger tree size can also result in the increasing q n associated with water recharge chen et al 2020 have verified the significant power function relations between q n and dbh therefore considering the growth advantages caused by the long term sufficient irrigation the relatively larger tree size dbh and tree height in t25 xi et al 2014 might also lead to its higher q n by contrast minor variation in q n among treatments illustrates that it was less affected by θ figs 1 and 2 this phenomenon was different from the apparent decreasing q n with θ found by a previous study fang et al 2018 the less variable q n under different soil water conditions was mainly attributed to synchronous water uptake regulation during daytime and nighttime namely concurrent increase or decrease of q n and q day with θ fig 1 similar q n values among different species ages and soil water conditions were also reported by chen et al 2020 and zeppel et al 2010 besides previous studies and our results jointly exhibited a low average of q n 15 which was primarily caused by low q n with high q day chen et al 2020 zeppel et al 2010 this means that even if q n was affected by environmental and biological factors their effects on variation in q n are still limited the low q n commonly observed also reflected plants strategy for minimizing water loss while maximizing carbon gain except for the sensitive response of q n to irrigation the hypothesis that q n was differently affected by θ at different soil depths was further confirmed in the present study the significant linear relation between q n and θ in the surface soil layer was only detected in treatments with less or no water supply t75 and ck fig 3 frequent irrigation in t25 and t50 resulted in a relatively narrow variation range of θ in their shallow soil which might weaken the correlation of q n with θ thus more considerable soil moisture fluctuation should be the fundamental reason for significant relations between surface θ and q n in drier soil comparable results have also been found for two co occurring species pinus tabuliformis and acer truncatum in a temperate semiarid region chen et al 2020 inversely the remarkable contribution of deep soil water 80 and 110 cm depths to q n presented in wet soil conditions fig 3 this phenomenon was more likely to be related to the sensitive reaction of deep roots to soil water rather than to suppressed q n by low deep θ since there was a similar variation range of deep θ in each treatment compared with the shallow roots frequently stimulated by irrigation deep roots in a relatively stable and moist environment might respond more violently to increasing θ specific causes for the varied contributions of shallow and deep soil water to nocturnal sap flow among irrigation treatments however call for further ecophysiological study 4 2 soil water dependent influences of environmental on qn in contrary with previous observations in other forests han et al 2021 rosado et al 2012 novick et al 2009 our results showed generally negative and weak relations between meteorological factors and q n fig 4 this was attributed to the sensitive stomatal reaction of poplar to increasing potential atmospheric water demand a sharp decrease in nocturnal stomatal conductance with vpd n was commonly observed in our experimental plantation even under conditions with sufficient water supply fig s2 thus poplar tended to adopt a conservative strategy of nocturnal water use through rapid stomatal closure under the circumstances soil moisture played a more crucial role in q n regulation than meteorological drivers as low soil moisture can aggravate the stomatal regulation by triggering stomatal closure with rising vpd n cirelli et al 2016 zeppel et al 2012 howard and donovan 2007 we showed that the influence of meteorological factors on q n depended on soil moisture in our poplar plantation compared with the significant negative effect of vpd n and ws n on q n in other treatments no correlations were detected between meteorological factors and q n in t25 fig 4 for trees growing in well watered conditions adequate soil moisture may avoid the stomatal conductance loss caused by soil water stress hence significant negative effects of vpd n and ws n on q n disappeared when abundant soil water was provided the relationship between vpd n and q n became more robust with the decline of soil water conditions it indicated that a severer loss of stomatal conductance induced by lower θ wang et al 2021 cirelli et al 2016 further strengthened the negative effects of vpd n on q n fig s2 similarly chen et al 2020 also observed that vpd n had a significant and negative influence on q n in an a truncatum forest with dry soil while no correlation between vpd n and q n was detected under a moister soil condition moreover it can be inferred that trees in t50 and t75 were still subjected to stomatal closure triggered by soil water stress even with irrigation overall the indistinctive influence of meteorological factors on q n in t25 rejected the hypothesis that the variation in nocturnal sap flow can be better explained by meteorological factors when there is sufficient moisture in the soil additionally these findings illustrated that increasing θ can relieve the sensitive stomatal reaction to atmospheric water demand but will not change the inherent and conservative water use habit of poplar at night 4 3 soil water content changed the trade off between re and tn in this study the hypothesis that r e decreases with θ were confirmed by the observed negative linear relations between θ and r e in each treatment fig 7 this indicates that unlimited soil water availability can reduce the dependence of tree water use on stem water storage although no comparable results can directly support this viewpoint it can be indirectly proved by a higher observed r e in drier environments for example yu et al 2018 reported that r e of p euphratica exceeded 80 in a hyperarid desert but r e decreased to 60 in a semi humid forest zeppel et al 2010 and 20 25 in a humid montane forest respectively alvarado barrientos et al 2015 interestingly in different irrigation treatments the significant influence of soil water availability on r e occurred in different soil depths fig 7 as the irrigated water was applied to the shallow soil layer soil water replenishment mainly came from surface soil for the three irrigation treatments t25 t50 and t75 long term stable and sufficient available water in shallow soil layers further induced concentrated root distribution in this zone zou et al 2022 ma et al 2012 thus trees with irrigation can obtain more water from surface soil to sustain the transpiration during the daytime which facilitates the conservation of stem water storage for trees under rainfed conditions the soil surface was subject to strong evaporation without water replenishment leading to a larger fluctuation of θ in this depth fig 7 unsatisfied transpiration demand due to limited surface soil moisture motivated roots to explore deeply and take up stable and sufficient deep soil water resources di et al 2018 the compensation of deep water usage to transpiration consumption finally contributed to the apparent negative correlation between r e and θ in the deep soil of ck therefore different water uptake strategies between irrigated and rainfed trees could be considered as the potential inducer for varied relations between θ and r e at different soil depths surprisingly there was an opposite variation in r e with soil moisture among treatments which exhibited relatively higher r e with more soil water input fig 6 this result rejected the hypothesis that trees have a rising r e when facing a more severe soil water deficit possible explanations for this phenomenon were primarily embodied in the following three aspects firstly this phenomenon can be attributed to a stronger reliance on stem water storage to sustain rapid diurnal transpiration under moister soil conditions our results showed that both the maximal q day of the fit line and its corresponding r e increased with the irrigation amount fig 8 to guarantee timely water supply for higher diurnal transpired water demand in moister conditions more stored water in the stem was consumed during daytime correspondingly more absorbed water was needed for stem water refilling at night to reduce hydraulic limitation and prepare for follow up water consumption the next day secondly greater r e in better soil water conditions might also be related to increased tree size in our poplar plantation relatively higher r e was accompanied by larger tree size under moister soil conditions this is consistent with the previous study which found that dependency on stored water increased with tree size since larger trees have a greater water storage capacity relative to water use than smaller trees phillips et al 2003 thirdly phillips et al 2003 also verified that the use of stored water increased photosynthesis which might be the reason for the better growth status of trees with more irrigation water in our study xi et al 2014 accordingly enhanced r e under unlimited soil water conditions may be a maintaining mechanism for poplar to improve diurnal transpiration photosynthesis and growth synchronously overall opposite variation directions of r e among and within treatments demonstrated its different responses to changing soil moisture on short and long term scales 5 conclusions overall our results verified the significant effects of soil moisture on nocturnal water use and its responses to meteorological factors in the fast growing poplar plantation in the seasonal arid region sufficient soil moisture significantly promoted q n by enhancing the stomatal conductance while a relative convergence was found in q n among treatments with the decline of soil water conditions significant linear correlations between q n and θ shifted from deep soil layers to the soil surface soil water dependent influence of meteorological factors on q n was concluded based on the weaker explanation of vpd n to q n with increasing soil water meanwhile two components r e and t n of q n exhibited trade offs with varied soil water conditions negative linear relations between r e and θ were shown within treatments while significantly higher r e was observed under conditions with more sufficient soil water for the long term these opposite responses of r e to θ reflected the different adaptions of nocturnal water use to soil water availability on short and long scales increasing θ can relieve the sensitive stomatal reaction to atmospheric water demand but will not change the conservative water use habit of poplars at night declaration of competing interest the

9275,nocturnal water uses q n significantly affect global water budgets and diurnal water cycles which are currently suffering from restrictions of soil drought and soil water depletion caused by climate change and worldwide greening recent studies have recognized the vital influence of soil water availability on q n but responses of nocturnal water use strategy to soil moisture variation were not fully understood for example the effect of soil water content θ on the trade offs between two components of q n stem water refilling r e and nocturnal transpiration t n was rarely involved and remained unclear this study analyzed the nocturnal sap flow of typical afforestation species poplar plantation under different soil water conditions in a seasonal arid region of northern china results indicated that higher θ significantly promoted q n through enhancing the stomatal conductance but had less influence on the proportion of nocturnal water use to daily water use q n 7 10 with the decline of soil water conditions significant linear correlations between q n and θ shifted from deep soil layers to the soil surface the influence of meteorological factors on q n depended on soil water condition and the explanation of nocturnal vapor pressure deficit vpd n to q n became weaker with increasing soil moisture negative linear relations between the proportion of stem water refilling to q n r e and θ were shown within treatments but a significantly higher r e was observed under more sufficient soil water these opposite responses of r e to θ reflected the different adaptions of q n to soil water availability on short and long scales this study highlights the crucial role of soil moisture in the nocturnal water use and balance strategy of a seasonal arid poplar plantation our results help better understand the nocturnal transpiration processes in the context of global climate change keywords nocturnal sap flow trade offs soil water content meteorological drivers populus tomentosa data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global climate change and worldwide greening have been sustained for decades leading to considerable temperature rise and increase in leaf area of vegetation chen et al 2019 gistemp team 2018 the consistently elevated potential evapotranspiration demand and leaf area can prominently affect global water and energy flux and budget through their effects on the transpiration of plants zeppel et al 2014 as daytime transpiration represents the majority of the contribution to total water use more abundant studies have been devoted to illustrating responses of daytime physiological processes to climate change than nighttime such as elevated temperature and co2 atmospheric and soil drought sperry et al 2019 mackay et al 2015 ainsworth et al 2005 although nocturnal water use q n only accounted for about 6 3 of daily water use on a global average padrón et al 2020 a growing body of evidence suggests that it contributed to both improving tree growth caird et al 2007 and avoiding tree mortality caused by hydraulic failure klein et al 2018 zeppel et al 2019 besides the more considerable temperature increase at night xia et al 2014 folland et al 2001 signifies a stronger enhancement in atmospheric water demand during nighttime than daytime further proofing the non negligible water use at night nocturnal water use is projected to increase continuously worldwide padrón et al 2020 in addition to daytime water consumption extra root water uptake caused by q n accelerates soil moisture depletion wang et al 2021 meanwhile the soil drought induced by climate change also threatens plants especially in water limited areas it has been found that drought induced tree mortality was accelerated under nocturnal climate warming lu et al 2022 therefore nocturnal temperature increase coupled with soil water deficit tends to strengthen the dieback and mortality rate in forests there is an urgent need to understand the influencing mechanisms of soil water availability on nocturnal sap flow to improve tree competitiveness and forest quality under climate change as yet sufficient soil water has been verified to promote the nocturnal sap flow han et al 2021 chen et al 2020 montoro et al 2020 but the effect of soil water content θ on the proportion of nocturnal water use to daily water use q n was less focused convergence in q n was reported across species and tree ages on the same site chen et al 2020 phillips et al 2010 zeppel et al 2010 while a noticeable variation in q n was found among sites han et al 2021 forster 2014 consequently at a specific site q n may respond more to varying soil moisture than q n a hypothesis can be proposed that q n will be distinctly promoted under well watered conditions while q n may maintain relatively stable at the same site regardless of θ besides the different contributions of soil water at various depths to the variation of daily total transpiration have been found by xi et al 2017 on this basis we can reasonably speculate that q n should also be differently impacted by θ at different depths but such speculation has not been verified by previous studies among diversified environmental impact factors vapor pressure deficit vpd wind speed ws and θ can independently or interactively affect nocturnal sap flow globally han et al 2021 hayat et al 2021 padrón et al 2020 siddiq and cao 2018 zeppel et al 2014 the influence mechanism of θ on nocturnal sap flow should be different from the meteorological factors as θ determines the amount of available soil water that can be absorbed by trees instead of their water demand when the potential water demand cannot be met by root water uptake the driving force of meteorological factors on nocturnal sap flow might change leitgeb et al 2002 this speculation was partially verified by hayat et al 2021 who reported that the relationships between stomatal conductance and meteorological factors were modified by θ but it still needs further exploration into whether and how soil water affects the relationships between nocturnal sap flow and meteorological factors therefore we hypothesized that the nocturnal sap flow variation could be better explained by meteorological factors when there is sufficient soil water not limiting the root water uptake two ecophysiological and ecohydrological components are involved in the nocturnal sap flow process stem water refilling r e and nocturnal transpiration t n these two components cooccur temporally and spatially but represent opposite water use directions water storage in the stem and water loss to the atmosphere although the methods for precise partitioning between r e and t n remain debated researchers have tried different ways to quantify these two components liu et al 2021 di et al 2019b siddiq and cao 2018 buckley et al 2011 zeppel et al 2010 when most studies focused on the seasonal variation and the interspecific differences of r e and t n yu et al 2018 alvarado barrientos et al 2015 phillips et al 2010 it was seldomly investigated whether there is a trade off between these two components several case studies reported that a lower proportion of r e to q n r e existed in a temperate and humid montane forest alvarado barrientos et al 2015 while it increased in seasonal arid di et al 2019b and desert environments yu et al 2018 considering that the reliance on stored water in the stem tends to occur more in water limited regions we hypothesize that trees have a relatively higher r e when experiencing more severe soil water deficit and r e decreases with increasing θ as the dominant contributor to global greening china has the largest area of planted forests around the world thanks to the afforestation and reforestation during recent decades chen et al 2019 song et al 2018 poplar the principal and widely distributed tree species in northern china plays a crucial role in both timber production and ecological restoration zhang et al 2012 given the extensive degradation of poplar plantations in northern china sun et al 2018 their productivity quality and health may be further threatened by the coupled effects of increasing water scarcity and rising nighttime temperatures to better understand the nocturnal tree water consumption patterns and alterations in typical plantation ecosystems under climate change the nocturnal water use strategy of poplar plantations experiencing different soil water conditions was investigated in a seasonal arid region the overarching objectives of this study were 1 to explore the variations in q n and q n with soil water conditions 2 to elucidate the effects of soil moisture on the environmental driving force of q n and 3 to test the hypothesis that there will be a trade off between r e and t n i e r e and this trade off depends on soil water availability 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and experimental design this experiment was carried out in a 3 9 ha mature poplar plantation 36 58 n 116 14 e 27 m elevation in gaotang county shandong province northern china this region has a predominant warm temperate monsoon climate with the average annual air temperature precipitation and open pan evaporation of 13 2 c 545 mm and 1880 mm respectively during the experimental period the mean air temperatures in the growing season were 25 7 c and 21 2 c respectively at daytime and nighttime an apparent wet season is generally observed in july and august when 52 80 of precipitation distributes the soil of this experimental site is an alluvial silt loam with a ph of 8 1 and the bulk density for different soil layers varied within 1 47 1 63 g cm 3 other details regarding the soil profile including soil hydraulic and chemical characteristics can be referred to xi et al 2016 the clone b301 populus tomentosa p bolleana p tomentosa was planted in the spring of 2005 at a stand density of 2500 trees ha 1 using an alternate wide and narrow row spacing scheme 1 m 2 m 6 m a subsurface drip irrigation system was applied in the experimental plantation at 20 cm depth with three drip laterals for every two tree rows one drip lateral 2 l h 1 drippers 50 cm apart was set in the middle of the narrow row while the other two laterals were arranged in the wide rows at a 60 cm distance from the tree lines three irrigation treatments t25 t50 t75 and a rainfed control ck were designed in this study with three replications trees in t25 t50 and t75 were irrigated when the mean soil matric potential at 20 cm depth and 10 cm distance from drippers reached 25 50 and 75 kpa respectively more information on irrigation scheduling and experimental design can be found in xi et al 2014 this study was conducted in the second replication of the irrigation experiment over two consecutive growing seasons i e 2010 2011 at the beginning of this study the mean diameter at breast height dbh and the mean tree height were 9 26 cm and 12 26 m in t25 9 01 cm and 11 98 m in t50 8 96 cm and 11 94 m in t75 and 9 17 cm and 12 03 m in ck respectively with no significant difference among treatments p 0 05 2 2 environmental factors meteorological data were continuously monitored by a standard automatic weather station delta t devices ltd cambridge uk located in an open field about 250 m away from the experimental stand meteorological variables were recorded every 10 min for two consecutive years including global solar radiation r s kw m 2 photosynthetically active radiation par mol m 2 d 1 relative air humidity h air temperature t a ws m s 1 and precipitation p mm nocturnal meteorological data were filtered following the principle of r s 0 005 kw m 2 daley and phillips 2006 nocturnal t a t an and h h n were used to calculate the nocturnal vapor pressure deficit vpd n kpa campbell and norman 1998 to represent the nocturnal atmospheric water demand seasonal variations in nocturnal meteorological factors mentioned above have been detailly described in di et al 2019b in each treatment tdr probes tdc220 sinton technology ltd beijing china were installed under two representative drippers for θ cm3 cm 3 measurement the probes were inserted horizontally into the soil at 20 50 80 and 110 cm soil depths respectively and the measurements were taken half hourly the oven drying method was used to calibrate the tdr probes before their installation in each growing season the measurement of θ was initiated in early april and terminated at the end of october seasonal variation in θ at different soil depths has been exhibited by di et al 2019a 2 3 sapwood area and width the sapwood area sa was estimated by its allometric regression relation with dbh as described in our previous study xi et al 2017 a total of 67 pairs of dbh and sa data were used to establish this relationship with an r 2 of 0 981 based on the measurements of 90 felled trees the linear relation between sapwood width and dbh fig s1 was established and used for sapwood width determination the heartwood area was identified by observing the dark color often associated with heartwood burgess et al 2001 at the beginning of this study the sapwood width in t25 t50 t75 and ck were 4 07 3 97 3 94 and 4 03 cm respectively 2 4 nocturnal sap flow sap flux density vsf cm s 1 was measured by a thermal dissipation probe tdp30 dynamax inc tx usa at the breast height of 1 3 m above the ground for each treatment three average sized sample trees or five sample trees covering different dbh classes were selected for sap flow measurement as particularly described in our previous study di et al 2019a according to the sapwood width of sample trees the probes with a length of 3 cm were chosen to minimize the potential estimation errors caused by inserting probes into the heartwood the probes were installed on the south aspect of the stems and the stems were wrapped with aluminum foil from the ground to the height of the installed sensors to shield them from solar radiation and rainwater measurements were taken every 10 s and the average values for each 10 min were recorded then the temperature differences δt c between the heated and reference probes were converted into vsf following the commonly used calibration equation proposed by granier 1987 1 vsf 0 0119 t m t t 1 231 where δt m indicates the maximal δt when vsf is zero considering the vsf might not reach zero every night the daily maximum values of δt could lead to an underestimation of nocturnal vsf thus the maximum value of daily δt m over 7 10 days lu et al 2004 was used to represent the zero value of vsf by using the baseliner software oishi et al 2016 after the calculation of vsf the nocturnal and diurnal data were separated when r s was less or more than 0 005 kw m 2 daley and phillips 2006 respectively for further analysis results of the whole tree potometer experiment conducted on the same plantation li et al 2014 verified that when the vsf difference across the sapwood and among azimuths was ignored the commonly used eq 1 is believed to be accurate and valid for our p tomentosa plantation di et al 2019b then the daily water use q mm d 1 was calculated as follows 2 q vsf t sa a g where vsf cm s 1 is the arithmetic or weighted mean stand sap flux density t s is the time duration of day and night sa cm2 is the total sapwood area at the position of probe installation and a g cm2 is the area of the experimental stand here the water use was assumed to represent the water absorbed from the soil including both the water loss to the atmosphere i e transpiration and the xylem refilling for recovering the water capacitance of both stem and branch the q n and diurnal q q day were calculated following eq 2 by using the nocturnal and diurnal vsf respectively 2 5 differentiating xylem refilling from nocturnal transpiration the t n and r e were distinguished using the forecasted refilling approach which was proposed based on the assumptions of 1 r e and t n occur at the same time 2 any sap flow occurring at night is regarded as refilling when the nocturnal driving force vpd was minimized and 3 sap flow declines with decreasing solar radiation in the evening and tailing off to zero if no water loss occurred fisher et al 2007 thus the sap flow was fitted by an exponential decay function according to the initial steep slope of the sap flow trend at night the integral of the fitted line was calculated to represent the amount of r e while the area surrounded by the fitted curve and actual sap flow data was regarded as t n then the ratio of r e to q n r e was determined to show the trade off between the two components of q n more details about the process of the partitioning of r e and t n can be referred to di et al 2019b 2 6 nocturnal stomatal conductance a strong linear relation between stomatal conductance and the ratio of sap flow density to vpd has been found for p tomentosa in previous studies li et al 2021 the ratio of transpiration to vpd can be calculated thus to show the variation in stomatal conductance in this study q n vpd n was calculated to represent nocturnal stomatal conductance 2 7 leaf area index the seasonal dynamic of leaf area index lai was measured using a winscanopy plant canopy analyzer régent instruments inc quebec canada throughout the experimental period ten measuring points were randomly chosen for lai measurement in each treatment at an interval of about 15 days then a non linear regression was employed for lai interpolation more details about the measurement and seasonal variation of lai can be referred to di et al 2019a in this study lai was simply described as it was only used to eliminate the impact of canopy development on nocturnal stand water use in different treatments 2 8 data analysis to minimize the effect of noisy sap flow data on rainy days all statistical analyses of sap flow were conducted on non rainy days the exponential decay function y aebx was applied to calculate the nocturnal xylem refilling following the forecasted refilling approach mentioned above differences in q n q n r e t n and r e among treatments were compared based on the one way anova a corresponding non parametric test was applied for data that did not meet the normal distribution the product of nocturnal meteorological factors and lai was used in the linear correlation analyses to eliminate the difference in canopy development among treatments additionally boundary regression was performed to simulate the relation between r e and q day the upper boundary was adjusted to the 90 envelope of q day data points and the r e corresponding to the peak value of the fitted curve was calculated based on the fitting formula variations of q n and q n among treatments were calculated according to phillips et al 2010 all statistical analyses were performed using origin ver 2021 originlab usa and matlab ver r2021a mathworks inc usa at a critical probability value of 0 05 3 results 3 1 qn and qn under different soil water conditions variations in q n and q day among different treatments were similar during the study periods fig 1 in 2010 q n and q day were 0 12 and 2 42 mm d 1 in t25 and 0 10 and 2 28 mm d 1 in t75 respectively which were significantly higher than t50 and ck p 0 05 in 2011 the average q n and q day over the four treatments increased by 91 and 54 respectively the larger increments of q n and q day in t50 and ck led to the differences among treatments disappearing in 2011 only leaving a significantly higher q n in t25 than in other treatments p 0 05 fig 1 the two year average daily q n for t25 t50 t75 and ck were 9 7 7 1 8 6 and 8 2 respectively with q n being significantly higher in t25 than in the other three treatments in both two years fig 1 the seasonal variation of q n was much greater than that of q n as q n increased apparently in late growing season due to strong decrease of q day fig 2 besides the variation of q n cv 0 27 among treatments was less than that of q n cv 0 37 3 2 relationships between qn and environmental and biological factors the q n generally increased with θ p 0 05 but this relationship was detected in different soil layers for different treatments fig 3 the q n in t25 and t50 was significantly related to θ in the deep soil layer θ 80 and θ 110 p 0 05 while q n in t75 and ck was mainly impacted by θ in surface soil θ 20 r 2 0 30 p 0 01 fig 3 additionally meteorological factors also had significant effects on q n in all the treatments except for t25 fig 4 the q n in t50 t75 and ck was negatively and significantly related to ws n lai p 0 01 fig 4 for vpd n lai only q n in t75 and ck showed a significant correlation with it with pearson r of 0 28 p 0 001 and 0 37 p 0 0001 respectively fig 4 in all treatments q n increased sharply with increasing nocturnal stomatal conductance indicated by q n vpd n and then the increase of q n gradually slowed down fig 5 when q n vpd n exceeded a critical value about 0 6 mm d 1 kpa 1 q n maintained within a relatively stable range the t25 had the highest q n vpd n with its average and minimum values of 0 155 and 0 035 mm d 1 kpa 1 respectively while the corresponding values for the other treatments were 0 106 and 0 017 t50 0 133 and 0 016 t75 0 120 and 0 016 mm d 1 kpa 1 ck respectively fig 5 3 3 re tn and re under different soil water conditions for non rainy days during the study period significant differences among treatments were observed in r e with the highest value appearing in t25 0 109 mm d 1 and followed by t75 0 076 mm d 1 t50 0 065 mm d 1 and ck 0 068 mm d 1 in contrast there was relatively less variation in t n among treatments a significant difference in t n was only detected between t25 and t50 fig 6 mean daily r e for t25 t50 t75 and ck were 70 65 66 and 62 respectively fig 6 significantly higher r e was detected in t25 p 0 05 while there was no significant difference among the other treatments 3 4 effects of θ and qday on re in different treatments r e was significantly and negatively impacted by θ in different depths fig 7 the r e in t25 and t75 decreased with increasing θ 20 p 0 01 while r e in t50 was negatively correlated with both θ 20 p 0 01 and θ 50 p 0 05 fig 7 in contrast no significant relation was detected between r e and θ 20 in ck but its r e had strong linear relations with θ at 50 80 and 110 cm soil depths fig 7 a significant quadratic polynomial relation was found between r e and the maximal q day which was indicated by the 90 upper boundary of q day fig 8 the r e value corresponding to the peak of the fitted curve in each treatment was 66 t25 64 t50 61 t75 and 58 ck respectively in addition the mean maximal q day i e the average of data points on the fitted curve for t25 t50 t75 and ck was 3 91 3 71 3 58 and 3 53 mm d 1 respectively this finding indicated that the relatively higher mean r e under a better soil water condition was attributed to maintaining a higher maximum of q day fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 different responses of qn and qn to soil water content by eliminating the potential effects of tree species age site and climate on q n we confirmed the hypothesis that higher θ significantly promotes q n but has less influence on q n in our mature poplar plantation fig 1 dominant control force of θ on q n has been reported in early studies han et al 2021 hayat et al 2021 zeppel et al 2014 through its effect on stomatal conductance howard and donovan 2007 similarly a relatively higher average of nocturnal stomatal conductance was also found in the well watered treatment t25 of this study fig 5 meanwhile a larger sap flux under a given q n vpd n promoted by sufficient soil moisture also explained the significant increment of q n in t25 figs 1 and 5 while variation in stomatal conductance mainly affects the magnitude of nocturnal transpiration tree size was detected to be coupled to the other component of q n that is nighttime water recharge wang et al 2008 phillips et al 2003 thus a larger tree size can also result in the increasing q n associated with water recharge chen et al 2020 have verified the significant power function relations between q n and dbh therefore considering the growth advantages caused by the long term sufficient irrigation the relatively larger tree size dbh and tree height in t25 xi et al 2014 might also lead to its higher q n by contrast minor variation in q n among treatments illustrates that it was less affected by θ figs 1 and 2 this phenomenon was different from the apparent decreasing q n with θ found by a previous study fang et al 2018 the less variable q n under different soil water conditions was mainly attributed to synchronous water uptake regulation during daytime and nighttime namely concurrent increase or decrease of q n and q day with θ fig 1 similar q n values among different species ages and soil water conditions were also reported by chen et al 2020 and zeppel et al 2010 besides previous studies and our results jointly exhibited a low average of q n 15 which was primarily caused by low q n with high q day chen et al 2020 zeppel et al 2010 this means that even if q n was affected by environmental and biological factors their effects on variation in q n are still limited the low q n commonly observed also reflected plants strategy for minimizing water loss while maximizing carbon gain except for the sensitive response of q n to irrigation the hypothesis that q n was differently affected by θ at different soil depths was further confirmed in the present study the significant linear relation between q n and θ in the surface soil layer was only detected in treatments with less or no water supply t75 and ck fig 3 frequent irrigation in t25 and t50 resulted in a relatively narrow variation range of θ in their shallow soil which might weaken the correlation of q n with θ thus more considerable soil moisture fluctuation should be the fundamental reason for significant relations between surface θ and q n in drier soil comparable results have also been found for two co occurring species pinus tabuliformis and acer truncatum in a temperate semiarid region chen et al 2020 inversely the remarkable contribution of deep soil water 80 and 110 cm depths to q n presented in wet soil conditions fig 3 this phenomenon was more likely to be related to the sensitive reaction of deep roots to soil water rather than to suppressed q n by low deep θ since there was a similar variation range of deep θ in each treatment compared with the shallow roots frequently stimulated by irrigation deep roots in a relatively stable and moist environment might respond more violently to increasing θ specific causes for the varied contributions of shallow and deep soil water to nocturnal sap flow among irrigation treatments however call for further ecophysiological study 4 2 soil water dependent influences of environmental on qn in contrary with previous observations in other forests han et al 2021 rosado et al 2012 novick et al 2009 our results showed generally negative and weak relations between meteorological factors and q n fig 4 this was attributed to the sensitive stomatal reaction of poplar to increasing potential atmospheric water demand a sharp decrease in nocturnal stomatal conductance with vpd n was commonly observed in our experimental plantation even under conditions with sufficient water supply fig s2 thus poplar tended to adopt a conservative strategy of nocturnal water use through rapid stomatal closure under the circumstances soil moisture played a more crucial role in q n regulation than meteorological drivers as low soil moisture can aggravate the stomatal regulation by triggering stomatal closure with rising vpd n cirelli et al 2016 zeppel et al 2012 howard and donovan 2007 we showed that the influence of meteorological factors on q n depended on soil moisture in our poplar plantation compared with the significant negative effect of vpd n and ws n on q n in other treatments no correlations were detected between meteorological factors and q n in t25 fig 4 for trees growing in well watered conditions adequate soil moisture may avoid the stomatal conductance loss caused by soil water stress hence significant negative effects of vpd n and ws n on q n disappeared when abundant soil water was provided the relationship between vpd n and q n became more robust with the decline of soil water conditions it indicated that a severer loss of stomatal conductance induced by lower θ wang et al 2021 cirelli et al 2016 further strengthened the negative effects of vpd n on q n fig s2 similarly chen et al 2020 also observed that vpd n had a significant and negative influence on q n in an a truncatum forest with dry soil while no correlation between vpd n and q n was detected under a moister soil condition moreover it can be inferred that trees in t50 and t75 were still subjected to stomatal closure triggered by soil water stress even with irrigation overall the indistinctive influence of meteorological factors on q n in t25 rejected the hypothesis that the variation in nocturnal sap flow can be better explained by meteorological factors when there is sufficient moisture in the soil additionally these findings illustrated that increasing θ can relieve the sensitive stomatal reaction to atmospheric water demand but will not change the inherent and conservative water use habit of poplar at night 4 3 soil water content changed the trade off between re and tn in this study the hypothesis that r e decreases with θ were confirmed by the observed negative linear relations between θ and r e in each treatment fig 7 this indicates that unlimited soil water availability can reduce the dependence of tree water use on stem water storage although no comparable results can directly support this viewpoint it can be indirectly proved by a higher observed r e in drier environments for example yu et al 2018 reported that r e of p euphratica exceeded 80 in a hyperarid desert but r e decreased to 60 in a semi humid forest zeppel et al 2010 and 20 25 in a humid montane forest respectively alvarado barrientos et al 2015 interestingly in different irrigation treatments the significant influence of soil water availability on r e occurred in different soil depths fig 7 as the irrigated water was applied to the shallow soil layer soil water replenishment mainly came from surface soil for the three irrigation treatments t25 t50 and t75 long term stable and sufficient available water in shallow soil layers further induced concentrated root distribution in this zone zou et al 2022 ma et al 2012 thus trees with irrigation can obtain more water from surface soil to sustain the transpiration during the daytime which facilitates the conservation of stem water storage for trees under rainfed conditions the soil surface was subject to strong evaporation without water replenishment leading to a larger fluctuation of θ in this depth fig 7 unsatisfied transpiration demand due to limited surface soil moisture motivated roots to explore deeply and take up stable and sufficient deep soil water resources di et al 2018 the compensation of deep water usage to transpiration consumption finally contributed to the apparent negative correlation between r e and θ in the deep soil of ck therefore different water uptake strategies between irrigated and rainfed trees could be considered as the potential inducer for varied relations between θ and r e at different soil depths surprisingly there was an opposite variation in r e with soil moisture among treatments which exhibited relatively higher r e with more soil water input fig 6 this result rejected the hypothesis that trees have a rising r e when facing a more severe soil water deficit possible explanations for this phenomenon were primarily embodied in the following three aspects firstly this phenomenon can be attributed to a stronger reliance on stem water storage to sustain rapid diurnal transpiration under moister soil conditions our results showed that both the maximal q day of the fit line and its corresponding r e increased with the irrigation amount fig 8 to guarantee timely water supply for higher diurnal transpired water demand in moister conditions more stored water in the stem was consumed during daytime correspondingly more absorbed water was needed for stem water refilling at night to reduce hydraulic limitation and prepare for follow up water consumption the next day secondly greater r e in better soil water conditions might also be related to increased tree size in our poplar plantation relatively higher r e was accompanied by larger tree size under moister soil conditions this is consistent with the previous study which found that dependency on stored water increased with tree size since larger trees have a greater water storage capacity relative to water use than smaller trees phillips et al 2003 thirdly phillips et al 2003 also verified that the use of stored water increased photosynthesis which might be the reason for the better growth status of trees with more irrigation water in our study xi et al 2014 accordingly enhanced r e under unlimited soil water conditions may be a maintaining mechanism for poplar to improve diurnal transpiration photosynthesis and growth synchronously overall opposite variation directions of r e among and within treatments demonstrated its different responses to changing soil moisture on short and long term scales 5 conclusions overall our results verified the significant effects of soil moisture on nocturnal water use and its responses to meteorological factors in the fast growing poplar plantation in the seasonal arid region sufficient soil moisture significantly promoted q n by enhancing the stomatal conductance while a relative convergence was found in q n among treatments with the decline of soil water conditions significant linear correlations between q n and θ shifted from deep soil layers to the soil surface soil water dependent influence of meteorological factors on q n was concluded based on the weaker explanation of vpd n to q n with increasing soil water meanwhile two components r e and t n of q n exhibited trade offs with varied soil water conditions negative linear relations between r e and θ were shown within treatments while significantly higher r e was observed under conditions with more sufficient soil water for the long term these opposite responses of r e to θ reflected the different adaptions of nocturnal water use to soil water availability on short and long scales increasing θ can relieve the sensitive stomatal reaction to atmospheric water demand but will not change the conservative water use habit of poplars at night declaration of competing interest the

and fluorescence parameters grain yield and wp reached their maximum values at d2 under r and at d3 under f which was because r had a higher plant number by 25 in each row at d3 compared to f due to the decreased row number resulting from the existence of 40 cm wide ridge under r the greatest grain yield 7383 5 kg ha 1 and 8577 4 kg ha 1 and wp 20 03 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 21 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 were obtained under ri60d2 during the two growing seasons these results suggest that ridge furrow mulching combined with supplemental irrigation and modified plant density of 360 104 plants ha 1 can produce high grain yield and wp for winter wheat in the semi humid but drought prone areas of northwest china keywords ridge furrow mulching supplemental irrigation plant density photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence grain yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water scarcity and low water productivity are the main limiting factors for winter wheat production in semi arid and semi humid areas of northwest china gao et al 2021 ma et al 2018 qiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2010 where winter wheat is one of the most important cereal crops the ridge furrow planting with film mulch on the ridge r has been found to greatly improve soil temperature and water content zheng et al 2020 2021 and has a better effect on rainwater collection in the field daryanto et al 2017 which results in the increase in crop yields and water productivity wp supplemental irrigation during the critical crop growth periods is also effective in alleviating water stress and further improving crop yields bhattarai et al 2015 li et al 2018 rady et al 2021 recently the ridge furrow mulching and supplemental irrigation as efficient water use technologies have been widely used in semi arid and semi humid but drought prone areas with seasonally scarce water resources xu et al 2020 plant density also plays an important role in crop growth and development influencing individual size and biomass distributions van kleunen et al 2001 luo et al 2020 moghimi et al 2022 the nutritional organs of crops are more competitive for biomass at higher plant densities while the reproductive organs are more competitive for biomass at lower plant densities weiner 2004 traditional high yielding winter wheat cultivation methods rely on early sowing and high fertilizer and water inputs at low sowing densities to promote monocot development liu et al 2016 gao et al 2021 however low plant densities have a small population base for crops and cannot achieve high yields studies have shown that higher plant densities increase intra species competition between crops leading to higher plant mortality and uncoordinated yield components westoby 1984 tokatlidis 2014 zhu et al 2021 therefore under rainfed or limited irrigation conditions choosing a suitable plant density and building a good crop group structure can help improve crop yield and resource use efficiency and promote the sustainable agricultural development in semi arid and semi humid but drought prone areas leaf photosynthesis is the primary driver of dry matter distribution and organ formation which is the basis of plant production and the major determinant of crop yield composition zlatev and lidon 2012 wang et al 2016 leaf photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence are highly sensitive to water and temperature stresses zivcak et al 2013 improving soil moisture conditions significantly increased photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence and grain yield of winter wheat yang et al 2000 zadražnik et al 2013 the ridge furrow mulching and supplementary irrigation were found to significantly increase the electron transfer rate etr maximal psii quantum yield fv fm and effective psii quantum yield φpsii ali et al 2018b liao et al 2022a in addition to the effect of water stress on photosynthetic fluorescence processes water stress affects the photosynthetic pigment content of crops which in turn directly affects photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters richards et al 2019 although the photosynthetic pigment content of crops decreased and the net photosynthetic rate per plant reduced at higher plant densities canopy light interception was significantly increased liu et al 2016 consequently higher plant densities can increase the photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency of the population within a certain range although the single effect of supplemental irrigation and plant density on growth photosynthesis and grain yield of winter wheat has been well studied their interaction effects especially under ridge furrow mulching are still poorly understood we hypothesized that supplemental irrigation and modified plant density could improve the photosynthesis grain yield and water productivity of winter wheat under ridge furrow mulching these objectives of this study were thus to 1 explore the interaction effects of supplemental irrigation and plant density on soil water content swc leaf area index lai aboveground biomass relative chlorophyll content spad value photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and grain yield of winter wheat under ridge furrow mulching and traditional plat plant conditions and 2 explore the optimal combination of supplemental irrigation and plant density for high winter wheat production this study can provide guidance for improving the grain yield and water productivity of winter wheat in semi arid and semi humid but drought prone areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description

oven at 105 c for 8 h to calculate gravimetric soil water content the volumetric soil water content was computed by multiplying gravimetric soil water content by dry bulk density 2 3 2 leaf area index and aboveground biomass the lai 2200c canopy analyzer li cor inc usa was used to measure lai of winter wheat which utilizes the fisheye optical sensor for measuring the transmitted light at five angles above and below wheat canopy and applies the radiation transfer models for lai calculation in each growth period five lai values were obtained in each plot by five point sampling method and the mean was used as the lai of each treatment twenty plant samples were randomly selected in each plot to determine the aboveground biomass at the seeding jointing heading flowering grain filling and

each plot for each leaf five spad values were obtained by the chlorophyll meter and the mean was calculated as the leaf spad value due to the uneven distributions of chlorophyll content in leaves various leaves were selected for the spad value measurements in each subplot including the above of the leaf the middle of the leaf and the below of the leaf by placing the sensor in direct contact with the plant 2 3 4 net photosynthetic rate the net photosynthetic rate pn of flag leaves of winter wheat at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages was measured by the li 6800 portable

0 150 cm soil layer was determined at various growth stages figs 3 and 4 there was no considerable difference in swc among the treatments for surface and deep soils but significant differences in swc existed in the 60 120 cm soil layer among different treatments at the jointing and grain filling stages the swc decreased as the depth increased under both r and f however the opposite trend was observed at the maturity stage compared with f r considerably enhanced the swc at various plant densities and supplemental irrigation amounts during the two seasons the initial swc did not show statistically significant difference among different treatments 3 2 leaf area index and aboveground biomass the lai showed a trend of rapid increase and then slow increase and finally decrease in different treatments over the two growing seasons fig 5 the lai peaked at the flowering stage during 2020 2021 while it peaked at the heading stage during 2021 2022 the maximum aboveground occurred at the maturity stage fig 6 and fig 7 compared with f r increased laimax by 4 8 and aboveground biomass per plant by 9 2 compared with i0 i60 increased laimax by 4 6 and aboveground biomass per plant by 6 7 the lai under d3 was significantly higher than that under d1 by 20 5 and d2 by 11 3 the d2 and d3 increased population aboveground biomass by 39 3 and 70 7 compared with d1 but d2 and d3 decreased aboveground biomass per plant by 7 8 and 14 9 compared with d1 3 3 spad value different cultivation patterns plant densities and supplemental irrigation amounts exhibited significant impact p 0 01 on the spad value over the two growing seasons the most significant interaction effect of the two factors occurred between plant pattern and plant density f d the three factor interaction f i d was most significant at maturity p 0 001 table 1 shows the spad measurements of winter wheat flag leaf by the chlorophyll meter in various treatments during the growing seasons of 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 the spad value showed an increasing and then decreasing trend at the heading and maturity stages the spad value was significantly improved by the interaction effect of cultivation pattern and supplemental irrigation amount the r cultivation pattern and supplemental irrigation i60 increased the spad values of winter wheat flag leaves by 5 0 and 6 4 respectively in contrast spad values showed a negative correlation with plant density the spad value of d3 was 11 2 and 2 4 lower compared to that at d1 during the two growing seasons respectively the differences in spad values between treatments were most significant at maturity increased by 17 6 and 6 3 during 2020 2021 and by 13 4 and 30 2 during 2021 2022 respectively 3 4 net photosynthetic rate the pn of winter wheat increased significantly by supplementary irrigation and decreased significantly with the increase of plant density under r and f at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages fig 8 during 2020 2021 the pn increased at the jointing and flowering stages and decreased at the flowering and filling stages however during 2021 2022 the pn decreased slowly from the jointing to filling stages compared to f r improved the pn by 23 7 and 15 9 during 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively compared to i0 i60 improved the pn by 10 7 and 12 7 during 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively the pn of single winter wheat flag leaf decreased with the increase of plant density under the same cultivation pattern and supplemental irrigation conditions however the pn of d2 was significantly greater than that of d3 at the flowering stage during 2021 2022 3 5 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters table 2 and table 3 show the values of fv fm fv fo φpsii and exc of winter wheat at the heading filling and maturity stages and the interaction effects of the three factors the fv fm fv fo φpsii of winter wheat significantly decreased with the increase of plant density at the heading filling and maturity stages under both cultivation patterns and reached their maximum at the filling stage during 2020 2021 and at the heading stage during 2021 2022 compared to f r increased the fv fm fv fo φpsii by 5 2 4 1 and 12 2 respectively compared to i0 i60 increased the fv fm fv fo φpsii by 2 4 1 5 and 9 5 respectively however as plant density increased these values decreased by 0 1 4 9 0 5 15 0 and 2 1 19 1 respectively the difference was not the case with exc which reduced under both r and supplemental irrigation conditions no significant difference in exc existed between the two cultivation patterns at the heading and maturity stages during 2020 2021 3 6 grain yield evapotranspiration and water productivity the single factor showed significant effects p 0 05 on gy et and wp of winter wheat and ranked as d p i except for the non significant effect of supplemental irrigation on wp during 2021 2022 table 4 the interaction effects of p i and p i d on et were not significant the et of winter wheat varied significantly between treatments but the trends were similar in both seasons the r increased soil water and decreased soil evaporation compared to f the et increased significantly with increasing plant density compared with d1 d2 and d3 improved et by 4 5 and 10 1 respectively the gy and wp significantly improved by the interaction effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density in the two seasons table 4 under the same supplemental irrigation r reached the maximum yield at d2 while f reached the maximum at d3 the r and i60 significantly increased gy and wp by 10 4 and 11 8 13 5 and 7 7 at the same plant density respectively compared with d1 d2 improved gy and wp by 9 1 and 4 4 respectively under r d3 reduced gy and wp by 7 2 and 13 5 compared to d2 while it increased them by 6 1 and 1 9 under f respectively compared those during 2020 2021 the gy et and wp during 2021 2022 increased by 25 5 6 9 and 17 6 respectively 3 7 principal component analysis in order to comprehensively evaluate the relationships between planting pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on growth photosynthesis yield and water productivity of winter wheat the data obtained from each treatment were averaged and subjected to the principal component analysis pca fig 9 the variability of the data for the two principal components pc1 and pc2 with eigenvalues greater than 1 was 90 0 and 93 3 for 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively during 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 lai agb aboveground biomass pn gy grain yield and wp were positively correlated with pc1 pn gy and wp were positively correlated with pc1 lai and agb were negatively correlated with pc2 by combining the principal component scores it was found that ri60d2 had the highest score during both 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on soil water content in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china and around the world where annual rainfall is far less than evaporation water is a major factor limiting crop yields mulching the soil surface with plastic film can restrict the water exchange between the air and soil fang et al 2022 and thus decrease water evaporation from the soil mulching on the ridge increases the efficiency of water collection and thus improves soil moisture conditions and finally enhances crop growth and yields gu et al 2021 in our study when plant density and supplemental irrigation were the same swc was significantly greater under r than f which agreed with the findings of liu et al 2009 and fang et al 2022 meanwhile supplemental irrigation can directly and significantly increase swc especially in the top layer of the soil it has been suggested that increasing plant density can appropriately reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground thereby reducing the evaporation of water from the ground in the field feng et al 2016 fang et al 2021 however as plant density increased plants need to absorb more water to grow thereby reducing the swc in our study the average swc in the 0 150 cm soil layer at the end of winter wheat was found to be significantly lower under d3 than that under d1 this was due to the group competition of crops which promoted the use of soil water previous studies have shown that high plant density reduced water loss low density consumed less water and medium density reduced soil evaporation losses and total water consumption jia et al 2018 4 2 effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on lai and aboveground biomass after sowing mulching not only retained water but also increased the soil temperature and promoted the emergence of winter wheat and provided greater advantages for later growth mo et al 2017 liu et al 2014 and daryanto et al 2017 showed that the ridge furrow planting with film mulch system promoted crop growth and increase yields the uneven rainfall distribution often occurs over the winter wheat growing seasons with less rainfall at the overwinter greening and jointing stages in the semi arid and semi humid but drought prone regions of northwest china the shortage of soil water occurs mainly at these stages in these regions which has a negative impact on winter wheat growth therefore appropriate supplemental irrigation during these critical growth periods can improve water productivity promote wheat growth and development and ultimately increase grain yield meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 moradi et al 2022 in the study r and supplemental irrigation increased lai and aboveground biomass of winter wheat by 4 0 4 8 which was generally consistent with previous studies plant density greatly affects the wheat population structure and yield formation appropriate plant density can reduce the competition between population and individual and help build a rational population structure zhang et al 1999 ma et al 2018 studies have shown that high plant density increased crop stress and affected crop growth and yields testa et al 2016 costabr et al 2013 showed that at higher plant density the leaf area and dry matter mass of individual wheat plants were smaller than those at lower plant density but the population indicators became larger this was generally consistent with our findings fig 5 the group effect was significantly greater under r than f pavlovic et al 2010 zheng et al 2020 4 3 effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on leaf physiology the swc greatly affects the photosynthetic characteristics and spad value of crops in semi arid regions dong et al 2019 water scarcity and irregular precipitation distribution have limited crop productivity as a result of poorer photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence resulting in significant water stress at the critical growth stages of winter wheat baker and rosenqvist 2004 wang et al 2009 du et al 2022 however under insufficient soil moisture and high temperature conditions stress led to stomatal closure resulting in reduced co2 diffusion and lower intercellular co2 concentration thereby reducing the pn of the crop richards 2000 the results of this study indicated that r and i60 increased spad values and consequently pn fv fm fv fo and φpsii the positive response of wheat psii photochemical characteristics to water stress provided useful information about psii photochemistry and photosynthetic metabolism under water stressed conditions tahi et al 2007 thus under better moisture conditions fv fm fv fo and φpsii were significantly greater compared with those under f and i0 which agreed with previous studies osorio et al 1998 wang et al 2017 earlier studies reported that the exc value increased under water stressed conditions probably due to the down regulation of photochemistry and blockage of dark reactions resulting in decreased photosynthesis rate lu et al 2002 elazab et al 2016 the two season trial found that the f system and i0 increased the exc by 13 7 and 12 3 respectively indicating severe photoinhibition caused by water stress plant density affects the degree of competitiveness of the plant s light resources lauer and simmons 2022 the spad value of a single leaf decreased with increasing plant density liao et al 2022a which was consistent with our study on the one hand high plant density caused the competition between crop roots for soil water and nutrients resulting in a larger lai for individual wheat plants at low plant density jahanzad et al 2013 gao et al 2021 on the other hand it is the poor light transmission in the field of the high density treated population and the intense competition between individuals and ultimately the insufficient use of light energy resulting in a waste of light resources katsura et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 in our study fv fm fv fo and φpsii reached their maximum at d1 under the same planting pattern and supplemental irrigation conditions however under the same planting pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density had no significant effect on the exc most of the exc values at d3 in this study were smaller than those at d2 probably because increasing the plant density reduced the photosynthetic pigment content and increased the quantum efficiency and electron transfer rate of psii thereby reducing the exc wu et al 2014 gu et al 2017 zhong et al 2017 4 4 effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on grain yield evapotranspiration and water productivity mulched ridges improved soil moisture and nutrient status in comparison to non mulched ridges oweis and hachum 2006 ali et al 2018b the plastic film cover improved the water harvesting efficiency of the rainwater collecting system increased soil moisture over the winter wheat growing seasons improved soil moisture supply conditions during the reproductive period and reduced et and improved wp zhang et al 2005 ali et al 2018a dong et al 2019 the results of this study indicated that r and i60 improved gy and wp which agreed with previous studies lu et al 2021 our findings indicated that gy and wp during 2021 2022 were 25 5 and 17 6 higher than those during 2020 2021 respectively this was because 2020 2021 was a dry season and 2021 2022 was a wet season according to the drought index guo et al 2010 the gy and wp of d2 were greatest under r and the gy and wp of d3 were greatest under f when the supplemental irrigation was i60 this may be due to the fact that at the high densities under r the presence of the mulching ridges compressed the plant area of the wheat plants in our experimental treatment r had a 40 cm wide monopoly but the number of seeds per unit area remained the same which actually caused a higher plant number by 25 in each row compared to f due to the decreased row number resulting from the existence of 40 cm wide ridge under r this increased the conflict between individual crops affecting the ventilation and light penetration capacity of the group which in turn reduced the yield whaley et al 2000 sun et al 2019 previous research has indicated that high plant density increased winter wheat population size increased the competition between individual plants and the assimilate acquisition significantly reduced compared to that under low density conditions luo et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 in the present study the number of spikes per unit area of wheat significantly increased at d3 but the number of grains per spike and the thousand grain weight reduced this trend was consistent with the results of previous studies peralta et al 2015 hamnér et al 2017 our study indicated that ridge furrow mulching combined with supplemental irrigation and modified plant density improved wheat leaf photosynthetic efficiency chlorophyll fluorescence parameters grain yield and finally water productivity 5 conclusions a two season experiment was performed to investigate the interaction effects of supplemental irrigation and plant density on the growth photosynthesis grain yield and water productivity of winter wheat under ridge furrow planting and traditional flat planting in a semi humid but drought prone area in northwest china it was found that cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density had significant influences on the indicators above r and i60 significantly increased lai aboveground biomass spad value net photosynthetic rate maximal psii quantum yield fv fm energy transformation potential activities of psii fv fo effective psii quantum yield φpsii grain yield and wp while they reduced the relative energy excess at the psii level increasing plant density generally improved lai aboveground biomass but it reduced spad value pn and fluorescence parameters grain yield and wp reached their maximum values at d2 under r and at d3 under f the greatest grain yield and wp were obtained under ri60d2 these results suggest that ridge furrow mulching combined with supplemental irrigation and modified plant density is suitable for the winter wheat production in the semi humid but drought prone areas of northwest china however the effects of other plant densities irrigation amounts and irrigation times on winter wheat production need to be further investigated declaration of competing interest the authors

and fluorescence parameters grain yield and wp reached their maximum values at d2 under r and at d3 under f which was because r had a higher plant number by 25 in each row at d3 compared to f due to the decreased row number resulting from the existence of 40 cm wide ridge under r the greatest grain yield 7383 5 kg ha 1 and 8577 4 kg ha 1 and wp 20 03 kg ha 1 mm 1 and 21 77 kg ha 1 mm 1 were

individual size and biomass distributions van kleunen et al 2001 luo et al 2020 moghimi et al 2022 the nutritional organs of crops are more competitive for biomass at higher plant densities while the reproductive organs are more competitive for biomass at lower plant densities weiner 2004 traditional high yielding winter wheat cultivation methods rely on early sowing and high fertilizer and water inputs at low sowing densities to promote monocot development liu et al 2016 gao et al 2021 however low plant densities have a small population base for crops and cannot achieve high yields studies have shown that higher plant densities increase intra species competition between crops leading to higher plant mortality and uncoordinated yield components westoby 1984 tokatlidis 2014 zhu et al 2021 therefore under rainfed or limited irrigation conditions choosing a suitable plant density and building a good crop group structure can help improve crop yield and resource use efficiency and promote the sustainable agricultural development in semi arid and semi humid but drought prone areas leaf photosynthesis is the primary driver of dry matter distribution and organ formation which is the basis of plant production and the major determinant of crop yield composition zlatev and lidon 2012 wang et al 2016 leaf photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence are highly sensitive to water and temperature stresses zivcak et al 2013 improving soil moisture conditions significantly increased photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence and grain yield of winter wheat yang et al 2000 zadražnik et al 2013 the ridge furrow mulching and supplementary irrigation were found to significantly increase the electron transfer rate etr maximal psii quantum yield fv fm and effective psii quantum yield φpsii ali et al 2018b liao et al 2022a in addition to the effect of water stress on photosynthetic fluorescence processes water stress affects the photosynthetic pigment content of crops which in turn directly affects photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters richards et al 2019 although the photosynthetic pigment content of crops decreased and the net photosynthetic rate per plant reduced at higher plant densities canopy light interception was significantly increased liu et al 2016 consequently higher plant densities can increase the photosynthetic rate and chlorophyll fluorescence efficiency of the population within a certain range although the single effect of supplemental irrigation and plant density on growth photosynthesis and grain yield of winter wheat has been well studied their interaction effects especially under ridge furrow mulching are still poorly understood we hypothesized that supplemental irrigation and modified plant density could improve the photosynthesis grain yield and water productivity of winter wheat under ridge furrow mulching these objectives of this study were thus to 1 explore the interaction effects of supplemental irrigation and plant density on soil water content swc leaf area index lai aboveground biomass relative chlorophyll content spad value photosynthesis chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and grain yield of winter wheat under ridge furrow mulching and traditional plat plant conditions and 2 explore the optimal combination of supplemental irrigation and plant density for high winter wheat production this study can provide guidance for improving the grain yield and water productivity of winter wheat in semi arid and semi humid but drought prone areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description

angles above and below wheat canopy and applies the radiation transfer models for lai calculation in each growth period five lai values were obtained in each plot by five point sampling method and the mean was used as the lai of each treatment twenty plant samples were randomly selected in each plot to determine the aboveground biomass at the seeding jointing heading flowering grain filling and maturity stages wheat samples were dried in the oven at 105 c for 30 min and then at 80 c until constant weight 2 3 3 relative chlorophyll content the chlorophyll meter spad 502 plus konica minolta optics inc japan was applied for measuring relative chlorophyll content spad value at the heading flowering and grain filling stages of winter wheat five wheat flag leaves were used for measurement in each plot for each leaf five spad values were obtained by the chlorophyll meter and the mean was calculated as the leaf spad value due to the uneven distributions of chlorophyll content in leaves various leaves were selected for the spad value measurements in each subplot including the above of the leaf the middle of the leaf and the below of the leaf by placing the sensor in direct contact with the plant 2 3 4 net photosynthetic rate the net photosynthetic rate pn of flag leaves of winter wheat at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages was measured by the li 6800 portable

usa the principal component analysis was also carried out using the origin2021 software 3 results 3 1 soil water content for the two winter wheat growing seasons 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 the swc in the 0 150 cm soil layer was determined at various growth stages figs 3 and 4 there was no considerable difference in swc among the treatments for surface and deep soils but significant differences in swc existed in the 60 120 cm soil layer among different treatments at the jointing and grain filling stages the swc decreased as the depth increased under both r and f however the opposite trend was observed at the maturity stage compared with f r considerably enhanced the swc at various plant densities and supplemental irrigation amounts during the two seasons the initial swc did not show statistically significant difference among different treatments 3 2 leaf area index and aboveground biomass the lai showed a trend of rapid increase and then slow increase and finally decrease in different treatments over the two growing seasons fig 5 the lai peaked at the flowering stage during 2020 2021 while it peaked at the heading stage during 2021 2022 the maximum aboveground occurred at the maturity stage fig 6 and fig 7 compared with f r increased laimax by 4 8 and aboveground biomass per plant by 9 2 compared with i0 i60 increased laimax by 4 6 and aboveground biomass per plant by 6 7 the lai under d3 was significantly higher than that under d1 by 20 5 and d2 by 11 3 the d2 and d3 increased population aboveground biomass by 39 3 and 70 7 compared with d1 but d2 and d3 decreased aboveground biomass per plant by 7 8 and 14 9 compared with d1 3 3 spad value different cultivation patterns plant densities and supplemental irrigation amounts exhibited significant impact p 0 01 on the spad value over the two growing seasons the most significant interaction effect of the two factors occurred between plant pattern and plant density f d the three factor interaction f i d was most significant at maturity p 0 001 table 1 shows the spad measurements of winter wheat flag leaf by the chlorophyll meter in various treatments during the growing seasons of 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 the spad value showed an increasing and then decreasing trend at the heading and maturity stages the spad value was significantly improved by the interaction effect of cultivation pattern and supplemental irrigation amount the r cultivation pattern and supplemental irrigation i60 increased the spad values of winter wheat flag leaves by 5 0 and 6 4 respectively in contrast spad values showed a negative correlation with plant density the spad value of d3 was 11 2 and 2 4 lower compared to that at d1 during the two growing seasons respectively the differences in spad values between treatments were most significant at maturity increased by 17 6 and 6 3 during 2020 2021 and by 13 4 and 30 2 during 2021 2022 respectively 3 4 net photosynthetic rate the pn of winter wheat increased significantly by supplementary irrigation and decreased significantly with the increase of plant density under r and f at the jointing flowering and grain filling stages fig 8 during 2020 2021 the pn increased at the jointing and flowering stages and decreased at the flowering and filling stages however during 2021 2022 the pn decreased slowly from the jointing to filling stages compared to f r improved the pn by 23 7 and 15 9 during 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively compared to i0 i60 improved the pn by 10 7 and 12 7 during 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively the pn of single winter wheat flag leaf decreased with the increase of plant density under the same cultivation pattern and supplemental irrigation conditions however the pn of d2 was significantly greater than that of d3 at the flowering stage during 2021 2022 3 5 chlorophyll fluorescence parameters table 2 and table 3 show the values of fv fm fv fo φpsii and exc of winter wheat at the heading filling and maturity stages and the interaction effects of the three factors the fv fm fv fo φpsii of winter wheat significantly decreased with the increase of plant density at the heading filling and maturity stages under both cultivation patterns and reached their maximum at the filling stage during 2020 2021 and at the heading stage during 2021 2022 compared to f r increased the fv fm fv fo φpsii by 5 2 4 1 and 12 2 respectively compared to i0 i60 increased the fv fm fv fo φpsii by 2 4 1 5 and 9 5 respectively however as plant density increased these values decreased by 0 1 4 9 0 5 15 0 and 2 1 19 1 respectively the difference was not the case with exc which reduced under both r and supplemental irrigation conditions no significant difference in exc existed between the two cultivation patterns at the heading and maturity stages during 2020 2021 3 6 grain yield evapotranspiration and water productivity the single factor showed significant effects p 0 05 on gy et and wp of winter wheat and ranked as d p i except for the non significant effect of supplemental irrigation on wp during 2021 2022 table 4 the interaction effects of p i and p i d on et were not significant the et of winter wheat varied significantly between treatments but the trends were similar in both seasons the r increased soil water and decreased soil evaporation compared to f the et increased significantly with increasing plant density compared with d1 d2 and d3 improved et by 4 5 and 10 1 respectively the gy and wp significantly improved by the interaction effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density in the two seasons table 4 under the same supplemental irrigation r reached the maximum yield at d2 while f reached the maximum at d3 the r and i60 significantly increased gy and wp by 10 4 and 11 8 13 5 and 7 7 at the same plant density respectively compared with d1 d2 improved gy and wp by 9 1 and 4 4 respectively under r d3 reduced gy and wp by 7 2 and 13 5 compared to d2 while it increased them by 6 1 and 1 9 under f respectively compared those during 2020 2021 the gy et and wp during 2021 2022 increased by 25 5 6 9 and 17 6 respectively 3 7 principal component analysis in order to comprehensively evaluate the relationships between planting pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on growth photosynthesis yield and water productivity of winter wheat the data obtained from each treatment were averaged and subjected to the principal component analysis pca fig 9 the variability of the data for the two principal components pc1 and pc2 with eigenvalues greater than 1 was 90 0 and 93 3 for 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 respectively during 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 lai agb aboveground biomass pn gy grain yield and wp were positively correlated with pc1 pn gy and wp were positively correlated with pc1 lai and agb were negatively correlated with pc2 by combining the principal component scores it was found that ri60d2 had the highest score during both 2020 2021 and 2021 2022 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on soil water content in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china and around the world where annual rainfall is far less than evaporation water is a major factor limiting crop yields mulching the soil surface with plastic film can restrict the water exchange between the air and soil fang et al 2022 and thus decrease water evaporation from the soil mulching on the ridge increases the efficiency of water collection and thus improves soil moisture conditions and finally enhances crop growth and yields gu et al 2021 in our study when plant density and supplemental irrigation were the same swc was significantly greater under r than f which agreed with the findings of liu et al 2009 and fang et al 2022 meanwhile supplemental irrigation can directly and significantly increase swc especially in the top layer of the soil it has been suggested that increasing plant density can appropriately reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground thereby reducing the evaporation of water from the ground in the field feng et al 2016 fang et al 2021 however as plant density increased plants need to absorb more water to grow thereby reducing the swc in our study the average swc in the 0 150 cm soil layer at the end of winter wheat was found to be significantly lower under d3 than that under d1 this was due to the group competition of crops which promoted the use of soil water previous studies have shown that high plant density reduced water loss low density consumed less water and medium density reduced soil evaporation losses and total water consumption jia et al 2018 4 2 effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on lai and aboveground biomass after sowing mulching not only retained water but also increased the soil temperature and promoted the emergence of winter wheat and provided greater advantages for later growth mo et al 2017 liu et al 2014 and daryanto et al 2017 showed that the ridge furrow planting with film mulch system promoted crop growth and increase yields the uneven rainfall distribution often occurs over the winter wheat growing seasons with less rainfall at the overwinter greening and jointing stages in the semi arid and semi humid but drought prone regions of northwest china the shortage of soil water occurs mainly at these stages in these regions which has a negative impact on winter wheat growth therefore appropriate supplemental irrigation during these critical growth periods can improve water productivity promote wheat growth and development and ultimately increase grain yield meng et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 moradi et al 2022 in the study r and supplemental irrigation increased lai and aboveground biomass of winter wheat by 4 0 4 8 which was generally consistent with previous studies plant density greatly affects the wheat population structure and yield formation appropriate plant density can reduce the competition between population and individual and help build a rational population structure zhang et al 1999 ma et al 2018 studies have shown that high plant density increased crop stress and affected crop growth and yields testa et al 2016 costabr et al 2013 showed that at higher plant density the leaf area and dry matter mass of individual wheat plants were smaller than those at lower plant density but the population indicators became larger this was generally consistent with our findings fig 5 the group effect was significantly greater under r than f pavlovic et al 2010 zheng et al 2020 4 3 effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on leaf physiology the swc greatly affects the photosynthetic characteristics and spad value of crops in semi arid regions dong et al 2019 water scarcity and irregular precipitation distribution have limited crop productivity as a result of poorer photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence resulting in significant water stress at the critical growth stages of winter wheat baker and rosenqvist 2004 wang et al 2009 du et al 2022 however under insufficient soil moisture and high temperature conditions stress led to stomatal closure resulting in reduced co2 diffusion and lower intercellular co2 concentration thereby reducing the pn of the crop richards 2000 the results of this study indicated that r and i60 increased spad values and consequently pn fv fm fv fo and φpsii the positive response of wheat psii photochemical characteristics to water stress provided useful information about psii photochemistry and photosynthetic metabolism under water stressed conditions tahi et al 2007 thus under better moisture conditions fv fm fv fo and φpsii were significantly greater compared with those under f and i0 which agreed with previous studies osorio et al 1998 wang et al 2017 earlier studies reported that the exc value increased under water stressed conditions probably due to the down regulation of photochemistry and blockage of dark reactions resulting in decreased photosynthesis rate lu et al 2002 elazab et al 2016 the two season trial found that the f system and i0 increased the exc by 13 7 and 12 3 respectively indicating severe photoinhibition caused by water stress plant density affects the degree of competitiveness of the plant s light resources lauer and simmons 2022 the spad value of a single leaf decreased with increasing plant density liao et al 2022a which was consistent with our study on the one hand high plant density caused the competition between crop roots for soil water and nutrients resulting in a larger lai for individual wheat plants at low plant density jahanzad et al 2013 gao et al 2021 on the other hand it is the poor light transmission in the field of the high density treated population and the intense competition between individuals and ultimately the insufficient use of light energy resulting in a waste of light resources katsura et al 2007 zhang et al 2009 in our study fv fm fv fo and φpsii reached their maximum at d1 under the same planting pattern and supplemental irrigation conditions however under the same planting pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density had no significant effect on the exc most of the exc values at d3 in this study were smaller than those at d2 probably because increasing the plant density reduced the photosynthetic pigment content and increased the quantum efficiency and electron transfer rate of psii thereby reducing the exc wu et al 2014 gu et al 2017 zhong et al 2017 4 4 effects of cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density on grain yield evapotranspiration and water productivity mulched ridges improved soil moisture and nutrient status in comparison to non mulched ridges oweis and hachum 2006 ali et al 2018b the plastic film cover improved the water harvesting efficiency of the rainwater collecting system increased soil moisture over the winter wheat growing seasons improved soil moisture supply conditions during the reproductive period and reduced et and improved wp zhang et al 2005 ali et al 2018a dong et al 2019 the results of this study indicated that r and i60 improved gy and wp which agreed with previous studies lu et al 2021 our findings indicated that gy and wp during 2021 2022 were 25 5 and 17 6 higher than those during 2020 2021 respectively this was because 2020 2021 was a dry season and 2021 2022 was a wet season according to the drought index guo et al 2010 the gy and wp of d2 were greatest under r and the gy and wp of d3 were greatest under f when the supplemental irrigation was i60 this may be due to the fact that at the high densities under r the presence of the mulching ridges compressed the plant area of the wheat plants in our experimental treatment r had a 40 cm wide monopoly but the number of seeds per unit area remained the same which actually caused a higher plant number by 25 in each row compared to f due to the decreased row number resulting from the existence of 40 cm wide ridge under r this increased the conflict between individual crops affecting the ventilation and light penetration capacity of the group which in turn reduced the yield whaley et al 2000 sun et al 2019 previous research has indicated that high plant density increased winter wheat population size increased the competition between individual plants and the assimilate acquisition significantly reduced compared to that under low density conditions luo et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 in the present study the number of spikes per unit area of wheat significantly increased at d3 but the number of grains per spike and the thousand grain weight reduced this trend was consistent with the results of previous studies peralta et al 2015 hamnér et al 2017 our study indicated that ridge furrow mulching combined with supplemental irrigation and modified plant density improved wheat leaf photosynthetic efficiency chlorophyll fluorescence parameters grain yield and finally water productivity 5 conclusions a two season experiment was performed to investigate the interaction effects of supplemental irrigation and plant density on the growth photosynthesis grain yield and water productivity of winter wheat under ridge furrow planting and traditional flat planting in a semi humid but drought prone area in northwest china it was found that cultivation pattern supplemental irrigation and plant density had significant influences on the indicators above r and i60 significantly increased lai aboveground biomass spad value net photosynthetic rate maximal psii quantum yield fv fm energy transformation potential activities of psii fv fo effective psii quantum yield φpsii grain yield and wp while they reduced the relative energy excess at the psii level increasing plant density generally improved lai aboveground biomass but it reduced spad value pn and fluorescence parameters grain yield and wp reached their maximum values at d2 under r and at d3 under f the greatest grain yield and wp were obtained under ri60d2 these results suggest that ridge furrow mulching combined with supplemental irrigation and modified plant density is suitable for the winter wheat production in the semi humid but drought prone areas of northwest china however the effects of other plant densities irrigation amounts and irrigation times on winter wheat production need to be further investigated declaration of competing interest the authors

9277,the establishment of growth stage specific irrigation scheduling is considered critically important for achieving higher cotton gossypium hirsutum l productivity in north western india in the study region farmers prefer pre sowing irrigation psi with canal water because underground water has poor quality due to presence of high concentration of soluble salts however non availability of canal water at cotton sowing period often delays its sowing and eventually impacts cotton productivity with significant effect on crop phenology therefore we investigated the effect of irrigation scheduling based on depth of psi and subsequent post sowing first irrigation psfi on crop phenology growth attributes and water productivity of cotton at different dates of sowing dos which are representative of actual sowing window in the study region more specifically this study evaluated the performance of psi depths viz 75 and 120 mm psi75 and psi120 and dos viz april 30th and may 30th combinations in main plots and psfi treatments i e 21 42 dos psfi21 psfi28 psfi35 and psfi42 in the subplots these results revealed that psi120 significantly p 0 05 increased the seed cotton yield by

the psi120 treatment significantly improved the lint yield and ginning outturn got compared with psi75 the number of monopods sympods bolls m 2 and boll weight were significantly higher at psfi28

important non food commercial cash crop having high significance in agricultural and industrial economy because it ranks first as a commodity of global agricultural trade barwale et al 2004 agbenyegah 2012 singh et al 2021a india had the largest area of 13 4 million ha mha under cotton production followed by u s a china and pakistan aiccip 2020 and comprise 30 of global cultivated area with nearly

sharma et al 2020 singh et al 2021a kumar et al 2021b besides these sustainability issues the traditional cotton growing region of north western india has a major problem of poor quality irrigation water 40 of the underground waters are either saline or sodic nonetheless underground water which has been the major source of irrigation water in north western india is declining in 80 of cultivated area at an alarming rate of 40 cm year 1 while in some pockets the situation is even worrisome with decline rate of more than 90 cm year 1 hira et al 2004 bhatt et al 2021 the results of modelling approach underpin that due to significant increases in mean air temperatures length and frequency and intensity of extreme events cotton based agroecosystem would become hotspot for severe water stress in future kloesel et al 2018 in north western india farmers of cotton growing region are highly dependent upon canal water availability particularly for pre sowing irrigation psi singh et al 2021a the proper timing of irrigation is considered critical determinant for cotton productivity feike et al 2017 mitchell mccallister et al 2020 based on survey of more than two hundred cotton growers facing water scarcity feike et al 2017 reported that large differences in cotton productivity and water use efficiency were ascribed to the regions where both cotton yields and water productivity were at low levels such differences to a large scale are ascribed to poor knowledge of cotton growers regarding irrigation water use in cotton cultivation kang et al 2012 singh et al 2021a besides inappropriate irrigation schedules for cotton li et al 2013 wang et al 2019a therefore to sustain cotton productivity irrigation can be strategically applied at critical cotton growth stages to optimize water availability schaefer et al 2018 himanshu et al 2019 the untimely and non availability of canal water availability especially during the sowing mid april to mid may as well as during post sowing first irrigation psfi in june often leads to either delayed crop sowing and or pressurize farmers to apply psi with poor quality saline underground water jalota et al 2008 although cotton is more tolerant of salinity than the other crops feike et al 2017 dilnur et al 2019 yet salinity can reduce seed cotton yield by 8 40 fowler 1986 corwin et al 2003 the negative impacts of soil salinity are intensified with increased nutrient imbalance in soils which reduces the cotton yield and water productivity wang et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 the delay in irrigation can result in yield loss equivalent to 62 300 us ha 1 vories et al 2003 seed cotton yield is reported to decrease by 0 34 mg ha 1 for each additional hour of stress time on days with water stress during the irrigation period wanjura et al 2006 application of heavy psi has been the potential strategy for water management in cotton production to store moisture in the soil profile and to bank water for the crop during the water stress period mahan et al 2012 the application of heavy psi ensures efficient use of applied irrigation water ranging between 45 and 70 water loss associated with high winds and temperatures bordovsky and porter 2003 additionally the delay in sowing becomes more susceptible to insect pest and diseases kumar et al 2020 whereas psi with poor quality water led to seedling mortality boumans et al 1988 although cotton crop can outperform under deficit irrigation i e with only 4 5 irrigations through border method with less evapotranspiration requirements jalota et al 2006 and only slightly reduced seed cotton yield under deficit water conditions rao et al 2016 liu et al 2017 yet it requires timely irrigation at critical growth stages pace et al 1999 wang et al 2004 for example water deficit at squaring flowering and boll opening stage could lead to a significant set back on crop productivity because of decrease in leaf water potential number of bolls plant 1 and boll weight aujla et al 2005 jalota et al 2006 it is well established that water deficit at seedling stage enhances the length of tap root to explore the lower layers of soil profile for water need under heavy psi conditions but moisture stress caused by shallow psi and or prevailing hot dry spell for long period could lead to reduced surface area in the upper canopy and shoot growth of cotton crop aujla et al 2005 pace et al 1999 perry et al 2012 water deficit has been reported to affect leaf expansion ball et al 1994 abscission pattern crozat et al 1999 flowering boll formation and its distribution and yield components gerik et al 1996 aujla et al 2005 himanshu et al 2019 also reported that water deficit particularly at germination and seedling emergence stage to squaring stage late bloom and boll opening stage significant affect the seed cotton yield most of the earlier research on water scheduling in cotton remained centred on enhancing water productivity based on evapo transpiration jalota et al 2008 2006 kijne et al 2003 drip irrigation aujla et al 2005 ibragimov et al 2007 basal et al 2009 mulching use of osmo protectants etc for sustaining productivity with limited use of irrigation water arora et al 2011 hasanuzzaman et al 2013 wang et al 2016 singh et al 2018 brar and vashist 2020 these approaches had limited adoption at the farmers fields due to higher input cost of micro irrigation system hindrance in intercultural operation under mulching and osmo protectant are not much effective at all the stages of crop growth etc wang et al 2016 singh et al 2021b nonetheless farmers fields are intensively managed cropland ecosystems with prime focus on crop productivity singh and benbi 2020 2021 because their objectives are to maximize crop yields at minimal risks of crop failure or yield loss saini et al 2010 singh et al 2021b therefore in the frame of multi contemporary challenges related to water scarcity their keen interest is to ensure timely and assured irrigation to crop with good quality canal water it is seen that when the canal water becomes available farmers instead of giving desired heavy psi 120 mm psi120 prefer shallow pre sowing irrigation 75 mm psi75 to ensure timely sowing in their entire area to be kept under cotton such situation becomes worst with mortality of cotton seedling with the increase in temperature and no rain till the start of monsoon period july gill et al 2013 the poor plant stand not only decreases the productivity but also lead to large set back on crop growth brar et al 2020 it is well established that a sufficient level of psi is pre requisite for optimized seedling emergence and establishment in cotton and eventually to crop productivity aujla et al 2005 perry et al 2012 other than shallow psi options to manage limited canal water availability for irrigation crop sowing often gets delayed in entire north western india the delayed cotton sowing alters the phenology morphology and often lead to reduced productivity of cotton crop and more susceptible to insect pest and diseases yang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 shah 2017 bilal et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 brar and singh 2021 a shift in sowing date due to irrigation water scarcity results to expose the crop initial reproductive phase to hot and long days which not only influences the crop phenological development but also enhances the crop sensitivity to moisture stress and ultimately affects the productivity and profitability ur rahman et al 2016 wang et al 2019b besides delayed cotton sowing enhances the problem of insect pest attack boll shedding jatt et al 2007 and drastic drop in seed cotton yield ur rahman et al 2016 besides for psfi farmers prefer canal water availability or rain rather than applying groundwater field experiments in the study region showed that psfi sometime gets delayed up to 6th week after sowing which result in severe seedling mortality especially under light psi conditions buttar et al 2007 jalota et al 2008 brar and singh 2021 such partial drought like situations are the major hurdle in sustaining crop productivity in the entire cotton growing region of north western india the irrigation water amount wang et al 2012 as well as irrigation interval kang et al 2012 are reported to influence cotton yield and water use efficiency although many researchers have demonstrated that mild deficit irrigation at vegetative stages has a negligible effect on seed cotton yield perry et al 2012 rao et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zahoor et al 2017 niu et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 li et al 2021 but water stress at reproductive stage significantly reduces crop productivity iqbal et al 2017 zahoor et al 2017 hu et al 2019 some researchers showed a delay in psfi up to 6 7 weeks is beneficial for cotton while some reported the adverse effects of delayed psfi in terms of reduction in crop yield wrona et al 1996 buttar et al 2007 bordovsky et al 2015 brar and singh 2021 till date limited information is available on the level of psi time of psfi and their relation to date of sowing dos under such water scarcity conditions in north western india uncertainty in productivity of cotton wheat cropping system is ascribed to delayed establishment of both crops singh et al 2019a the delayed sowing of cotton led to delayed wheat sowing which is considered responsible for decreased wheat productivity due to heat high temperature stress at grain filling stage in late sown wheat it has been estimated that in north western india delayed wheat establishment leads to yield loss of 15 60 kg day 1 ha 1 pathak et al 2003 sidhu et al 2007 nonetheless delayed wheat harvesting by mid april causes cotton sowing to start by the end of april therefore has significant impact on the sustainability of the cotton wheat system additionally poor quality underground water due to high concentration of soluble salts in the study region singh et al 2022a 2022b largely requires heavy psi before cotton establishment with good quality canal water earlier research showed that heavy psi with canal water has great significance for enhanced cotton productivity and increased resilience of cotton based ecosystems buttar et al 2007 the heavy psi helps establish strong root system during the early growth phase which favours good crop growth cotton later in the season due to ensured soil moisture availability from the lower layers of soil profile erie et al 1982 hunsaker et al 2015 the adoption of improved irrigation water management practices which ensures high moisture storage in soils has played an important role in achieving water savings due to increased irrigation water productivity for surface irrigated cotton systems across the globe bucks et al 1988 hunsaker et al 1998 pereira et al 2009 darouich et al 2014 singh et al 2022c we hypothesized that heavy psi and subsequent psfi would have variable impact on cotton productivity for crop sown on different dos due to changed crop phenology a larger volume of irrigation water applied as psi would also help to leach the soluble salts out of the root zone and thereby besides enhancing soil moisture storage deep in soil profile heavy psi would push layer of high concentration of soluble salts beyond the root zone to favour optimum plant growth we aimed at quantifying the depth of psi and to optimum appropriate time of psfi to cotton at different sowing dates for increased crop productivity therefore the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of psi depth and psfi on crop phenology and water productivity of cotton sown on april 30th and may 30th the period considered representative of actual sowing window in the study region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field

whole may and first week of june during 2017 while there was 34 mm rainfall on may 30th 2016 is main reason for differential response to the time of psfi soil of the experimental site was loamy sand

significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 and the differences in treatments mean at p 0 05 were considered statistically significant the regression analyses were performed on selected variables using spss for windows 16 0 spss inc chicago u s a since there was an interaction between years x psfi therefore data were not pooled over years the dendrogram that depicts the hierarchical relationships viz single linkage correlation coefficient distance between agronomic attributes of cotton and productivity was developed on pooled data for two study years and irrigation modules to explain the output from hierarchical clustering using minitab 16 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 cotton phenology under different irrigation management modules cotton seedling emergence was advanced under psi120 but was significantly p 0 05 delayed under shallow irrigation psi75 table 1 however other phenophases were significantly advanced under psi75 compared with psi120 treatment due to water stress days taken to initiation of squaring flowering boll development boll opening as well as crop maturity were less under shallow psi75 compared with heavy irrigation psi120 the shortened yield formation phases square initiation to maturity as well as total crop duration was significantly lesser under shallow psi75 fig 3b from initiation of squaring crop under psi75 acquired 128 131 days to reach maturity whereas crop under psi120 appropriated 131 134 days to reach maturity water stress shortened all phenophases whereas well water conditions lengthen all phenophases this was evident from fig 4 which shows that days taken to square initiation had a significant linear positive relationship with days to flowering initiation boll development boll opening and crop maturity with higher values of coefficients of determination r2 of 0 8 0 9 0 7 and 0 8 respectively a linear relationship between growth and total cotton duration to water availability is known rao et al 2016 the reduction in total duration especially the reproductive phases due to water deficit has also been reported by many researchers hasanuzzaman et al 2013 brar and vashist 2020 nagamalla et al 2021 in case of dos all the phenophases viz time taken to seedling emergence initiation of squaring flowering boll development boll opening and crop maturity were shorted when crop was sown on may 30th compared with crop sown on april 30th table 1 these results were supported by the significant positive linear relationship between days taken to square initiation and subsequent phenophases fig 4 due to this yield formation phase squaring to maturity was shortened with delay in sowing fig 3a a significant advancement in all phenophases resulted in early crop maturity by 18 20 days of late sown crop due to prevailing higher temperature during early crop growth stage as compared to timely sown crop these results corroborate earlier research findings highlighting the effect of dos hussain et al 2012 shah 2017 to get optimum weather conditions for growth and development lead to enlarge yield formation phase hussain et al 2012 rahman et al 2018 sankaranarayanan et al 2020 ullah et al 2019 delay in psfi led to a significant advancement in phenophases due to water stress table 1 days taken to initiation of squaring flowering boll development and boll opening were significantly greater under psfi21 as compared to psfi35 and psfi42 in psfi28 time taken to these phenophases did not differ significantly from psfi21 and psfi35 however significantly lower time was taken by these phenophases under psfi42 early application of psfi resulted in no water stress led to a longer period to squaring and other vegetative and reproductive phenophase as well as total crop duration fig 4 the length of yield formation phases was positively related to water expense irrigation water rainfall and increased with an increase in the amount of irrigation water either due to psi or psfi fig 3b crop maturity was also significantly advanced under psfi42 as compared to earlier irrigation times psfi21 and psfi28 during both years the improvement in cotton growth and development under timely irrigation management has been reported earlier perry et al 2012 saseendran et al 2014 these results showed that water stress either due to shallow psi or due to delay of psfi has significant impact on cotton phenological development the results of the present study were supported by brar and vashist 2020 and li et al 2020 who observed crop growth phenophases and total crop duration are linearly related to soil moisture availability 3 2 cotton growth and productivity under different irrigation management modules there was a considerable difference in crop growth development and seed cotton yield over the study years table 2 which was related to the variation in rainfall and other weather parameters figs 1 and 2 the vigorous crop growth was evident by significantly higher plant height number of monopods and sympods per plant under psi120 compared with psi75 single linkage correlation coefficient shows that seed cotton yield and lint yield were closely linked with number of boll per m2 and plant height with similarity index 96 5 followed by sympods per plant and boll weight with a similarity index of 93 fig 5 in psi120 treatment better crop growth in terms of plant height lead to a significantly higher number of bolls per during both the study years and significantly higher boll weight during 2017 the longer reproductive phase better growth and yield attributes resulted in producing significantly higher seed cotton yield under psi120 over psi75 fig 3b d the heavy psi i e psi120 resulted in significantly higher seed cotton yield by 16 8 and 18 7 during 2016 and 2017 respectively over shallow psi75 a significant increase in seed cotton yield with an increase in water expense was evident from a linear positive relationship between water expense yield formation phases and seed cotton yield fig 3b d brar and vashist 2020 also reported that sufficient soil moisture lengthens the yield formation phase which brings to significant improvement in yield attributes as well as crop productivity a better growth parameters of cotton under heavy psi i e psi120 has also been reported earlier rao et al 2016 it has been well established that for surface irrigated system heavy psi i e psi250 to psi350 applied in the fields of u s a help providing deep soil moisture storage up to a depth of 180 cm in soil profile which is considered as maximum root growth and water extraction zone erie et al 1982 soil moisture storage in soil profile from psi permits cotton plants to establish a strong root system particular during the early growth phase in the season which is eventually utilized by the cotton later in the season hunsaker et al 2015 plant height number of monopods and sympods per plant were significantly higher under timely sown crop april 30th than late sown crop table 2 yield attributes like boll per unit area and boll weight were also significantly improved under april 30th sown crop and contributed towards a significant increase in seed cotton yield crop sown on april 30th produced significantly higher seed cotton yield by 87 8 and 97 6 over crop sown on may 30th during 2016 and 2017 respectively conversely the delay in sowing had a negative impact on yield formation phase fig 3a early phenophases of late sown crop till boll development has to face comparatively higher temperature range which shortened the phenophases by early squaring flowering and boll development led to poor productivity of late sown crop fig 4 this phase between flowering and boll development stage is considered key yield determinant period of cotton han and kang 2001 brar and singh 2021 plant height number of boll m 2 and number of sympods plant 1 were closely linked with seed cotton yield with a higher correlation coefficient fig 5 similarly the decrease in biomass production poor growth and yield under late sown cotton has also been reported earlier ferrise et al 2010 cao et al 2011 another reason for lower productivity of late sown cotton is that last flush of boll opening coincided with low temperature and lesser sunshine hours nonetheless few of the fully developed bolls were unable to open and could not be picked led to reduce seed cotton yield than timely sown crop liu et al 2015 hu et al 2017 brar and singh 2021 in case of psfi significantly higher number of mono and and sympods were recorded under psfi28 and psfi21 which were decreased significantly due to delay in irrigation psfi42 table 2 it is known that even a short duration moisture stress occurring during flowering and boll development phase significantly impacts various physiological traits e g leaf expansion and photosynthesis and biochemical changes e g c and n metabolism and antioxidant metabolism in cotton plants ball et al 1994 potikha et al 1999 pettigrew 2001 ennahli and earl 2005 which leads to a reduction in cotton development and final productivity a better yield attributes apparently as higher number of bolls per unit area and heavier boll weight under psfi28 was observed however a significant decline in number of bolls and boll weight under psfi42 during both the years was also observed cotton under psfi28 produced the highest seed cotton yield followed by psfi35 and was significantly higher than psfi21 and psfi42 during 2016 during 2017 the highest seed cotton yield was also recorded under psfi28 followed by psfi35 and psfi21 and were significantly higher than psfi42 it was apparent from linear significant p 0 05 linkage between cotton growth and yield attributes with seed cotton yield fig 5 a different response to psfi over the years was due to variation in weather events especially the rainfall fig 2 no rainfall event occurred during the whole may and first week of june 2017 which was the main reason for such response to early psfi21 during 2017 while due to a rainfall of 34 mm on may 30th 2016 psfi21 had a negative impact on crop productivity which was decreased significantly as compared to psfi28 and psfi35 there was no significant impact of psfi35 on seed cotton yield during both years it could be ascribed to mild water stress during the early growth stages which cause deeper penetration of roots thereby empowering to explore the lower layers of soil profile for moisture and nutrient singh and benbi 2022 which ultimately results to enhance seed cotton yield the plant root characteristics i e geometry and architecture which play a key role in the plant s ability to explore the soil volume for water and nutrients sharp et al 1988 develops an important mechanism for drought resistance and ability to change root physiological and biochemical processes under water stress situations spollen and sharp 1991 however prolonged water stress e g in psfi42 treatment resulted in a significant decline in seed cotton yield cook and el zik 1993 depending upon soil texture and prevailing weather conditions application of psfi at optimum time resulted in 36 increase in seed cotton yield buttar et al 2007 oweis et al 2011 reported that mean seed cotton yield of 2502 kg ha 1 which ranging from 1520 kg ha 1 under 40 irrigation to 3460 kg ha 1 under 100 irrigation zonta et al 2017 also reported that water stress affects important physiological processes as well as reproductive structures which ultimately lead to significant yield losses the decreased cotton crop productivity due to prolonged psfi could be ascribed to the fact that when the soil dries plants shed leaves to reduce water loss via transpiration and transfer a greater proportion of assimilates to the root to enhance the water and nutrient uptake capacity and increases the root shoot ratio to maintain the water balance in plants passioura 1983 shangguan et al 2000 liu et al 2004 3 3 interaction effect of irrigation management modules on crop productivity these results revealed that interaction among the psi x psfi psi x dos and psi x dos x psfi were statistically significant table 3 during 2017 interaction between psi x dos x psfi showed that april 30th sown cotton under psi120 and psfi35 treatment produced the significantly higher seed cotton yield regardless of combinations of psi and psfi a significant decline in seed cotton yield was recorded with a delay in sowing from april 30th to may 30th in april 30th sown cotton during 2017 psfi delayed up to 35 das under psi120 and up to 28 das under psi75 did not resulted any significant reduction in seed cotton yield whereas time of psfi had a non significant effect on seed cotton yield for may 30th sown crop irrespective of level of psi data pooled over dos under psi120 showed that psfi28 42 and psfi28 35 were optimum for higher cotton productivity during 2016 and 2017 respectively however under psi75 the psfi28 35 and psfi21 28 were significantly better during 2016 and 2017 respectively similarly pooled data for psi levels showed that psfi28 35 and psfi21 28 resulted in significantly higher cotton productivity during 2017 for april 30th and may 30th sown crop respectively the interaction effect of psi x dos showed significantly higher seed cotton yield for april 30th sown crop under psi120 treatment compared with all other combinations during both years of study however the lowest seed cotton yield was recorded for may 30th sown crop under psi75 treatment 3 4 quality traits of cotton under different irrigation management modules among the quality parameters lint yield and got were significantly higher under psi120 treatment because of improved soil moisture conditions but a significant decrease was recorded under psi75 table 4 other quality parameters like 2 5 fibre span length fibre strength and micronaire under psi120 were also improved although non significantly except 2 5 fibre span length which was statistically higher under psi120 treatment during 2017 fibre strength exhibited a linear significant r2 0 709 p 0 05 relationship with got fig 6 optimum soil moisture conditions during the initial crop growth period lead to enhanced crop growth which is considered critical for good quality of produce all the cotton quality parameters were significantly superior under timely sown crop late sown crop had significant deterioration in quality parameters such as lower values of got lint yield 2 5 fibre span length fibre strength and higher values of micronaire lower values represent fine fibres etc fig 6 prevailing humid and low temperature conditions during later boll development and boll opening stage of late sown crop 30th may resulted in poor fibres development and deterioration in fibre quality parameters the deterioration in fibre quality in terms of lint percentage lint index and lint yield under delayed sown conditions has been reported ferrise et al 2010 cao et al 2011 ullah et al 2019 fibre length reduces greatly due to water stress at first third of boll filling period whereas fibre maturity and micronaire are negatively influenced by water stress at two third of boll filling period hearn 1994 among the time of psfi a similar trend was observed for lint yield as recorded for seed cotton yield a significantly higher lint yield under psfi28 and psfi35 was observed similarly psfi21 and psfi28 treatments significantly increased the got as compared to other psfi treatments during 2017 while the effect of different psfi treatments on 2 5 fibre span length fibre strength and micronaire was statistically non significant 3 5 water productivity indices under different irrigation management modules the amount of irrigation water applied differs significantly for dos psi and psfi table 5 the depth of irrigation water applied under psi120 was higher by 45 mm over psi75 total water expense was also higher under psi120 896 mm and 742 mm during 2016 and 2017 respectively than psi75 851 mm and 693 mm during 2016 and 2017 respectively the volume of irrigation water applied in the present study was almost in a similar range reported earlier wanjura et al 2002 a maximum lint yield has been reported with the application of 740 mm of water and with 20 deviation in this application depth yield is reduced by 2 6 wanjura et al 2002 the comparison of adequate irrigation regime with deficit irrigation treatments showed that total depth of water applied varied between 257 and 867 mm and the seed cotton yield was achieved with adequate irrigation dağdelen et al 2006 which was similar to these results these values were however very less 38 6 at psi120 and 49 2 at psi75 when compared with total water expense for cotton under surface irrigation reported earlier in arizona nass 2010 averaged over psi and psfi it was observed that the depth of irrigation water applied to may 30th sown was lower compared to april 30th sown crop timely sown crop april 30th received 18 and 38 mm higher irrigation water over the late sown crop may 30th during 2016 and 2017 respectively therefore the longer crop duration of april 30th sown crop by 20 and 18 days during 2016 and 2017 respectively and higher crop water requirement resulted in higher irrigation water applied corresponding to irrigation water applied water expense was also higher under april 30th sown crop by 51 and 36 mm respectively during 2016 and 2017 as compared to may 30th sown crop the reduction in duration and quantity of irrigation water with delay in cotton sowing has been reported brar and singh 2021 sowing dates has significant impact on crop water requirement and cotton can be stressed severely with slight variation in irrigation water supply huang 2015 these results showed that depth of irrigation water applied was higher under early psfi21 as compared to psfi35 42 the total water expense was higher under psfi21 during 2016 under psfi21 and psfi28 during 2017 the rcwp and tcwp were significantly higher under psi120 compared with psi75 table 5 although acwp increased under psi120 than psi75 but the effect of psi was statistically non significant it was observed that psi120 resulted in 15 9 17 9 higher rcwp than the psi75 during the study period similarly tcwp was higher by 11 0 under psi120 as compared to psi75 jalota et al 2006 also reported 15 decrease in acwp by reducing psi300 to psi75 for cotton grown on silt loam soils the psi120 treatment prolonged the yield formation phase and resulted in proportionally higher seed cotton yield and water productivity indices table 5 and fig 3b h fig 3e f illustrates a linear positive relationship between yield formation phase and water productivity indices while psi75 treatment has soil moisture deficit during the initial crop growth period which apparently has resulted in poor growth and productivity probably it was the reason for the reduction in yield formation phases as well as seed cotton yield water productivity indices fig 3b h fig 7 conversely the sufficient soil moisture and plant nutrients are considered essential for initial crop growth and establishment which ultimately resulted in higher crop yield and productivity indices yousaf et al 2016 zonta et al 2017 application of heavy psi helps to increase use efficiency of applied irrigation water which typically range between 45 and 70 of water loss due to winds and increased air temperatures bordovsky and porter 2003 it was observed delay in sowing from april 30th to may 30th drastically reduced all water productivity indices viz acwp rcwp and tcwp delayed crop sowing may 30th resulted in a significant decrease in acwp by 44 1 43 6 rcwp by 38 0 41 6 and tcwp by 43 6 46 9 compared with that of the timely sown crop april 30th it could be ascribed to the prevailing weather conditions which remain favourable for april sown crop to provide longer crop duration enhanced crop growth and yield of cotton fig 3a although the depth of applied irrigation water in timely sown crop april 30th was higher due to longer duration but it produced proportionately significantly higher seed cotton yield fig 3c the higher seed cotton yield under april 30th sowing plots resulted in increased water productivity indices fig 3g h therefore favourable weather conditions for better phenological development could be optimized by changing the sowing date for achieving higher productivity bilal et al 2019 sankaranarayanan et al 2020 many other researchers reported the improved water and nutrient productivity indices for cotton sown in april compared with delayed sowing buttar et al 2007 jalota et al 2008 it has been reported that applying just half the required water shortened the season by 25 days and decreases the plant height bhattarai et al 2006 among the psfi levels the highest acwp was recorded under psfi28 and psfi35 as compared to psfi21 and psfi42 similarly rcwp and tcwp were higher under psfi28 and psfi35 over psfi42 treatment during 2016 all water productivity indices were significantly increased with delay in psfi psfi21 to psfi28 35 the rcwp and tcwp were statistically non significant among psfi21 and psfi35 during 2017 the moderate water stress improves root penetration to explore more moisture and nutrient from deeper soil layers resulted in better vegetative and reproductive growth as well as improved productivity and productivity indices fig 3e f but with a further delay in psfi psfi42 a significant reduction in all water productivity indices was observed these results showed that acwp varied between 510 and 913 g m 3 and seed cotton yield between 1664 and 3088 kg ha 1 which was comparable to the acwp range of 550 and 620 g m 3 and seed cotton yield of 3180 and 4030 kg ha 1 reported earlier ibragimov et al 2007 the peak effective acwp of 140 330 g m 3 has been reported earlier zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 detar 2008 it was important to observe higher acwp by 1 4 2 5 times in the present study as compared to 360 g m 3 reported earlier which varied between 320 g m 3 under 40 irrigation to 390 g m 3 under the 100 irrigation oweis et al 2011 and it could be ascribed to assured heavy psi and timely psfi hunsaker et al 2015 reported acwp of 120 g m 3 for cotton fields under surface irrigation and 40 reduction when compared with acwp for micro irrigation system in arizona even on a global scale seed cotton yield of irrigated fields typically varies between 4000 and 5000 kg ha 1 and acwp values varied between 400 and 600 g m 3 of depleted water oweis et al 2011 in the present study seed cotton yield varied between 1263 and 3088 kg ha 1 regardless of the treatments which was lower by 38 68 as compared with globally acceptable yield yet heavy psi and timely psfi has helped achieving higher acwp than reported by several earlier studies zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 detar 2008 oweis et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2015 the variation in crop yield and water productivity could be ascribed to several factors of which climatic variability soil texture and fertility soil and nutrient management are important oweis et al 2011 both acwp and tcwp exhibited a significant and positive relation with yield formation phase as well as with seed cotton yield fig 3e h application of psfi at optimum time resulted in increase of 36 in seed cotton yield besides improved water expense efficiency by 54 buttar et al 2007 jalota et al 2006 reported that by reducing the volume of post sowing irrigation water from 300 to 75 mm decreases in water productivity by 15 4 and 1 respectively for silt loam sandy loam and loamy sand soils in north western india 3 6 irrigation management regimes and soil water content the soil water content θ varied among the treatments due to levels of psi and timing psfi fig 8 rainfall before application psfi treatments reduced the differences in θ soil water content was higher under psi120 than psi75 throughout the observation period particularly larger differences were observed for the period between crop sowing to till the application of psfi or rainfall soil moisture content was almost similar among the different sowing dates till two weeks after sowing especially during 2017 from 3rd week onwards may 30th sown crop coincide with rainfall led to higher soil moisture content during 3rd to 8th weeks than april 30th sown crop there was no change in soil moisture content among different sowing dates till two weeks after sowing after that 3rd week onwards may 30th sown crop coincide with rainfall led to higher soil moisture content the april 30th sown crop in case of april 30th sown crop there was a continuous decline in soil water content up to 3rd 4th 5th and 6th week under psfi21 psfi28 psfi35 and psfi42 respectively while at 7th week of april 30th sown crop soil moisture content was higher under psfi21 and psfi28 because of scheduling of 2nd post sowing irrigation soil moisture content was increased with application of psfi under respective treatments although differences were narrowed down by rainfall especially under may 30th sown crop the variation in soil moisture content was associated with a variable amount of irrigation water under psi p120 and p75 and different times of application psfi as per the treatments these results corroborate earlier research findings chattopadhyay and samui 2003 guan et al 2013 huang 2015 singh et al 2015 3 7 nitrogen factor productivity under different irrigation management modules the n factor productivity was higher under moderately stressed treatments of psfi28 and psfi35 as compared to psfi42 during both years fig 7 because of better crop growth development and yield under moderate water stress conditions psfi28 and psfi35 with similar quantity of applied fertilizer n lead to increased n factor productivity these results are in accordance with findings of thind et al 2010 and singh et al 2018 it has been known that cumulative irrigation water and applied fertilizer n imposed greater influence on the cotton lint yield than other factors lin et al 2021 fertilizer n application increases root growth and decreases the shoots growth when cotton plants are under severe water stress because the limited moisture extracted by root is primarily consumed by the root system itself and only a small amount of water was transported to shoots mardanov et al 1998 3 8 economic indices of cotton under different irrigation management regimes the increased seed cotton yield under psi120 increased the cost of picking which resulted in higher cost of cultivation cci compared with psi75 treatment table 6 unsurprisingly the higher seed cotton yield led to significantly increased agrs and anrs under psi120 treatment among the sowing dates the higher cci under april 30th sown crop as compared to may 30th sown were ascribed to higher seed cotton yield and therefore the additional cost of picking for timely sown cotton crop gross returns net returns and b c ratio were also significantly higher under april 30th sown crop as compared to may 30th sown these results corroborate earlier research findings of sankaranarayanan et al 2020 who reported significant influence of dos of cotton on monetary parameters because timely sowing provide favourable climate conditions which in turn led to higher productivity and economic returns the higher number of irrigations amongst the psfi treatments and increased cost of picking was responsible for increased cci the economic returns were significantly higher under psfi28 followed by psfi35 as compared to psfi21 and psfi42 in the present study cci agrs and anrs varied between 459 and 584 us ha 1 669 and 1637 us ha 1 and 210 1053 us ha 1 respectively with b c ratio range of 0 46 1 79 these returns were in line with studies conducted in indian trans gangetic plain singh et al 2019b who reported cci of 524 us ha 1 agrs of 1150 us ha 1 anrs of 626 us ha 1 with b c ratio of 1 19 4 conclusions these results revealed that irrigation module psi and psfi and dos had a significant influence on cotton growth and development and yield and water indices water stress either due to shallow psi and or due to delayed psfi had a negative impact on crop phenphases yield and contributing attributes and productivity indices notwithstanding the sowing dates heavy psi i e psi120 has significantly increased the cotton yield rcwp and tcwp conversely the delayed cotton sowing particularly under deficit moisture regime significantly reduced the crop phonological development which eventually led to decreased crop productivity cotton sown with heavy psi120 and psfi28 42 or with shallow psi75 and psfi21 35 helped in achieving significantly higher cotton productivity due to the positive impact of irrigation scheduling modules on crops phonological development averaged over psi levels psfi could be delayed up to psfi28 and psfi35 under april 30th and may 30th sown crop respectively for timely sown cotton april 30th psi120 significantly increased the seed cotton yield but for late sown crop may 30th psi75 resulted in significantly lower yield these results underpins overwhelming significance of timely crop establishment on april 30th after heavy psi120 and psfi28 35 which helps achieve significantly higher yield potential of cotton in north western india therefore scheduling psi and psfi to cotton depending upon prevailing weather conditions would help obtaining higher cotton productivity in north western india there is further need to investigate the response of psi and psfi in texturally divergent soils which responds differently to soil moisture retention nonetheless expected variable response to sowing time and selection of hybrids with respect to their duration time to maturity also required to be optimized for increased sustainability and up scaling of irrigation schedule in cropland ecosystems under cotton based systems conflicts of interest the authors have no conflicts of interest declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

9277,the establishment of growth stage specific irrigation scheduling is considered critically important for achieving higher cotton gossypium hirsutum l productivity in north western india in the study region farmers prefer pre sowing irrigation psi with canal water because underground water has poor quality due to presence of high concentration of soluble salts however non availability of canal water at cotton sowing period often delays its sowing and eventually impacts cotton productivity with significant effect on crop phenology therefore we investigated the effect of irrigation scheduling based on depth of psi and subsequent post sowing first irrigation psfi on crop phenology growth attributes and water productivity of cotton at different dates of sowing dos which are representative of actual sowing window in the study region more specifically this study evaluated the performance of psi depths viz 75 and 120 mm psi75 and psi120 and dos viz april 30th and may 30th combinations in main plots and psfi treatments i e 21 42 dos psfi21 psfi28 psfi35 and psfi42 in the subplots these results revealed that psi120 significantly p 0 05 increased the seed cotton yield by 16 8 18 7 real crop water productivity rcwp by 15 9 17 9 and total crop water productivity tcwp by 11 0 compared with psi75 the april 30th sown cotton showed improved phenological development apparently due to longer yield formation phase which has significantly increased the seed cotton yield by 87 8 97 6 apparent water productivity by 77 3 79 0 rcwp by 61 2 71 1 and tcwp by 77 3 88 3 compared with may 30th sown crop therefore to achieve higher cotton productivity under psi75 treatment psfi21 35 appeared most optimum whilst under psfi28 42 significantly outperformed under psi120 the psi120 treatment significantly improved the lint yield and ginning outturn got compared with psi75 the number of monopods sympods bolls m 2 and boll weight were significantly higher at psfi28 which decreased with delayed psfi the effect of psi and psfi on crop productivity was significantly higher for april 30th sown crop compared with may 30th sown crop the days to square initiation exhibited a linear significant relationship with flower initiation r2 0 797 p 0 05 boll development r2 0 857 p 0 05 boll opening r2 0 735 p 0 05 and crop maturity r2 0 779 p 0 05 got exhibited a linear significant relationship with fibre span length r2 0 709 p 0 05 these results highlight that irrigation scheduling at psi120 and psfi28 42 for 30th april sown crop significantly enhanced the crop and water productivity nonetheless psi120 helped delay the psfi for both sowing dates without any significant impact on cotton productivity the economic indices viz average gross returns agrs average net returns anrs and benefit cost b c ratio of cotton cultivation were significantly higher under psi120 and psfi28 35 keywords apparent crop water productivity fibre quality irrigation scheduling real crop water productivity total crop water productivity water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cotton gossypium hirsutum l is an important non food commercial cash crop having high significance in agricultural and industrial economy because it ranks first as a commodity of global agricultural trade barwale et al 2004 agbenyegah 2012 singh et al 2021a india had the largest area of 13 4 million ha mha under cotton production followed by u s a china and pakistan aiccip 2020 and comprise 30 of global cultivated area with nearly 60 of total cotton production in india cotton in largely cultivated in north western india comprising states of punjab haryana and rajasthan with an average productivity range of 691 785 kg ha 1 singh et al 2021b cotton growing region in india is characterized by an arid climate low rainfall below 400 mm year 1 poor quality underground water kumar et al 2021a and low soil fertility verma et al 2017 sharma et al 2020 singh et al 2021a kumar et al 2021b besides these sustainability issues the traditional cotton growing region of north western india has a major problem of poor quality irrigation water 40 of the underground waters are either saline or sodic nonetheless underground water which has been the major source of irrigation water in north western india is declining in 80 of cultivated area at an alarming rate of 40 cm year 1 while in some pockets the situation is even worrisome with decline rate of more than 90 cm year 1 hira et al 2004 bhatt et al 2021 the results of modelling approach underpin that due to significant increases in mean air temperatures length and frequency and intensity of extreme events cotton based agroecosystem would become hotspot for severe water stress in future kloesel et al 2018 in north western india farmers of cotton growing region are highly dependent upon canal water availability particularly for pre sowing irrigation psi singh et al 2021a the proper timing of irrigation is considered critical determinant for cotton productivity feike et al 2017 mitchell mccallister et al 2020 based on survey of more than two hundred cotton growers facing water scarcity feike et al 2017 reported that large differences in cotton productivity and water use efficiency were ascribed to the regions where both cotton yields and water productivity were at low levels such differences to a large scale are ascribed to poor knowledge of cotton growers regarding irrigation water use in cotton cultivation kang et al 2012 singh et al 2021a besides inappropriate irrigation schedules for cotton li et al 2013 wang et al 2019a therefore to sustain cotton productivity irrigation can be strategically applied at critical cotton growth stages to optimize water availability schaefer et al 2018 himanshu et al 2019 the untimely and non availability of canal water availability especially during the sowing mid april to mid may as well as during post sowing first irrigation psfi in june often leads to either delayed crop sowing and or pressurize farmers to apply psi with poor quality saline underground water jalota et al 2008 although cotton is more tolerant of salinity than the other crops feike et al 2017 dilnur et al 2019 yet salinity can reduce seed cotton yield by 8 40 fowler 1986 corwin et al 2003 the negative impacts of soil salinity are intensified with increased nutrient imbalance in soils which reduces the cotton yield and water productivity wang et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 the delay in irrigation can result in yield loss equivalent to 62 300 us ha 1 vories et al 2003 seed cotton yield is reported to decrease by 0 34 mg ha 1 for each additional hour of stress time on days with water stress during the irrigation period wanjura et al 2006 application of heavy psi has been the potential strategy for water management in cotton production to store moisture in the soil profile and to bank water for the crop during the water stress period mahan et al 2012 the application of heavy psi ensures efficient use of applied irrigation water ranging between 45 and 70 water loss associated with high winds and temperatures bordovsky and porter 2003 additionally the delay in sowing becomes more susceptible to insect pest and diseases kumar et al 2020 whereas psi with poor quality water led to seedling mortality boumans et al 1988 although cotton crop can outperform under deficit irrigation i e with only 4 5 irrigations through border method with less evapotranspiration requirements jalota et al 2006 and only slightly reduced seed cotton yield under deficit water conditions rao et al 2016 liu et al 2017 yet it requires timely irrigation at critical growth stages pace et al 1999 wang et al 2004 for example water deficit at squaring flowering and boll opening stage could lead to a significant set back on crop productivity because of decrease in leaf water potential number of bolls plant 1 and boll weight aujla et al 2005 jalota et al 2006 it is well established that water deficit at seedling stage enhances the length of tap root to explore the lower layers of soil profile for water need under heavy psi conditions but moisture stress caused by shallow psi and or prevailing hot dry spell for long period could lead to reduced surface area in the upper canopy and shoot growth of cotton crop aujla et al 2005 pace et al 1999 perry et al 2012 water deficit has been reported to affect leaf expansion ball et al 1994 abscission pattern crozat et al 1999 flowering boll formation and its distribution and yield components gerik et al 1996 aujla et al 2005 himanshu et al 2019 also reported that water deficit particularly at germination and seedling emergence stage to squaring stage late bloom and boll opening stage significant affect the seed cotton yield most of the earlier research on water scheduling in cotton remained centred on enhancing water productivity based on evapo transpiration jalota et al 2008 2006 kijne et al 2003 drip irrigation aujla et al 2005 ibragimov et al 2007 basal et al 2009 mulching use of osmo protectants etc for sustaining productivity with limited use of irrigation water arora et al 2011 hasanuzzaman et al 2013 wang et al 2016 singh et al 2018 brar and vashist 2020 these approaches had limited adoption at the farmers fields due to higher input cost of micro irrigation system hindrance in intercultural operation under mulching and osmo protectant are not much effective at all the stages of crop growth etc wang et al 2016 singh et al 2021b nonetheless farmers fields are intensively managed cropland ecosystems with prime focus on crop productivity singh and benbi 2020 2021 because their objectives are to maximize crop yields at minimal risks of crop failure or yield loss saini et al 2010 singh et al 2021b therefore in the frame of multi contemporary challenges related to water scarcity their keen interest is to ensure timely and assured irrigation to crop with good quality canal water it is seen that when the canal water becomes available farmers instead of giving desired heavy psi 120 mm psi120 prefer shallow pre sowing irrigation 75 mm psi75 to ensure timely sowing in their entire area to be kept under cotton such situation becomes worst with mortality of cotton seedling with the increase in temperature and no rain till the start of monsoon period july gill et al 2013 the poor plant stand not only decreases the productivity but also lead to large set back on crop growth brar et al 2020 it is well established that a sufficient level of psi is pre requisite for optimized seedling emergence and establishment in cotton and eventually to crop productivity aujla et al 2005 perry et al 2012 other than shallow psi options to manage limited canal water availability for irrigation crop sowing often gets delayed in entire north western india the delayed cotton sowing alters the phenology morphology and often lead to reduced productivity of cotton crop and more susceptible to insect pest and diseases yang et al 2014 liu et al 2015 shah 2017 bilal et al 2019 kumar et al 2020 brar and singh 2021 a shift in sowing date due to irrigation water scarcity results to expose the crop initial reproductive phase to hot and long days which not only influences the crop phenological development but also enhances the crop sensitivity to moisture stress and ultimately affects the productivity and profitability ur rahman et al 2016 wang et al 2019b besides delayed cotton sowing enhances the problem of insect pest attack boll shedding jatt et al 2007 and drastic drop in seed cotton yield ur rahman et al 2016 besides for psfi farmers prefer canal water availability or rain rather than applying groundwater field experiments in the study region showed that psfi sometime gets delayed up to 6th week after sowing which result in severe seedling mortality especially under light psi conditions buttar et al 2007 jalota et al 2008 brar and singh 2021 such partial drought like situations are the major hurdle in sustaining crop productivity in the entire cotton growing region of north western india the irrigation water amount wang et al 2012 as well as irrigation interval kang et al 2012 are reported to influence cotton yield and water use efficiency although many researchers have demonstrated that mild deficit irrigation at vegetative stages has a negligible effect on seed cotton yield perry et al 2012 rao et al 2016 wang et al 2016 zahoor et al 2017 niu et al 2018 cheng et al 2021 li et al 2021 but water stress at reproductive stage significantly reduces crop productivity iqbal et al 2017 zahoor et al 2017 hu et al 2019 some researchers showed a delay in psfi up to 6 7 weeks is beneficial for cotton while some reported the adverse effects of delayed psfi in terms of reduction in crop yield wrona et al 1996 buttar et al 2007 bordovsky et al 2015 brar and singh 2021 till date limited information is available on the level of psi time of psfi and their relation to date of sowing dos under such water scarcity conditions in north western india uncertainty in productivity of cotton wheat cropping system is ascribed to delayed establishment of both crops singh et al 2019a the delayed sowing of cotton led to delayed wheat sowing which is considered responsible for decreased wheat productivity due to heat high temperature stress at grain filling stage in late sown wheat it has been estimated that in north western india delayed wheat establishment leads to yield loss of 15 60 kg day 1 ha 1 pathak et al 2003 sidhu et al 2007 nonetheless delayed wheat harvesting by mid april causes cotton sowing to start by the end of april therefore has significant impact on the sustainability of the cotton wheat system additionally poor quality underground water due to high concentration of soluble salts in the study region singh et al 2022a 2022b largely requires heavy psi before cotton establishment with good quality canal water earlier research showed that heavy psi with canal water has great significance for enhanced cotton productivity and increased resilience of cotton based ecosystems buttar et al 2007 the heavy psi helps establish strong root system during the early growth phase which favours good crop growth cotton later in the season due to ensured soil moisture availability from the lower layers of soil profile erie et al 1982 hunsaker et al 2015 the adoption of improved irrigation water management practices which ensures high moisture storage in soils has played an important role in achieving water savings due to increased irrigation water productivity for surface irrigated cotton systems across the globe bucks et al 1988 hunsaker et al 1998 pereira et al 2009 darouich et al 2014 singh et al 2022c we hypothesized that heavy psi and subsequent psfi would have variable impact on cotton productivity for crop sown on different dos due to changed crop phenology a larger volume of irrigation water applied as psi would also help to leach the soluble salts out of the root zone and thereby besides enhancing soil moisture storage deep in soil profile heavy psi would push layer of high concentration of soluble salts beyond the root zone to favour optimum plant growth we aimed at quantifying the depth of psi and to optimum appropriate time of psfi to cotton at different sowing dates for increased crop productivity therefore the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of psi depth and psfi on crop phenology and water productivity of cotton sown on april 30th and may 30th the period considered representative of actual sowing window in the study region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the field experiment was conducted during kharif 2016 and 2017 at punjab agricultural university s regional research station bathinda india the experimental site was located at an altitude of 211 m above mean sea level amsl and is intersected by 30 09 49 n latitude 74 55 18 e longitude in the study region river water supply with canal network is the only source of good quality irrigation water as underground water is moderately to highly saline the study site was characterized by sub tropical arid climate with a normal average annual rainfall of 450 mm of which 70 80 is received in monsoon season extending from july to september total annual rainfall recorded at the meteorological observatory of the research farm was 619 mm in 2016 which is much more by 37 6 than normal annual rainfall while rainfall was only 388 mm during 2017 which was lower by 13 7 than the normal rainfall in the region rainfall during the cropping season mid april to mid november was 558 and 356 mm during 2016 and 2017 respectively there was significant variation in total seasonal rainfall as well as rain events before psfi and other weather parameters figs 1 and 2 there was a no rainfall event during the whole may and first week of june during 2017 while there was 34 mm rainfall on may 30th 2016 is main reason for differential response to the time of psfi soil of the experimental site was loamy sand in texture according to usda classification system with sand 82 2 silt 10 2 and clay 7 5 the bulk density of the surface 0 15 cm soil layer was 1 56 g cm3 the soil was slightly alkaline with ph1 2 8 1 non saline with electrical conductivity e c 1 2 0 16 ds m 1 the surface soil layer was low in soil organic c 3 40 g kg 1 available n 217 kg n ha 1 but high in available p 35 4 kg p ha 1 and k 285 kg k ha 1 the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was 1 61 cm hr 1 field capacity moisture content ψ m 0 33 bar was 23 5 and volumetric water content θ at permanent wilting point ψ m 15 bar was 8 8 2 2 experimental design and treatments the experiment was laid out in a split plot design with three replications four treatment combinations of two psi levels viz 75 and 120 mm psi75 and psi120 and two different dates of sowing dos viz april 30th and may 30th in main plot and four schedules of psfi at 21 28 35 and 42 days after sowing viz psfi21 psfi28 psfi35 and psfi 42 respectively in sub plots were established the heavy psi psi120 was considered to replenish 90 cm soil profile water to field capacity and shallow psi level psi75 replenish 50 cm soil profile water to field capacity volumetric soil water content before psi was 74 mm in 0 120 cm soil profile the psi was given 4 5 days before sowing as per the treatments the level of psfi and subsequent irrigations were 75 mm among all the treatments and were scheduled as per crop water requirement etc started from psfi in both the case of pre and post sowing irrigation a measured quantity of irrigation as per treatments was applied

significant difference lsd test at p 0 05 and the differences in treatments mean at p 0 05 were considered statistically significant the regression analyses were performed on selected variables using spss for windows 16 0 spss inc chicago u s a since there was an interaction between years x psfi therefore data were not pooled over years the dendrogram that depicts the hierarchical relationships viz single linkage correlation coefficient distance between agronomic attributes of cotton and productivity was developed on pooled data for two study years and irrigation modules to explain the output from hierarchical clustering using minitab 16 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 cotton phenology under different irrigation management modules cotton seedling emergence was advanced under psi120 but was significantly p 0 05 delayed under shallow irrigation psi75 table 1 however other phenophases were significantly advanced under psi75 compared with psi120 treatment due to water stress days taken to initiation of squaring flowering boll development boll opening as well as crop maturity were less under shallow psi75 compared with heavy irrigation psi120 the shortened yield formation phases square initiation to maturity as well as total crop duration was significantly lesser under shallow psi75 fig 3b from initiation of squaring crop under psi75 acquired 128 131 days to reach maturity whereas crop under psi120 appropriated 131 134 days to reach maturity water stress shortened all phenophases whereas well water conditions lengthen all phenophases this was evident from fig 4 which shows that days taken to square initiation had a significant linear positive relationship with days to flowering initiation boll development boll opening and crop maturity with higher values of coefficients of determination r2 of 0 8 0 9 0 7 and 0 8 respectively a linear relationship between growth and total cotton duration to water availability is known rao et al 2016 the reduction in total duration especially the reproductive phases due to water deficit has also been reported by many researchers hasanuzzaman et al 2013 brar and vashist 2020 nagamalla et al 2021 in case of dos all the phenophases viz time taken to seedling emergence initiation of squaring flowering boll development boll opening and crop maturity were shorted when crop was sown on may 30th compared with crop sown on april 30th table 1 these results were supported by the significant positive linear relationship between days taken to square initiation and subsequent phenophases fig 4 due to this yield formation phase squaring to maturity was shortened with delay in sowing fig 3a a significant advancement in all phenophases resulted in early crop maturity by 18 20 days of late sown crop due to prevailing higher temperature during early crop growth stage as compared to timely sown crop these results corroborate earlier research findings highlighting the effect of dos hussain et al 2012 shah 2017 to get optimum weather conditions for growth and development lead to enlarge yield formation phase hussain et al 2012 rahman et al 2018 sankaranarayanan et al 2020 ullah et al 2019 delay in psfi led to a significant advancement in phenophases due to water stress table 1 days taken to initiation of squaring flowering boll development and boll opening were significantly greater under psfi21 as compared to psfi35 and psfi42 in psfi28 time taken to these phenophases did not differ significantly from psfi21 and psfi35 however significantly lower time was taken by these phenophases under psfi42 early application of psfi resulted in no water stress led to a longer period to squaring and other vegetative and reproductive phenophase as well as total crop duration fig 4 the length of yield formation phases was positively related to water expense irrigation water rainfall and increased with an increase in the amount of irrigation water either due to psi or psfi fig 3b crop maturity was also significantly advanced under psfi42 as compared to earlier irrigation times psfi21 and psfi28 during both years the improvement in cotton growth and development under timely irrigation management has been reported earlier perry et al 2012 saseendran et al 2014 these results showed that water stress either due to shallow psi or due to delay of psfi has significant impact on cotton phenological development the results of the present study were supported by brar and vashist 2020 and li et al 2020 who observed crop growth phenophases and total crop duration are linearly related to soil moisture availability 3 2 cotton growth and productivity under different irrigation management modules there was a considerable difference in crop growth development and seed cotton yield over the study years table 2 which was related to the variation in rainfall and other weather parameters figs 1 and 2 the vigorous crop growth was evident by significantly higher plant height number of monopods and sympods per plant under psi120 compared with psi75 single linkage correlation coefficient shows that seed cotton yield and lint yield were closely linked with number of boll per m2 and plant height with similarity index 96 5 followed by sympods per plant and boll weight with a similarity index of 93 fig 5 in psi120 treatment better crop growth in terms of plant height lead to a significantly higher number of bolls per during both the study years and significantly higher boll weight during 2017 the longer reproductive phase better growth and yield attributes resulted in producing significantly higher seed cotton yield under psi120 over psi75 fig 3b d the heavy psi i e psi120 resulted in significantly higher seed cotton yield by 16 8 and 18 7 during 2016 and 2017 respectively over shallow psi75 a significant increase in seed cotton yield with an increase in water expense was evident from a linear positive relationship between water expense yield formation phases and seed cotton yield fig 3b d brar and vashist 2020 also reported that sufficient soil moisture lengthens the yield formation phase which brings to significant improvement in yield attributes as well as crop productivity a better growth parameters of cotton under heavy psi i e psi120 has also been reported earlier rao et al 2016 it has been well established that for surface irrigated system heavy psi i e psi250 to psi350 applied in the fields of u s a help providing deep soil moisture storage up to a depth of 180 cm in soil profile which is considered as maximum root growth and water extraction zone erie et al 1982 soil moisture storage in soil profile from psi permits cotton plants to establish a strong root system particular during the early growth phase in the season which is eventually utilized by the cotton later in the season hunsaker et al 2015 plant height number of monopods and sympods per plant were significantly higher under timely sown crop april 30th than late sown crop table 2 yield attributes like boll per unit area and boll weight were also significantly improved under april 30th sown crop and contributed towards a significant increase in seed cotton yield crop sown on april 30th produced significantly higher seed cotton yield by 87 8 and 97 6 over crop sown on may 30th during 2016 and 2017 respectively conversely the delay in sowing had a negative impact on yield formation phase fig 3a early phenophases of late sown crop till boll development has to face comparatively higher temperature range which shortened the phenophases by early squaring flowering and boll development led to poor productivity of late sown crop fig 4 this phase between flowering and boll development stage is considered key yield determinant period of cotton han and kang 2001 brar and singh 2021 plant height number of boll m 2 and number of sympods plant 1 were closely linked with seed cotton yield with a higher correlation coefficient fig 5 similarly the decrease in biomass production poor growth and yield under late sown cotton has also been reported earlier ferrise et al 2010 cao et al 2011 another reason for lower productivity of late sown cotton is that last flush of boll opening coincided with low temperature and lesser sunshine hours nonetheless few of the fully developed bolls were unable to open and could not be picked led to reduce seed cotton yield than timely sown crop liu et al 2015 hu et al 2017 brar and singh 2021 in case of psfi significantly higher number of mono and and sympods were recorded under psfi28 and psfi21 which were decreased significantly due to delay in irrigation psfi42 table 2 it is known that even a short duration moisture stress occurring during flowering and boll development phase significantly impacts various physiological traits e g leaf expansion and photosynthesis and biochemical changes e g c and n metabolism and antioxidant metabolism in cotton plants ball et al 1994 potikha et al 1999 pettigrew 2001 ennahli and earl 2005 which leads to a reduction in cotton development and final productivity a better yield attributes apparently as higher number of bolls per unit area and heavier boll weight under psfi28 was observed however a significant decline in number of bolls and boll weight under psfi42 during both the years was also observed cotton under psfi28 produced the highest seed cotton yield followed by psfi35 and was significantly higher than psfi21 and psfi42 during 2016 during 2017 the highest seed cotton yield was also recorded under psfi28 followed by psfi35 and psfi21 and were significantly higher than psfi42 it was apparent from linear significant p 0 05 linkage between cotton growth and yield attributes with seed cotton yield fig 5 a different response to psfi over the years was due to variation in weather events especially the rainfall fig 2 no rainfall event occurred during the whole may and first week of june 2017 which was the main reason for such response to early psfi21 during 2017 while due to a rainfall of 34 mm on may 30th 2016 psfi21 had a negative impact on crop productivity which was decreased significantly as compared to psfi28 and psfi35 there was no significant impact of psfi35 on seed cotton yield during both years it could be ascribed to mild water stress during the early growth stages which cause deeper penetration of roots thereby empowering to explore the lower layers of soil profile for moisture and nutrient singh and benbi 2022 which ultimately results to enhance seed cotton yield the plant root characteristics i e geometry and architecture which play a key role in the plant s ability to explore the soil volume for water and nutrients sharp et al 1988 develops an important mechanism for drought resistance and ability to change root physiological and biochemical processes under water stress situations spollen and sharp 1991 however prolonged water stress e g in psfi42 treatment resulted in a significant decline in seed cotton yield cook and el zik 1993 depending upon soil texture and prevailing weather conditions application of psfi at optimum time resulted in 36 increase in seed cotton yield buttar et al 2007 oweis et al 2011 reported that mean seed cotton yield of 2502 kg ha 1 which ranging from 1520 kg ha 1 under 40 irrigation to 3460 kg ha 1 under 100 irrigation zonta et al 2017 also reported that water stress affects important physiological processes as well as reproductive structures which ultimately lead to significant yield losses the decreased cotton crop productivity due to prolonged psfi could be ascribed to the fact that when the soil dries plants shed leaves to reduce water loss via transpiration and transfer a greater proportion of assimilates to the root to enhance the water and nutrient uptake capacity and increases the root shoot ratio to maintain the water balance in plants passioura 1983 shangguan et al 2000 liu et al 2004 3 3 interaction effect of irrigation management modules on crop productivity these results revealed that interaction among the psi x psfi psi x dos and psi x dos x psfi were statistically significant table 3 during 2017 interaction between psi x dos x psfi showed that april 30th sown cotton under psi120 and psfi35 treatment produced the significantly higher seed cotton yield regardless of combinations of psi and psfi a significant decline in seed cotton yield was recorded with a delay in sowing from april 30th to may 30th in april 30th sown cotton during 2017 psfi delayed up to 35 das under psi120 and up to 28 das under psi75 did not resulted any significant reduction in seed cotton yield whereas time of psfi had a non significant effect on seed cotton yield for may 30th sown crop irrespective of level of psi data pooled over dos under psi120 showed that psfi28 42 and psfi28 35 were optimum for higher cotton productivity during 2016 and 2017 respectively however under psi75 the psfi28 35 and psfi21 28 were significantly better during 2016 and 2017 respectively similarly pooled data for psi levels showed that psfi28 35 and psfi21 28 resulted in significantly higher cotton productivity during 2017 for april 30th and may 30th sown crop respectively the interaction effect of psi x dos showed significantly higher seed cotton yield for april 30th sown crop under psi120 treatment compared with all other combinations during both years of study however the lowest seed cotton yield was recorded for may 30th sown crop under psi75 treatment 3 4 quality traits of cotton under different irrigation management modules among the quality parameters lint yield and got were significantly higher under psi120 treatment because of improved soil moisture conditions but a significant decrease was recorded under psi75 table 4 other quality parameters like 2 5 fibre span length fibre strength and micronaire under psi120 were also improved although non significantly except 2 5 fibre span length which was statistically higher under psi120 treatment during 2017 fibre strength exhibited a linear significant r2 0 709 p 0 05 relationship with got fig 6 optimum soil moisture conditions during the initial crop growth period lead to enhanced crop growth which is considered critical for good quality of produce all the cotton quality parameters were significantly superior under timely sown crop late sown crop had significant deterioration in quality parameters such as lower values of got lint yield 2 5 fibre span length fibre strength and higher values of micronaire lower values represent fine fibres etc fig 6 prevailing humid and low temperature conditions during later boll development and boll opening stage of late sown crop 30th may resulted in poor fibres development and deterioration in fibre quality parameters the deterioration in fibre quality in terms of lint percentage lint index and lint yield under delayed sown conditions has been reported ferrise et al 2010 cao et al 2011 ullah et al 2019 fibre length reduces greatly due to water stress at first third of boll filling period whereas fibre maturity and micronaire are negatively influenced by water stress at two third of boll filling period hearn 1994 among the time of psfi a similar trend was observed for lint yield as recorded for seed cotton yield a significantly higher lint yield under psfi28 and psfi35 was observed similarly psfi21 and psfi28 treatments significantly increased the got as compared to other psfi treatments during 2017 while the effect of different psfi treatments on 2 5 fibre span length fibre strength and micronaire was statistically non significant 3 5 water productivity indices under different irrigation management modules the amount of irrigation water applied differs significantly for dos psi and psfi table 5 the depth of irrigation water applied under psi120 was higher by 45 mm over psi75 total water expense was also higher under psi120 896 mm and 742 mm during 2016 and 2017 respectively than psi75 851 mm and 693 mm during 2016 and 2017 respectively the volume of irrigation water applied in the present study was almost in a similar range reported earlier wanjura et al 2002 a maximum lint yield has been reported with the application of 740 mm of water and with 20 deviation in this application depth yield is reduced by 2 6 wanjura et al 2002 the comparison of adequate irrigation regime with deficit irrigation treatments showed that total depth of water applied varied between 257 and 867 mm and the seed cotton yield was achieved with adequate irrigation dağdelen et al 2006 which was similar to these results these values were however very less 38 6 at psi120 and 49 2 at psi75 when compared with total water expense for cotton under surface irrigation reported earlier in arizona nass 2010 averaged over psi and psfi it was observed that the depth of irrigation water applied to may 30th sown was lower compared to april 30th sown crop timely sown crop april 30th received 18 and 38 mm higher irrigation water over the late sown crop may 30th during 2016 and 2017 respectively therefore the longer crop duration of april 30th sown crop by 20 and 18 days during 2016 and 2017 respectively and higher crop water requirement resulted in higher irrigation water applied corresponding to irrigation water applied water expense was also higher under april 30th sown crop by 51 and 36 mm respectively during 2016 and 2017 as compared to may 30th sown crop the reduction in duration and quantity of irrigation water with delay in cotton sowing has been reported brar and singh 2021 sowing dates has significant impact on crop water requirement and cotton can be stressed severely with slight variation in irrigation water supply huang 2015 these results showed that depth of irrigation water applied was higher under early psfi21 as compared to psfi35 42 the total water expense was higher under psfi21 during 2016 under psfi21 and psfi28 during 2017 the rcwp and tcwp were significantly higher under psi120 compared with psi75 table 5 although acwp increased under psi120 than psi75 but the effect of psi was statistically non significant it was observed that psi120 resulted in 15 9 17 9 higher rcwp than the psi75 during the study period similarly tcwp was higher by 11 0 under psi120 as compared to psi75 jalota et al 2006 also reported 15 decrease in acwp by reducing psi300 to psi75 for cotton grown on silt loam soils the psi120 treatment prolonged the yield formation phase and resulted in proportionally higher seed cotton yield and water productivity indices table 5 and fig 3b h fig 3e f illustrates a linear positive relationship between yield formation phase and water productivity indices while psi75 treatment has soil moisture deficit during the initial crop growth period which apparently has resulted in poor growth and productivity probably it was the reason for the reduction in yield formation phases as well as seed cotton yield water productivity indices fig 3b h fig 7 conversely the sufficient soil moisture and plant nutrients are considered essential for initial crop growth and establishment which ultimately resulted in higher crop yield and productivity indices yousaf et al 2016 zonta et al 2017 application of heavy psi helps to increase use efficiency of applied irrigation water which typically range between 45 and 70 of water loss due to winds and increased air temperatures bordovsky and porter 2003 it was observed delay in sowing from april 30th to may 30th drastically reduced all water productivity indices viz acwp rcwp and tcwp delayed crop sowing may 30th resulted in a significant decrease in acwp by 44 1 43 6 rcwp by 38 0 41 6 and tcwp by 43 6 46 9 compared with that of the timely sown crop april 30th it could be ascribed to the prevailing weather conditions which remain favourable for april sown crop to provide longer crop duration enhanced crop growth and yield of cotton fig 3a although the depth of applied irrigation water in timely sown crop april 30th was higher due to longer duration but it produced proportionately significantly higher seed cotton yield fig 3c the higher seed cotton yield under april 30th sowing plots resulted in increased water productivity indices fig 3g h therefore favourable weather conditions for better phenological development could be optimized by changing the sowing date for achieving higher productivity bilal et al 2019 sankaranarayanan et al 2020 many other researchers reported the improved water and nutrient productivity indices for cotton sown in april compared with delayed sowing buttar et al 2007 jalota et al 2008 it has been reported that applying just half the required water shortened the season by 25 days and decreases the plant height bhattarai et al 2006 among the psfi levels the highest acwp was recorded under psfi28 and psfi35 as compared to psfi21 and psfi42 similarly rcwp and tcwp were higher under psfi28 and psfi35 over psfi42 treatment during 2016 all water productivity indices were significantly increased with delay in psfi psfi21 to psfi28 35 the rcwp and tcwp were statistically non significant among psfi21 and psfi35 during 2017 the moderate water stress improves root penetration to explore more moisture and nutrient from deeper soil layers resulted in better vegetative and reproductive growth as well as improved productivity and productivity indices fig 3e f but with a further delay in psfi psfi42 a significant reduction in all water productivity indices was observed these results showed that acwp varied between 510 and 913 g m 3 and seed cotton yield between 1664 and 3088 kg ha 1 which was comparable to the acwp range of 550 and 620 g m 3 and seed cotton yield of 3180 and 4030 kg ha 1 reported earlier ibragimov et al 2007 the peak effective acwp of 140 330 g m 3 has been reported earlier zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 detar 2008 it was important to observe higher acwp by 1 4 2 5 times in the present study as compared to 360 g m 3 reported earlier which varied between 320 g m 3 under 40 irrigation to 390 g m 3 under the 100 irrigation oweis et al 2011 and it could be ascribed to assured heavy psi and timely psfi hunsaker et al 2015 reported acwp of 120 g m 3 for cotton fields under surface irrigation and 40 reduction when compared with acwp for micro irrigation system in arizona even on a global scale seed cotton yield of irrigated fields typically varies between 4000 and 5000 kg ha 1 and acwp values varied between 400 and 600 g m 3 of depleted water oweis et al 2011 in the present study seed cotton yield varied between 1263 and 3088 kg ha 1 regardless of the treatments which was lower by 38 68 as compared with globally acceptable yield yet heavy psi and timely psfi has helped achieving higher acwp than reported by several earlier studies zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 detar 2008 oweis et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2015 the variation in crop yield and water productivity could be ascribed to several factors of which climatic variability soil texture and fertility soil and nutrient management are important oweis et al 2011 both acwp and tcwp exhibited a significant and positive relation with yield formation phase as well as with seed cotton yield fig 3e h application of psfi at optimum time resulted in increase of 36 in seed cotton yield besides improved water expense efficiency by 54 buttar et al 2007 jalota et al 2006 reported that by reducing the volume of post sowing irrigation water from 300 to 75 mm decreases in water productivity by 15 4 and 1 respectively for silt loam sandy loam and loamy sand soils in north western india 3 6 irrigation management regimes and soil water content the soil water content θ varied among the treatments due to levels of psi and timing psfi fig 8 rainfall before application psfi treatments reduced the differences in θ soil water content was higher under psi120 than psi75 throughout the observation period particularly larger differences were observed for the period between crop sowing to till the application of psfi or rainfall soil moisture content was almost similar among the different sowing dates till two weeks after sowing especially during 2017 from 3rd week onwards may 30th sown crop coincide with rainfall led to higher soil moisture content during 3rd to 8th weeks than april 30th sown crop there was no change in soil moisture content among different sowing dates till two weeks after sowing after that 3rd week onwards may 30th sown crop coincide with rainfall led to higher soil moisture content the april 30th sown crop in case of april 30th sown crop there was a continuous decline in soil water content up to 3rd 4th 5th and 6th week under psfi21 psfi28 psfi35 and psfi42 respectively while at 7th week of april 30th sown crop soil moisture content was higher under psfi21 and psfi28 because of scheduling of 2nd post sowing irrigation soil moisture content was increased with application of psfi under respective treatments although differences were narrowed down by rainfall especially under may 30th sown crop the variation in soil moisture content was associated with a variable amount of irrigation water under psi p120 and p75 and different times of application psfi as per the treatments these results corroborate earlier research findings chattopadhyay and samui 2003 guan et al 2013 huang 2015 singh et al 2015 3 7 nitrogen factor productivity under different irrigation management modules the n factor productivity was higher under moderately stressed treatments of psfi28 and psfi35 as compared to psfi42 during both years fig 7 because of better crop growth development and yield under moderate water stress conditions psfi28 and psfi35 with similar quantity of applied fertilizer n lead to increased n factor productivity these results are in accordance with findings of thind et al 2010 and singh et al 2018 it has been known that cumulative irrigation water and applied fertilizer n imposed greater influence on the cotton lint yield than other factors lin et al 2021 fertilizer n application increases root growth and decreases the shoots growth when cotton plants are under severe water stress because the limited moisture extracted by root is primarily consumed by the root system itself and only a small amount of water was transported to shoots mardanov et al 1998 3 8 economic indices of cotton under different irrigation management regimes the increased seed cotton yield under psi120 increased the cost of picking which resulted in higher cost of cultivation cci compared with psi75 treatment table 6 unsurprisingly the higher seed cotton yield led to significantly increased agrs and anrs under psi120 treatment among the sowing dates the higher cci under april 30th sown crop as compared to may 30th sown were ascribed to higher seed cotton yield and therefore the additional cost of picking for timely sown cotton crop gross returns net returns and b c ratio were also significantly higher under april 30th sown crop as compared to may 30th sown these results corroborate earlier research findings of sankaranarayanan et al 2020 who reported significant influence of dos of cotton on monetary parameters because timely sowing provide favourable climate conditions which in turn led to higher productivity and economic returns the higher number of irrigations amongst the psfi treatments and increased cost of picking was responsible for increased cci the economic returns were significantly higher under psfi28

ratio of 1 19 4 conclusions these results revealed that irrigation module psi and psfi and dos had a significant influence on cotton growth and development and yield and water indices water stress either due to shallow psi and or due to delayed psfi had a negative impact on crop phenphases yield and contributing attributes and productivity indices notwithstanding the sowing dates heavy psi i e psi120 has significantly increased the cotton yield rcwp and tcwp conversely the delayed cotton sowing particularly under deficit moisture regime significantly reduced the crop phonological development which eventually led to decreased crop productivity cotton sown with heavy psi120 and psfi28 42 or with shallow psi75 and psfi21 35 helped in achieving significantly higher cotton productivity due to the positive impact of irrigation scheduling modules on crops phonological development averaged over psi levels psfi could be delayed up to psfi28 and psfi35 under april 30th and may 30th sown crop respectively for timely sown cotton april 30th psi120 significantly increased the seed cotton yield but for late sown crop may 30th psi75 resulted in significantly lower yield these results underpins overwhelming significance of timely crop establishment on april 30th after heavy psi120 and psfi28 35 which helps achieve significantly higher yield potential of cotton in north western india therefore scheduling psi and psfi to cotton depending upon prevailing weather conditions would help obtaining higher cotton productivity in north western india there is further need to investigate the response of psi and psfi in texturally divergent soils which responds differently to soil moisture retention nonetheless expected variable response to sowing time and selection of hybrids with respect to their duration time to maturity also required to be optimized for increased sustainability and up scaling of irrigation schedule in cropland ecosystems under cotton based

long term stable operation of systems therefore this study proposes an obtaining the bswr suitable for crop irrigation conductivity method based on conductivity biogas slurry and clean water the three

process clogging location and characteristic parameters are analyzed using a hydraulic test an industrial camera and the ordered regression method for three common emitters under three bswr the results show that the proposed method relative error is approximately 10 which is considered feasible over time the discharge and uniformity of emitters decrease and subsequently remain constant as the slurry concentration increases the emitters clog more rapidly and internal patch emitters ipes show the lowest adaptability to bsdi systems the pressure compensation pces and single wing labyrinth emitters swles is better than ipes on anti clogging performance clogging mainly occurs at the inlet grid and the swles are clogged at the internal flow channel and outlet moreover the inlet grid and pressure compensation are key characteristic parameters affecting clogging the adaptability of emitters can be improved by changing the inlet grid layout increasing the cross sectional area of the flow channel and or reducing the pathway length based on irrigation uniformity and economic cost large discharge swles and pces are recommended for one time field crops and multi year cash crops respectively furthermore the bswr should be at least 1 4 and ratios of 1 8 1 20 are most conducive to stable operation this study serves as a guideline for future development of bsdi systems graphical

available on request 1 introduction in recent years fertigation has been widely implemented worldwide peng et al 2017 this technology uses drip or sprinkler irrigation systems as the carrier and it plays an important role in large scale agriculture at present water fertilizer integration technology uses soluble industrial fertilizers however several studies have revealed that long term application of chemical fertilizers reduces soil fertility dubey et al 2012 crop quality and yield xin et al 2017 which is not conducive to the sustainable development therefore various organic fertilizers have been considered as substitutes for chemical fertilizers such as solid biogas residue kizito et al 2019 and liquid biogas slurry kumar et al 2015 based on its physical characteristics biogas slurry could be a good alternative to chemical fertilizers in water fertilizer integration technology moreover biogas slurry is an efficient liquid fertilizer which contains a considerable amount of both macro and micro nutrients 1 5 n 1 1 p and 1 k in addition to appreciable quantities of organic matter kumar et al 2015 during digestion of biogas slurry these nutrients are transformed from organic form to dissolved states inorganic form this makes them more useful for plant uptake lansing et al 2010 which can improve the yield ferdous et al 2018 and nutritional quality xu et al 2019 of crops however as the residual product after biogas fermentation biogas slurry contains particle impurities and has high viscosity song et al 2011 at present biogas slurry is mainly applied with extensive surface irrigation du et al 2019 yin et al 2019 however in some areas it is applied using drip irrigation systems guido et al 2020 biogas slurry drip irrigation reduces labor costs and improves the efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization when biogas slurry is added to a drip irrigation system the emitters are the most vulnerable components if the emitters are clogged the uniformity of irrigation and fertilization is reduced which is not conducive to high crop yields scholars have investigated the anti clogging performance of emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems for example xiao et al 2021 found that an electromagnetic field can effectively control the formation of microbial films on patch emitters reducing the risk of biological clogging chen et al 2020 proposed a water fertilizer ratio and an optimal matching scheme for the working pressure and orifice pressure compensating emitter discharge specification however specific emitters were used in the research so their conclusions are not universal previous studies revealed that the performance of different types of emitters in drip irrigation systems varies considerably depending on the water quality for example in the case of subsurface drip irrigation with domestic water for up to eight years orifice emitters were found to exhibit the best anti clogging performance feng et al 2004 in contrast for reclaimed water drip irrigation the single wing labyrinth emitter exhibited inferior anti clogging performance compared to the internal patch type emitter which increases the clogging risk owing to a long flow channel hao et al 2017 considering the adaptability hydraulic performance and cost of reclaimed water drip irrigation pei et al 2014 reported that the cusp shaped saw tooth non pressure compensating emitters with short flow path are suitable for short term irrigation of annual crop whereas pressure compensating emitters with small outflow and flow stance index are suitable for irrigating perennial crop for drip irrigation systems near the yellow river highly sediment laden water considering the life cycle production cost carbon footprint and other factors single wing labyrinth emitters should be selected in the short term 1 year and internal patch irrigation combined with capillary flushing is more suitable in the long term 3 5years liu et al 2021 thus appropriate emitters should be selected for drip irrigation systems depending on the water quality there has been limited research on anti clogging mechanisms for biogas slurry drip irrigation systems and the adaptability of emitters under different biogas slurry concentrations biogas slurry water ratios if biogas slurry water ratio is too high the emitter will be clogged conversely if this ratio is too low biogas slurry can not provide enough nutrients when the irrigation amount reaches the crop water demand considering the potential broad applicability of biogas slurry drip irrigation technology it is necessary to investigate the clogging characteristics of different types of emitters under different biogas slurry concentrations and to determine the most suitable emitters and optimum ratios of biogas slurry to clear water the aims of this study are as follows 1 investigate the clogging characteristics of different types of emitters under different slurry concentrations 2 clarify the main reasons and characteristic parameters affecting the anti clogging performance of emitters under biogas slurry drip irrigation and 3 identify the most suitable biogas slurry water ratio and emitter type for biogas slurry drip irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 test emitter three types of emitters commonly used internal patch emitters ipes pressure compensated emitters pces and single wing labyrinth emitters swles and two nominal discharge specifications of each type were used in this study fig 1 shows the emitters and their specific characteristic parameters are listed in the table 1 the characteristic parameters of the pressure compensation nominal discharge and water inlet grid were provided by the manufacturer moreover the pathway length and min w h was measured using a high power industrial camera zy hd4k zong yuan china accuracy 0 01 mm among them min w h is minimum pathway size w is pathway width h is pathway depth and nominal discharge is measured at the rated pressure of 0 1 mpa 2 2 test device the experiments were conducted at the biogas station of beijing miyun haihua baili energy technology co ltd the test device was designed as a biogas slurry and water circulation test system which was built with a 9 m long aluminum profile and was equipped with a slope circulating tank to facilitate the circulation of test water into the biogas slurry circulation tank volume 1 m3 shown in fig 2 a centrifugal pump rated lift of 35 m and rated flow of 2 m3 h was used as the power source for the device the inlet of the centrifugal pump was connected to the biogas slurry circulation tank through a pipeline the outlet was equipped with a check valve and a screen filter 125 µm filtration level filter cleaning frequency daily was fitted on the check valve the test device was equipped with three types of valves the return valve used for pressure relief during system operation the main valve used to control the closure of the drip irrigation system and the pressure regulating valve located in front of the pressure gauge measuring range 0 0 4 mpa used to regulate the pressure of the drip irrigation tape for the test the drip irrigation tape was laid in two layers which were repeating groups to facilitate the measurement of emitter discharge each layer of drip irrigation tape consisted of six types of drip irrigation tape 15 emitters for each type of drip irrigation tape in each layer and several measuring cylinders were placed under each type of tape on the mobile tray fig 2 a mixture of clean water and biogas slurry was used as the test water the test water was stored in a 1 m3 biogas slurry circulation tank where the biogas slurry obtained from the continuously stirred tank reactor a fully mixed anaerobic reactor and preliminary filtering was conducted through a centrifuge 370 µm 2 3 ratio design of biogas slurry and clean water different treatment processes and fermentation sources can cause considerable variations its conductivity considering the electrical conductivity ec required for normal crop growth it is possible to determine the ratio of biogas slurry to clean water based on the conductivity of the crop original biogas slurry and clean water in general the conductivity and concentration are positively correlated therefore we propose the following formulas to calculate the biogas slurry water ratio 1 ecbs vbs ecw vw ecp vbs vw and 2 m vbs vw where m is the volume ratio of biogas slurry to clean water v bs is the volume of biogas slurry m3 v w is the volume of clean water m3 ec bs is the conductivity of biogas slurry ms cm ec w is the conductivity of clean water ms cm and ec p is the set conductivity value suitable for plant generation ms cm 2 3 1 test i method feasibility verification firstly the irrigation water ec suitable for crop growth should generally be lower than 4ms cm moustarhfer et al 2016 mago et al 2022 therefore we set the conductivity values to those suitable for plant generation set value which are 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 ms cm and measured the original biogas slurry conductivity 15 51 ms cm and the clean water conductivity 0 56 ms cm secondly the corresponding ratios for achieving the set values were calculated using formulas 1 and 2 then according to the calculated ratios and volumes listed in table 2 we mixed biogas slurry with water and measured mixture conductivity using a conductivity meter three samples for each treatment finally we calculated the relative error between the measured average value and the set value in table 2 as is evident from table 1 the measured average value was slightly higher than the set value but the relative error is smaller ranging from 9 37 to 13 58 which proves that this method is reliable and can be used for the biogas slurry water ratios in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system 2 3 2 test ii method applied to the performance test of emitters three conductivity values suitable for plant generation were set i e 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 ms cm the original biogas slurry conductivity 13 31 ms cm and the clean water conductivity 0 75 ms cm was measured according to the methods and steps of test i the biogas slurry water ratios were calculated and adjusted appropriately and three test ratios were determined i e 1 20 low concentration slurry 1 8 medium concentration slurry and 1 4 high concentration slurry we divided the total volume of the biogas slurry tank 1000 l according to the determined biogas slurry water ratio 1 4 1 8 and 1 20 and calculated the corresponding volume required for treatment using three concentrations 200 l 110 l and 47 6 l subsequently we transferred it to the biogas slurry tank using a 20 l plastic bucket and 1 l measuring cylinder after adding the biogas slurry we filled the biogas slurry tank with clean water to obtain the required proportion the relevant data are presented in table 3 2 4 test index the biogas slurry water mixtures were tested on two independent devices before each operation the mixture in the tank was first stirred with a tube to ensure uniformity then the conductivity of the mixture was measured and when the relative error between the measured and set conductivities exceeds 10 water or biogas slurry was added to maintain its concentration the operating pressure of the drip irrigation tape was set as 0 1 mpa and used for a total of approximately 450 h between 08 00 and 17 00 each day samples were collected 15 times with the first time being the clean water test which only lasted for 30 min discharge tests were randomly conducted every other day on five emitter units at the head 0 3 m middle 3 6 m and end 6 9 m of the drip irrigation tape discharge was measured in 30 emitters for each emitter type each test lasted for 3 min and the emitter discharge was obtained using the weighing method the temperature change during the running time is shown in fig 3 the relative average discharge dra capra and scicolone 1998 and christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1941 were calculated using the equations 3 dra i 1 n q i t n q 0 and 4 cu 100 1 i 1 n q i t q t n q t where q 0 is the average discharge of the emitters in the clear water test l h q i t is the emitter discharge at time i under the biogas slurry drip irrigation system l h q t is the average emitter discharge under the biogas slurry drip irrigation system l h and n is the total number of emitters on the drip irrigation tape the emitters were directed downward without flushing throughout the test period 2 5 setting parameters of the ordered regression model the ordered regression model effectively determines the key characteristic parameters that affect emitter clogging liu et al 2018 in general an emitter is considered to be clogged when the relative average discharge is less than 75 in this study spss analysis software was used to establish and analyze an ordered regression model for five characteristic parameters of the emitters table 1 and to sequence the first clogging of the emitters dra 75 moreover a parallel line test was conducted in the ordered regression model the characteristic parameters of the emitters were considered as independent variables and dummy variables were set the dummy variables were defined as x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 and x 5 for the pressure compensation water inlet grid nominal discharge min w h and pathway length respectively categorical variables were assigned by variable assignment the values with pressure compensation or an inlet grid were assigned a value of 1 otherwise they were 0 the sequence of the first clogging of the emitter dra 75 was considered as the dependent variable and the variable code was defined as y in these procedures the significance threshold for the dummy variables was p 0 05 for the 15 sampling events if the first clogging occurred in the first five sampling events the variable was assigned a value of 1 if it occurred in the middle five sampling events the variable was assigned a value of 2 and if it occurred in the final sampling events the variable was assigned a value of 3 table 4 lists the specific model settings 3 results 3 1 variation in relative average discharge of emitters the evolution of the relative average discharge of the different emitters with respect to the operation time under different slurry concentrations i e different biogas slurry water ratios is shown in fig 4 under the three concentrations the relative average discharge of each type of emitter gradually decreased over time however there were noticeable differences in the relative average discharge of the different types of emitters as shown in fig 4 the internal patch emitters ipe1 and ipe2 demonstrated the worst performance under all three concentrations at the end of the operation the relative average discharge was only 5 40 of the original relative average discharge under the same concentration the anti clogging performance of ipe2 was slightly better than that of ipe1 as the nominal discharge of the emitter increased the size of the flow section corresponding to the internal channel increased and the anti clogging performance improved under these three slurry concentrations the pressure compensated emitter pce1 and single wing labyrinth emitter swle2 had better anti clogging performances than the other emitters especially with low and medium concentration slurries moreover the relative average discharge of the two emitters was generally greater than 75 throughout the operation indicating that there was little or no clogging in the case with high concentration slurry the two emitters pce1 and swle2 only clogged after approximately 200 h of continuous operation however the relative average discharge remained stable at more than 65 in the latter stages the pressure compensated emitter pce2 and single wing labyrinth emitter swle1 had better anti clogging performances than the ipes however they were not as good as the pce1 and swle2 emitters fig 5 shows temporal variation of dra of the emitters with six different specifications under three concentrations using a linear fit evidently there is a strong linear relationship between the relative flow and operation time of the emitters and most of the determination coefficients are above 0 8 high concentration 1 4 biogas slurry markedly reduces the relative average flow of each type of emitter with the increase in operation time compared to medium and low concentration biogas slurry moreover the difference between the effects of medium concentration 1 8 and low concentration 1 20 on the relative flow of emitters is negligible after the initial stage of operation 15 h the order of influence of high concentration biogas slurry on emitters is as follows ipe dra 77 swle dra 85 pce dra 93 by contrast in the middle stage 150 h high concentration biogas slurry has an apparent influence on pce emitters in the later stages of operation 300 432 h the average relative flow of each emitter exhibits an increasing trend and the influence of concentration on the relative flow of emitter is weakened however at the end of the operation the relative average discharge of all the emitters with the high concentration slurry was less than 75 which indicates that high concentration biogas slurry is not suitable for all types of emitters which will induce clogging in the drip system 3 2 variation in christiansen uniformity coefficient of emitters uniform water and fertilizer application is required to ensure a high quality and yield of crops to further quantify the anti clogging performances of various types of emitters in a biogas slurry drip irrigation system the christiansen uniformity coefficient was used to quantitatively evaluate the uniformity of the drip irrigation system the relationship between cu and the running time of each type of emitter under different slurry concentrations is shown in fig 6 similar to the trends in the relative average discharge the cu values of all the emitters decreased as the operation time increased the cu of all the emitters followed the same trends as the relative average discharge for example the uniformity of the pces was the highest the uniformity requirements of the drip irrigation system can be satisfied when the slurry concentration is low the cu of the internal patch emitter decreased most rapidly which indicates that the uniformity of the internal patch emitter was poorly adapted to the biogas slurries in particular with the high concentration slurries the cu was less than 80 of the required uniformity after less than 15 h the single wing labyrinth emitter particularly the large discharge single wing labyrinth emitter can satisfy the uniformity requirements with low and medium concentration slurries 3 3 form and location of emitter clogging substances to observe the characteristics such as the shape and position of the clogging substances the various types of emitters the clogged water inlets water outlets and internal channels of the emitters were photographed using a high power industrial camera as shown in fig 7 a large amount of clogging substances were found at the water inlet grid of the internal patch fig 7a and pressure compensated fig 7b emitters and around the inner wall of the drip irrigation tape at the same time there are also a large number of clogging substances on the upper and lower surfaces of the diaphragm of the pressure compensation emitter however comparatively few clogging substances were observed in the internal channel structures of the two emitters and the clogging substances exhibited characteristics of aggregates similar to sludge the single wing labyrinth emitter did not find obvious clogging accumulation at the inlet and only obvious clogging substances residue at the outlet 3 4 analysis of key characteristic parameter of anti clogging emitters the relationship between the emitter characteristic parameters and the first clogging time was analyzed using the ordered regression method the channel length was removed from the model to ensure its reliability because this parameter cannot make the model pass the parallel line test the results of the corrected ordered regression analysis are presented in table 5 the original hypothesis of the parallelism test was that the regression equations are parallel the parallel line significance values of the model under the three slurry concentrations 1 20 1 8 and 1 4 were 0 292 0 529 and 0 117 respectively which are greater than 0 05 in accordance with the original hypothesis the model can further analyze the key characteristic parameters affecting the anti clogging performance of the emitters through the parallelism test under the three slurry concentrations the presence of pressure compensation had a significant effect on the first clogging time of the emitters p 0 05 under the three concentrations and without pressure compensation x1 0 the corresponding model estimation coefficients were negative i e 4 079 4 619 and 4 256 respectively this indicates that emitters with a pressure compensation function cannot be readily blocked which is consistent with the fact that the relative average discharge of the pressure compensated emitter in fig 4 is higher than that of the internal patch emitter with the same inlet grid in addition the presence of a water inlet grid had a significant effect on the first clogging time of the emitters p 0 05 the regression coefficients in the case with no water inlet grid x2 0 under the three slurry concentrations were 2 552 2 712 and 2 074 respectively this indicates that the omission of an inlet grid is conducive to the improvement of anti clogging performance in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems under the three slurry concentrations the effects of nominal emitter discharge and channel depth on the first clogging time did not reach a significance level of 0 05 indicating that these characteristic parameters had no significant effect on the anti clogging performance of the emitters under biogas slurry drip irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 adaptability analysis of biogas slurry water ratios and emitter type in biogas slurry drip irrigation system under different fertilizer water ratios the adaptability of all emitters is poor in the early stages of system operation this may be due to the high concentration of suspended solids that readily agglomerate into macromolecular substances resulting in rapid adhesion and clogging in the early stages of system operation however the adaptability relatively improves in later stages there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon based on the change in water quality perspective since the mixed liquid of biogas slurry water is stored in the water tank it is easy to cause larger particles to settle and adhere to the bottom of the water tank which partly reduces the solid particles of the mixed liquid thereby reducing clogging speed of the emitter in later stages with respect to microbiology wang et al 2022 found that the emitter clogging substances contained some bacteria in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system and the reproductive capacity of bacteria can generally be weakened by low temperature which leads to the decrease of microbiological activity therefore phenomenon may be caused by weakened microbiological activity due to low temperature in the late stage of operation taylor et al 2006 fig 3 alternatively this may be attributed to the growth detachments and sediment of biofilms in biogas slurry drip irrigation system li et al 2012 overall the adaptability of emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems is enhanced however with the increase of biogas slurry concentration the applicability of each emitter to biogas slurry systems is obviously reduced which is consistent with the conclusions of chen et al 2020 an adequate ratio of biogas slurry to clean water is a critical factor for improving the service life of emitters and drip irrigation systems different types of emitters have different adaptability to different water quality drip irrigation systems like other water quality drip irrigation systems the pces exhibit an optimal performance adin and sacks 1991 li et al 2009 but the inner patch type has the worst adaptability to biogas slurry drip irrigation systems for the inner patch and single wing labyrinth emitters the flow of ipe2 is greater than ipe1 and the flow of swle2 is greater than swle1 indicating that the anti clogging performance of large flow emitters is also better than that of small flow emitters fig 4 this further verifies that non pressure compensation emitters with large discharge section sizes typically demonstrate high anti clogging performances however the anti clogging performance of a pressure compensated emitter with a small nominal discharge pce1 was higher than that of pce2 chen et al 2020 reported that the anti clogging performances of pces with large discharge are superior to those of pces with small nominal discharge their results are inconsistent with those of the present study which can be attributed to differences in the internal overflow structure of the two types of pces the internal flow channel area of the pces is small in this study and the corresponding discharge was around 1 3 l h however chen et al 2020 used the orifice type pces that do not have a labyrinth flow channel therefore the internal overflow hole area was large enough to produce a typical corresponding discharge of 4 12 l h implying that it is more difficult for the large flow specification to clog the changes in the relative average discharge and cu of the emitters during operation show that the slurry concentration has a considerable effect on the anti clogging performance of the various emitters on one hand it is necessary to select an appropriate emitter for the slurry concentration i e for low and medium concentration slurries the pces and large discharge swles were most suitable on the other hand for the chosen drip irrigation system and emitters the appropriate slurry concentration i e biogas slurry water ratio should be determined for example if the slurry concentration is too low then it may be difficult to adapt to long term operation regardless of the emitter type according to this study the appropriate emitters for long term and efficient operation are pces and large discharge swles however pces are more expensive than single wing labyrinth emitters by a factor of 5 10 therefore in terms of system safety application and economy the disposable drip irrigation system drip irrigation tape is replaced once a year has the greatest potential for chinese field crops if biogas slurry drip irrigation is implemented a large thin walled single wing labyrinth emitter should be used pressure compensating emitters will potentially remain the optimum choice for subsurface drip irrigation of cash crops facility agriculture however the applicability of inner patch emitters which are the most widely used type of emitters and with the most mature technology to biogas slurry drip irrigation systems cannot be guaranteed therefore it is crucial to investigate the application of inner patch emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems furthermore when implementing the biogas slurry drip irrigation technology the mixing ratio of biogas slurry to clean water should be at least 1 4 lastly biogas slurry to clean water ratios of 1 8 1 20 are conducive to the safe and stable operation of biogas slurry drip irrigation systems 4 2 effect of emitter structure on anti clogging performance in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems the formation position of emitter clogging substances can effectively reflect the influence of emitter structure on anti clogging performance the inner patch and pressure compensating emitter were clogged when a barrier was formed by the grid at the water inlet fig 7 the biogas slurry is highly viscous and settles easily shao et al 2019 moreover the internal patch and pces protruded and were embedded in the inner wall of the pipeline which blocked the solids suspended in the slurry the suspended solids in the biogas slurry settled and accumulated readily at the emitter inlet and affected the relative average discharge dra and uniformity coefficient cu of the emitter fig 4 and fig 6 owing to the absence of a grid at the inlet of the single wing labyrinth emitter clogs could not accumulate at the inlet which reduced the risk of the emitter becoming clogged quickly in addition several scholars have reported that the channel length of swles is longer than that of other types of emitters table 1 which increases the risk of becoming clogged wu et al 2008 hao et al 2017 however in this study the anti clogging performance was superior to that of the ipes with a small channel length this implies that a shorter flow channel length does not lead to easier emitter clogging but rather that the cross sectional area a is the key variable responsible for a emitter clogging recent studies have shown that the dimensionless parameter relative radius a1 2 l is closely related to the anti clogging performance of the emitters and the smaller the a1 2 l value the better the anti clogging performance li et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 these results suggest that the length of the emitter channel is not the only factor determining the anti clogging performance in addition it should be noted that there was no inlet grid in the single wing labyrinth emitter moreover it was made of a highly flexible pe material and the suspended solids in the biogas slurry were mostly viscous compressible substances consequently the clogging substances could be readily squeezed out under the action of water pressure and the substances were observed at the water outlet fig 7c the clogging mechanisms of the three types of emitters were different the clogging mechanism of the swles is attributed to the squeezed clogging which remains in the internal flow channel and outlet in contrast blockages in the other types of emitters were attributed to accumulations at the inlet grid caused by biogas slurry adhesion and sedimentation in addition the pressure compensating emitters with grids have a self flushing function thus the anti clogging performance of the pressure compensating emitters is superior to that of ipes however the precipitates accumulated on the upper and lower surfaces of the pressure compensating emitters fig 7b furthermore the deposition and accumulation of substances on the upper surface of the diaphragm reduces the moving distance of the diaphragm which is not conducive to the self flushing function in particular when the nominal discharge specification of the pressure compensating emitter is large more slurry passes through and the probability of substances accumulating quickly and clogging the diaphragm increases this may also be a factor in the optimal performance of the small nominal discharge pressure compensating emitter pce1 based on the analysis of the plug shape plug attachment position fig 7 and key characteristic parameters of the various types of emitters the characteristic parameters of the emitters were found to have a significant effect on the anti clogging performance the traditional inlet grid layout or structural form of patch emitters internal patch type and pressure compensation type does not only improve the anti clogging performance of emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation system but also causes clogging substances in biogas slurry to easily deposit at and block the water inlet which has a considerable effect on affects the anti clogging performance of emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems these findings can serve as a basis for the design and optimization of the characteristic parameters of emitters suitable for biogas slurry drip irrigation systems for the internal patch and pressure compensation emitters the existing emitter inlet grid has a horizontal upward design mode which can readily intercept and adhere to solids suspended in the slurry moreover the impurities in the slurry readily settle at the emitter inlet grid under the action of gravity increasing the risk that the emitter will be clogged rapidly therefore the emitter inlet grid can be designed with a longitudinal back item arrangement to reduce the interception and settlement of suspended solids under the action of gravity and reduce the rate of accumulation of clogging substances in the emitter inlet grid consequently the anti clogging performance of the emitter in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system would be improved for pces focus should be directed toward setting the elastic diaphragm away from the water inlet to reduce the deposition of impurities on the diaphragm and improve the effective rebound strength of the elastic diaphragm for swles the risk of retaining suspended solids at the channel and outlet can be reduced by increasing the cross sectional area of the flow channel or reducing the pathway length thus improving its adaptability in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems 5 conclusions in this study a simple and rapid method of identifying the biogas slurry water ratio suitable for crop irrigation conductivity based on the conductivity of biogas slurry and clean water is proposed the relative error of this method is approximately 10 which is considered feasible the slurry concentration i e biogas slurry water ratio had a noticeable effect on the relative average discharge and uniformity coefficient of the emitters a high concentration slurry increased the probability of the emitters getting clogged and the internal patch emitter exhibited the poorest adaptability to the biogas slurry drip irrigation system moreover the pces and large discharge swles performed better in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system and are highly applicable to such systems with low and medium concentration slurries the clogging positions of different types of emitters are different most of the clogs in the ipes and pces were at the inlet grid and the swles clogged at the internal flow channel and outlet the key characteristic parameters affecting the anti clogging performance of emitters in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system were the presence absence of a water inlet grid and pressure compensation according to the accumulation and movement characteristics of clogging substances in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system structural optimization measures such as improving the layout of the water inlet grid increasing the cross sectional area of the flow channel and reducing the pathway length can be implemented to improve the adaptability of emitters to biogas slurry drip irrigation systems considering factors such as irrigation uniformity in addition to the economic cost of the biogas slurry drip irrigation system large discharge thin walled swles and pces are recommended for use in one time field crops and multi year cash crops biogas slurry drip irrigation systems respectively in addition with respect to the emitter adaptability and long term operation of the system when biogas slurry is returned to the field with a drip irrigation system it should be mixed with clean water in a ratio of at least 1 4 in this study a ratio of biogas slurry to clean water of 1 8 1 20 was found to be conducive to the stable operation of the biogas slurry drip irrigation system the limitations of this study include the lack of flushing procedures for drip irrigation belts however this does not affect the validity of the obtained results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

conductivity levels 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 ms cm are set based on their suitability for crop growth the corresponding bswr is determined using the proposed method i e 1 20 1 8 and 1 4 the clogging dynamic process clogging location and characteristic parameters are analyzed using a hydraulic test an industrial camera and the ordered regression method for three common emitters under three bswr the results show that the proposed method relative error is approximately 10 which is considered feasible over time the discharge and uniformity of emitters decrease and subsequently remain constant as the slurry concentration increases the emitters clog more rapidly and internal patch emitters ipes show the lowest adaptability to bsdi systems the pressure compensation pces and single wing labyrinth emitters swles is better than ipes on anti clogging performance clogging mainly occurs at the inlet grid and the swles are clogged at the internal flow channel and outlet moreover the inlet grid and pressure compensation are key characteristic parameters affecting clogging the adaptability of emitters can be improved by changing the inlet grid layout increasing the cross sectional area of the flow channel and or reducing the pathway length based on irrigation uniformity and economic cost large discharge swles and pces are recommended for one time field crops and multi year cash crops respectively furthermore the bswr should be at least 1 4 and ratios of 1 8 1 20 are most conducive to stable operation this study serves as a guideline for future development of bsdi systems graphical

available on request 1 introduction in recent years fertigation has been widely implemented worldwide peng et al 2017 this technology uses drip or sprinkler irrigation systems as the carrier and it plays an important role in large scale agriculture at present water fertilizer integration technology uses soluble industrial fertilizers however several studies have revealed that long term application of chemical fertilizers reduces soil fertility dubey et al 2012 crop quality and yield xin et al 2017 which is not conducive to the sustainable development therefore various organic fertilizers have been considered as substitutes for chemical fertilizers such as solid biogas residue kizito et al 2019 and liquid biogas slurry kumar et al 2015 based on its physical characteristics biogas slurry could be a good alternative to chemical fertilizers in water fertilizer integration technology moreover biogas slurry is an efficient liquid fertilizer which contains a considerable amount of both macro and micro nutrients 1 5 n 1 1 p and 1 k in addition to appreciable quantities of organic matter kumar et al 2015 during digestion of biogas slurry these nutrients are transformed from organic form to dissolved states inorganic form this makes them more useful for plant uptake lansing et al 2010 which can improve the yield ferdous et al 2018 and nutritional quality xu et al 2019 of crops however as the residual product after biogas fermentation biogas slurry contains particle impurities and has high viscosity song et al 2011 at present biogas slurry is mainly applied with extensive surface irrigation du et al 2019 yin et al 2019 however in some areas it is applied using drip irrigation systems guido et al 2020 biogas slurry drip irrigation reduces labor costs and improves the efficiency of water and fertilizer utilization when biogas slurry is added to a drip irrigation system the emitters are the most vulnerable components if the emitters are clogged the uniformity of irrigation and fertilization is reduced which is not conducive to high crop yields scholars have investigated the anti clogging performance of emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems for example xiao et al 2021 found that an electromagnetic field can effectively control the formation of microbial films on patch emitters reducing the risk of biological clogging chen et al 2020 proposed a water fertilizer ratio and an optimal matching scheme for the working pressure and orifice pressure compensating emitter discharge specification however specific emitters were used in the research so their conclusions are not universal previous studies revealed that the performance of different types of emitters in drip irrigation systems varies considerably depending on the water quality for example in the case of subsurface drip irrigation with domestic water for up to eight years orifice emitters were found to exhibit the best anti clogging performance feng et al 2004 in contrast for reclaimed water drip irrigation the single wing labyrinth emitter exhibited inferior anti clogging performance compared to the internal patch type emitter which increases the clogging risk owing to a long flow channel hao et al 2017 considering the adaptability hydraulic performance and cost of reclaimed water drip irrigation pei et al 2014 reported that the cusp shaped saw tooth non pressure compensating emitters with short flow path are suitable for short term irrigation of annual crop whereas pressure compensating emitters with small outflow and flow stance index are suitable for irrigating perennial crop for drip irrigation systems near the yellow river highly sediment laden water considering the life cycle production cost carbon footprint and other factors single wing labyrinth emitters should be selected in the short term 1 year and internal patch irrigation combined with capillary flushing is more suitable in the long term 3 5years liu et al 2021 thus appropriate emitters should be selected for drip irrigation systems depending on the water quality there has been limited research on anti clogging mechanisms for biogas slurry drip irrigation systems and the adaptability of emitters under different biogas slurry concentrations biogas slurry water ratios if biogas slurry water ratio is too high the emitter will be clogged conversely if this ratio is too low biogas slurry can not provide enough nutrients when the irrigation amount reaches the crop water demand considering the potential broad applicability of biogas slurry drip irrigation technology it is necessary to investigate the clogging characteristics of different types of emitters under different biogas slurry concentrations and to determine the most suitable emitters and optimum ratios of biogas slurry to clear water the aims of this study are as follows 1 investigate the clogging characteristics of different types of emitters under different slurry concentrations 2 clarify the main reasons and characteristic parameters affecting the anti clogging performance of emitters under biogas slurry drip irrigation and 3 identify the most suitable biogas slurry water ratio and emitter type for biogas slurry drip irrigation systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 test emitter three types of emitters commonly used internal patch emitters ipes pressure compensated emitters pces and single wing labyrinth emitters swles and two nominal discharge specifications of each type were used in this study fig 1 shows the emitters and their specific characteristic parameters are listed in the table 1 the characteristic parameters of the pressure compensation nominal discharge and water inlet grid were provided by the manufacturer moreover the pathway length and min w h was measured using a high power industrial camera zy hd4k zong yuan china accuracy 0 01 mm among them min w h is minimum pathway size w is pathway width h is pathway depth and nominal discharge is measured at the rated pressure of 0 1 mpa 2 2 test device the experiments were conducted at the biogas station of beijing miyun haihua baili energy technology co ltd the test device was designed as a biogas slurry and water circulation test system which was built with a 9 m long aluminum profile and was equipped with a slope circulating tank to facilitate the circulation of test water into the biogas slurry circulation tank volume 1 m3 shown in fig 2 a centrifugal pump rated lift of 35 m and rated flow of 2 m3 h was used as the power source for the device the inlet of the centrifugal pump was connected to the biogas slurry circulation tank through a pipeline the outlet was equipped with a check valve and a screen filter 125 µm filtration level filter cleaning frequency daily was fitted on the check valve the test device was equipped with three types of valves the return valve used for pressure relief during system operation the main valve used to control the closure of the drip irrigation system and the pressure regulating valve located in front of the pressure gauge measuring range 0 0 4 mpa used to regulate the pressure of the drip irrigation tape for the test the drip irrigation tape was laid in two layers which were repeating groups to facilitate the measurement of emitter discharge each layer of drip irrigation tape consisted of six types of drip irrigation tape 15 emitters for each type of drip irrigation tape in each layer and several measuring cylinders were placed under each type of tape on the mobile tray fig 2 a mixture of clean water and biogas slurry was used as the test water the test water was stored in a 1 m3 biogas slurry circulation tank where the biogas slurry obtained from the continuously stirred tank reactor a fully mixed anaerobic reactor and preliminary filtering was conducted through a centrifuge 370 µm 2 3 ratio design of biogas slurry and clean water different treatment processes and fermentation sources can cause considerable variations its conductivity considering the electrical conductivity ec required for normal crop growth it is possible to determine the ratio of biogas slurry to clean water based on the conductivity of the crop original biogas slurry and clean water in general the conductivity and concentration are positively correlated therefore we propose the following formulas to calculate the biogas slurry water ratio 1 ecbs vbs ecw vw ecp vbs vw and 2 m vbs vw where m is the volume ratio of biogas slurry to clean water v bs is the volume of biogas slurry m3 v w is the volume of clean water m3 ec bs is the conductivity of biogas slurry ms cm ec w is the conductivity of clean water ms cm and ec p is the set conductivity value suitable for plant generation ms cm 2 3 1 test i method feasibility verification firstly the irrigation water ec suitable for crop growth should generally be lower than 4ms cm moustarhfer et al 2016 mago et al 2022 therefore we set the conductivity values to those suitable for plant generation set value which are 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 ms cm and measured the original biogas slurry conductivity 15 51 ms cm and the clean water conductivity 0 56 ms cm secondly the corresponding ratios for achieving the set values were calculated using formulas 1 and 2 then according to the calculated ratios and volumes listed in table 2 we mixed biogas slurry with water and measured mixture conductivity using a conductivity meter three samples for each treatment finally we calculated the relative error between the measured average value and the set value in table 2 as is evident from table 1 the measured average value was slightly higher than the set value but the relative error is smaller ranging from 9 37 to 13 58 which proves that this method is reliable and can be used for the biogas slurry water ratios in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system 2 3 2 test ii method applied to the performance test of emitters three conductivity values suitable for plant generation were set i e 1 3 2 3 and 3 3 ms cm the original biogas slurry conductivity 13 31 ms cm and the clean water conductivity 0 75 ms cm was measured according to the methods and steps of test i the biogas slurry water ratios were calculated and adjusted appropriately and three test ratios were determined i e 1 20 low concentration slurry 1 8 medium concentration slurry and 1 4 high concentration slurry we divided the total volume of the biogas slurry tank 1000 l according to the determined biogas slurry water ratio 1 4 1 8 and 1 20 and calculated the corresponding volume required for treatment using three concentrations 200 l 110 l and 47 6 l subsequently we transferred it to the biogas slurry tank using a 20 l plastic bucket and 1 l measuring cylinder after adding the biogas slurry we filled the biogas slurry tank with clean water to obtain the required proportion the relevant data are presented in table 3 2 4 test index the biogas slurry water mixtures were tested on two independent devices before each operation the mixture in the tank was first stirred with a tube to ensure uniformity then the conductivity of the mixture was measured and when the relative error between the measured and set conductivities exceeds 10 water or biogas slurry was added to maintain its concentration the operating pressure of the drip irrigation tape was set as 0 1 mpa and used for a total of approximately 450 h between 08 00 and 17 00 each day samples were collected 15 times with the first time being the clean water test which only lasted for 30 min discharge tests were randomly conducted every other day on five emitter units at the head 0 3 m middle 3 6 m and end 6 9 m of the drip irrigation tape discharge was measured in 30 emitters for each emitter type each test lasted for 3 min and the emitter discharge was obtained using the weighing method the temperature change during the running time is shown in fig 3 the relative average discharge dra capra and scicolone 1998 and christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1941 were calculated using the equations 3 dra i 1 n q i t n q 0 and 4 cu 100 1 i 1 n q i t q t n q t where q 0 is the average discharge of the emitters in the clear water test l h q i t is the emitter discharge at time i under the biogas slurry drip irrigation system l h q t is the average emitter discharge under the biogas slurry drip irrigation system l h and n is the total number of emitters on the drip irrigation tape the emitters were directed downward without flushing throughout the test period 2 5 setting parameters of the ordered regression model the ordered regression model effectively determines the key characteristic parameters that affect emitter clogging liu et al 2018 in general an emitter is considered to be clogged when the relative average discharge is less than 75 in this study spss analysis software was used to establish and analyze an ordered regression model for five characteristic parameters of the emitters table 1 and to sequence the first clogging of the emitters dra 75 moreover a parallel line test was conducted in the ordered regression model the characteristic parameters of the emitters were considered as independent variables and dummy variables were set the dummy variables were defined as x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 and x 5 for the pressure compensation water inlet grid nominal discharge min w h and pathway length respectively categorical variables were assigned by variable assignment the values with pressure compensation or an inlet grid were assigned a value of 1 otherwise they were 0 the sequence of the first clogging of the emitter dra 75 was considered as the dependent variable and the variable code was defined as y in these procedures the significance threshold for the dummy variables was p 0 05 for the 15 sampling events if the first clogging occurred in the first five sampling events the variable was assigned a value of 1 if it occurred in the middle five sampling events the variable was assigned a value of 2 and if it occurred in the final sampling events the variable was assigned a value of 3 table 4 lists the specific model settings 3 results 3 1 variation in relative average discharge of emitters the evolution of the relative average discharge of the different emitters with respect to the operation time under different slurry concentrations i e different biogas slurry water ratios is shown in fig 4 under the three concentrations the relative average discharge of each type of emitter gradually decreased over time however there were noticeable differences in the relative average discharge of the different types of emitters as shown in fig 4 the internal patch emitters ipe1 and ipe2 demonstrated the worst performance under all three concentrations at the end of the operation the relative average discharge was only 5 40 of the original relative average discharge under the same concentration the anti clogging performance of ipe2 was slightly better than that of ipe1 as the nominal discharge of the emitter increased the size of the flow section corresponding to the internal channel increased and the anti clogging performance improved under these three slurry concentrations the pressure compensated emitter pce1 and single wing labyrinth emitter swle2 had better anti clogging performances than the other emitters especially with low and medium concentration slurries moreover the relative average discharge of the two emitters was generally greater than 75 throughout the operation indicating that there was little or no clogging in the case with high concentration slurry the two emitters pce1 and swle2 only clogged after approximately 200 h of continuous operation however the relative average discharge remained stable at more than 65 in the latter stages the pressure compensated emitter pce2 and single wing labyrinth emitter swle1 had better anti clogging performances than the ipes however they were not as good as the pce1 and swle2 emitters fig 5 shows temporal variation of dra of the emitters with six different specifications under three concentrations using a linear fit evidently there is a strong linear relationship between the relative flow and operation time of the emitters and most of the determination coefficients are above 0 8 high concentration 1 4 biogas slurry markedly reduces the relative average flow of each type of emitter with the increase in operation time compared to medium and low concentration biogas slurry moreover the difference between the effects of medium concentration 1 8 and low concentration 1 20 on the relative flow of emitters is negligible after the initial stage of operation 15 h the order of influence of high concentration biogas slurry on emitters is as follows ipe dra 77 swle dra 85 pce dra 93 by contrast in the middle stage 150 h high concentration biogas slurry has an apparent influence on pce emitters in the later stages of operation 300 432 h the average relative flow of each emitter exhibits an increasing trend and the influence of concentration on the relative flow of emitter is weakened however at the end of the operation the relative average discharge of all the emitters with the high concentration slurry was less than 75 which indicates that high concentration biogas slurry is not suitable for all types of emitters which will induce clogging in the drip system 3 2 variation in christiansen uniformity coefficient of emitters uniform water and fertilizer application is required to ensure a high quality and yield of crops to further quantify the anti clogging performances of various types of emitters in a biogas slurry drip irrigation system the christiansen uniformity coefficient was used to quantitatively evaluate the uniformity of the drip irrigation system the relationship between cu and the running time of each type of emitter under different slurry concentrations is shown in fig 6 similar to the trends in the relative average discharge the cu values of all the emitters decreased as the operation time increased the cu of all the emitters followed the same trends as the relative average discharge for example the uniformity of the pces was the highest the uniformity requirements of the drip irrigation system can be satisfied when the slurry concentration is low the cu of the internal patch emitter decreased most rapidly which indicates that the uniformity of the internal patch emitter was poorly adapted to the biogas slurries in particular with the high concentration slurries the cu was less than 80 of the required uniformity after less than 15 h the single wing labyrinth emitter particularly the large discharge single wing labyrinth emitter can satisfy the uniformity requirements with low and medium concentration slurries 3 3 form and location of emitter clogging substances to observe the characteristics such as the shape and position of the clogging substances the various types of emitters the clogged water inlets water outlets and internal channels of the emitters were photographed using a high power industrial camera as shown in fig 7 a large amount of clogging substances were found at the water inlet grid of the internal patch fig 7a and pressure compensated fig 7b emitters and around the inner wall of the drip irrigation tape at the same time there are also a large number of clogging substances on the upper and lower surfaces of the diaphragm of the pressure compensation emitter however comparatively few clogging substances were observed in the internal channel structures of the two emitters and the clogging substances exhibited characteristics of aggregates similar to sludge the single wing labyrinth emitter did not find obvious clogging accumulation at the inlet and only obvious clogging substances residue at the outlet 3 4 analysis of key characteristic parameter of anti clogging emitters the relationship between the emitter characteristic parameters and the first clogging time was analyzed using the ordered regression method the channel length was removed from the model to ensure its reliability because this parameter cannot make the model pass the parallel line test the results of the corrected ordered regression analysis are presented in table 5 the original hypothesis of the parallelism test was that the regression equations are parallel the parallel line significance values of the model under the three slurry concentrations 1 20 1 8 and 1 4 were 0 292 0 529 and 0 117 respectively which are greater than 0 05 in accordance with the original hypothesis the model can further analyze the key characteristic parameters affecting the anti clogging performance of the emitters through the parallelism test under the three slurry concentrations the presence of pressure compensation had a significant effect on the first clogging time of the emitters p 0 05 under the three concentrations and without pressure compensation x1 0 the corresponding model estimation coefficients were negative i e 4 079 4 619 and 4 256 respectively this indicates that emitters with a pressure compensation function cannot be readily blocked which is consistent with the fact that the relative average discharge of the pressure compensated emitter in fig 4 is higher than that of the internal patch emitter with the same inlet grid in addition the presence of a water inlet grid had a significant effect on the first clogging time of the emitters p 0 05 the regression coefficients in the case with no water inlet grid x2 0 under the three slurry concentrations were 2 552 2 712 and 2 074 respectively this indicates that the omission of an inlet grid is conducive to the improvement of anti clogging performance in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems under the three slurry concentrations the effects of nominal emitter discharge and channel depth on the first clogging time did not reach a significance level of 0 05 indicating that these characteristic parameters had no significant effect on the anti clogging performance of the emitters under biogas slurry drip irrigation 4 discussion 4 1 adaptability analysis of biogas slurry water ratios and emitter type in biogas slurry drip irrigation system under different fertilizer water ratios the adaptability of all emitters is poor in the early stages of system operation this may be due to the high concentration of suspended solids that readily agglomerate into macromolecular substances resulting in rapid adhesion and clogging in the early stages of system operation however the adaptability relatively improves in later stages there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon based on the change in water quality perspective since the mixed liquid of biogas slurry water is stored in the water tank it is easy to cause larger particles to settle and adhere to the bottom of the water tank which partly reduces the solid particles of the mixed liquid thereby reducing clogging speed of the emitter in later stages with respect to microbiology wang et al 2022 found that the emitter clogging substances contained some bacteria in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system and the reproductive capacity of bacteria can generally be weakened by low temperature which leads to the decrease of microbiological activity therefore phenomenon may be caused by weakened microbiological activity due to low temperature in the late stage of operation taylor et al 2006 fig 3 alternatively this may be attributed to the growth detachments and sediment of biofilms in biogas slurry drip irrigation system li et al 2012 overall the adaptability of emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems is enhanced however with the increase of biogas slurry concentration the applicability of each emitter to biogas slurry systems is obviously reduced which is consistent with the conclusions of chen et al 2020 an adequate ratio of biogas slurry to clean water is a critical factor for improving the service life of emitters and drip irrigation systems different types of emitters have different adaptability to different water quality drip irrigation systems like other water quality drip irrigation systems the pces exhibit an optimal performance adin and sacks 1991 li et al 2009 but the inner patch type has the worst adaptability to biogas slurry drip irrigation systems for the inner patch and single wing labyrinth emitters the flow of ipe2 is greater than ipe1 and the flow of swle2 is greater than swle1 indicating that the anti clogging performance of large flow emitters is also better than that of small flow emitters fig 4 this further verifies that non pressure compensation emitters with large discharge section sizes typically demonstrate high anti clogging performances however the anti clogging performance of a pressure compensated emitter with a small nominal discharge pce1 was higher than that of pce2 chen et al 2020 reported that the anti clogging performances of pces with large discharge are superior to those of pces with small nominal discharge their results are inconsistent with those of the present study which can be attributed to differences in the internal overflow structure of the two types of pces the internal flow channel area of the pces is small in this study and the corresponding discharge was around 1 3 l h however chen et al 2020 used the orifice type pces that do not have a labyrinth flow channel therefore the internal overflow hole area was large enough to produce a typical corresponding discharge of 4 12 l h implying that it is more difficult for the large flow specification to clog the changes in the relative average discharge and cu of the emitters during operation show that the slurry concentration has a considerable effect on the anti clogging performance of the various emitters on one hand it is necessary to select an appropriate emitter for the slurry concentration i e for low and medium concentration slurries the pces and large discharge swles were most suitable on the other hand for the chosen drip irrigation system and emitters the appropriate slurry concentration i e biogas slurry water ratio should be determined for example if the slurry concentration is too low then it may be difficult to adapt to long term operation regardless of the emitter type according to this study the appropriate emitters for long term and efficient operation are pces and large discharge swles however pces are more expensive than single wing labyrinth emitters by a factor of 5 10 therefore in terms of system safety application and economy the disposable drip irrigation system drip irrigation tape is replaced once a year has the greatest potential for chinese field crops if biogas slurry drip irrigation is implemented a large thin walled single wing labyrinth emitter should be used pressure compensating emitters will potentially remain the optimum choice for subsurface drip irrigation of cash crops facility agriculture however the applicability of inner patch emitters which are the most widely used type of emitters and with the most mature technology to biogas slurry drip irrigation systems cannot be guaranteed therefore it is crucial to investigate the application of inner patch emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems furthermore when implementing the biogas slurry drip irrigation technology the mixing ratio of biogas slurry to clean water should be at least 1 4 lastly biogas slurry to clean water ratios of 1 8 1 20 are conducive to the safe and stable operation of biogas slurry drip irrigation systems 4 2 effect of emitter structure on anti clogging performance in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems the formation position of emitter clogging substances can effectively reflect the influence of emitter structure on anti clogging performance the inner patch and pressure compensating emitter were clogged when a barrier was formed by the grid at the water inlet fig 7 the biogas slurry is highly viscous and settles easily shao et al 2019 moreover the internal patch and pces protruded and were embedded in the inner wall of the pipeline which blocked the solids suspended in the slurry the suspended solids in the biogas slurry settled and accumulated readily at the emitter inlet and affected the relative average discharge dra and uniformity coefficient cu of the emitter fig 4 and fig 6 owing to the absence of a grid at the inlet of the single wing labyrinth emitter clogs could not accumulate at the inlet which reduced the risk of the emitter becoming clogged quickly in addition several scholars have reported that the channel length of swles is longer than that of other types of emitters table 1 which increases the risk of becoming clogged wu et al 2008 hao et al 2017 however in this study the anti clogging performance was superior to that of the ipes with a small channel length this implies that a shorter flow channel length does not lead to easier emitter clogging but rather that the cross sectional area a is the key variable responsible for a emitter clogging recent studies have shown that the dimensionless parameter relative radius a1 2 l is closely related to the anti clogging performance of the emitters and the smaller the a1 2 l value the better the anti clogging performance li et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 these results suggest that the length of the emitter channel is not the only factor determining the anti clogging performance in addition it should be noted that there was no inlet grid in the single wing labyrinth emitter moreover it was made of a highly flexible pe material and the suspended solids in the biogas slurry were mostly viscous compressible substances consequently the clogging substances could be readily squeezed out under the action of water pressure and the substances were observed at the water outlet fig 7c the clogging mechanisms of the three types of emitters were different the clogging mechanism of the swles is attributed to the squeezed clogging which remains in the internal flow channel and outlet in contrast blockages in the other types of emitters were attributed to accumulations at the inlet grid caused by biogas slurry adhesion and sedimentation in addition the pressure compensating emitters with grids have a self flushing function thus the anti clogging performance of the pressure compensating emitters is superior to that of ipes however the precipitates accumulated on the upper and lower surfaces of the pressure compensating emitters fig 7b furthermore the deposition and accumulation of substances on the upper surface of the diaphragm reduces the moving distance of the diaphragm which is not conducive to the self flushing function in particular when the nominal discharge specification of the pressure compensating emitter is large more slurry passes through and the probability of substances accumulating quickly and clogging the diaphragm increases this may also be a factor in the optimal performance of the small nominal discharge pressure compensating emitter pce1 based on the analysis of the plug shape plug attachment position fig 7 and key characteristic parameters of the various types of emitters the characteristic parameters of the emitters were found to have a significant effect on the anti clogging performance the traditional inlet grid layout or structural form of patch emitters internal patch type and pressure compensation type does not only improve the anti clogging performance of emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation system but also causes clogging substances in biogas slurry to easily deposit at and block the water inlet which has a considerable effect on affects the anti clogging performance of emitters in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems these findings can serve as a basis for the design and optimization of the characteristic parameters of emitters suitable for biogas slurry drip irrigation systems for the internal patch and pressure compensation emitters the existing emitter inlet grid has a horizontal upward design mode which can readily intercept and adhere to solids suspended in the slurry moreover the impurities in the slurry readily settle at the emitter inlet grid under the action of gravity increasing the risk that the emitter will be clogged rapidly therefore the emitter inlet grid can be designed with a longitudinal back item arrangement to reduce the interception and settlement of suspended solids under the action of gravity and reduce the rate of accumulation of clogging substances in the emitter inlet grid consequently the anti clogging performance of the emitter in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system would be improved for pces focus should be directed toward setting the elastic diaphragm away from the water inlet to reduce the deposition of impurities on the diaphragm and improve the effective rebound strength of the elastic diaphragm for swles the risk of retaining suspended solids at the channel and outlet can be reduced by increasing the cross sectional area of the flow channel or reducing the pathway length thus improving its adaptability in biogas slurry drip irrigation systems 5 conclusions in this study a simple and rapid method of identifying the biogas slurry water ratio suitable for crop irrigation conductivity based on the conductivity of biogas slurry and clean water is proposed the relative error of this method is approximately 10 which is considered feasible the slurry concentration i e biogas slurry water ratio had a noticeable effect on the relative average discharge and uniformity coefficient of the emitters a high concentration slurry increased the probability of the emitters getting clogged and the internal patch emitter exhibited the poorest adaptability to the biogas slurry drip irrigation system moreover the pces and large discharge swles performed better in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system and are highly applicable to such systems with low and medium concentration slurries the clogging positions of different types of emitters are different most of the clogs in the ipes and pces were at the inlet grid and the swles clogged at the internal flow channel and outlet the key characteristic parameters affecting the anti clogging performance of emitters in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system were the presence absence of a water inlet grid and pressure compensation according to the accumulation and movement characteristics of clogging substances in the biogas slurry drip irrigation system structural optimization measures such as improving the layout of the water inlet grid increasing the cross sectional area of the flow channel and reducing the pathway length can be implemented to improve the adaptability of emitters to biogas slurry drip irrigation systems considering factors such as irrigation uniformity in addition to the economic cost of the biogas slurry drip irrigation system large discharge thin walled swles and pces are recommended for use in one time field crops and multi year cash crops biogas slurry drip irrigation systems respectively in addition with respect to the emitter adaptability and long term operation of the system when biogas slurry is returned to the field with a drip irrigation system it should be mixed with clean water in a ratio of at least 1 4 in this study a ratio of biogas slurry to clean water of 1 8 1 20 was found to be conducive to the stable operation of the biogas slurry drip irrigation system the limitations of this study include the lack of flushing procedures for drip irrigation belts however this does not affect the validity of the obtained results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

estimates and in regional irrigation water demand studies especially in areas with limited weather data a major limitation is that without local calibration the constant parameters used in these methods usually cannot ensure the same reliability in regional analysis on the other hand the controlling variables of eto under different climatic conditions and how they are related to the structures of these methods have not been adequately addressed yet herein we evaluated the performance of three commonly used temperature based methods i e thornthwaite th t blaney criddle bc t and hargreaves and samani hs t and five radiation based methods i e makkink ma r priestley taylor pt r jensen and haise jh r turc tu r and abtew ab r for regional eto estimates and calibrated them using the penman monteith method monthly meteorological data 1961 2010 from 15 weather stations in texas united states covering humid subhumid semiarid and arid climates were used the hs t method is recommended for regional analysis if reliable wind speed and relative humidity data are not available the radiative component was the driving factor of eto accounting for 72 84 of its variation in the warm season in all climates therefore temperature and radiation based methods performed well and showed little variation in the warm season however we demonstrated that the vapor pressure deficit impact on eto variations could be as high as 43 49 in the cool season in subhumid semiarid and arid climates and wind speed impact on eto variations was 4 12 and 10 16 in humid semiarid and arid climates respectively to accurately reflect these impacts we adjusted the hs t and pt r methods by multiplying a calibration free coefficient by doing so the accuracy of eto under cool dry and windy conditions is considerably improved compared with the locally calibrated methods the adjusted hs t and pt r methods can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of applying the less data intensive eto methods to predict regional or global irrigation water demand keywords reference evapotranspiration radiation based temperature based dry and windy conditions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto is essential for irrigation water management water balance studies and hydrologic and crop modeling particularly due to increasing global irrigation water demand iwd in a warming climate florke et al 2018 haddeland et al 2014 raza et al 2021 the most common method for irrigation water estimation is the crop coefficient approach i e adjusting eto by crop coefficients allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1976 when required meteorological data are available the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith equation fao pm allen et al 1998 is the recommended standard method for eto estimation since it is more physically based and can be applied globally without local calibration however the fao pm method requires a diverse set of reliable weather data including solar radiation air temperature relative humidity rh and wind speed which are usually unavailable in many regions in addition considerable uncertainties still exist in rh and wind speed forecasts from global climate models gcms which hinders the use of the pm method in regional and global eto and iwd studies lai et al 2022 in addition to the physical based combination methods like penman 1948 and fao pm method allen et al 1998 other approaches currently used for eto estimation are based on 1 empirical relationships 2 machine learning algorithms 3 water budget 4 mass transfer 5 temperature and 6 radiation empirical methods like multiple regression analysis yirga 2019 are unsuitable for regional studies because the variables selected as predictors are empirical and site specific machine learning algorithms e g artificial neural networks ann random forest rf support vector machines svm and extreme learning machine elm ahmadi et al 2021 bellido jiménez et al 2021 chia et al 2021 wang et al 2019 are usually trained and tested in the same region and therefore their estimation accuracy in other regions are not guaranteed water budget methods are rarely used in practice due to the difficulty and accumulated error in the measurements of their required variables such as deep percolation subsurface flow and capillary rise guitjens 1982 mass transfer methods are attractive in estimating the evaporation of free water bodies like lakes and reservoirs singh and xu 1997 but less robust for vegetated surfaces than other approaches like temperature and radiation based methods valipour et al 2017 xu and singh 2002 the commonly used temperature based methods include thornthwaite th t thornthwaite 1948 hargreaves and samani hs t hargreaves and samani 1985 and blaney criddle bc t blaney and criddle 1950 and the radiation based ones include priestley taylor pt r priestley and taylor 1972 makkink ma r makkink 1957 and turc tu r turc 1961 the use of temperature and radiation based methods has two advantages 1 only temperature or radiation related data are required as input and 2 acceptable accuracy which has been extensively verified against the lysimeter observations or the estimation using the reference method fao pm under humid subhumid semiarid arid and high altitude climatic conditions amatya et al 1995 azhar and perera 2011 djaman et al 2019 liu et al 2017 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 xu and singh 2002 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2021 therefore radiation based doll and siebert 2002 rost et al 2008 schmied et al 2021 and temperature based methods grogan et al 2022 wisser et al 2008 are widely used in regional and global iwd studies however regional and global iwd studies using temperature and radiation based methods show high uncertainties since the default parameters in those methods cannot guarantee the same reliability in different climatic regions in humid climates radiation based methods usually perform better than temperature based methods but both methods can provide reasonable estimates amatya et al 1995 azhar and perera 2011 djaman et al 2019 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 xu and singh 2002 xu et al 2013 in warm and dry climates the aerodynamic component primarily affected by wind speed and rh becomes more significant matsoukas et al 2011 and warm air advection from unirrigated areas often contributes extra sensible heat energy for evapotranspiration the advection of sensible heat energy can be reflected in the temperature based methods by changing temperature however the radiation based methods cannot adequately compensate for the advection effect and thus are not suggested for semiarid or arid climates didari and ahmadi 2019 for example temperature based methods e g hs t and bc t allen and pruitt 1986 were reported to have better performance than radiation based methods in sub humid nandagiri and kovoor 2006 and semiarid climates bakhtiari et al 2011 er raki et al 2010 gao et al 2017 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 tabari 2010 however inconsistent results were reported in other studies for example in an arid climate with light wind conditions in aksu china gao et al 2017 reported that the pt r method which is radiation based showed the best performance followed by other temperature or radiation based methods like hs t ma r tu r and bc t in a warm humid climate with moderate to strong wind tabari 2010 found that the hs t method temperature based performed better than radiation based methods including tu r pt r and ma r moreover both temperature and radiation based methods showed high uncertainty under dry and windy conditions and their performance did not improve significantly even after local calibration akhavan et al 2018 didari and ahmadi 2019 valipour et al 2017 these studies suggest that the relative contributions of weather parameters to the eto variation largely vary with climatic conditions leading to inconsistent performance of different methods particularly under dry and windy conditions in addition what the controlling weather parameters of eto under different climatic conditions are and how they relate to the structures of the temperature and radiation based methods have not been comprehensively understood and adequately addressed in previous studies ahmadi and javanbakht 2020 hu et al 2021 kang et al 2021 ng et al 2022 these deficiencies hinder the effort of applying the less data intensive methods to predict regional or global irrigation water demand herein we selected eight more recommended methods based on their performances in previous studies including three temperature based methods i e th t bc t and hs t and five radiation based methods i e ma r pt r jensen and haise jh r jensen and haise 1963 tu r and abtew ab r abtew 1996 to conduct a systematic evaluation under various climatic conditions by comparing them with the reference method i e fao pm to do so we collected 50 years 1961 2010 of monthly meteorological data from 15 weather stations with moderate to strong wind speed in texas united states covering humid subhumid semiarid and arid climate types the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the performance of the selected temperature or radiation based methods with the default and local calibration values for regional eto analysis 2 identify the controlling weather parameters in the eto estimation under different climate types and 3 improve the performance of the selected methods under dry and windy conditions through adequate consideration of the aerodynamic component 2 material and methods more details about the reference method i e fao pm and the eight temperature and radiation based eto methods were first introduced second the performance evaluation was carried out in the following three aspects 1 the eto values estimated using the eight methods with default constant parameters were compared with the fao pm estimates and then calibrated with an automatic optimization method 2 model verification was conducted at the chosen stations to assess the model ability to perform long term projections and 3 the calibrated regional parameters for the eight methods were evaluated for regional analysis third sensitivity analysis using the non dimensional relative sensitivity coefficients was conducted to understand the model structure and quantify the contributions of meteorological parameters to eto variations last we attempted to improve the performance of the selected methods under dry and windy conditions based on the sensitivity analysis results as mentioned above the fao pm method requires high quality meteorological data and elevation information which is used to calculate the psychrometric constant table 1 in contrast the eight temperature or radiation based eto methods require much fewer inputs than does the fao pm method table 1 for example the temperature based methods only require temperature and other parameters e g daytime length and extraterrestrial radiation r a are available from standard tables the time step input data and definition associated with each eto method vary widely given the nonlinear nature of eto daily meteorological data can lead to more accurate estimation than monthly averages nevertheless daily weather data show high uncertainty since its quality control is more difficult than monthly data therefore monthly data are suggested when analyzing long term trends vicente serrano et al 2014 consistent definitions of parameters time steps monthly and units were used for model comparison 2 1 fao pm method compared with the original pm method a hypothetical reference grass surface with an assumed grass height of 0 12 m an albedo of 0 23 and a fixed surface resistance r s 70 s m 1 is used by the fao pm method allen et al 1998 hence the fao pm method depends only on climatic variables i e available energy a vapor pressure deficit d and aerodynamic resistance r a 1 et o 0 408 a γ 900 t 273 u 2 d γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 a r

and calculations of each variable are detailed in the appendix the change in eto can be attributed to the changes in a d and r a to better understand the relative contributions of a d and r a to the dynamics of eto the non dimensional relative sensitivity coefficients i e s a s d and s r a are used beven 1979 mccuen 1974 rana and katerji 1998 2 s a et o a a et o 1 1 900 γ t 273 u 2 d a 3 s d et o

u 2 u 2 et o s r a 2 2 temperature and radiation based methods most temperature based methods are developed based on the empirical relationships of air temperature or day length with field eto measurements table 2 typical temperature based methods can be formulated as eqs 7 or 8 xu and singh 2001 6 et o c t n 7 et o c 1 p c 2 t c 3 h where t is the mean air temperature p is the daytime length h is a humidity term and n c c 1 c 2 and c 3 are constants the th t method has a form similar to eq 6 and the bc t and hs t methods show a similar form as eq 7 the th t method correlates mean temperature with eto based on water balance solar radiation r s can be estimated by r a using the terms in the hs t method i e r s α r a t max t min 1 2 where α is an adjustment coefficient 0 16 for interior locations or 0 19 for locations near the ocean allen et al 1998 daytime length in the bc t method is an indicator of solar radiation radiation based methods follow the energy balance equation using net solar radiation r n or r s as the primary parameter jensen et al 1990 the available energy for evapotranspiration includes r n g and sensible energy h h may increase or decrease due to the heat advection effect when strong winds provide significant heating or cooling to the reference surface this advection of sensible heat energy is treated in the pm method by introducing an aerodynamic term however radiation based methods cannot adequately compensate for the advection effect since they assume that the relative contribution of solar radiation to eto is a constant i e s a in eq 2 radiation based methods can be formulated as 8 et o 1 s a et eq 1 s a γ r n g λ where s a represents the relative contribution of available energy to eto with wind speed having a negligible effect i e s r a 0 it is similar to the decoupling coefficient introduced by jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 to analyze the relative contribution of solar radiation and aerodynamic terms to the evapotranspiration process by replacing 1 s a 1 26 eq 8 is transferred to the pt r method eq 13 in table 2 it also indicates that solar radiation accounts for 79 4 s a 1 1 26 of the eto variation in the pt r method the ma r jh r tu r and ab r methods use r s instead of r n since r s can be linearly associated with r n with g 0 and an albedo of 0 23 the ma r method can be considered as a special form of eq 8 when disregarding the aerodynamic term and compensating for with two empirical coefficients eq 12 in table 2 the term γ is a function of temperature with given atmospheric pressure and therefore it can be replaced with different forms related to temperature e g t 3 in jh r t t 15 in tu r and t max in ab r method because of the empirical nature the default values of constants in each method usually represent certain climatic conditions and as a consequence calibration is usually necessary when applying temperature and radiation based methods in different climatic regions 2 3 model evaluation root mean square error rmse and relative error re were used to evaluate the model performance 17 rmse i 1 n x i et o i 2 n 18 re x i et o i et o i 100 where x i and et 0 i are the ith calculated eto using the selected method and the fao pm method respectively and n is the number of observations the method with the best performance has rmse and re values close to 0 here an re of 20 was used as an arbitrary measurement of the acceptance of each method xu and singh 2001 the monthly eto values calculated with each method are correlated with the fao pm estimates using linear regression 19 y ax b where y represents fao pm eto and x is the eto calculated in each method a and b are the slope and intercept respectively the best method has the highest coefficient of determination r 2 with a close to 1 and b close to 0 for better comparison the intercept was set as 0 and the corresponding slope and r 2 were recalculated an automatic optimization method was used to obtain the best parameters involved in each method singh and xu 1997 the calibrated parameters is obtained by minimizing the residual sum of squares rss as shown in eq 20 20 minimum rss i 1 n x i et o i 2 2 4 regional analysis the criteria used in selecting eto methods best suitable for regional analysis are described as follows 1 it can be used to estimate eto under different climate types 2 it can capture the peak and seasonal variations of eto 3 if the default parameter in a method overestimates underestimates in a specific climate then the error should be systematic and correctable 4 it can be used to evaluate the long term variation of eto and 5 for methods that satisfy all the criteria the one with fewer inputs is preferred 2 5 study area texas has the largest cropland area in the united states located in

plains region 2 which have dry high radiation and windy environments monthly meteorological data between 1961 and 2010 from 15 stations covering most of the ten climate divisions were downloaded from climate date online provided by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web air temperature and relative humidity measured from these stations were at 2 m height to reduce the calculation uncertainty solar radiation data including r s and r a were obtained from direct radiation measurement which were downloaded from the national solar radiation database https rredc nrel gov solar old data nsrdb r n was calculated following allen et al 1998 wind speeds from noaa climate stations are generally measured at a 10 m height and they were converted to 2 m wind speeds using the method suggested by allen et al 1998 as detailed in the appendix the integrity quality and reasonableness of these weather data were evaluated using the procedures and guidelines recommended by allen 1996 the evaluation of aridity impact is shown in fig a 1 the annual means of primary meteorological variables from 1961 to 2010 are shown in table 3 and their seasonal and annual variations are detailed in fig a 2 here three seasons were identified based on air temperature variation i e warm season may through sep transition season march april and october and cool season jan feb nov and dec the warm season is of particular interest since it is the growing season with high irrigation requirements moderate to strong advection was observed in both arid and humid climates wind speed among 3 5 m s and the wind speed had no apparent seasonal variation fig a 2 3 results 3 1 evaluation of each method with default constant values using the default constant values in each method table 2 resulted in significant errors in monthly eto estimation at different locations with the highest rmse of all methods in arid climate 0 62 2 66 mm d 1 followed by semiarid 0 78 1 62 mm d 1 subhumid 0 56 1 52 mm d 1 and humid 0 34 1 14 mm d 1 climates table 4 when concerning the mean rmse of all 15 stations the best method was hs t 0 64 mm d 1 followed by tu r 0 76 ab r 0 82 pt r 0 90 jh r 1 03 bc t 1 05 ma r 1 37 and th t 1 68 hs t was the only method showing comparable reliability across all climate types i e the re of annual mean eto at all stations was within 20 also it had the lowest rmse at one station in arid and semiarid regions and five stations in humid regions table 4 one possible explanation is that t max t min 1 2 in the hs r method was highly correlated with relative humidity r2 0 96 with rh 50 n 7738 therefore the effect of relative humidity impact on eto can be considered the three radiation based methods i e pt r tu r and ab r worked quite well for annual eto estimates in humid climates but they substantially underestimated eto in arid and semiarid climates by 14 18 19 31 and 43 48 in warm transition and cool seasons respectively table a 1 table a 2 the tu r method performed well in arid climates table 4 since an adjustment was made when rh 50 eq 15 for methods initially developed in a relatively dry environment e g bc t and jh r they underestimated the mean annual eto by 7 and 12 in arid and semiarid regions but significantly overestimated eto in humid regions the ma r method had high r 2 but systematically underestimated eto at all stations indicating that the default constant value was too small of all the methods evaluated the th t method performed the poorest in estimating monthly eto but it still showed acceptable accuracy in the warm season re within 20 the peak and seasonal variations of mean monthly eto from all methods were compared with the fao pm estimates fig 2 hs t pt r and ab r well simulated the peak eto across all the stations with re within 20 all methods captured the warm season eto variations the bc t and jh t methods overestimated eto under high humid conditions and jh r overestimated peak values at all stations ranging between 5 s1 and 43 s13 overall both the temperature and radiation based methods performed better in the warm season than in the transition and cold seasons the hs t method showed less seasonal difference than did other methods 3 2 calibration of constant values all methods performed better after calibration with the mean annual re within 10 except the th t and jh r methods fig 3 after calibration the ma r method performed the best with the lowest rmse at most stations followed by the tu r and hs t methods fig a 3 tables a 3 a 4 the significant improvement of the ma r method was because of the use of two empirical coefficients eq 12 which can be easily adjusted to reflect the impact of both radiative and aerodynamic components on eto changes one drawback is that the ma r method should be adequately calibrated using local weather data which limits its use in regional analysis after calibration the radiation based methods e g pt r jh r and ab r still showed large underestimations in arid and semiarid climates indicating the relative contribution of solar radiation to eto i e s a was not constant moreover the underestimation was more significant during cool and transition seasons suggesting that the impact of the radiative component on eto changes is reduced in a relatively cold environment the calibrated parameters for each station and method are shown in tables 5 and 6 expected differences were found at different stations for the same method the differences between climate regions were greater than that between stations in the same climate regions and in general the calibrated parameters were higher in more arid climates indicating that rh significantly affected the parameters in both temperature and radiation based methods for example the calibrated values of α in hs t were 0 0020 0 0023 mean 0 0022 in humid subtropical climates while the values were 0 0024 0 0027 mean 0 0026 in semi arid and arid climates table 5 similar results were reported in other studies sepaskhah and razzaghi 2009 tabari and talaee 2011 zhu et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 evaluated 839 stations over china 12 years of data and reported that the calibrated parameters for hs t were higher than 0 0031 in arid climates close to 0 0026 in semi arid climates and smaller than 0 0022 in relatively humid climates high values 0 0030 0 0043 were observed in extremely arid environments due to low rh while low values 0 0018 were reported in highly humid environments aschonitis et al 2017 for radiation based methods pt r method was taken as an example since its default value α 1 26 represents that solar radiation accounts for 79 4 s a 1 α 1 1 26 of the eto variation as mentioned in section 2 2 the value of α 1 26 was obtained by averaging several field measurements over vegetated and water surfaces priestley and taylor 1972 as shown in table 6 the calibrated values of α in pt r ranged between 1 15 1 25 1 34 1 51 1 50 1 58 in humid subhumid and semi arid climates respectively and as high as 1 67 in arid climate which was consistent with other studies aschonitis et al 2017 bakhtiari et al 2011 didari and ahmadi 2019 er raki et al 2010 gao et al 2017 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 shiri et al 2019 tabari 2010 aschonitis et al 2017 used a global monthly weather dataset 1948 2006 and found that the calibrated values of α in pt r ranged from 0 52 to 2 96 with higher values 1 8 in extremely arid environments and lower values 1 0 in high humid environments these significant spatial variabilities are attributated to the inadequate consideration of the aerodynamic component i e the combined effect of rh and u 2 consequently the calibrated values of α in pt r increased or decreased due to the heat advection effect when strong winds provided significant heating or cooling to the reference surface 3 3 method verification for long term projections the verification of method for long term projections was carried out at three stations i e s3 s6 and s14 representing different climatic conditions fig 4 the split record method was used to analyze the sensitivity of parameters to model performance klemes 1986 singh and xu 1997 the data set was split into two periods i e 1961 1990 and 1991 2010 the eight selected methods were calibrated separately for these two periods the calibrated parameters for the first period were used to predict the second period the purpose was to test the method s fidelity to the monthly prediction of eto for an independent period as shown in fig 4 the performance was acceptable in the warm season may to september with relative errors within 20 however the radiation based methods and the th t method had high relative errors in the cool season in sum once the method is calibrated it can be used to predict the future eto for the same station with sufficient confidence 3 4 evaluation for different climates the calibrated regional parameters for the eight methods were used for eto estimation at the fifteen stations fig 5 shows a comparison of using one set of parameters for all climates one region and two different sets of parameters two regions including one for arid semiarid climates stations in climate division 1 and 5 fig 1 and one for humid subhumid climates stations in other climate divisions fig 1 it was evident that more accurate estimates could be obtained if the calibration was made for each climate type and the lowest mean relative error was observed when three regions were considered including humid climate subhumid and arid semiarid climates fig a 4 even with the calibrated mean of all stations one region the hs t a 0 024 and ma r a 0 81 and b 0 09 methods can produce acceptable levels of confidence in all seasons and climates types the tu r method worked well for regional analysis in humid subhumid and warm seasons in arid and semiarid climates all calibrated methods showed better performance in the warm season than in the transition and cool seasons for regional analysis and larger errors with respect to the reference method were found under dry and windy conditions generally air temperature measurements are more reliable than the other three parameters required by the fao pm method moreover the default value of the hs r method was more stable than the ma r method taken together the hs t method is recommended for regional analysis if reliable wind speed and rh are not available calibration with the fao pm method is suggested in regions under dry and windy conditions 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis the contributions of available energy a vapor pressure deficit d and aerodynamic resistance r a to the variations of eto at each station in different seasons are shown in fig 6 the available energy was the driving factor of eto since it accounted for 51 84 of the variance in eto fig 6a the contribution of available energy to eto varied greatly in different climate regions and the seasonality difference was more significant than the spatial differences in the warm season the available energy accounted for 84 77 72 and 73 of the variation in eto in humid subhumid semiarid and arid climates respectively hence the methods linking eto with the available energy performed well in the warm season the pt r method assumes s a 79 4 s d 1 s a 20 6 and s ra 0 with this assumption the contribution of the radiative component s a is about four times that of the aerodynamic component s d and s ra however the vapor pressure deficit had relatively higher impacts on the eto variation in cool and dry environments e g s d was 27 28 in the warm season in semiarid and arid climates and can be as high as 43 49 in the cool season in subhumid semiarid and arid climates fig 6b therefore the radiation based methods underestimated eto under cool and dry conditions since they assumed that the relative contribution of solar radiation to eto is constant the wind speed impact s u2 can further complicate the relative contribution of aerodynamic components on eto the energy heat and vapor transfer rate of the grass reference surface and the surrounding environment were more similar in humid and subhumid climates than in semiarid and arid climates accordingly the effect of regional advection on eto was usually minor under humid conditions for example s u2 s ra in humid climate was only 4 3 and 2 in warm transition and cool seasons respectively the negative value in s u2 indicated that increasing wind speed or decreasing r a led to a reduction in eto as shown in fig 6c wind speed negatively impacted eto in warm and transition seasons in humid climates due to the cool air advection and the impacts were slightly enhanced with increased wind speed however drier air generally had a higher vapor pressure gradient in addition wind speed affected the sensible heat transfer from the vast dry unirrigated area and contributed to the energy required for evapotranspiration through warm air advection hence s u2 in arid climate showed consistently high values 10 16 in all seasons even under moderate wind conditions in semiarid climates s u2 kept at 4 6 in warm and transition seasons and increased to 12 in the cool season under strong wind conditions therefore the assumption that the aerodynamic resistance impacts on eto variations were equal to zero i e s ra 0 was invalid for most stations leading to the underestimation of most methods even after calibration especially in the semiarid and arid climates under strong wind conditions to further illustrate the impacts of weather variables on s a and s u2 sensitivity analysis of s a and s u2 s r a in response to the changes in rh air temperature and wind speed was performed by increasing or decreasing an individual variable while holding the other variables constant fig 7 fig 8 the ranges of different variables were selected according to their maximum and minimum values recorded from 1961 to 2010 in the study area an exponential relationship between mean air temperature and available energy was developed using the data from 1961 to 2010 i e a 3 4635 e 0 0509 t with r 2 0 81 compared with linear regression the exponential relationship performed better especially at relatively low temperatures based on the mean air temperature and rh four climate regions were classified including humid cold humid warm dry cold and dry warm relative humidity is the most sensitive weather variable to s a and s u2 the equilibrium or quasi equilibrium evaporation condition i e s u2 0 existed within rh between 65 and 75 and rh under the equilibrium condition showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature at 20 rh under equilibrium or quasi equilibrium evaporation conditions rh was about 70 which is consistent with the value calculated by selecting the weather variables from 1961 to 2010 that satisfied the equilibrium or quasi equilibrium evaporation conditions rh 70 6 n 437 with rh 70 t 20 and u 2 2 m s a s a value of 0 8 was derived from fig 7 which is the same as the value suggested by mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 to analyze the relative effects of the radiative component on the evapotranspiration process with negligible effect of advection it is noted that s u2 was more sensitive to rh and wind speed within 0 4 m s strong wind conditions u 2 4 m s did not necessarily increase the wind speed impact on s u2 variations 4 2 adjustment for dry and windy conditions since hs t was the best method selected for regional analysis and pt r was the most theoretically based radiative method these two methods were adjusted to improve their performance under dry and windy conditions the impact of vapor pressure deficit change on eto can be estimated by assuming that there were no changes in other parameters then et adjust et o 1 s d d d d where d is the vapor pressure deficit under the equilibrium condition since d is calculated by 1 rh e s the term d d d can be approximated by rh rh 100 rh assuming that there is little change in the mean temperature under the two conditions rh is the rh at the equilibrium value in percentage then one gets et adjust et o 1 s d rh rh 100 rh under the equilibrium condition s d 1 s a 0 2 rh 70 then et adjust et o 1 47 0 0067 rh under strong wind conditions u2 3 m s the impact of wind effect on s d can be approximated as s d ω ω u 2 u 2 s d 1 s a 2 s a 1 1 s a s a then et adjust et o 1 s d 1 s a rh rh 1 rh et o 1 84 0 012 rh fig 9 shows the results of using the adjustment coefficient c 1 84 0 012 rh for strong wind conditions both methods performed better than the original and local calibrated methods especially under dry and windy conditions s1 s2 s3 and s9 it was noted that s8 the station with the lowest rh i e 40 had a relatively higher rmse 0 82 mm d 1 than the calibrated method 0 66 mm d 1 considering that s8 had light to moderate wind 2 7 0 6 m s the adjustment coefficient without the correction for strong wind conditions i e c 1 47 0 0067 rh was tested and the rmse decreased to 0 40 mm d 1 5 conclusions in this research three temperature based and five radiation based methods were evaluated for regional eto estimates using 50 years 1961 2010 of monthly meteorological data under various climatic conditions in texas united states the hs t method is recommended for regional analysis if reliable wind speed and rh data are unavailable however calibration is required in regions under dry and windy conditions radiation and temperature based methods performed well and showed little variation in the warm season in all climates the reason is that the radiative component was the driving factor of eto accounting for 72 84 of the variation in eto however radiation based methods underestimated eto under cool and dry conditions because they assume that the relative contribution of solar radiation to eto is constant and the aerodynamic resistance impact on eto variations is equal to zero e g s a 80 s d 20 and s ra s u2 0 in the pt r method we demonstrated that s d could be as high as 43 49 in the cool season in subhumid semiarid and arid climates and s u2 was sensitive to rh and wind speed within 0 4 m s which was 4 2 4 12 and 10 16 in humid semiarid and arid climates respectively we also showed that the equilibrium or quasi equilibrium evaporation conditions i e the aerodynamic resistance or wind speed impacts on eto variations were equal to zero were valid when the rh value was within 70 6 to accurately reflect the impact of aerodynamic components on the eto estimation under dry and windy conditions the calibration free coefficients i e c 1 84 0 012 rh under strong winds conditions and c 1 47 0 0067 rh under light to moderate wind conditions are suggested to multiply the hs t and pt r equations the adjusted hs t and pt r methods significantly improved the accuracy of the original method and performed better than the local calibrated method the adjusted methods do not require local calibration which can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of applying the less data intensive methods to predict regional or global irrigation water demand funding this research did not receive any

estimates and in regional irrigation water demand studies especially in areas with limited weather data a major limitation is that without local calibration the constant parameters used in these methods usually cannot ensure the same reliability in regional analysis on the other hand the controlling variables of eto under different climatic conditions and how they are related to the structures of these methods have not been adequately addressed yet herein we evaluated the performance of three commonly used temperature based methods i e thornthwaite th t blaney criddle bc t and hargreaves and samani hs t and five radiation based methods i e makkink ma r priestley taylor pt r jensen and haise jh r turc tu r and abtew ab r for regional eto estimates and calibrated them using the penman monteith method monthly meteorological data 1961 2010 from 15 weather stations in texas united states covering humid subhumid semiarid and arid climates were used the hs t method is recommended for regional analysis if reliable wind speed and relative humidity data are not available the radiative component was the driving factor of eto accounting for 72 84 of its variation in the warm season in all climates therefore temperature and radiation based methods performed well and showed little variation in the warm season however we demonstrated that the vapor pressure deficit impact on eto variations could be as high as 43 49 in the cool season in subhumid semiarid and arid climates and wind speed impact on eto variations was 4 12 and 10 16 in humid semiarid and arid climates respectively to accurately reflect these impacts we adjusted the hs t and pt r methods by multiplying a calibration free coefficient by doing so the accuracy of eto under cool dry and windy conditions is considerably improved compared with the locally calibrated methods the adjusted hs t and pt r methods can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of applying the less data intensive eto methods to predict regional or global irrigation water demand keywords reference evapotranspiration radiation based temperature based dry and windy conditions data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration eto is essential for irrigation water management water balance studies and hydrologic and crop modeling particularly due to increasing global irrigation water demand iwd in a warming climate florke et al 2018 haddeland et al 2014 raza et al 2021 the most common method for irrigation water estimation is the crop coefficient approach i e adjusting eto by crop coefficients allen et al 1998 doorenbos and pruitt 1976 when required meteorological data are available the food and agriculture organization fao penman monteith equation fao pm allen et al 1998 is the recommended standard method for eto estimation since it is more physically based and can be applied globally without local calibration however the fao pm method requires a diverse set of reliable weather data including solar radiation air temperature relative humidity rh and wind speed which are usually unavailable in many regions in addition considerable uncertainties still exist in rh and wind speed forecasts from global climate models gcms which hinders the use of the pm method in regional and global eto and iwd studies lai et al 2022 in addition to the physical based combination methods like penman 1948 and fao pm method allen et al 1998 other approaches currently used for eto estimation are based on 1 empirical relationships 2 machine learning algorithms 3 water budget 4 mass transfer 5 temperature and 6 radiation empirical methods like multiple regression analysis yirga 2019 are unsuitable for regional studies because the variables selected as predictors are empirical and site specific machine learning algorithms e g artificial neural networks ann random forest rf support vector machines svm and extreme learning machine elm ahmadi et al 2021 bellido jiménez et al 2021 chia et al 2021 wang et al 2019 are usually trained and tested in the same region and therefore their estimation accuracy in other regions are not guaranteed water budget methods are rarely used in practice due to the difficulty and accumulated error in the measurements of their required variables such as deep percolation subsurface flow and capillary rise guitjens 1982 mass transfer methods are attractive in estimating the evaporation of free water bodies like lakes and reservoirs singh and xu 1997 but less robust for vegetated surfaces than other approaches like temperature and radiation based methods valipour et al 2017 xu and singh 2002 the commonly used temperature based methods include thornthwaite th t thornthwaite 1948 hargreaves and samani hs t hargreaves and samani 1985 and blaney criddle bc t blaney and criddle 1950 and the radiation based ones include priestley taylor pt r priestley and taylor 1972 makkink ma r makkink 1957 and turc tu r turc 1961 the use of temperature and radiation based methods has two advantages 1 only temperature or radiation related data are required as input and 2 acceptable accuracy which has been extensively verified against the lysimeter observations or the estimation using the reference method fao pm under humid subhumid semiarid arid and high altitude climatic conditions amatya et al 1995 azhar and perera 2011 djaman et al 2019 liu et al 2017 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 xu and singh 2002 xu et al 2013 yang et al 2021 therefore radiation based doll and siebert 2002 rost et al 2008 schmied et al 2021 and temperature based methods grogan et al 2022 wisser et al 2008 are widely used in regional and global iwd studies however regional and global iwd studies using temperature and radiation based methods show high uncertainties since the default parameters in those methods cannot guarantee the same reliability in different climatic regions in humid climates radiation based methods usually perform better than temperature based methods but both methods can provide reasonable estimates amatya et al 1995 azhar and perera 2011 djaman et al 2019 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 xu and singh 2002 xu et al 2013 in warm and dry climates the aerodynamic component primarily affected by wind speed and rh becomes more significant matsoukas et al 2011 and warm air advection from unirrigated areas often contributes extra sensible heat energy for evapotranspiration the advection of sensible heat energy can be reflected in the temperature based methods by changing temperature however the radiation based methods cannot adequately compensate for the advection effect and thus are not suggested for semiarid or arid climates didari and ahmadi 2019 for example temperature based methods e g hs t and bc t allen and pruitt 1986 were reported to have better performance than radiation based methods in sub humid nandagiri and kovoor 2006 and semiarid climates bakhtiari et al 2011 er raki et al 2010 gao et al 2017 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 tabari 2010 however inconsistent results were reported in other studies for example in an arid climate with light wind conditions in aksu china gao et al 2017 reported that the pt r method which is radiation based showed the best performance followed by other temperature or radiation based methods like hs t ma r tu r and bc t in a warm humid climate with moderate to strong wind tabari 2010 found that the hs t method temperature based performed better than radiation based methods including tu r pt r and ma r moreover both temperature and radiation based methods showed high uncertainty under dry and windy conditions and their performance did not improve significantly even after local calibration akhavan et al 2018 didari and ahmadi 2019 valipour et al 2017 these studies suggest that the relative contributions of weather parameters to the eto variation largely vary with climatic conditions leading to inconsistent performance of different methods particularly under dry and windy conditions in addition what the controlling weather parameters of eto under different climatic conditions are and how they relate to the structures of the temperature and radiation based methods have not been comprehensively understood and adequately addressed in previous studies ahmadi and javanbakht 2020 hu et al 2021 kang et al 2021 ng et al 2022 these deficiencies hinder the effort of applying the less data intensive methods to predict regional or global irrigation water demand herein we selected eight more recommended methods based on their performances in previous studies including three temperature based methods i e th t bc t and hs t and five radiation based methods i e ma r pt r jensen and haise jh r jensen and haise 1963 tu r and abtew ab r abtew 1996 to conduct a systematic evaluation under various climatic conditions by comparing them with the reference method i e fao pm to do so we collected 50 years 1961 2010 of monthly meteorological data from 15 weather stations with moderate to strong wind speed in texas united states covering humid subhumid semiarid and arid climate types the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the performance of the selected temperature or radiation based methods with the default and local calibration values for regional eto analysis 2 identify the controlling weather parameters in the eto estimation under different climate types and 3 improve the performance of the selected methods under dry and windy conditions through adequate consideration of the aerodynamic component 2 material and methods more details about the reference method i e fao pm and the eight temperature and radiation based eto methods were first introduced second the performance evaluation was carried out in the following three aspects 1 the eto values estimated using the eight methods with default constant parameters were compared with the fao pm estimates and then calibrated with an automatic optimization method 2 model verification was conducted at the chosen stations to assess the model ability to perform long term projections and 3 the calibrated regional parameters for the eight methods were evaluated for regional analysis third sensitivity analysis using the non dimensional relative sensitivity coefficients was conducted to understand the model structure and quantify the contributions of meteorological parameters to eto variations last we attempted to improve the performance of the selected methods under dry and windy conditions based on the sensitivity analysis results as mentioned above the fao pm method requires high quality meteorological data and elevation information which is used to calculate the psychrometric constant table 1 in contrast the eight temperature or radiation based eto methods require much fewer inputs than does the fao pm method table 1 for example the temperature based methods only require temperature and other parameters e g daytime length and extraterrestrial radiation r a are available from standard tables the time step input data and definition associated with each eto method vary widely given the nonlinear nature of eto daily meteorological data can lead to more accurate estimation than monthly averages nevertheless daily weather data show high uncertainty since its quality control is more difficult than monthly data therefore monthly data are suggested when analyzing long term trends vicente serrano et al 2014 consistent definitions of parameters time steps monthly and units were used for model comparison 2 1 fao pm method compared with the original pm method a hypothetical reference grass surface with an assumed grass height of 0 12 m an albedo of 0 23 and a fixed surface resistance r s 70 s m 1 is used by the fao pm method allen et al 1998 hence the fao pm method depends only on climatic variables i e available energy a vapor pressure deficit d and aerodynamic resistance r a 1 et o 0 408 a γ 900 t 273 u 2 d γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm d 1 a r n g in which r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 d 1 and g is the soil heat flux mj m 2 d 1 d is the vapor pressure deficit kpa t and u 2 are the mean air temperature oc and wind speed

and calculations of each variable are detailed in the appendix the change in eto can be attributed to the changes in a d and r a to better understand the relative contributions of a d and r a to the dynamics of eto the non dimensional relative sensitivity coefficients i e s a s d and s r a are used beven 1979 mccuen 1974 rana and katerji 1998 2 s a et o a a et o 1 1 900 γ t 273 u 2 d a 3 s d et o

u 2 u 2 et o s r a 2 2 temperature and radiation based methods most temperature based methods are developed based on the empirical relationships of air temperature or day length with field eto measurements table 2 typical temperature based methods can be formulated as eqs 7 or 8 xu and singh 2001 6 et o c t n 7 et o c 1 p c 2 t c 3 h where t is the mean air temperature p is the daytime length h is a humidity term and n c c 1 c 2 and c 3 are constants the th t method has a form similar to eq 6 and the bc t and hs t methods show a similar form as eq 7 the th t method correlates mean temperature with eto based on water balance solar radiation r s can be estimated by r a using the terms in the hs t method i e r s α r a t max t min 1 2 where α is an adjustment coefficient 0 16 for interior locations or 0 19 for locations near the ocean allen et al 1998 daytime length in the bc t method is an indicator of solar radiation radiation based methods follow the energy balance equation using net solar radiation r n or r s as the primary parameter jensen et al 1990 the available energy for evapotranspiration includes r n g and sensible energy h h may increase or decrease due to the heat advection effect when strong winds provide significant heating or cooling to the reference surface this advection of sensible heat energy is treated in the pm method by introducing an aerodynamic term however radiation based methods cannot adequately compensate for the advection effect since they assume that the relative contribution of solar radiation to eto is a constant i e s a in eq 2 radiation based methods can be formulated as 8 et o 1 s a et eq 1 s a γ r n g λ where s a represents the relative contribution of available energy to eto with wind speed having a negligible effect i e s r a 0 it is similar to the decoupling coefficient introduced by jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 to analyze the relative contribution of solar radiation and aerodynamic terms to the evapotranspiration process by replacing 1 s a 1 26 eq 8 is transferred to the pt r method eq 13 in table 2 it also indicates that solar radiation accounts for 79 4 s a 1 1 26 of the eto variation in the pt r method the ma r jh r tu r and ab r methods use r s instead of r n since r s can be linearly associated with r n with g 0 and an albedo of 0 23 the ma r method can be considered as a special form of eq 8 when disregarding the aerodynamic term and compensating for with two empirical coefficients eq 12 in table 2 the term γ is a function of temperature with given atmospheric pressure and therefore it can be replaced with different forms related to temperature e g t 3 in jh r t t 15 in tu r and t max in ab r method because of the empirical nature the default values of constants in each method usually represent certain climatic conditions and as a consequence calibration is usually necessary when applying temperature and radiation based methods in different climatic regions 2 3 model evaluation root mean square error rmse and relative error re were used to evaluate the model performance 17 rmse i 1 n x i et o i 2 n 18 re x i et o i et o i 100 where x i and et 0 i are the ith calculated eto using the selected method and the fao pm method respectively and n is the number of observations the method with the best performance has rmse and re values close to 0 here an re of 20 was used as an arbitrary measurement of the acceptance of each method xu and singh 2001 the monthly eto values calculated with each method are correlated with the fao pm estimates using linear regression 19 y ax b where y represents fao pm eto and x is the eto calculated in each method a and b are the slope and intercept respectively the best method has the highest coefficient of determination r 2 with a close to 1 and b close to 0 for better comparison the intercept was set as 0 and the corresponding slope and r 2 were recalculated an automatic optimization method was used to obtain the best parameters involved in each method singh and xu 1997 the calibrated parameters is obtained by minimizing the residual sum of squares rss as shown in eq 20 20 minimum rss i 1 n x i et o i 2 2 4 regional analysis the criteria used in selecting eto methods best suitable for regional analysis are described as follows 1 it can be used to estimate eto under different climate types 2 it can capture the peak and seasonal variations of eto 3 if the default parameter in a method overestimates underestimates in a specific climate then the error should be systematic and correctable 4 it can be used to evaluate the long term variation of eto and 5 for methods that satisfy all the criteria the one with fewer inputs is preferred 2 5 study area texas has the largest cropland area in the united states located in the south central region and borders with the gulf of mexico to the southeast fig 1 there are ten climate divisions in texas https texas resiliencesystem org texas climate divisions including humid subtropical cfa semiarid bsh and bsk and arid bwh and bwk conditions based on the köppen geiger classification beck et al 2018 most cropland is in semiarid regions e g high plains region 1 and rolling plains region 2 which have dry high radiation and windy environments monthly meteorological data between 1961 and 2010 from 15 stations covering most of the ten climate divisions were downloaded from climate date online provided by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web air temperature and relative humidity measured from these stations were at 2 m height to reduce the calculation uncertainty solar radiation data including r s and r a were obtained from direct radiation measurement which were downloaded from the national solar radiation database https rredc nrel gov solar old data nsrdb r n was calculated following allen et al 1998 wind speeds from noaa climate stations are generally measured at a 10 m height and they were converted to 2 m wind speeds using the method suggested by allen et al 1998 as detailed in the appendix the integrity quality and reasonableness of these weather data were evaluated using the procedures and guidelines recommended by allen 1996 the evaluation of aridity impact is shown in fig a 1 the annual means of primary meteorological variables from 1961 to 2010 are shown in table 3 and their seasonal and annual variations are detailed in fig a 2 here three seasons were identified based on air temperature variation i e warm season may through sep transition season march april and october and cool season jan feb nov and dec the warm season is of particular interest since it is the growing season with high irrigation requirements moderate to strong advection was observed in both arid and humid climates wind speed among 3 5 m s and the wind speed had no apparent seasonal variation fig a 2 3 results 3 1 evaluation of each method with default constant values using the default constant values in each method table 2 resulted in significant errors in monthly eto estimation at different locations with the highest rmse of all methods in arid climate 0 62 2 66 mm d 1 followed by semiarid 0 78 1 62 mm d 1 subhumid 0 56 1 52 mm d 1 and humid 0 34 1 14 mm d 1 climates table 4 when concerning the mean rmse of all 15 stations the best method was hs t 0 64 mm d 1 followed by tu r 0 76 ab r 0 82 pt r 0 90 jh r 1 03 bc t 1 05 ma r 1 37 and th t 1 68 hs t was the only method showing comparable reliability across all climate types i e the re of annual mean eto at all stations was within 20 also it had the lowest rmse at one station in arid and semiarid regions and five stations in humid regions table 4 one possible explanation is that t max t min 1 2 in the hs r method was highly correlated with relative humidity r2 0 96 with rh 50 n 7738 therefore the effect of relative humidity impact on eto can be considered the three radiation based methods i e pt r tu r and ab r worked quite well for annual eto estimates in humid climates but they substantially underestimated eto in arid and semiarid climates by 14 18 19 31 and 43 48 in warm transition and cool seasons respectively table a 1 table a 2 the tu r method performed well in arid climates table 4 since an adjustment was made when rh 50 eq 15 for methods initially developed in a relatively dry environment e g bc t and jh r they underestimated the mean annual eto by 7 and 12 in arid and semiarid regions but significantly overestimated eto in humid regions the ma r method had high r 2 but systematically underestimated eto at all stations indicating that the default constant value was too small of all the methods evaluated the th t method performed the poorest in estimating monthly eto but it still showed acceptable accuracy in the warm season re within 20 the peak and seasonal variations of mean monthly eto from all methods were compared with the fao pm estimates fig 2 hs t pt r and ab r well simulated the peak eto across all the stations with re within 20 all methods captured the warm season eto variations the bc t and jh t methods overestimated eto under high humid conditions and jh r overestimated peak values at all stations ranging between 5 s1 and 43 s13 overall both the temperature and radiation based methods performed better in the warm season than in the transition and cold seasons the hs t method showed less seasonal difference than did other methods 3 2 calibration of constant values all methods performed better after calibration with the mean annual re within 10 except the th t and jh r methods fig 3 after calibration the ma r method performed the best with the lowest rmse at most stations followed by the tu r and hs t methods fig a 3 tables a 3 a 4 the significant improvement of the ma r method was because of the use of two empirical coefficients eq 12 which can be easily adjusted to reflect the impact of both radiative and aerodynamic components on eto changes one drawback is that the ma r method should be adequately calibrated using local weather data which limits its use in regional analysis after calibration the radiation based methods e g pt r jh r and ab r still showed large underestimations in arid and semiarid climates indicating the relative contribution of solar radiation to eto i e s a was not constant moreover the underestimation was more significant during cool and transition seasons suggesting that the impact of the radiative component on eto changes is reduced in a relatively cold environment the calibrated parameters for each station and method are shown in tables 5 and 6 expected differences were found at different stations for the same method the differences between climate regions were greater than that between stations in the same climate regions and in general the calibrated parameters were higher in more arid climates indicating that rh significantly affected the parameters in both temperature and radiation based methods for example the calibrated values of α in hs t were 0 0020 0 0023 mean 0 0022 in humid subtropical climates while the values were 0 0024 0 0027 mean 0 0026 in semi arid and arid climates table 5 similar results were reported in other studies sepaskhah and razzaghi 2009 tabari and talaee 2011 zhu et al 2019 zhu et al 2019 evaluated 839 stations over china 12 years of data and reported that the calibrated parameters for hs t were higher than 0 0031 in arid climates close to 0 0026 in semi arid climates and smaller than 0 0022 in relatively humid climates high values 0 0030 0 0043 were observed in extremely arid environments due to low rh while low values 0 0018 were reported in highly humid environments aschonitis et al 2017 for radiation based methods pt r method was taken as an example since its default value α 1 26 represents that solar radiation accounts for 79 4 s a 1 α 1 1 26 of the eto variation as mentioned in section 2 2 the value of α 1 26 was obtained by averaging several field measurements over vegetated and water surfaces priestley and taylor 1972 as shown in table 6 the calibrated values of α in pt r ranged between 1 15 1 25 1 34 1 51 1 50 1 58 in humid subhumid and semi arid climates respectively and as high as 1 67 in arid climate which was consistent with other studies aschonitis et al 2017 bakhtiari et al 2011 didari and ahmadi 2019 er raki et al 2010 gao et al 2017 nandagiri and kovoor 2006 shiri et al 2019 tabari 2010 aschonitis et al 2017 used a global monthly weather dataset 1948 2006 and found that the calibrated values of α in pt r ranged from 0 52 to 2 96 with higher values 1 8 in extremely arid environments and lower values 1 0 in high humid environments these significant spatial variabilities are attributated to the inadequate consideration of the aerodynamic component i e the combined effect of rh and u 2 consequently the calibrated values of α in pt r increased or decreased due to the heat advection effect when strong winds provided significant heating or cooling to the reference surface 3 3 method verification for long term projections the verification of method for long term projections was carried out at three stations i e s3 s6 and s14 representing different climatic conditions fig 4 the split record method was used to analyze the sensitivity of parameters to model performance klemes 1986 singh and xu 1997 the data set was split into two periods i e 1961 1990 and 1991 2010 the eight selected methods were calibrated separately for these two periods the calibrated parameters for the first period were used to predict the second period the purpose was to test the method s fidelity to the monthly prediction of eto for an independent period as shown in fig 4 the performance was acceptable in the warm season may to september with relative errors within 20 however the radiation based methods and the th t method had high relative errors in the cool season in sum once the method is calibrated it can be used to predict the future eto for the same station with sufficient confidence 3 4 evaluation for different climates the calibrated regional parameters for the eight methods were used for eto estimation at the fifteen stations fig 5 shows a comparison of using one set of parameters for all climates one region and two different sets of parameters two regions including one for arid semiarid climates stations in climate division 1 and 5 fig 1 and one for humid subhumid climates stations in other climate divisions fig 1 it was evident that more accurate estimates could be obtained if the calibration was made for each climate type and the lowest mean relative error was observed when three regions were considered including humid climate subhumid and arid semiarid climates fig a 4 even with the calibrated mean of all stations one region the hs t a 0 024 and ma r a 0 81 and b 0 09 methods can produce acceptable levels of confidence in all seasons and climates types the tu r method worked well for regional analysis in humid subhumid and warm seasons in arid and semiarid climates all calibrated methods showed better performance in the warm season than in the transition and cool seasons for regional analysis and larger errors with respect to the reference method were found under dry and windy conditions generally air temperature measurements are more reliable than the other three parameters required by the fao pm method moreover the default value of the hs r method was more stable than the ma r method taken together the hs t method is recommended for regional analysis if reliable wind speed and rh are not available calibration with the fao pm method is suggested in regions under dry and windy conditions 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity analysis the contributions of available energy a vapor pressure deficit d and aerodynamic resistance r a to the variations of eto at each station in different seasons are shown in fig 6 the available energy was the driving factor of eto since it accounted for 51 84 of the variance in eto fig 6a the contribution of available energy to eto varied greatly in different climate regions and the seasonality difference was more significant than the spatial differences in the warm season the available energy accounted for 84 77 72 and 73 of the variation in eto in humid subhumid semiarid and arid climates respectively hence the methods linking eto with the available energy performed well in the warm season the pt r method assumes s a 79 4 s d 1 s a 20 6 and s ra 0 with this assumption the contribution of the radiative component s a is about four times that of the aerodynamic component s d and s ra however the vapor pressure deficit had relatively higher impacts on the eto variation in cool and dry environments e g s d was 27 28 in the warm season in semiarid and arid climates and can be as high as 43 49 in the cool season in subhumid semiarid and arid climates fig 6b therefore the radiation based methods underestimated eto under cool and dry conditions since they assumed that the relative contribution of solar radiation to eto is constant the wind speed impact s u2 can further complicate the relative contribution of aerodynamic components on eto the energy heat and vapor transfer rate of the grass reference surface and the surrounding environment were more similar in humid and subhumid climates than in semiarid and arid climates accordingly the effect of regional advection on eto was usually minor under humid conditions for example s u2 s ra in humid climate was only 4 3 and 2 in warm transition and cool seasons respectively the negative value in s u2 indicated that increasing wind speed or decreasing r a led to a reduction in eto as shown in fig 6c wind speed negatively impacted eto in warm and transition seasons in humid climates due to the cool air advection and the impacts were slightly enhanced with increased wind speed however drier air generally had a higher vapor pressure gradient in addition wind speed affected the sensible heat transfer from the vast dry unirrigated area and contributed to the energy required for evapotranspiration through warm air advection hence s u2 in arid climate showed consistently high values 10 16 in all seasons even under moderate wind conditions in semiarid climates s u2 kept at 4 6 in warm and transition seasons and increased to 12 in the cool season under strong wind conditions therefore the assumption that the aerodynamic resistance impacts on eto variations were equal to zero i e s ra 0 was invalid for most stations leading to the underestimation of most methods even after calibration especially in the semiarid and arid climates under strong wind conditions to further illustrate the impacts of weather variables on s a and s u2 sensitivity analysis of s a and s u2 s r a in response to the changes in rh air temperature and wind speed was performed by increasing or decreasing an individual variable while holding the other variables constant fig 7 fig 8 the ranges of different variables were selected according to their maximum and minimum values recorded from 1961 to 2010 in the study area an exponential relationship between mean air temperature and available energy was developed using the data from 1961 to 2010 i e a 3 4635 e 0 0509 t with r 2 0 81 compared with linear regression the exponential relationship performed better especially at relatively low temperatures based on the mean air temperature and rh four climate regions were classified including humid cold humid warm dry cold and dry warm relative humidity is the most sensitive weather variable to s a and s u2 the equilibrium or quasi equilibrium evaporation condition i e s u2 0 existed within rh between 65 and 75 and rh under the equilibrium condition showed a decreasing trend with increasing temperature at 20 rh under equilibrium or quasi equilibrium evaporation conditions rh was about 70 which is consistent with the value calculated by selecting the weather variables from 1961 to 2010 that satisfied the equilibrium or quasi equilibrium evaporation conditions rh 70 6 n 437 with rh 70 t 20 and u 2 2 m s a s a value of 0 8 was derived from fig 7 which is the same as the value suggested by mcnaughton and jarvis 1983 to analyze the relative effects of the radiative component on the evapotranspiration process with negligible effect of advection it is noted that s u2 was more sensitive to rh and wind speed within 0 4 m s strong wind conditions u 2 4 m s did not necessarily increase the wind speed impact on s u2 variations 4 2 adjustment for dry and windy conditions since hs t was the best method selected for regional analysis and pt r was the most theoretically based radiative method these two methods were adjusted to improve their performance under dry and windy conditions the impact of vapor pressure deficit change on eto can be estimated by assuming that there were no changes in other parameters then et adjust et o 1 s d d d d where d is the vapor pressure deficit under the equilibrium condition since d is calculated by 1 rh e s the term d d d can be approximated by rh rh 100 rh assuming that there is little change in the mean temperature under the two conditions rh is the rh at the equilibrium value in percentage then one gets et adjust et o 1 s d rh rh 100 rh under the equilibrium

than the original and local calibrated methods especially under dry and windy conditions s1 s2 s3 and s9 it was noted that s8 the station with the lowest rh i e 40 had a relatively higher rmse 0 82 mm d 1 than the calibrated method 0 66 mm d 1 considering that s8 had light to moderate wind 2 7 0 6 m s the adjustment coefficient without the correction for strong wind conditions i e c 1 47 0 0067 rh was tested and the rmse decreased to 0 40 mm d 1 5 conclusions in this research three temperature based and five radiation based methods were evaluated for regional eto estimates using 50 years 1961 2010 of monthly meteorological data under various climatic conditions in texas united states the hs t method is recommended for regional analysis if reliable wind speed and rh data are unavailable however calibration is required in regions under dry and windy conditions radiation and temperature based methods performed well and showed little variation in the warm season in all climates the reason is that the radiative component was the driving factor of eto accounting for 72 84 of the variation in eto however radiation based methods underestimated eto under cool and dry conditions because they assume that the relative contribution of solar radiation to eto is constant and the aerodynamic resistance impact on eto variations is equal to zero e g s a 80 s d 20 and s ra s u2 0 in the pt r method we demonstrated that s d could be as high as 43 49 in the cool season in subhumid semiarid and arid climates and s u2 was sensitive to rh and wind speed within 0 4 m s which was 4 2 4 12 and 10 16 in humid semiarid and arid climates respectively we also showed that the equilibrium or quasi equilibrium evaporation conditions i e the aerodynamic resistance or wind speed impacts on eto variations were equal to zero were valid when the rh value was within 70 6 to accurately reflect the impact of aerodynamic components on the eto estimation under dry and windy conditions the calibration free coefficients i e c 1 84 0 012 rh under strong winds conditions and c 1 47 0 0067 rh under light to moderate wind conditions are suggested to multiply the hs t and pt r equations the adjusted hs t and pt r methods significantly improved the accuracy of the original method and performed better than the local calibrated method the adjusted methods do not require local calibration which can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of applying the less data intensive methods to predict regional or global irrigation water demand funding this research did not receive any
