17565,significant effort has been made to measure and understand the surface charge of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles many laboratory experiments have been reported on zeta potential of natural and prepared caco3 and a few have also been published for mg oh 2 however there are very few reported measurements of zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles at conditions relevant to lime softening despite lime softening being a common and established process for water treatment the present study aims to understand the interactions and electrokinetic properties of these two particles in lime softening effects of various experimental parameters such as ph temperature aging inorganic carbon co3 2 hco3 and divalent cations ca2 mg2 on the electrokinetic properties i e zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles were individually studied the interactions between humic acid mimicking natural organic matter silicate representing silica clay mimicking suspended solids and caco3 mg oh 2 particles were studied as well as the interactions between caco3 and mg oh 2 thermodynamic modeling was used to predict precipitates as a function of solution chemistry and assist with data interpretation the results provide considerable insight into factors that are of importance to lime softening graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zeta potential lime softening thermodynamic modeling calcium carbonate magnesium hydroxide potential determining ions 1 introduction chemical precipitative lime softening is a common and established process in water and wastewater treatment during which the ph of the treated water is raised sufficiently to remove calcium and magnesium hardness by converting ca2 to caco3 and mg2 to mg oh 2 both precipitating from the treated water as solids awwa 1990 during lime softening chemicals normally added are lime the process is referred to as lime softening or lime in combination with soda ash referred to as lime soda softening the former is typically used to remove carbonate hardness and the latter can remove both carbonate and non carbonate hardness ostovar and amiri 2013 although there is not a clear distinction depending on the operating temperature lime softening can be classified as cold i e 15 to 60 c warm i e 60 to 85 c and hot lime softening i e 90 to 105 c usually cold lime softening is deployed for softening drinking water in municipal applications while warm and hot lime softening are used for treating industrial water for example a warm or hot lime softening process is commonly applied to treat oilfield produced water derived from steam assisted gravity drainage sagd oil recovery operations heins 2009 as well as industrial cooling knight 1981 and boiler feed waters understanding the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles relevant to lime softening conditions is of importance and has not been well explored especially for warm and hot lime softening where industrial wastewater is composed of multi components and higher temperature might play an important role as well the zeta potential is a parameter used to evaluate the electrokinetic behavior of particles which can provide information on their surface charge particle stability and subsequent easiness to coagulate black and christman 1961 israelachvili 1992 many laboratory experiments have been reported on zeta potential of caco3 mahrouqi et al 2017 wolthers et al 2008 however very few reported zeta potential of caco3 particles at conditions relevant to lime softening most measurements of zeta potential of caco3 were conducted using natural samples of calcite or using preformed caco3 however caco3 generated during lime softening is mostly freshly precipitated in some cases preformed caco3 may be added or lime sludge is recycled back into the precipitation system to facilitate precipitation during lime softening in comparison to caco3 the zeta potential measurements of mg oh 2 have been even less explored black and christman 1961 larson and buswell 1940 russell et al 2009a the published results regarding the surface charge of caco3 are often contradictory and there has been a lot of debate over the sign of the surface charge and the potential determining ions eriksson et al 2007 even among the reports on zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles at conditions relevant to water softening the published results on the surface charge of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles are not consistent even the sign of their surface charge being opposite among some reports for example larson and buswell 1940 found mg oh 2 particles to be positively charged and caco3 particles to be negatively charged throughout the ph range of water softening the lower end of the ph range was not specified but the higher end was specified as ph 12 black and christman 1961 reported that throughout the entire ph range of lime soda softening the zeta potential of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 was positive ph ranging from 10 2 to 11 2 and the zeta potential of freshly precipitated caco3 was negative ph ranging from 9 0 to 11 0 russell et al 2009a reported that the zeta potential of caco3 was dependent on caco3 source with preformed caco3 having a negative zeta potential at ph of 10 4 while freshly precipitated caco3 having a positive zeta potential at the same ph furthermore the sign of the zeta potential of both freshly precipitated caco3 and freshly precipitated mg oh 2 depended on ph freshly precipitated caco3 was negatively charged at ph values lower than 10 5 but positively charged at ph values higher than 10 5 freshly precipitated mg oh 2 was negatively charged at ph values lower than 11 5 but positively charged at ph values higher than 11 5 in this work a systematic study was carried out to understand the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles through zeta potential measurements throughout the wide ph range possibly encountered in lime softening zeta potential measurements were conducted under controlled conditions including ph temperature aging time while exposed to the atmosphere varied concentration of cations mg2 and ca2 for caco3 particles only and anions co3 2 and hco3 for mg oh 2 particles only the presence of possible interacting species in water including humic acid ha silicate and clay freshly precipitated caco3 and mg oh 2 particles were obtained from synthetic water samples and their zeta potentials were measured the rationale for studying these influencing parameters is as follows 1 ph is an important factor affecting zeta potential and lime softening 2 atmospheric co2 can influence zeta potential measurements and its impact needs to be addressed wolthers et al 2008 3 the temperature dependence of zeta potential for caco3 and mg oh 2 remains poorly understood and needs to be addressed especially at the higher temperatures of warm hot softening 4 the effect of co3 2 and hco3 was studied as alkalinity control is an important lime softening operational parameter 5 the interaction between caco3 and mg oh 2 particles was studied because caco3 and mg oh 2 particles might be formed simultaneously during lime softening and most softening sludges contain both caco3 and mg oh 2 particles black and christman 1961 and 6 the interaction between humic acid ha mimicking natural organic matter silicate representing silica as well as clay mimicking suspended solids and caco3 mg oh 2 particles was studied because these compounds are common components in wastewater and can interact with caco3 mg oh 2 particles during lime softening adusei gyamfi et al 2019 latour et al 2014 for example natural organic matter can be removed through coprecipitation with formed caco3 and mg oh 2 during lime softening mercer et al 2005 russell et al 2009a 2009b for comparison with freshly precipitated particles preformed caco3 and mg oh 2 were also studied to understand how sample preparation might affect zeta potentials of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles thermodynamic modeling using visual minteq software was used to predict precipitates as a function of solution chemistry and assist with zeta potential data interpretation the results from this detailed and systematic study will provide a better understanding of the interactions and electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in these complicated and multicomponent systems which is important to better understand their coagulation and flocculation mechanisms 2 experiment and methods 2 1 chemicals calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o acs reagent 99 magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o acs reagent 99 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 99 7 sodium carbonate na2co3 anhydrous 99 5 and sodium hydroxide naoh acs reagent 97 were purchased from fisher chemicals calcium carbonate caco3 reagentplus 99 magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 99 sodium metasilicate na2sio3 granular ha technical bentonite analogue montmorillonite al2o3 sio2 h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich milli q water millipore deionized with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used for preparation of all water samples 2 2 sample preparation and tests fresh stock solutions of cacl2 na2co3 mgcl2 naoh and nahco3 were prepared cacl2 and na2co3 stock solutions were used to produce caco3 precipitation mgcl2 and naoh stock solutions were used to produce mg oh 2 precipitation water samples containing preformed caco3 and mg oh 2 were also prepared the average particle size of preformed caco3 and mg oh 2 in suspension was determined to be 5 1 μm and 12 8 μm respectively using a beckman coulter ls 13 320 particle size analyzer each water sample ws was prepared in a 50 ml plastic centrifugation tube fisher scientific and mixed at 200 rpm in the multi thermal shaker mandel scientific can for 5 min detailed sample information is provided in tables a1 and a2 in the supporting information si the ph was measured by a fisher scientific accumet ae150 ph benchtop meter which was calibrated using the standard buffer solutions with known ph values ph 4 0 7 0 and 10 0 naoh 1 m and hcl 1 m solutions were used for ph adjustment zeta potential is an experimentally determined parameter that describes the electrostatic charge of particles in solutions fig a1 the zeta potential of the suspended particles in water samples was analyzed by a malvern zetasizer nano zs with a high concentration zeta potential cell zen1010 which has a temperature limit of 70 c the temperature of water samqples was controlled at 25 35 45 55 and 65 c to study the temperature effect the equipment utilizes dynamic light scattering for determining the electrophoretic mobility of particles fig a1 then the zeta potential of the particles is calculated from the measured electrophoretic mobility i e velocity using the smoluchowski equation 1 u e ε ζ η where ue ɛ ζ and η are the electrophoretic mobility dielectric constant of water zeta potential and viscosity of water respectively the zeta potential distribution was generated by the zetasizer for each measurement and a single averaged zeta potential value was obtained based on the zeta potential distribution a single measurement on each sample was repeated 5 times and mean values with standard deviations are reported 2 3 prediction of precipitates using thermodynamic modeling the potential precipitates under different conditions ph temperature co2 exposure chemical species etc were predicted by calculating saturation indices sis using thermodynamic modeling visual minteq version 3 1 the saturation index si is defined as 2 s i log i a p k s p where iap and ksp are the ionic activity product in the chemical reaction and solubility product of the precipitate respectively it should be noted that the ionic activities were calculated by visual minteq using the davies equation for solutions with low ionic strength for solutions with moderate ionic strength debye hückel equation was used and for solutions with high ionic strength specific ion interaction theory was used the si indicates the potential of a specific precipitate to be formed when si 0 the solution is supersaturated and the precipitate can form when si 0 the solution is undersaturated and the precipitate cannot form when si 0 the solution is in equilibrium 3 results and discussion 3 1 the zeta potential of mg oh 2 particles the zeta potentials of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 precipitated from 4 mm mgcl2 and 8 mm naoh and preformed mg oh 2 particles 4 mm commercially purchased mg oh 2 in water were measured as a function of ph temperature aging and varying concentration of nahco3 na2co3 fig 1 as described in the following sections 3 1 1 the effect of ph the zeta potential measurements of freshly precipitated and preformed mg oh 2 particles under various phs at 25 c showed that both particles exhibited positive charge at their initial solution ph and over a relatively wide ph range fig 1 a for the preformed mg oh 2 the point of zero charge pzc was observed around ph 11 8 11 9 this observation agrees with the findings of parks 1965 who reported that the pzc of mg oh 2 was at a ph of 12 for the freshly precipitated mg oh 2 the zeta potential was still slightly positive at a ph of 12 5 however a decreasing trend was quite clear at the same ph the zeta potential of the freshly precipitated particles was higher than that of preformed mg oh 2 for the ph range of 10 2 11 0 we observed a similar trend to black and christman 1961 who found that freshly precipitated mg oh 2 exhibited a zeta potential of approximately 7 5 mv throughout this ph range reducing the ph to 10 from the intial ph did not affect the zeta potential of preformed mg oh 2 but lowered that of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 from 25 to 20 mv fig 1 a at a ph of 9 0 negative zeta potential was recorded the modeling with atmospheric co2 included si figs a2 a and b suggested that hydromagnesite mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o magnesite mgco3 and artinite mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o are the dominant species in descending order at ph 9 5 only mgco3 precipitates at a ph of 9 0 the observed negative charge at ph values lower than 9 5 can be ascribed to the formation of a mixture of mgco3 and mg oh 2 in the form of hydromagnesite this is in good agreement with the previous report that freshly precipiated mgco3 was best characterized as a hydromagnesite and carried negative zeta potential russell et al 2009a 3 1 2 the effect of temperature the measured phs and zeta potentials of suspensions of freshly precipitated and preformed mg oh 2 particles as a function of temperature are shown in fig 1 b the resulting ph of both suspensions decreased with increasing temperature the zeta potential of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 increased slowly from 22 mv at 25 c to 27 mv at 65 c in the case of preformed mg oh 2 particles the zeta potential was positive between 25 and 45 c but much lower compared to the freshly precipitated one 5 mv vs 22 mv at 25 c however the zeta potential decreased when the temperature was raised to 55 c and became negative at 65 c 5 mv for the freshly precipitated mg oh 2 case including co2 the calculated sis fig a2 c indicate that mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o mgco3 and mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o in descending order are the insoluble minerals below 35 c while above 35 c brucite mg oh 2 also precipitates additionally with increasing temperature the si of mgco3 decreases and that of mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o and brucite increases for the preformed mg oh 2 brucite is at equilibrium throughout and mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o has the highest si with co2 at high temperature 65 c fig a2 d 3 1 3 the effect of aging as the concentration of dissolved co2 increases due to exposure to atmospheric co2 the ph and total alkalinity change with time which could result in changes of the charge on the particle surface as shown in fig 1 c the ph of both water samples decreased with increasing exposure time to the ambient co2 the zeta potentials of both types of particles followed a decreasing trend with aging time for the freshly precipitated mg oh 2 zeta potential was reversed to negative the sis predicted fis a2 a and b at 25 c with co2 input indicated that with aging mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o mgco3 and mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o in descending order can precipitate 3 1 4 the effect of nahco3 and na2co3 the effect of nahco3 and na2co3 addition on the zeta potential of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 was studied fig 1 d as nahco3 solution was added a steady decrease in the ph from 11 to 10 3 was observed this was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the zeta potential initially from 25 to 5 mv and a slow decrease until the zeta potential became negative in the case of na2co3 addition a similar decreasing trend was observed in the zeta potential although the ph showed an increase from 11 to 11 25 the predicted species with sis greater than zero are mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o mgco3 and mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o in descending order fig a3 3 2 the zeta potential of caco3 particles the zeta potentials of freshly precipitated and preformed caco3 particles 4 mm caco3 in water were measured as a function of ph temperature aging and mgcl2 fig 2 as described in the following sections three different samples of freshly precipitated caco3 were prepared by varying molar ratios of cacl2 to na2co3 from 2 1 to 1 1 and to 1 2 from reactions of 8 mm cacl2 and 4 mm na2co3 4 mm cacl2 and 4 mm na2co3 4 mm cacl2 and 8 mm na2co3 in the solutions respectively 3 2 1 the effect of ph the zeta potential measurements of preformed and freshly precipitated caco3 at 25 c fig 2 a showed that the zeta potential of the preformed caco3 was negative throughout the ph range tested 9 0 11 5 which is consistent with other reported studies for example bob and walker 2001 reported a negative zeta potential for caco3 throughout the studied ph range of 8 4 11 6 in the presence of 0 001 m kcl black and christman 1961 found that both freshly precipitated and resuspended caco3 particles were negatively charged throughout the ph range of 9 0 11 0 the zeta potential of the preformed caco3 decreased with increasing ph foxall et al 1979 thompson and pownall 1989 and stipp 1999 have shown that the electrophoretic mobility of calcite particles is only secondarily affected by the ph and that the bulk concentration of ca2 and co3 2 and other carbonate species are the potential determining ions pdis they found that the zeta potential of preformed caco3 was 24 36 mv at ph of 10 4 somasundaran and agar 1967 concluded that the principal pdis of caco3 were indentified as ca2 hco3 h and oh co3 2 ions also were found to play a major role above ph of 9 0 they proposed that the principal mechanism of charge devleopment at the surface was preferential hydrolysis of surface calcium and carbonate ions or the hydrolysis of the bulk solution ions followed by the adsorption of the resulting complexes at the surface russell et al 2009a conducted jar tests on softening a water composed of nahco3 cacl2 and kno3 with ca oh 2 and found that the freshly precipitated caco3 exhibited a slightly positive zeta potential at lower ph values 9 0 negative zeta potential at ph values ranging from 9 0 to 10 5 and positive zeta potential at ph values ranging from 10 5 to 11 6 in this study freshly precipitated caco3 with molar ratios of cacl2 na2co3 of 2 1 and 1 1 showed positive zeta potential while the freshly precipitated caco3 with molar ratio of cacl2 na2co3 of 1 2 showed negative zeta potential fig 2 a for freshly precipitated caco3 cacl2 na2co3 2 1 its zeta potential was positive throughout the ph range tested the positive zeta potential can be attributed to the presence of excess ca2 ions a similar effect was observed in the presence of mg2 ions which will be discussed later this is further supported by the fact that reducing the molar ratio of cacl2 to na2co3 also lowered the zeta potential for freshly precipitated caco3 cacl2 na2co3 1 1 its zeta potential at initial ph was slightly positive but dropped to negative at other tested phs for freshly precipitated caco3 cacl2 na2co3 1 2 its zeta potential was negative throughout the ph range tested which is accounted for by the excess of carbonate ions in the solution the trend of zeta potential change was very similar to that of freshly precipitated caco3 cacl2 na2co3 1 1 there has been debate on the pdis for caco3 and it is more generally accepted that ca2 and co3 2 and other carbonate species are the pdis in our results comparing the three situations ca2 in excess co3 2 in excess or ca2 and co3 2 of equal ratio it can be clearly seen that in the presence of ca2 or co3 2 in the solution ph plays a less important role in electric charge modification of the caco3 surfaces which is in good agreement with previous reports derkani et al 2019 mahani et al 2015 supporting that ca2 and co3 2 are the pdis for both preformed and freshly precipitated caco3 the predicted mineral species with sis greater than zero for in situ formed caco3 cases were all polymorphs of caco3 calcite aragonite vaterite caco3 xh2o in a descending order with a slightly higher sis with co2 input than that of without fig a3 the sis predicted for calcite preformed caco3 was zero for the entire ph range implying an equilibrium between dissolved and precipitated caco3 fig a3 3 2 2 the effect of temperature with temperature increasing from 25 to 65 c the ph of preformed caco3 remained fairly stable whereas the zeta potential decreased from 12 mv to 22 mv fig 2 b for freshly precipitated caco3 temperature change showed effects depending on the initial molar ratios of precursor materials cacl2 na2co3 both cacl2 na2co3 1 1 and cacl2 na2co3 2 1 showed similar trends of ph and zeta potential for cacl2 na2co3 1 1 the ph of the particles started around 10 0 and decreased with increasing temperature 9 5 at 65 c the zeta potential became more positive 5 to 15 mv as the temperature increased for cacl2 na2co3 2 1 excess ca2 ions the ph was 9 7 and decreased with increasing temperature 8 3 at 65 c the zeta potential was around 20 mv initially and increased further with increasing temperature for the case of cacl2 na2co3 1 2 where the water sample has excessive co3 2 ions the ph remained fairly close to 11 0 and the zeta potential became more negative as the temperature increased following the trend of preformed caco3 the predicted mineral species in descending order of si for in situ formed samples were calcite aragonite vaterite and caco3 xh2o respectively fig a5 with increasing temperature the solubility of caco3 inceases in the absence of atmospheric co2 while decreases with atmospheric co2 present coto et al 2012 wells 1915 thus without co2 si of calcite decreased with increasing temperature with co2 si of calcite increased with increasing temperature fig a5 mahrouqi et al 2016 2017 reported that the zeta potential of natural calcium carbonate in the presence of atmospheric co2 became less negative with increasing temperature which was explained by increased ca2 concentration resulting from increased calcite dissolution with increasing temperature our observation of a different trend for the zeta potential of preformed caco3 with respect to temperature could be due to the impact caused by exposure to atmospheric co2 in our system where solubility of caco3 decreases with increasing temperature corresponding to the modeling in fig a5 the plots of the activity of soluble species fig a6 showed that with co2 for cacl2 na2co3 of 1 1 and 2 1 the activity of ca2 and co3 2 kept almost the same while that of hco3 obviously decreased with increasing temperature leading to the observed increased zeta potential with increasing temperature for cacl2 na2co3 of 1 2 and preformed caco3 the activity of co3 2 kept almost the same while that of ca2 obviously decreased with increasing temperature leading to the observed decreased zeta potential with increasing temperature 3 2 3 the effect of aging it has been reported that timing and exposure to atmospheric co2 can possibly influence the zeta potential measurements of caco3 particles russell et al 2009a wolthers et al 2008 to study the effect of aging freshly precipitated and preformed caco3 were exposed to the atmospheric condition for 48 h and their zeta potentials and phs were measured periodically the observed trend in ph and zeta potential is shown in fig 2 c respectively during the aging test the ph of all water samples decreased over time due to the increased amount of dissolved co2 the zeta potential of all particles decreased over time for freshly precipitaed caco3 particles cacl2 na2co3 2 1 or 1 1 their zeta potentials started being positive and were eventually reversed to negative at the end of the aging experiment ph of all water samples ranged from 8 10 within which hco3 is the dominating species 3 2 4 the effect of mgcl2 mgcl2 stock solution was gradually added to the preformed caco3 to assess the impact of mg2 ion on the charge of caco3 particles at 25 c the mg2 ions had the same effect on the zeta potential as excess ca2 ions as discussed in the sections above the zeta potential of the caco3 was negative but was eventually reversed to positive with the addtion of mgcl2 fig 2 d upon addition of 0 5 ml of 100 mm mgcl2 molar ratio of mgcl2 to caco3 0 5 average zeta potential was close to zero and addition of 2 ml of 100 mm mgcl2 molar ratio of mgcl2 to caco3 2 reversed the zeta potential of caco3 particles to positive a study done by black and christman 1961 showed a similar result the mobility of caco3 2 mm became zero when 80 ppm of mgcl2 was added also it was reported that magnesium can be incorporated into the caco3 crystal lattice which results in the formation of a mixed mg caco3 solid during softening leading to more positive surface charge russell et al 2009b the modeling indicates the potential formation of dolomite camg co3 2 fig a7 3 3 interactions of binary particles the following sections describe the zeta potential as a function of molar ratio of caco3 to mg oh 2 at different temperatures fig 3 a impacts of ha mimicking natural organic matter silicate representing silica clay mimicking suspended solids on the zeta potential of caco3 mg oh 2 particles systems at 25 c with different dosage fig 3 b d and at different temperatures with the fixed dosage fig 3 e and f 3 3 1 mg oh 2 and caco3particles caco3 and mg oh 2 particles might be formed simultaneously during lime softening to study the interaction between caco3 and mg oh 2 particles under lime softening conditions the molar ratio of mg oh 2 and caco3 was varied from 0 to 2 with 0 2 4 8 mm mg oh 2 in 4 mm caco3 suspensions respectively and the zeta potentials were measured at different temperatures fig 3 a the zeta potential of the binary system was negative and became positive when the molar ratio of mg oh 2 to caco3 was increased to 0 5 further increasing the ratio to 1 and 2 led to a slow but steady increase in zeta potential at 25 c and 45 c the trend was slightly different at 65 c where the zeta potential increased rapidly from molar ratio 0 to 1 and then became stable after that since mg oh 2 carries positive charge and caco3 carries negative charge the observed change in zeta potential from negative to positive with increasing ratio of mg oh 2 is reasonable in an early study black and christman 1961 found that both positively and negatively charged particles were present in a softening sludge consisting of both caco3 and mg oh 2 the relative number of negatively charged particles decreased with increasing ph interaction between the two types of particles could also lead to formation of new minerals with various compositions the possible species in decreasing order of sis fig a8 are huntite camg3 co3 4 hydromagnesite mg5 oh 2 co3 4 4h2o dolomite camg co3 2 magnesite mgco3 artinite mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o 3 3 2 the effect of silicate on the zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles silicate is the ubiquitous constituent of industrial produced water the ph and zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 in the presence of various amounts of na2sio3 to represent sio2 were measured with 0 4 2 4 8 mm na2sio3 in 4 mm preformed mg oh 2 or caco3 suspensions respectively the pzc of silicate is around ph 2 3 stumm 1992 implying that silicate would be negatively charged throughout the ph range tested in our study fig 3 b shows the ph and zeta potentials as a function of molar ratios of na2sio3 and caco3 or mg oh 2 there was a sharp increase in ph at the molar ratio of 0 1 followed by a slow increase at ratios 0 5 and higher in the case of caco3 zeta potentials showed a sharp decrease from 10 to 37 mv at molar ratio 0 1 followed by a slow decrease to 45 mv between molar ratios 0 5 to 2 mg oh 2 and na2sio3 system also followed the same trend with increasing ratio of na2sio3 although the final zeta potential was 55 mv the negative zeta potential is expected to be dominated by the presence of the charged surface species of si o brady and walther 1989 and a direct result of the increase in ph that shifts functional groups from si oh to si o the modeling indicates that there are no calcium silicate minerals formed for the silicate caco3 system fig a9 while magnesium silicates such as chrysotile mg3 si2o5 oh 4 may form fig a10 for the silicate mg oh 2 system as shown in fig 3 e and f with increasing temperature in the range of 25 to 65 c the zeta potential of silicate caco3 molar ratio 1 1 system remained almost unchanged for silicate mg oh 2 molar ratio 1 1 system the zeta potential remained negative and the magnitude decreased slightly 64 mv at 25 c to 60 mv at 65 c while the ph of both systems slightly decreased 3 3 3 the effect of humic acid ha on the zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles studies have shown that nom can be removed during lime softening process through coprecipitating with caco3 and mg oh 2 solids russell et al 2009a 2009b oil field produced water and many other industrial wastewaters contain dissolved organic substances that have similar chemical characteristics to ha most importantly in the presence of large number of negatively charged functional groups pillai et al 2017 hence ha is used in this study to mimic organic matter in produced water similar to the silicate experiments the ph and zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 in the presence of various amounts of ha were measured with 0 4 2 4 8 mm ha in 4 mm preformed mg oh 2 or caco3 suspensions respectively with increasing concentration of ha the ph of the caco3 solution decreased from 9 45 to 8 3 and the ph of the mg oh 2 solution decreased from 10 45 to 8 3 fig 3 c the zeta potential decreased with increasing molar ratios for both caco3 and mg oh 2 solutions stumm 1992 suspected that molecules of dissolved has can be considered as flexible polyelectrolytes with anionic functional groups which also have hydrophobic components adsorption of has on inorganic surfaces could happen from the ligand exchange of functional groups on the humic substances carboxylic phenolic with surface hydroxyl groups on the metal oxides supplemented by a hydrophobic interaction involving nonpolar components of the humic molecules in addition the binding of metal ions to the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on ha can occur in a monodentate and bidentate form the stockholm humic model shm predicts that the dissolution of caco3 and mg oh 2 increases with the concentration of ha fig a11 based on modeling data the dissolved ca2 ions can form mono and bidentate complexes i e haca aq and ha2ca and mg2 ions form monodentate complex hamg aq in a modeling study reported by gustafsson 2001 it was suggested that a monodentate calcium complex is the dominant form in acidic ph and bidentate complex becomes significant only above ph 10 although electrostatic repulsion arising from the high negative charge density of ha and caco3 surfaces at high ph leads to low levels of ha adsorption as speculated by bob and walker 2001 ha does not adsorb to calcite by a simple charge neutralization mechanism rather ha adsorbs to calcite through specific or non specific chemical interactions between ha and the caco3 surface the ph and zeta potential of ha caco3 and ha mg oh 2 at a fixed molar ratio of 0 05 1 are shown in fig 3 e and f increasing the temperature from 25 to 65 c increased slightly the magnitude of the zeta potential of ha caco3 25 mv at 25 c to 29 mv at 65 c and ha mg oh 2 system with molar ratio of 0 05 1 37 mv at 25 c to 40 mv at 65 c while the ph slightly increased for the former and decreased for the latter system 3 3 4 the effect of clay on the zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particle systems suspended solids can be removed from waters during lime softening in this study bentonite montmorillonite al2o3 sio2 h2o was used to represent suspended solids the pzc of bentonite is around ph of 2 5 stumm 1992 implying that bentonite would be negatively charged throughout the ph range tested in our study the effect of increasing clay content on the zeta potential of the clay caco3 and clay mg oh 2 systems was studied for both experiments there was no obvious change of ph with the increasing clay concentration it was observed fig 3 d that when introducing clay to caco3 particles the zeta potential of the system became more negative as more clay was added at clay caco3 molar ratio of 0 05 the zeta potential was around 28 mv similar results were observed for the clay and mg oh 2 interaction although the zeta potential of mg oh 2 started around 10 mv at the clay mg oh 2 molar ratio of 0 05 the zeta potential was around 37 mv the modeling fig a12 indicated no formation of new calcium minerals in clay caco3 system while there was the potential formation of magnesium silicate precipitates such as chrysotile mg3 si2o5 oh 4 and sepiolite mg4si6o15 oh 2 6h2o in clay mg oh 2 systems the effect of temperature on the ph and zeta potential of clay caco3 and clay mg oh 2 at a fixed molar ratio of 1 1 is shown in fig 3 e and f increasing the temperature from 25 to 65 c increased slightly the magnitude of the zeta potential of clay caco3 17 mv at 25 c to 21 mv at 65 c and clay mg oh 2 system with molar ratio of 1 1 25 mv at 25 c to 31 mv at 65 c and the ph decreased slightly for both systems 3 4 interpretation of the scenarios 3 4 1 surface charge development and zeta potential the surface charge of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in a lime softener depends on the chemical species on their surfaces the equilibrium reactions between those species and the chemical species present in solution based on x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and low energy electron diffraction leed analysis stipp and hochella jr 1991 have shown that caco3 contains co3h0 and caoh0 as functional groups on the surface in water these functional groups can interact with potential determining ions pdi such as ca2 and co3 2 or hco3 or h2co3 stipp 1999 thompson and pownall 1989 which could change the surface charge of caco3 there are no specific studies available in the literature that investigate the functional groups on the surface of mg oh 2 particles russell et al 2009b suspected that mgoh could be the functional group dictating the surface charge of mg oh 2 based on the functional group charge development theory surface equilibrium reactions and potential surface species can be illustrated in fig 4 a and b for mg oh 2 and caco3 particles respectively particle surface charges attract ions strongly bound on the surface stern layer and less firmly associated diffuse layer so called electrostatic double layer israelachvili 1992 the particle with stern layer acts as a single entity and zeta potential ζ is the potential experimentally measured at the shear plane the stern potential ψst is determined by the surface potential and stern layer structure and the potential decreases exponentially with distance from the stern potential through the diffuse layer israelachvili 1992 only water and mg oh 2 fig 4 a or caco3 particles fig 4 b are considered in the schematic drawing as the reference position a brief data summary of sign of zeta potential under different scenarios is listed for comparison based on the electrostatic double layer theory the schematic of changes of zeta potential corresponding to different scenarios is also illustrated red curve represents the reference position and the sign of zeta potential depends on surface potential green dotted curve is for reversed stern potential from the reference due to significant change of stern layer structure from strong interactions with opposite charges to the reference leading to reversed zeta potential blue dotted curve indicates increased magnitude of stern potential from the reference due to strong interactions with alike charges to the reference leading to increased magnitude of zeta potential red dotted curve indicates suppressed diffuse layer from the reference due to increased ionic strength leading to decreased magnitude of zeta potential it should be emphasized that the differences in zeta potential was not due to different ionic strength of these suspensions the samples have a low ionic strength in the range of 0 4 20 mm increasing of ionic strength will shrink the double layer and only lead to the decrease of the magnitude of the zeta potential and vice versa fig 4a and b red dotted lines the zeta potential values observed are either reversed sign or increased magnitude with increased ionic strength therefore such changes cannot be due to the changes of ionic strength and be discussed below case by case for strong surface adsorption or reactions positive zeta potential was observed for mg oh 2 particles in water due to the presence of oh mg 2 mg h2o oh h and oh mg h2o 2 in the stern layer fig 4 a red solid line eqs 1 and 2 at high ph values a reduction in the zeta potential was observed which is due to the increase of mgo the presence of carbonate alkalinity co3 2 hco3 or atmospheric co2 from the atmosphere aging changed the zeta potential of mg oh 2 to less positive or being reversed to negative this indicates a change of the stern layer structure due to strong adsorption of co3 2 hco3 leading to less positive or even negative stern potential fig 4 a green dotted line the negative zeta potential measured for preformed mg oh 2 at 65 c also indicates strong adsorption of co3 2 preformed caco3 particles exhibit negative zeta potential due to the presence of ca co3 and co3 in the stern layer fig 4 b red solid line the ph will shift the equilibrium fig 4 b eqs 3 and 4 and causes the variations of zeta potential as a function of ph the zeta potential of caco3 particles changes from negative to positive in excess divalent metal cations ca2 mg2 due to the formation of co3 ca and co3 mg in the stern layer fig 4 b green dotted line excess co3 2 or aging increases the magnitude of the zeta potential of caco3 to more negative due to the adsorption of co3 2 hco3 and oh ions shifting the surface equilibrium reactions fig 4 b blue dotted line it can be concluded that strong interactions exist among the binary particles systems as new zeta potential distribution peaks were observed in the binary systems compared to those of the individual components fig 4 c and d there were either a zeta potential peak position in between two peaks from the individual components caco3 mg oh 2 of molar ratio 1 1 caco3 ha of molar ratio 1 0 05 caco3 clay of molar ratio 1 1 a peak at much more negative position than the two peaks of the individual components caco3 na2sio3 of 1 1 mg oh 2 na2sio3 of 1 1 and multiple peaks mg oh 2 ha of 1 0 05 mg oh 2 clay of 1 1 which are not due to the overlapping of peaks from individual components 3 4 2 implications to lime softening operation the understanding of the electrophoretic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles obtained in this study has important implications for lime softening processes for both municipal and industrial water treatment for municipal water treatment the finding that zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles and the interactions between them are temperature dependent implies that lime softening operations probably need to be adjusted from summer to winter conditions the finding that co3 2 hco3 impacts zeta potential of both caco3 and mg oh 2 implies carbonate alkalinity needs to be taken into account as alkalinity control is an important lime softening operational parameter at the same time warm lime softening wls is commonly used in many industrial water treatment applications including treating oilfield produced water for hardness alkalinity and silica removal heins 2009 and softening of cooling water and boiler feed water streams in spite of the fact that wls has been commonly used for many years very little is known about the fundamental interactions and electrokinetic properties particle charge of the resulting caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in the softener the results of this study will be relevant to wls onsite chemical dosage evaluation and operational controls especially during a wls effluent off specification event for example the zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles decreases in the presence of elevated concentrations of nom clay and silica for waters subject to significant variability in silica or nom concentrations e g cyclic steam stimulation enhanced oil recovery operations or river sources after storm events these changes in raw water quality may influence the dose of the coagulant needed and the efficiency of the softening process for particle removal as observed in this study a wide range of other parameters including ph and the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ions alkalinity and clay have been shown to affect the surface charges of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles this research has also found that the particles present in softeners and their surface charge can depend on the presence of atmospheric co2 this must be taken into consideration as some industrial softeners are operated in covered vessels with a nitrogen atmosphere to exclude oxygen and co2 in addition temperature affects the surface charge of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles and the interactions between them and the zeta potential of precipitated particles may therefore be different for cold warm and hot softening processes the bench scale jar testing for selecting and optimizing coagulant and flocculant needs to be conducted at the same temperature as the real lime softening process bench scale jar testing conducted at room temperature will probably provide misleading results for higher temperature lime softening processes analytical instruments such as zeta potential analyzers can provide useful information on particle charge that may augment the information provided by traditional tests 4 conclusions both preformed and freshly precipitated mg oh 2 particles exhibit positive zeta potential between ph 9 5 11 5 the zeta potential of preformed caco3 particles can vary significantly from that of freshly precipitated particles preformed caco3 particles exhibit negative zeta potential in the ph range of 9 0 11 5 freshly precipitated caco3 particles can be either negatively or positively charged depending on the concentrations of other potential determining ions co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 present in the solution the zeta potential of preformed mg oh 2 particles can vary significantly from that of freshly precipitated particles the zeta potential of preformed mg oh 2 is 10 mv at room temperature and slowly decreases as the temperature increases over the range of 25 to 65 c and is reversed to 5 mv at 65 c but the zeta potential of in situ precipitated mg oh 2 is higher 25 mv at room temperature and is not affected much by temperature rise the zeta potential of preformed caco3 is between 10 and 15 mv at room temperature and becomes more negative as temperature increases the zeta potential of in situ formed caco3 is 5 mv and increases with increasing temperature the zeta potential of caco3 particles can change from negative to positive resulting from the existence of divalent metal cations ca2 mg2 or mg oh 2 the divalent metal cations ca2 mg2 can adsorb on caco3 particles and change its zeta potential from negative to positive mg oh 2 can interact with caco3 and gradually decrease the magnitude of its negative charge the presence of carbonate alkalinity co3 2 hco3 or exposure to atmospheric co2 changes the zeta potential of caco3 to more negative and the zeta potentail of mg oh 2 to less positive or being reversed to negative the addition of silica clay or humic acid can easily shift mg oh 2 particles from being positively charged to negatively charged and easily increase the magnitude of negatively charged caco3 particles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17565,significant effort has been made to measure and understand the surface charge of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles many laboratory experiments have been reported on zeta potential of natural and prepared caco3 and a few have also been published for mg oh 2 however there are very few reported measurements of zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles at conditions relevant to lime softening despite lime softening being a common and established process for water treatment the present study aims to understand the interactions and electrokinetic properties of these two particles in lime softening effects of various experimental parameters such as ph temperature aging inorganic carbon co3 2 hco3 and divalent cations ca2 mg2 on the electrokinetic properties i e zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles were individually studied the interactions between humic acid mimicking natural organic matter silicate representing silica clay mimicking suspended solids and caco3 mg oh 2 particles were studied as well as the interactions between caco3 and mg oh 2 thermodynamic modeling was used to predict precipitates as a function of solution chemistry and assist with data interpretation the results provide considerable insight into factors that are of importance to lime softening graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords zeta potential lime softening thermodynamic modeling calcium carbonate magnesium hydroxide potential determining ions 1 introduction chemical precipitative lime softening is a common and established process in water and wastewater treatment during which the ph of the treated water is raised sufficiently to remove calcium and magnesium hardness by converting ca2 to caco3 and mg2 to mg oh 2 both precipitating from the treated water as solids awwa 1990 during lime softening chemicals normally added are lime the process is referred to as lime softening or lime in combination with soda ash referred to as lime soda softening the former is typically used to remove carbonate hardness and the latter can remove both carbonate and non carbonate hardness ostovar and amiri 2013 although there is not a clear distinction depending on the operating temperature lime softening can be classified as cold i e 15 to 60 c warm i e 60 to 85 c and hot lime softening i e 90 to 105 c usually cold lime softening is deployed for softening drinking water in municipal applications while warm and hot lime softening are used for treating industrial water for example a warm or hot lime softening process is commonly applied to treat oilfield produced water derived from steam assisted gravity drainage sagd oil recovery operations heins 2009 as well as industrial cooling knight 1981 and boiler feed waters understanding the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles relevant to lime softening conditions is of importance and has not been well explored especially for warm and hot lime softening where industrial wastewater is composed of multi components and higher temperature might play an important role as well the zeta potential is a parameter used to evaluate the electrokinetic behavior of particles which can provide information on their surface charge particle stability and subsequent easiness to coagulate black and christman 1961 israelachvili 1992 many laboratory experiments have been reported on zeta potential of caco3 mahrouqi et al 2017 wolthers et al 2008 however very few reported zeta potential of caco3 particles at conditions relevant to lime softening most measurements of zeta potential of caco3 were conducted using natural samples of calcite or using preformed caco3 however caco3 generated during lime softening is mostly freshly precipitated in some cases preformed caco3 may be added or lime sludge is recycled back into the precipitation system to facilitate precipitation during lime softening in comparison to caco3 the zeta potential measurements of mg oh 2 have been even less explored black and christman 1961 larson and buswell 1940 russell et al 2009a the published results regarding the surface charge of caco3 are often contradictory and there has been a lot of debate over the sign of the surface charge and the potential determining ions eriksson et al 2007 even among the reports on zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles at conditions relevant to water softening the published results on the surface charge of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles are not consistent even the sign of their surface charge being opposite among some reports for example larson and buswell 1940 found mg oh 2 particles to be positively charged and caco3 particles to be negatively charged throughout the ph range of water softening the lower end of the ph range was not specified but the higher end was specified as ph 12 black and christman 1961 reported that throughout the entire ph range of lime soda softening the zeta potential of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 was positive ph ranging from 10 2 to 11 2 and the zeta potential of freshly precipitated caco3 was negative ph ranging from 9 0 to 11 0 russell et al 2009a reported that the zeta potential of caco3 was dependent on caco3 source with preformed caco3 having a negative zeta potential at ph of 10 4 while freshly precipitated caco3 having a positive zeta potential at the same ph furthermore the sign of the zeta potential of both freshly precipitated caco3 and freshly precipitated mg oh 2 depended on ph freshly precipitated caco3 was negatively charged at ph values lower than 10 5 but positively charged at ph values higher than 10 5 freshly precipitated mg oh 2 was negatively charged at ph values lower than 11 5 but positively charged at ph values higher than 11 5 in this work a systematic study was carried out to understand the electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles through zeta potential measurements throughout the wide ph range possibly encountered in lime softening zeta potential measurements were conducted under controlled conditions including ph temperature aging time while exposed to the atmosphere varied concentration of cations mg2 and ca2 for caco3 particles only and anions co3 2 and hco3 for mg oh 2 particles only the presence of possible interacting species in water including humic acid ha silicate and clay freshly precipitated caco3 and mg oh 2 particles were obtained from synthetic water samples and their zeta potentials were measured the rationale for studying these influencing parameters is as follows 1 ph is an important factor affecting zeta potential and lime softening 2 atmospheric co2 can influence zeta potential measurements and its impact needs to be addressed wolthers et al 2008 3 the temperature dependence of zeta potential for caco3 and mg oh 2 remains poorly understood and needs to be addressed especially at the higher temperatures of warm hot softening 4 the effect of co3 2 and hco3 was studied as alkalinity control is an important lime softening operational parameter 5 the interaction between caco3 and mg oh 2 particles was studied because caco3 and mg oh 2 particles might be formed simultaneously during lime softening and most softening sludges contain both caco3 and mg oh 2 particles black and christman 1961 and 6 the interaction between humic acid ha mimicking natural organic matter silicate representing silica as well as clay mimicking suspended solids and caco3 mg oh 2 particles was studied because these compounds are common components in wastewater and can interact with caco3 mg oh 2 particles during lime softening adusei gyamfi et al 2019 latour et al 2014 for example natural organic matter can be removed through coprecipitation with formed caco3 and mg oh 2 during lime softening mercer et al 2005 russell et al 2009a 2009b for comparison with freshly precipitated particles preformed caco3 and mg oh 2 were also studied to understand how sample preparation might affect zeta potentials of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles thermodynamic modeling using visual minteq software was used to predict precipitates as a function of solution chemistry and assist with zeta potential data interpretation the results from this detailed and systematic study will provide a better understanding of the interactions and electrokinetic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in these complicated and multicomponent systems which is important to better understand their coagulation and flocculation mechanisms 2 experiment and methods 2 1 chemicals calcium chloride dihydrate cacl2 2h2o acs reagent 99 magnesium chloride hexahydrate mgcl2 6h2o acs reagent 99 sodium bicarbonate nahco3 99 7 sodium carbonate na2co3 anhydrous 99 5 and sodium hydroxide naoh acs reagent 97 were purchased from fisher chemicals calcium carbonate caco3 reagentplus 99 magnesium hydroxide mg oh 2 99 sodium metasilicate na2sio3 granular ha technical bentonite analogue montmorillonite al2o3 sio2 h2o were purchased from sigma aldrich milli q water millipore deionized with a resistivity of 18 2 mω cm was used for preparation of all water samples 2 2 sample preparation and tests fresh stock solutions of cacl2 na2co3 mgcl2 naoh and nahco3 were prepared cacl2 and na2co3 stock solutions were used to produce caco3 precipitation mgcl2 and naoh stock solutions were used to produce mg oh 2 precipitation water samples containing preformed caco3 and mg oh 2 were also prepared the average particle size of preformed caco3 and mg oh 2 in suspension was determined to be 5 1 μm and 12 8 μm respectively using a beckman coulter ls 13 320 particle size analyzer each water sample ws was prepared in a 50 ml plastic centrifugation tube fisher scientific and mixed at 200 rpm in the multi thermal shaker mandel scientific can for 5 min detailed sample information is provided in tables a1 and a2 in the supporting information si the ph was measured by a fisher scientific accumet ae150 ph benchtop meter which was calibrated using the standard buffer solutions with known ph values ph 4 0 7 0 and 10 0 naoh 1 m and hcl 1 m solutions were used for ph adjustment zeta potential is an experimentally determined parameter that describes the electrostatic charge of particles in solutions fig a1 the zeta potential of the suspended particles in water samples was analyzed by a malvern zetasizer nano zs with a high concentration zeta potential cell zen1010 which has a temperature limit of 70 c the temperature of water samqples was controlled at 25 35 45 55 and 65 c to study the temperature effect the equipment utilizes dynamic light scattering for determining the electrophoretic mobility of particles fig a1 then the zeta potential of the particles is calculated from the measured electrophoretic mobility i e velocity using the smoluchowski equation 1 u e ε ζ η where ue ɛ ζ and η are the electrophoretic mobility dielectric constant of water zeta potential and viscosity of water respectively the zeta potential distribution was generated by the zetasizer for each measurement and a single averaged zeta potential value was obtained based on the zeta potential distribution a single measurement on each sample was repeated 5 times and mean values with standard deviations are reported 2 3 prediction of precipitates using thermodynamic modeling the potential precipitates under different conditions ph temperature co2 exposure chemical species etc were predicted by calculating saturation indices sis using thermodynamic modeling visual minteq version 3 1 the saturation index si is defined as 2 s i log i a p k s p where iap and ksp are the ionic activity product in the chemical reaction and solubility product of the precipitate respectively it should be noted that the ionic activities were calculated by visual minteq using the davies equation for solutions with low ionic strength for solutions with moderate ionic strength debye hückel equation was used and for solutions with high ionic strength specific ion interaction theory was used the si indicates the potential of a specific precipitate to be formed when si 0 the solution is supersaturated and the precipitate can form when si 0 the solution is undersaturated and the precipitate cannot form when si 0 the solution is in equilibrium 3 results and discussion 3 1 the zeta potential of mg oh 2 particles the zeta potentials of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 precipitated from 4 mm mgcl2 and 8 mm naoh and preformed mg oh 2 particles 4 mm commercially purchased mg oh 2 in water were measured as a function of ph temperature aging and varying concentration of nahco3 na2co3 fig 1 as described in the following sections 3 1 1 the effect of ph the zeta potential measurements of freshly precipitated and preformed mg oh 2 particles under various phs at 25 c showed that both particles exhibited positive charge at their initial solution ph and over a relatively wide ph range fig 1 a for the preformed mg oh 2 the point of zero charge pzc was observed around ph 11 8 11 9 this observation agrees with the findings of parks 1965 who reported that the pzc of mg oh 2 was at a ph of 12 for the freshly precipitated mg oh 2 the zeta potential was still slightly positive at a ph of 12 5 however a decreasing trend was quite clear at the same ph the zeta potential of the freshly precipitated particles was higher than that of preformed mg oh 2 for the ph range of 10 2 11 0 we observed a similar trend to black and christman 1961 who found that freshly precipitated mg oh 2 exhibited a zeta potential of approximately 7 5 mv throughout this ph range reducing the ph to 10 from the intial ph did not affect the zeta potential of preformed mg oh 2 but lowered that of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 from 25 to 20 mv fig 1 a at a ph of 9 0 negative zeta potential was recorded the modeling with atmospheric co2 included si figs a2 a and b suggested that hydromagnesite mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o magnesite mgco3 and artinite mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o are the dominant species in descending order at ph 9 5 only mgco3 precipitates at a ph of 9 0 the observed negative charge at ph values lower than 9 5 can be ascribed to the formation of a mixture of mgco3 and mg oh 2 in the form of hydromagnesite this is in good agreement with the previous report that freshly precipiated mgco3 was best characterized as a hydromagnesite and carried negative zeta potential russell et al 2009a 3 1 2 the effect of temperature the measured phs and zeta potentials of suspensions of freshly precipitated and preformed mg oh 2 particles as a function of temperature are shown in fig 1 b the resulting ph of both suspensions decreased with increasing temperature the zeta potential of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 increased slowly from 22 mv at 25 c to 27 mv at 65 c in the case of preformed mg oh 2 particles the zeta potential was positive between 25 and 45 c but much lower compared to the freshly precipitated one 5 mv vs 22 mv at 25 c however the zeta potential decreased when the temperature was raised to 55 c and became negative at 65 c 5 mv for the freshly precipitated mg oh 2 case including co2 the calculated sis fig a2 c indicate that mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o mgco3 and mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o in descending order are the insoluble minerals below 35 c while above 35 c brucite mg oh 2 also precipitates additionally with increasing temperature the si of mgco3 decreases and that of mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o and brucite increases for the preformed mg oh 2 brucite is at equilibrium throughout and mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o has the highest si with co2 at high temperature 65 c fig a2 d 3 1 3 the effect of aging as the concentration of dissolved co2 increases due to exposure to atmospheric co2 the ph and total alkalinity change with time which could result in changes of the charge on the particle surface as shown in fig 1 c the ph of both water samples decreased with increasing exposure time to the ambient co2 the zeta potentials of both types of particles followed a decreasing trend with aging time for the freshly precipitated mg oh 2 zeta potential was reversed to negative the sis predicted fis a2 a and b at 25 c with co2 input indicated that with aging mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o mgco3 and mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o in descending order can precipitate 3 1 4 the effect of nahco3 and na2co3 the effect of nahco3 and na2co3 addition on the zeta potential of freshly precipitated mg oh 2 was studied fig 1 d as nahco3 solution was added a steady decrease in the ph from 11 to 10 3 was observed this was accompanied by a rapid decrease in the zeta potential initially from 25 to 5 mv and a slow decrease until the zeta potential became negative in the case of na2co3 addition a similar decreasing trend was observed in the zeta potential although the ph showed an increase from 11 to 11 25 the predicted species with sis greater than zero are mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o mgco3 and mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o in descending order fig a3 3 2 the zeta potential of caco3 particles the zeta potentials of freshly precipitated and preformed caco3 particles 4 mm caco3 in water were measured as a function of ph temperature aging and mgcl2 fig 2 as described in the following sections three different samples of freshly precipitated caco3 were prepared by varying molar ratios of cacl2 to na2co3 from 2 1 to 1 1 and to 1 2 from reactions of 8 mm cacl2 and 4 mm na2co3 4 mm cacl2 and 4 mm na2co3 4 mm cacl2 and 8 mm na2co3 in the solutions respectively 3 2 1 the effect of ph the zeta potential measurements of preformed and freshly precipitated caco3 at 25 c fig 2 a showed that the zeta potential of the preformed caco3 was negative throughout the ph range tested 9 0 11 5 which is consistent with other reported studies for example bob and walker 2001 reported a negative zeta potential for caco3 throughout the studied ph range of 8 4 11 6 in the presence of 0 001 m kcl black and christman 1961 found that both freshly precipitated and resuspended caco3 particles were negatively charged throughout the ph range of 9 0 11 0 the zeta potential of the preformed caco3 decreased with increasing ph foxall et al 1979 thompson and pownall 1989 and stipp 1999 have shown that the electrophoretic mobility of calcite particles is only secondarily affected by the ph and that the bulk concentration of ca2 and co3 2 and other carbonate species are the potential determining ions pdis they found that the zeta potential of preformed caco3 was 24 36 mv at ph of 10 4 somasundaran and agar 1967 concluded that the principal pdis of caco3 were indentified as ca2 hco3 h and oh co3 2 ions also were found to play a major role above ph of 9 0 they proposed that the principal mechanism of charge devleopment at the surface was preferential hydrolysis of surface calcium and carbonate ions or the hydrolysis of the bulk solution ions followed by the adsorption of the resulting complexes at the surface russell et al 2009a conducted jar tests on softening a water composed of nahco3 cacl2 and kno3 with ca oh 2 and found that the freshly precipitated caco3 exhibited a slightly positive zeta potential at lower ph values 9 0 negative zeta potential at ph values ranging from 9 0 to 10 5 and positive zeta potential at ph values ranging from 10 5 to 11 6 in this study freshly precipitated caco3 with molar ratios of cacl2 na2co3 of 2 1 and 1 1 showed positive zeta potential while the freshly precipitated caco3 with molar ratio of cacl2 na2co3 of 1 2 showed negative zeta potential fig 2 a for freshly precipitated caco3 cacl2 na2co3 2 1 its zeta potential was positive throughout the ph range tested the positive zeta potential can be attributed to the presence of excess ca2 ions a similar effect was observed in the presence of mg2 ions which will be discussed later this is further supported by the fact that reducing the molar ratio of cacl2 to na2co3 also lowered the zeta potential for freshly precipitated caco3 cacl2 na2co3 1 1 its zeta potential at initial ph was slightly positive but dropped to negative at other tested phs for freshly precipitated caco3 cacl2 na2co3 1 2 its zeta potential was negative throughout the ph range tested which is accounted for by the excess of carbonate ions in the solution the trend of zeta potential change was very similar to that of freshly precipitated caco3 cacl2 na2co3 1 1 there has been debate on the pdis for caco3 and it is more generally accepted that ca2 and co3 2 and other carbonate species are the pdis in our results comparing the three situations ca2 in excess co3 2 in excess or ca2 and co3 2 of equal ratio it can be clearly seen that in the presence of ca2 or co3 2 in the solution ph plays a less important role in electric charge modification of the caco3 surfaces which is in good agreement with previous reports derkani et al 2019 mahani et al 2015 supporting that ca2 and co3 2 are the pdis for both preformed and freshly precipitated caco3 the predicted mineral species with sis greater than zero for in situ formed caco3 cases were all polymorphs of caco3 calcite aragonite vaterite caco3 xh2o in a descending order with a slightly higher sis with co2 input than that of without fig a3 the sis predicted for calcite preformed caco3 was zero for the entire ph range implying an equilibrium between dissolved and precipitated caco3 fig a3 3 2 2 the effect of temperature with temperature increasing from 25 to 65 c the ph of preformed caco3 remained fairly stable whereas the zeta potential decreased from 12 mv to 22 mv fig 2 b for freshly precipitated caco3 temperature change showed effects depending on the initial molar ratios of precursor materials cacl2 na2co3 both cacl2 na2co3 1 1 and cacl2 na2co3 2 1 showed similar trends of ph and zeta potential for cacl2 na2co3 1 1 the ph of the particles started around 10 0 and decreased with increasing temperature 9 5 at 65 c the zeta potential became more positive 5 to 15 mv as the temperature increased for cacl2 na2co3 2 1 excess ca2 ions the ph was 9 7 and decreased with increasing temperature 8 3 at 65 c the zeta potential was around 20 mv initially and increased further with increasing temperature for the case of cacl2 na2co3 1 2 where the water sample has excessive co3 2 ions the ph remained fairly close to 11 0 and the zeta potential became more negative as the temperature increased following the trend of preformed caco3 the predicted mineral species in descending order of si for in situ formed samples were calcite aragonite vaterite and caco3 xh2o respectively fig a5 with increasing temperature the solubility of caco3 inceases in the absence of atmospheric co2 while decreases with atmospheric co2 present coto et al 2012 wells 1915 thus without co2 si of calcite decreased with increasing temperature with co2 si of calcite increased with increasing temperature fig a5 mahrouqi et al 2016 2017 reported that the zeta potential of natural calcium carbonate in the presence of atmospheric co2 became less negative with increasing temperature which was explained by increased ca2 concentration resulting from increased calcite dissolution with increasing temperature our observation of a different trend for the zeta potential of preformed caco3 with respect to temperature could be due to the impact caused by exposure to atmospheric co2 in our system where solubility of caco3 decreases with increasing temperature corresponding to the modeling in fig a5 the plots of the activity of soluble species fig a6 showed that with co2 for cacl2 na2co3 of 1 1 and 2 1 the activity of ca2 and co3 2 kept almost the same while that of hco3 obviously decreased with increasing temperature leading to the observed increased zeta potential with increasing temperature for cacl2 na2co3 of 1 2 and preformed caco3 the activity of co3 2 kept almost the same while that of ca2 obviously decreased with increasing temperature leading to the observed decreased zeta potential with increasing temperature 3 2 3 the effect of aging it has been reported that timing and exposure to atmospheric co2 can possibly influence the zeta potential measurements of caco3 particles russell et al 2009a wolthers et al 2008 to study the effect of aging freshly precipitated and preformed caco3 were exposed to the atmospheric condition for 48 h and their zeta potentials and phs were measured periodically the observed trend in ph and zeta potential is shown in fig 2 c respectively during the aging test the ph of all water samples decreased over time due to the increased amount of dissolved co2 the zeta potential of all particles decreased over time for freshly precipitaed caco3 particles cacl2 na2co3 2 1 or 1 1 their zeta potentials started being positive and were eventually reversed to negative at the end of the aging experiment ph of all water samples ranged from 8 10 within which hco3 is the dominating species 3 2 4 the effect of mgcl2 mgcl2 stock solution was gradually added to the preformed caco3 to assess the impact of mg2 ion on the charge of caco3 particles at 25 c the mg2 ions had the same effect on the zeta potential as excess ca2 ions as discussed in the sections above the zeta potential of the caco3 was negative but was eventually reversed to positive with the addtion of mgcl2 fig 2 d upon addition of 0 5 ml of 100 mm mgcl2 molar ratio of mgcl2 to caco3 0 5 average zeta potential was close to zero and addition of 2 ml of 100 mm mgcl2 molar ratio of mgcl2 to caco3 2 reversed the zeta potential of caco3 particles to positive a study done by black and christman 1961 showed a similar result the mobility of caco3 2 mm became zero when 80 ppm of mgcl2 was added also it was reported that magnesium can be incorporated into the caco3 crystal lattice which results in the formation of a mixed mg caco3 solid during softening leading to more positive surface charge russell et al 2009b the modeling indicates the potential formation of dolomite camg co3 2 fig a7 3 3 interactions of binary particles the following sections describe the zeta potential as a function of molar ratio of caco3 to mg oh 2 at different temperatures fig 3 a impacts of ha mimicking natural organic matter silicate representing silica clay mimicking suspended solids on the zeta potential of caco3 mg oh 2 particles systems at 25 c with different dosage fig 3 b d and at different temperatures with the fixed dosage fig 3 e and f 3 3 1 mg oh 2 and caco3particles caco3 and mg oh 2 particles might be formed simultaneously during lime softening to study the interaction between caco3 and mg oh 2 particles under lime softening conditions the molar ratio of mg oh 2 and caco3 was varied from 0 to 2 with 0 2 4 8 mm mg oh 2 in 4 mm caco3 suspensions respectively and the zeta potentials were measured at different temperatures fig 3 a the zeta potential of the binary system was negative and became positive when the molar ratio of mg oh 2 to caco3 was increased to 0 5 further increasing the ratio to 1 and 2 led to a slow but steady increase in zeta potential at 25 c and 45 c the trend was slightly different at 65 c where the zeta potential increased rapidly from molar ratio 0 to 1 and then became stable after that since mg oh 2 carries positive charge and caco3 carries negative charge the observed change in zeta potential from negative to positive with increasing ratio of mg oh 2 is reasonable in an early study black and christman 1961 found that both positively and negatively charged particles were present in a softening sludge consisting of both caco3 and mg oh 2 the relative number of negatively charged particles decreased with increasing ph interaction between the two types of particles could also lead to formation of new minerals with various compositions the possible species in decreasing order of sis fig a8 are huntite camg3 co3 4 hydromagnesite mg5 oh 2 co3 4 4h2o dolomite camg co3 2 magnesite mgco3 artinite mg2 oh 2co3 3h2o 3 3 2 the effect of silicate on the zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles silicate is the ubiquitous constituent of industrial produced water the ph and zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 in the presence of various amounts of na2sio3 to represent sio2 were measured with 0 4 2 4 8 mm na2sio3 in 4 mm preformed mg oh 2 or caco3 suspensions respectively the pzc of silicate is around ph 2 3 stumm 1992 implying that silicate would be negatively charged throughout the ph range tested in our study fig 3 b shows the ph and zeta potentials as a function of molar ratios of na2sio3 and caco3 or mg oh 2 there was a sharp increase in ph at the molar ratio of 0 1 followed by a slow increase at ratios 0 5 and higher in the case of caco3 zeta potentials showed a sharp decrease from 10 to 37 mv at molar ratio 0 1 followed by a slow decrease to 45 mv between molar ratios 0 5 to 2 mg oh 2 and na2sio3 system also followed the same trend with increasing ratio of na2sio3 although the final zeta potential was 55 mv the negative zeta potential is expected to be dominated by the presence of the charged surface species of si o brady and walther 1989 and a direct result of the increase in ph that shifts functional groups from si oh to si o the modeling indicates that there are no calcium silicate minerals formed for the silicate caco3 system fig a9 while magnesium silicates such as chrysotile mg3 si2o5 oh 4 may form fig a10 for the silicate mg oh 2 system as shown in fig 3 e and f with increasing temperature in the range of 25 to 65 c the zeta potential of silicate caco3 molar ratio 1 1 system remained almost unchanged for silicate mg oh 2 molar ratio 1 1 system the zeta potential remained negative and the magnitude decreased slightly 64 mv at 25 c to 60 mv at 65 c while the ph of both systems slightly decreased 3 3 3 the effect of humic acid ha on the zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles studies have shown that nom can be removed during lime softening process through coprecipitating with caco3 and mg oh 2 solids russell et al 2009a 2009b oil field produced water and many other industrial wastewaters contain dissolved organic substances that have similar chemical characteristics to ha most importantly in the presence of large number of negatively charged functional groups pillai et al 2017 hence ha is used in this study to mimic organic matter in produced water similar to the silicate experiments the ph and zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 in the presence of various amounts of ha were measured with 0 4 2 4 8 mm ha in 4 mm preformed mg oh 2 or caco3 suspensions respectively with increasing concentration of ha the ph of the caco3 solution decreased from 9 45 to 8 3 and the ph of the mg oh 2 solution decreased from 10 45 to 8 3 fig 3 c the zeta potential decreased with increasing molar ratios for both caco3 and mg oh 2 solutions stumm 1992 suspected that molecules of dissolved has can be considered as flexible polyelectrolytes with anionic functional groups which also have hydrophobic components adsorption of has on inorganic surfaces could happen from the ligand exchange of functional groups on the humic substances carboxylic phenolic with surface hydroxyl groups on the metal oxides supplemented by a hydrophobic interaction involving nonpolar components of the humic molecules in addition the binding of metal ions to the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on ha can occur in a monodentate and bidentate form the stockholm humic model shm predicts that the dissolution of caco3 and mg oh 2 increases with the concentration of ha fig a11 based on modeling data the dissolved ca2 ions can form mono and bidentate complexes i e haca aq and ha2ca and mg2 ions form monodentate complex hamg aq in a modeling study reported by gustafsson 2001 it was suggested that a monodentate calcium complex is the dominant form in acidic ph and bidentate complex becomes significant only above ph 10 although electrostatic repulsion arising from the high negative charge density of ha and caco3 surfaces at high ph leads to low levels of ha adsorption as speculated by bob and walker 2001 ha does not adsorb to calcite by a simple charge neutralization mechanism rather ha adsorbs to calcite through specific or non specific chemical interactions between ha and the caco3 surface the ph and zeta potential of ha caco3 and ha mg oh 2 at a fixed molar ratio of 0 05 1 are shown in fig 3 e and f increasing the temperature from 25 to 65 c increased slightly the magnitude of the zeta potential of ha caco3 25 mv at 25 c to 29 mv at 65 c and ha mg oh 2 system with molar ratio of 0 05 1 37 mv at 25 c to 40 mv at 65 c while the ph slightly increased for the former and decreased for the latter system 3 3 4 the effect of clay on the zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particle systems suspended solids can be removed from waters during lime softening in this study bentonite montmorillonite al2o3 sio2 h2o was used to represent suspended solids the pzc of bentonite is around ph of 2 5 stumm 1992 implying that bentonite would be negatively charged throughout the ph range tested in our study the effect of increasing clay content on the zeta potential of the clay caco3 and clay mg oh 2 systems was studied for both experiments there was no obvious change of ph with the increasing clay concentration it was observed fig 3 d that when introducing clay to caco3 particles the zeta potential of the system became more negative as more clay was added at clay caco3 molar ratio of 0 05 the zeta potential was around 28 mv similar results were observed for the clay and mg oh 2 interaction although the zeta potential of mg oh 2 started around 10 mv at the clay mg oh 2 molar ratio of 0 05 the zeta potential was around 37 mv the modeling fig a12 indicated no formation of new calcium minerals in clay caco3 system while there was the potential formation of magnesium silicate precipitates such as chrysotile mg3 si2o5 oh 4 and sepiolite mg4si6o15 oh 2 6h2o in clay mg oh 2 systems the effect of temperature on the ph and zeta potential of clay caco3 and clay mg oh 2 at a fixed molar ratio of 1 1 is shown in fig 3 e and f increasing the temperature from 25 to 65 c increased slightly the magnitude of the zeta potential of clay caco3 17 mv at 25 c to 21 mv at 65 c and clay mg oh 2 system with molar ratio of 1 1 25 mv at 25 c to 31 mv at 65 c and the ph decreased slightly for both systems 3 4 interpretation of the scenarios 3 4 1 surface charge development and zeta potential the surface charge of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in a lime softener depends on the chemical species on their surfaces the equilibrium reactions between those species and the chemical species present in solution based on x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and low energy electron diffraction leed analysis stipp and hochella jr 1991 have shown that caco3 contains co3h0 and caoh0 as functional groups on the surface in water these functional groups can interact with potential determining ions pdi such as ca2 and co3 2 or hco3 or h2co3 stipp 1999 thompson and pownall 1989 which could change the surface charge of caco3 there are no specific studies available in the literature that investigate the functional groups on the surface of mg oh 2 particles russell et al 2009b suspected that mgoh could be the functional group dictating the surface charge of mg oh 2 based on the functional group charge development theory surface equilibrium reactions and potential surface species can be illustrated in fig 4 a and b for mg oh 2 and caco3 particles respectively particle surface charges attract ions strongly bound on the surface stern layer and less firmly associated diffuse layer so called electrostatic double layer israelachvili 1992 the particle with stern layer acts as a single entity and zeta potential ζ is the potential experimentally measured at the shear plane the stern potential ψst is determined by the surface potential and stern layer structure and the potential decreases exponentially with distance from the stern potential through the diffuse layer israelachvili 1992 only water and mg oh 2 fig 4 a or caco3 particles fig 4 b are considered in the schematic drawing as the reference position a brief data summary of sign of zeta potential under different scenarios is listed for comparison based on the electrostatic double layer theory the schematic of changes of zeta potential corresponding to different scenarios is also illustrated red curve represents the reference position and the sign of zeta potential depends on surface potential green dotted curve is for reversed stern potential from the reference due to significant change of stern layer structure from strong interactions with opposite charges to the reference leading to reversed zeta potential blue dotted curve indicates increased magnitude of stern potential from the reference due to strong interactions with alike charges to the reference leading to increased magnitude of zeta potential red dotted curve indicates suppressed diffuse layer from the reference due to increased ionic strength leading to decreased magnitude of zeta potential it should be emphasized that the differences in zeta potential was not due to different ionic strength of these suspensions the samples have a low ionic strength in the range of 0 4 20 mm increasing of ionic strength will shrink the double layer and only lead to the decrease of the magnitude of the zeta potential and vice versa fig 4a and b red dotted lines the zeta potential values observed are either reversed sign or increased magnitude with increased ionic strength therefore such changes cannot be due to the changes of ionic strength and be discussed below case by case for strong surface adsorption or reactions positive zeta potential was observed for mg oh 2 particles in water due to the presence of oh mg 2 mg h2o oh h and oh mg h2o 2 in the stern layer fig 4 a red solid line eqs 1 and 2 at high ph values a reduction in the zeta potential was observed which is due to the increase of mgo the presence of carbonate alkalinity co3 2 hco3 or atmospheric co2 from the atmosphere aging changed the zeta potential of mg oh 2 to less positive or being reversed to negative this indicates a change of the stern layer structure due to strong adsorption of co3 2 hco3 leading to less positive or even negative stern potential fig 4 a green dotted line the negative zeta potential measured for preformed mg oh 2 at 65 c also indicates strong adsorption of co3 2 preformed caco3 particles exhibit negative zeta potential due to the presence of ca co3 and co3 in the stern layer fig 4 b red solid line the ph will shift the equilibrium fig 4 b eqs 3 and 4 and causes the variations of zeta potential as a function of ph the zeta potential of caco3 particles changes from negative to positive in excess divalent metal cations ca2 mg2 due to the formation of co3 ca and co3 mg in the stern layer fig 4 b green dotted line excess co3 2 or aging increases the magnitude of the zeta potential of caco3 to more negative due to the adsorption of co3 2 hco3 and oh ions shifting the surface equilibrium reactions fig 4 b blue dotted line it can be concluded that strong interactions exist among the binary particles systems as new zeta potential distribution peaks were observed in the binary systems compared to those of the individual components fig 4 c and d there were either a zeta potential peak position in between two peaks from the individual components caco3 mg oh 2 of molar ratio 1 1 caco3 ha of molar ratio 1 0 05 caco3 clay of molar ratio 1 1 a peak at much more negative position than the two peaks of the individual components caco3 na2sio3 of 1 1 mg oh 2 na2sio3 of 1 1 and multiple peaks mg oh 2 ha of 1 0 05 mg oh 2 clay of 1 1 which are not due to the overlapping of peaks from individual components 3 4 2 implications to lime softening operation the understanding of the electrophoretic properties of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles obtained in this study has important implications for lime softening processes for both municipal and industrial water treatment for municipal water treatment the finding that zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles and the interactions between them are temperature dependent implies that lime softening operations probably need to be adjusted from summer to winter conditions the finding that co3 2 hco3 impacts zeta potential of both caco3 and mg oh 2 implies carbonate alkalinity needs to be taken into account as alkalinity control is an important lime softening operational parameter at the same time warm lime softening wls is commonly used in many industrial water treatment applications including treating oilfield produced water for hardness alkalinity and silica removal heins 2009 and softening of cooling water and boiler feed water streams in spite of the fact that wls has been commonly used for many years very little is known about the fundamental interactions and electrokinetic properties particle charge of the resulting caco3 and mg oh 2 particles in the softener the results of this study will be relevant to wls onsite chemical dosage evaluation and operational controls especially during a wls effluent off specification event for example the zeta potential of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles decreases in the presence of elevated concentrations of nom clay and silica for waters subject to significant variability in silica or nom concentrations e g cyclic steam stimulation enhanced oil recovery operations or river sources after storm events these changes in raw water quality may influence the dose of the coagulant needed and the efficiency of the softening process for particle removal as observed in this study a wide range of other parameters including ph and the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 ions alkalinity and clay have been shown to affect the surface charges of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles this research has also found that the particles present in softeners and their surface charge can depend on the presence of atmospheric co2 this must be taken into consideration as some industrial softeners are operated in covered vessels with a nitrogen atmosphere to exclude oxygen and co2 in addition temperature affects the surface charge of caco3 and mg oh 2 particles and the interactions between them and the zeta potential of precipitated particles may therefore be different for cold warm and hot softening processes the bench scale jar testing for selecting and optimizing coagulant and flocculant needs to be conducted at the same temperature as the real lime softening process bench scale jar testing conducted at room temperature will probably provide misleading results for higher temperature lime softening processes analytical instruments such as zeta potential analyzers can provide useful information on particle charge that may augment the information provided by traditional tests 4 conclusions both preformed and freshly precipitated mg oh 2 particles exhibit positive zeta potential between ph 9 5 11 5 the zeta potential of preformed caco3 particles can vary significantly from that of freshly precipitated particles preformed caco3 particles exhibit negative zeta potential in the ph range of 9 0 11 5 freshly precipitated caco3 particles can be either negatively or positively charged depending on the concentrations of other potential determining ions co3 2 hco3 ca2 mg2 present in the solution the zeta potential of preformed mg oh 2 particles can vary significantly from that of freshly precipitated particles the zeta potential of preformed mg oh 2 is 10 mv at room temperature and slowly decreases as the temperature increases over the range of 25 to 65 c and is reversed to 5 mv at 65 c but the zeta potential of in situ precipitated mg oh 2 is higher 25 mv at room temperature and is not affected much by temperature rise the zeta potential of preformed caco3 is between 10 and 15 mv at room temperature and becomes more negative as temperature increases the zeta potential of in situ formed caco3 is 5 mv and increases with increasing temperature the zeta potential of caco3 particles can change from negative to positive resulting from the existence of divalent metal cations ca2 mg2 or mg oh 2 the divalent metal cations ca2 mg2 can adsorb on caco3 particles and change its zeta potential from negative to positive mg oh 2 can interact with caco3 and gradually decrease the magnitude of its negative charge the presence of carbonate alkalinity co3 2 hco3 or exposure to atmospheric co2 changes the zeta potential of caco3 to more negative and the zeta potentail of mg oh 2 to less positive or being reversed to negative the addition of silica clay or humic acid can easily shift mg oh 2 particles from being positively charged to negatively charged and easily increase the magnitude of negatively charged caco3 particles declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17566,there is a debate on whether the trojan horse principle is occurring for nanoscale plastic debris npd 1 µm it is realized that npd have a high capacity to sorb environmental contaminants such as metals from the surrounding environment compared to their microplastic counterparts which influences the sorbed contaminants uptake herein we studied the influence of dissolved organic matter dom on the time resolved sorption of ionic silver ag onto polymeric nanomaterials as models of npd as a function of particle size 300 and 600 nm and chemical composition polystyrene ps and polyethylene pe subsequently the toxicity of npd and their co occurring adsorbed and absorbed ag on daphnia magna was determined silver nitrate was mixed with 1 2 105 npd particles ml for 6 days the extent of ag sorption onto npd after 6 days was as follows 600 nm ps npd 300 nm ps npd 300 nm pe npd the presence of dom in the system increased the sorption of ag onto 300 nm ps npd and pe npd whereas dom decreased the sorption onto 600 nm ps npd exposure to 1 mg l npd or 1 µg l ag was not toxic to daphnids however the mixture of these concentrations of ps npd and ag induced toxicity for both sizes 300 and 600 nm the addition of dom 1 10 and 50 mg l to the system inhibited the combined toxicity of ag and npd regardless of the size and chemical composition taken together in natural conditions where the concentration of dom is high e g in freshwater ecosystems the sorption of metals onto npd depends on the size and chemical composition of the npd nevertheless under realistic field conditions where the concentration of dom is high the uptake of contaminants in d magna that is influenced by the trojan horse principles could be negligible graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorption absorption particle size chemical composition silver ions oxidative stress 1 introduction the concern with regard to the occurrence of nanoscale plastic debris npds size 1 µm sobhani et al 2020 in the environment is increasing as they have been assumed to occur in different ecosystems ranging from soils and snow to surface waters and sediments alimi et al 2018 enfrin et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 materić et al 2020 npd are mostly formed as a result of plastic weathering where plastics in the environment break down to small pieces known as microplastics 1 µm size 5 mm zhu et al 2020 and npd he et al 2020 it was reported that npd can penetrate the biological barriers of organisms and distribute in the organisms bodies al sid cheikh et al 2018 gaspar et al 2018 which make npd potentially hazardous to organisms for example npd reduced the body growth activity and survival of organisms and induced physiological stress and cell death in exposed organisms chae and an 2017 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 physicochemical properties of plastic particles such as size and chemical composition may induce different toxic responses to the same mass of npd in organisms dong et al 2018 jeong et al 2016 although the toxicity of npd to different organisms has been documented hanna et al 2018 heinlaan et al 2020 the toxicity of npd as a function particle size and chemical composition is still largely unknown for example sun et al 2018 showed a strong correlation between toxicity and size of plastic particles where npd induced oxidative stress and rather than microplastics influenced the growth inhibition chemical composition and ammonia conversion efficiency of halomonas alkaliphila sun et al 2018 a previous study lee et al 2019 showed that small sized npd readily penetrated the chorion of developing embryos of zebrafish and accumulated throughout the whole body mostly in lipid rich regions the npd induced effects on the survival hatching rate developmental abnormalities and cell death of zebrafish embryos as a function of particle size lee et al 2019 the hazard of npd may not be limited to the physicochemical properties of the npd alone but might also be attributed to the co occurring chemicals in npd such as additives toussaint et al 2019 and or adsorbed and absorbed chemicals from the surrounding environment onto npd liu et al 2018 velzeboer et al 2014 for example the so called trojan horse principle a mechanism in which particles serve as vectors to carry chemicals naasz et al 2018 vale et al 2014 xia et al 2012 into cells and organisms has been proposed as a relevant pathway for the toxicity of nanomaterials this toxicity pathway may be extrapolated to npd as they are also considered as nanoscale materials jeong et al 2018 but the question is whether physicochemical properties of npd modulate their capability in transferring contaminant into organisms plastics have a high sorptive capacity absorption and adsorption for chemicals such as organic compounds and metals bakir et al 2012 davranche et al 2019 ogata et al 2009 with regard to microplastics it was documented that plastic particles can act as compartments for the partitioning of chemicals concentrating chemicals from the surrounding environment lee et al 2014 tourinho et al 2019 recent summaries reported that microplastics are not likely to increase significantly the level of soluble chemicals in organisms upon ingestion koelmans et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 however this finding may not necessarily be valid for npd which have a much smaller size and a greater volume specific surface area vssa than their microplastic counterparts liu et al 2018 the sorption capacity of plastic particles increases with decreasing particle size wang and wang 2018 zhan et al 2016 and increasing vssa and the time needed to reach partition equilibrium may significantly differ compared to microplastics counterparts when npd enter the environment they immediately interact with natural organic matter nom resulting in the formation of nom coated npd nom originate from the degradation of plants and animals residuals in the environment and is ubiquitous at different concentrations in natural surface water murphy et al 1999 the presence of nom on the surface of npd not only influences the colloidal stability of the particles shams et al 2020 but might also influence the sorption of chemicals onto the npd as a result the amount of chemicals sorbed to the npd might change as a function of nom concentration wu et al 2016 yu et al 2019 decreased wu et al 2016 and increased sorption chen et al 2017 of chemicals in the presence of nom has been already reported this can consequently alter the toxicity profile of the npd and their co occurring contaminants although the influence of nom on the toxicity profile of microplastics was investigated qiao et al 2019 there is no study available to show how the presence of nom may influence the sorption of chemicals onto npd and eventually the trojan horse effect of npd in aquatic organisms other environmental parameters such as salinity and ph may also influence the sorption of chemicals onto npd alimi et al 2018 this necessitates understanding the sorption of chemicals to npd and their subsequent toxicity to organisms under environmentally relevant conditions rather than in pure water nom contains many reactive groups such as hydroxyls amines thiols and carboxylic acids that can complex with chemicals and alter mostly decrease the bioavailability and subsequently the toxicity of the chemicals kungolos et al 2006 roy and campbell 1997 wang et al 2016 in case of metal for example nom can influence the speciation of metals and alter their toxicity kungolos et al 2006 it is important to understand whether this can be extrapolated to a system in which npd are present in this study we investigated the sorption of silver ag ions onto 300 and 600 nm polystyrene ps nanomaterials and 300 nm polyethylene pe nanomaterilas as models of npd in the presence and absence of dissolved organic matter dom for 6 days the sorption experiments were performed in a standard exposure medium of daphnia magna elendt m7 medium ph 8 to mimic natural condition as much as possible it is well documented that ag is a toxic and non essential metal to organisms which can cause oxidative stress in organisms bury et al 1999b hogstrand et al 1996 we investigated how npd influence the toxicity profile of ag in the presence and absence of dom 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used to prepare the culture media for d magna to prepare samples for chemical analysis and to determine the biochemical biomarkers were of analytical grade and purchased from sigma aldrich zwijndrecht the netherlands or merck darmstadt germany spherical ps nanomaterials with an average size of 600 nm pdi 0 08 and 300 nm pdi 0 02 were purchased from microparticles gmbh forschungs berlin germany and thermo fisher scientific bleiswijk the netherlands respectively to be used as a model of ps npd in this study the ps npd were supplied in a liquid dispersion spherical pe materials of 300 9000 nm were purchased from cospheric llc santa barbara ca us to be used as a model of pe npd the pe npd was supplied as a powder silver nitrate agno3 nitric acid hno3 65 and sodium hydroxide naoh were purchased from sigma aldrich sigma aldrich corp st louis mo usa ag standards with concentrations of 1000 mg l were obtained from perkinelmer rotterdam the netherlands suwannee river nom 1r101n was purchased from the international humic substances society saint paul minnesota united states 2 2 characterization of npd in different media the ps npd of different sizes 600 and 300 nm were dispersed in millì q mq water 10 mg l and sonicated using a bath sonicator 35 khz frequency dt 255 bandelin electronic sonorex digital berlin germany for 5 min and used as stocks for the ps npd the pe npd were dispersed in ethanol 30 and sonicated using a bath sonicator for 5 min after sonication the dispersion of pe npd was filtered through a whatman filter paper of 400 nm cut off and the filtrate was used as a stock of pe npd the particle number concentration of the npd in the stock dispersions was measured using nanoparticle tracking analyzer nta nanosight s ns200 malvern the netherlands and kept at around 30 106 particles ml it is reported that nta produces a number based distribution and can deal with polydisperse samples abdolahpur monikh et al 2019a we therefore used this technique to measure the npd particle number for imaging the npd aliquots of the dispersion were diluted with mq for ps npd and with 0 01 ethanol for pe npd put on copper grids and left to dry out for 24 h a jeol 1400 transmission electron microscope tem operating at 80 kv accelerating voltage was used to image the npd and determine their shape and size distribution a zetasizer nanodevice malvern panalytical netherlands was used to determine the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of the npd in the samples accordingly aliquots of the dispersion were diluted with mq water and immediately measured with regard to zeta potential and hydrodynamic size it is possible that the npd undergo aggregation in the exposure media to determine the aggregation profile of the npd in the exposure media the hydrodynamic size of the particles in the exposure medium was measured over time according to our previous study abdolahpur monikh et al 2019c 2 3 sorption experiments the sorption experiments to npd were carried out using a batch adsorption approach liu et al 2018 in the presence and absence of dom in the exposure medium elendt m7 medium ph 8 which was used to culture d magna the experimental design and the treatments are illustrated in fig 1 a ten replicates were used for each treatment the npd were dispersed in the exposure medium to reach a final nominal concentration of 1 2 105 particles ml and sonicated for 5 min we must emphasize that the particle number concentration might be dynamic and the particle number concentration refers to the initial concentration agno3 46 9 as ag was added to the dispersion to reach a final concentration of 100 µg l ag we used a high concentration of ag because we assumed that a part of the ag added would bind to cl to form insoluble agcl to obtain the dom suspensions nom was dissolved in mq water following the method reported by arenas logo et al arenas lago et al 2019 and filtered through a whatman filter paper of a 0 45 µm cut off the final concentration of the dom in the filtrate was 450 mg l dom was added to the mixture of npd and ag to reach a final concentration of 1 10 or 50 mg l of dom fig 1a all samples were covered with parafilm and shaken on a rotator at 18 rpm in the dark at 4 c for 6 days aliquots of the samples were taken every day for 6 days in total and centrifuged thermo scientific sorvall st 16r centrifuge at 3000 g for 20 min to assure that the centrifugation force has removed the npd from the supernatant top 2 mm in a separate sample the npd were dispersed in mq water and centrifuged at 3000 g for 20 min after centrifugation the particle number in the 2 mm supernatant was measured using nta no particles could be detected in the supernatant after centrifugation which confirms the removal of the npd from the top 2 mm of the supernatant control samples including ag dom and a mixture of ag and dom without npd were also used alongside the samples the ag control without npd was used to evaluate the formation of insoluble ag in the samples which may lead to the removal of ag from the supernatant after centrifugation the supernatants were removed and digested using aqua regia 3 ml hcl 1 ml hno3 for 1 h at 70 c in a water bath the residuals were diluted to a final volume of 15 ml and the ag concentration in the samples was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 2 4 immobilization assay with d magna for the acute immobilization tests with d magna the neonates less than 24 h old were separated and cultured for the experiments when they became adult after 9 days the adult d magna were cultured in a 200 ml of elendt m7 medium with an average of three organisms per beaker the young adults were tested because at this stage they are large enough to have particles sized 600 nm as food items acute immobilization was determined following the methods described within oecd guidelines 202 oecd 2004 five replicates per treatment were tested 15 organisms per each treatment the organisms were kept at 22 ᵒc with a 16 h light 8 h dark cycle the daphnids were fed 3 times per week prior to the exposure with 100 mg of wet weight green microalgae per daphnia the d magna were exposed to npd and different concentrations of ag and dom as illustrated in fig 1b for each size and type of npd separately the exposure was performed with mixtures of all possible combinations of npd initial concentration of 6 74 1010 particles l ag 0 1 2 5 and 10 µg l and dom 0 1 10 and 50 mg l fig 1b these dom concentrations were selected to represent a range that occurs in various natural surface waters chaves et al 2011 ag concentrations were selected based on previous studies bianchini and wood 2003 shen et al 2015 a detailed explanation of the exposure conditions is provided in the s1 supporting information the organisms were exposed to a mixture of the ag dom npd after the ag concentration in the supernatant almost reached a steady state after 72 h of exposure the number of immobile daphnids in each treatment was counted to obtain the percentage of survival per treatment 2 5 sublethal toxicity measurements the sublethal effects of ag were determined by measuring the bioconcentration factor bcf of ag to determine the uptake of ag in the organisms and prove the trojan horse principle the activity of superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and glutathione peroxidase gpx were determined to monitor the oxidative stress induced by ag the sublethal toxicity was only determined within organisms that did not die and measurements were restricted to the 1 µg l ag treatment 2 5 1 determining the bcf of ag after exposure for 72 h 1 ml of the exposure media was taken and analyzed to determine the concentration of ag in the exposure media the organisms were removed and put in clean media for 24 h as a depuration period depuration experiments were performed to allow the organisms to empty their gut our hypothesis is that the fraction of the npd that could not pass the gut epithelium and internalize into the organisms is excreted during the depuration period the 24 h depuration time was arbitrary selected according to previous studies which showed that after 24 h depuration considerable amounts of npd are removed from the gut of d magna rist et al 2017 after 24 h the organisms were removed cleaned gently with tap water and dried at 60 c to constant weight the dried organisms were weighted and digested using aqua regia for 1 h at 70 c in a water bath the residuals were diluted and the ag concentration in the samples was measured to obtain the bcf of ag for each treatment separately the bcf of ag was calculated as follows in which the possible adsorption on organisms and absorption in organisms were taken

previously reported methods as described below briefly the organisms were homogenized using a glass homogenizer in 10 vol w v ice cold 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 4 for 2 minutes at 3000 rpm the homogenates were then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 20 min at 4 c and the supernatant was removed and kept at 80 c for enzymatic assay the sod activity was determined at 420 nm by determining the rate of pyrogallol auto oxidation for 3 min using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis following the method reported previously marklund and marklund 1974 the cat activity as measured by hydrogen peroxide consumption was assayed at 240 nm using uv vis following the method reported by aebi bergmeyer 1974 gpx activity estimated by the rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidation was assayed at 340 nm using uv vis according to the method reported by drotar et al drotar et al 1985 controls without enzymes were subtracted from the total rate to yield the enzymatic activity rate the activities of the enzyme were reported after normalization with the value obtained for the control 2 6 ag measurements in the samples the ag concentration in water samples and the ag body burden in the organisms were measured using icp ms a perkinelmer nexion 2000 icp ms operating in standard mode was used for this purpose the conditional set up of the icp ms is given in table s1 supporting information 2 7 data analyses the ibm spss statistics 25 software was used to run the statistical analyses of the data the normality and homogeneity of variances were checked using kolmogorov smirnov and levene tests respectively the results are expressed as the mean standard deviation sd one way anova followed by dunnett s test was used to evaluate the significant differences between ag sorption onto npd of different types in the presence of various concentrations of dom and to evaluate the toxicity of ag to daphnids exposed to different treatments the difference between the sorption of ag onto 300 nm ps npd and 300 nm pe npd and also the difference between ps npd of different particle sizes were measured using a t test differences were considered to be significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 npd characterization the obtained tem images for the npd figure s1 supporting information indicated that the particles were spherical in shape with a narrow size distribution the sonication force did not break the particles in mq water the hydrodynamic size of the particles was around 730 45 nm 320 28 nm and 410 85 nm and the zeta potential was 38 3 mv 34 2 mv and 43 3 mv for 630 nm ps npd 300 nm ps npd and 300 nm pe npd respectively this high absolute value of the zeta potential is indicative of the electrostatic stability of the particles against agglomeration the physicochemical properties of the npd in 50 mg l dom solution is reported in table s2 supporting information when the particles were dispersed in the exposure media the absolute value of the zeta potential decreased to 24 4 21 3 and 32 4 for 630 nm ps npd 300 nm ps npd and 300 nm pe npd respectively this could lead to particle agglomeration over time for particularly the 300 nm and 600 nm ps npd we indeed determined a slight increase in the hydrodynamic size of the ps npd over 48 h measurement fig 2 a however the hydrodynamic size of the pe npd increased dramatically over 48 h we obtained the ps npd in liquid meaning that the surface of ps npd was modified to make the particles dispersible in aqueous media on the other hand the pe npd was powder and we dispersed them in water using ethanol thus the obtained fast aggregation for pe npd is highly likely to be attributed to the hydrophobic force that attracts the pe npd together and not because of the electrostatic force as the particle had a highly negative zeta potential in the exposure media 3 2 sorption of silver onto npd in the presence and absence of dom in this study we did not focus on the influence of the electrolyte on the ag sorption onto the npd and we restricted the study to determine the final influence of the exposure medium as an environmentally relevant medium on the npd and their capacity in adsorbing and absorbing ag our results confirm that the size and chemical composition of the npd can influence the sorption of ag onto npd fig 2b d shows the time resolved sorption of ag onto the npd in the presence and absence of dom in the treatment without npd and dom the concentration of ag in the supernatant remained relatively stable over 6 days of mixing fig 2b suggesting that the formation of insoluble ag could be neglectable or the insoluble ag did not sediment over time the presence of dom also did not influence the quantity of ag in the supernatant fig 2b this is in agreement with our previous studies for dom and copper cu where the presence of dom did not decrease the quantity of cu in the supernatant after centrifugation arenas lago et al 2019 in the treatment containing 300 nm ps npd fig 2b the concentration of ag decreased in the supernatant over time indicating that ag is ab adsorbed onto the surface of the particles and was removed from the supernatant after centrifugation this finding is in agreement with a previous study which showed that metals such as ag are ad absorbed onto ps particles kalčíková et al 2020 note that there might be desorption of ag from the npd back into the medium however we could not observe this because it might occur within the few primary hours of the exposure liu et al 2018 the sorption of ag onto the 300 nm npd reaches a steady state after 1 day dom increased the sorption of ag onto the particles as confirmed by the reduced amount of ag in the supernatant increasing the concentration of the dom from 1 mg l to 50 mg l significantly anova p 0 05 decreased the quantity of ag in the supernatant this indicates that the sorption of ag onto the npd increased dom has a variety of functional groups such as carbonyl carboxyl aromatic acetal and phenolic groups which allows for complexation with metal ions iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 karlsson et al 2005 when the ag absorbs to the dom that is attached to the surface of the npd the quantity of ag in the supernatant decreases after centrifugation as a result of npd sedimentation this is in agreement with the literature as it is reported that nom attached to the surface of nanomaterials e g fe3o4 liu et al 2008 tio2 chen et al 2012 and carbon nanotubes tian et al 2012 increases the removal of metals from water this can explain the higher removal of ag from the supernatant by dom coated npd compared to the bare npd our finding showed that the sorption of ag onto ps npd is a function of ps npd size as the 300 nm ps npd ad absorbed a lower amount of ag compared to the 600 nm ps npd fig 2c in this experiment we kept the particle number concentration equal for all the treatments the comparison between npd is on a particle number concentration basis and not on a mass basis therefore the available surface for sorption of ag in the treatment with 600 nm particles 1 36 10 3 cm2 is larger than in the treatment with 300 nm 3 4 10 4 cm2 which could explain the higher quantity of ag removed from the supernatant by the 600 nm ps npd the sorption of ag onto the 600 nm ps npd reached a steady state roughly after 3 days of incubation sorption of chemicals onto npd involves absorption in and adsorption on the npds alimi et al 2018 rochman et al 2013a the 600 nm ps npd have a larger volume compared to the 300 nm ps npd although surface adsorption of chemicals may reach a steady state a few hours after the exposure liu et al 2018 the diffusion of ag into the npd matrix and absorption into the particle with a larger volume may take a longer time interestingly the presence of dom decreased the sorption of ag onto the 600 nm ps npd compared to the 300 nm ps npd it is likely that the attached dom on the surface of the npd acts as an absorbent layer which absorbs ag ions when the dom layer reaches saturation further diffusion of ag into the npd is electrostatically unfavorable this can be confirmed by reaching an earlier steady state in the presence of dom compared to the naked npd fig 2c we also demonstrated that the chemical composition of npd plays a significant role in the sorption of ag onto the particles in the treatment containing pe npd and ag figure 3d the concentration of the removed ag from the supernatant after centrifugation decreased over time suggesting the sorption of the ag onto the pe npd however the quantity of the ab adsorbed ag onto the 300 nm pe npd was significantly t test p 0 05 lower than the ab adsorbed ag onto the 300 ps npd the two npd were similar in size 300 nm and shape spherical but varied in polymeric chemical composition the pe npd has a relatively rubbery and flexible structure at room temperature and is expected to allow for greater diffusion of the chemical into the matrix of the npd as compared to ps npd liu et al 2018 pascall et al 2005 as the ps npd has a dense glassy polymeric structure liu et al 2018 which limits the absorption of chemicals however this generalization did not hold in our findings a possible explanation for this is the fast agglomeration of the pe npd fig 2a which can decrease the available surface area for sorption of ag onto the particles the presence of dom increased the total quantity of ag removed from the medium by the pe npd confirming our hypothesis that aggregation decreases the capacity of chemical sorption by pe npd dom increased the stability of the pe npd due to steric stabilization as observed for other npd oriekhova and stoll 2018 this consequently increases the available surface area for chemical sorption as previously observed for dom coated carbon nanotubes tian et al 2012 increasing the concentration of the dom from 1 mg l to 50 mg l increased the removal of ag from the supernatant by pe npd 3 3 the toxicity of ag dom npd cocktails to d magna 3 3 1 immobilization bioassay the results of the immobilization bioassays are reported in table 1 the ps npd and the pe npd did not induce any mortality to the organism when compared to the control without any chemical it is well known that ag could be a toxic metal to organisms including d magna even at trace levels of 1 10 µg l glover et al 2005 in this study the immobilization bioassay showed that 1 µg l ag did not induce lethal toxicity to d magna table 1 however in the presence of ps npd of 300 nm and 600 nm the concentration of 1 µg l ag led to mortality to the organisms where the survival decreased to 64 2 5 and 85 1 in comparison to the control without any chemicals respectively the pe npd did not change the toxicity profile of 1 µg l ag compared to the ps npd and the control it is clear that the presence of ps npd led to an increased toxicity of ag it is possible that ps npd increase the bioavailability and uptake of the ag in the daphnids or change the uptake pathway of the ag the ps npd may for example facilitate the transport of ag ions into an organ within the daphnids whilst the ag ions alone cannot target that organ when the ag concentration in the exposure media increased from 0 to 10 µg l the survival of d magna decreased from roughly 98 to 0 the toxicity in the presence of 300 nm ps npd was higher than in the presence of 600 nm ps npd and 300 nm pe npd although a previous study showed that npd may increase the toxicity of metals due to the trojan horse mechanism lee et al 2019 our study for the first time shows that the size and chemical composition of npd influence the toxicity of ag to d magna overall our findings not only showed that due to the trojan horse mechanism the npd increased the lethal toxicity of the ag but also confirmed that the smaller npd are more hazardous compared to the larger particles of the same chemical composition the presence of dom at concentrations of 1 mg l up to 50 mg l reduced the combined toxicity of ag npd for all the tested npd regardless of size and chemical composition this is in agreement with a previous study which showed that nom decreases the toxicity of ps npd to d magna fadare et al 2019 dom binds ag ions and prevents the ions from binding to the site of toxic action glover et al 2005 in the presence of 5 µg l ag the dom could not totally inhibit ag toxicity and the dom coated 300 nm ps nps induce higher toxicity compared to the dom coated 600 nm ps npd the toxicity of ag in the presence of the dom coated npd was not affected by the chemical composition of the npd because there was no difference between the toxicity induced by dom coated ps npd and dom coated pe npd of the same size it is likely that dom offers a similar surface composition to npd regardless of the chemical bulk composition of the particles which in return determines the interaction of the npd with organisms apparently dom decreases the toxicity of metals in aquatic organisms independent of the metals being present in their dissolved form or sorbed onto npd by decreasing their bioavailability to the organisms 3 3 2 bioconcentration of ag organisms exposed to 1 µg l ag showed the highest survival rate compared to other treatments thus we selected 1 µg l ag concentration to investigate the sublethal toxicity in d magna first we must understand whether ag is taken up and bioconcentrate in the organisms from the exposure media and how the presence of npd and dom influences the ag uptake the bcfs of ag were calculated in organisms exposed to 1 µg l ag 6 74 1010 particles l npd and different concentrations of dom the results table 2 showed that the bcfs of ag in the organisms exposed to the mixture of npd and ag were significantly higher than the bcfs of the other treatments and higher than the bcf for the organisms exposed to ag alone this is in agreement with a previous study investigating the mixture effects of ni and microplastics in d magna where the exposure to the mixture of the microplastics and ni led to a higher bcf of ni compared to the exposure to ni alone kim et al 2017 this supports our hypothesis that npd increase the uptake of ag in daphnids the higher bcf observed for 300 nm ps npd 0 7 compared to the 600 nm ps npd 0 3 confirms that smaller npd may increase the uptake of chemicals due to penetration of biological barriers and entering organisms in a higher quantity compared to their larger counterparts although the increase in the uptake of chemicals in the presence of microplastics has been documented kim et al 2017 rochman et al 2013b very few studies reported this phenomenon for npd chen et al 2017 lee et al 2019 ma et al 2016 for example ma et al ma et al 2016 reported that the presence of 50 nm npd significantly increased the bioaccumulation of chemicals in d magna and increased the bcf over the entire exposure period they suggested that unlike microplastics npd can easily accumulate on the thoracopods and in the digestive tract ma et al 2016 the bcf of the ag in the presence of 300 nm pe npd was similar to the bcfs calculated for 300 nm ps npd this finding showed that 300 nm pe npd and ps npd have a similar influence on the uptake of ag regardless of the difference in the chemical composition of the npd the npd of different chemical composition however had a different influence on the toxicity profile of ag as described by ma et al ma et al 2016 one explanation could be that the ag pe npd complexes accumulate on the appendages of the organisms ma et al 2016 due to the hydrophobic surface which explains the high bcf while no lethal toxicity is observed whilst this accumulation did not occur in the case of 300 nm ps npd because the surface was modified the presence of dom significantly decreases the bcf of ag in all treatments regardless of npd size and shapes the high affinity of dom for ag was reported to be responsible for the observed protective effects regarding freshwater organisms in toxicity tests bury et al 1999a glover et al 2005 3 3 3 activities of antioxidant enzymes after confirming that npd can increase the uptake of ag in d magna as a function of npd size and chemical composition we aimed to understand whether the npd can also influence the sublethal toxicity of ag in the organisms it is well documented that exposure to ag induces the production of reactive oxygen species ros and consequently oxidative stress in organisms gomes et al 2015 like other organisms d magna has also developed antioxidant defense mechanisms to balance the naturally formed ros kim et al 2018 poynton et al 2007 accordingly d magna uses enzymes such as sod cat and gpx which are directly involved in the removal of ros to eliminate the oxidative stress induced by ag we measured the activities of these enzymes to determine the oxidative stress induced as a result of exposure to ag the results table 2 showed that the highest biomarker response was observed in d magna exposed to ag and to the mixture of ag and npds the increase in the activities of sod cat and gpx indicated that the organisms are responding to the increased levels of ros the activities of all analyzed enzymes increased significantly after exposure to the mixture of npd and ag compared to ag alone this is an indication that npd enhance the oxidative stress of ag and the activity of the enzymes increased to eliminate the ros our findings showed that the activity of sod was independent of npd size and chemical composition however the activity of cat and gpx in organisms exposed to 300 ps npd was significantly higher than in the organisms exposed to 600 nm ps npd this further confirms that the size of npd dramatically influences their trojan horse mechanism likely due to the higher uptake of the 300 nm particles compared to the 600 nm particles the organisms exposed to pe npd showed higher activities in the cat and gpx enzymes compared to organisms exposed to 300 nm ps npd our study for the first time documents that the chemical composition of npd influences their trojan horse effect interestingly in the presence of dom the activity of the enzymes was not significantly different from to the activity measured in control organisms previous studies reported that dom sorbed to particles inhibits the toxicity of ag nanomaterials to organisms collin et al 2016 due to decreasing the ag release from the dom coated particles 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that the size and chemical composition of npd influence the sorption of ag ions onto the npd under environmentally relevant conditions we kept the particle number concentration equal for all treatments our findings showed that the 600 nm ps npd ad absorb a higher quantity of ag compared to the 300 nm ps npd and pe npd when the same particle number concentration was used however different dose metrics such as particle mass and surface area may result in different outcomes we used particle number as the dose metric because it was reported to be more suitable for determining the influence of nanomaterial physicochemical properties on their toxicity abdolahpur monikh et al 2019b however the toxicity of ag in the presence of the 300 nm ps npd and pe npd was higher than in the presence of the 600 nm ps npd this implies that smaller particles of npd can be potentially more hazardous than the larger npd even if they sorb a lower quantity of contaminants ps npd sorbed a higher quantity of ag ions compared to pe npd of the same size however the toxicity of ag in the presence of pe npd was higher in few cases this suggests that chemical composition can influence the toxicity of npd this requires further research as most of the current publications focus solely on ps npd the presence of dom decreased the sorption of ag onto 600 nm ps npd while it increased the sorption of ag onto 300 ps npd and pe npd moreover dom inhibited the toxicity of ag npd regardless of npd size our findings suggest that the presence of dom in natural freshwater may inhibit the trojan horse effects of npd however in some ecosystems e g marine ecosystems where the concentration of dom is low trojan horse effects of npd may become a critical issue we demonstrated that the chemical composition and particle size of npd are fundamentally important factors to determine the trojan horse effects in organisms further studies may focus on how the other environmental parameters such as salinity and ph influence the sorption and subsequent trojan horse effects of npd following our

17566,there is a debate on whether the trojan horse principle is occurring for nanoscale plastic debris npd 1 µm it is realized that npd have a high capacity to sorb environmental contaminants such as metals from the surrounding environment compared to their microplastic counterparts which influences the sorbed contaminants uptake herein we studied the influence of dissolved organic matter dom on the time resolved sorption of ionic silver ag onto polymeric nanomaterials as models of npd as a function of particle size 300 and 600 nm and chemical composition polystyrene ps and polyethylene pe subsequently the toxicity of npd and their co occurring adsorbed and absorbed ag on daphnia magna was determined silver nitrate was mixed with 1 2 105 npd particles ml for 6 days the extent of ag sorption onto npd after 6 days was as follows 600 nm ps npd 300 nm ps npd 300 nm pe npd the presence of dom in the system increased the sorption of ag onto 300 nm ps npd and pe npd whereas dom decreased the sorption onto 600 nm ps npd exposure to 1 mg l npd or 1 µg l ag was not toxic to daphnids however the mixture of these concentrations of ps npd and ag induced toxicity for both sizes 300 and 600 nm the addition of dom 1 10 and 50 mg l to the system inhibited the combined toxicity of ag and npd regardless of the size and chemical composition taken together in natural conditions where the concentration of dom is high e g in freshwater ecosystems the sorption of metals onto npd depends on the size and chemical composition of the npd nevertheless under realistic field conditions where the concentration of dom is high the uptake of contaminants in d magna that is influenced by the trojan horse principles could be negligible graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adsorption absorption particle size chemical composition silver ions oxidative stress 1 introduction the concern with regard to the occurrence of nanoscale plastic debris npds size 1 µm sobhani et al 2020 in the environment is increasing as they have been assumed to occur in different ecosystems ranging from soils and snow to surface waters and sediments alimi et al 2018 enfrin et al 2019 koelmans et al 2019 materić et al 2020 npd are mostly formed as a result of plastic weathering where plastics in the environment break down to small pieces known as microplastics 1 µm size 5 mm zhu et al 2020 and npd he et al 2020 it was reported that npd can penetrate the biological barriers of organisms and distribute in the organisms bodies al sid cheikh et al 2018 gaspar et al 2018 which make npd potentially hazardous to organisms for example npd reduced the body growth activity and survival of organisms and induced physiological stress and cell death in exposed organisms chae and an 2017 lee et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 physicochemical properties of plastic particles such as size and chemical composition may induce different toxic responses to the same mass of npd in organisms dong et al 2018 jeong et al 2016 although the toxicity of npd to different organisms has been documented hanna et al 2018 heinlaan et al 2020 the toxicity of npd as a function particle size and chemical composition is still largely unknown for example sun et al 2018 showed a strong correlation between toxicity and size of plastic particles where npd induced oxidative stress and rather than microplastics influenced the growth inhibition chemical composition and ammonia conversion efficiency of halomonas alkaliphila sun et al 2018 a previous study lee et al 2019 showed that small sized npd readily penetrated the chorion of developing embryos of zebrafish and accumulated throughout the whole body mostly in lipid rich regions the npd induced effects on the survival hatching rate developmental abnormalities and cell death of zebrafish embryos as a function of particle size lee et al 2019 the hazard of npd may not be limited to the physicochemical properties of the npd alone but might also be attributed to the co occurring chemicals in npd such as additives toussaint et al 2019 and or adsorbed and absorbed chemicals from the surrounding environment onto npd liu et al 2018 velzeboer et al 2014 for example the so called trojan horse principle a mechanism in which particles serve as vectors to carry chemicals naasz et al 2018 vale et al 2014 xia et al 2012 into cells and organisms has been proposed as a relevant pathway for the toxicity of nanomaterials this toxicity pathway may be extrapolated to npd as they are also considered as nanoscale materials jeong et al 2018 but the question is whether physicochemical properties of npd modulate their capability in transferring contaminant into organisms plastics have a high sorptive capacity absorption and adsorption for chemicals such as organic compounds and metals bakir et al 2012 davranche et al 2019 ogata et al 2009 with regard to microplastics it was documented that plastic particles can act as compartments for the partitioning of chemicals concentrating chemicals from the surrounding environment lee et al 2014 tourinho et al 2019 recent summaries reported that microplastics are not likely to increase significantly the level of soluble chemicals in organisms upon ingestion koelmans et al 2016 ziccardi et al 2016 however this finding may not necessarily be valid for npd which have a much smaller size and a greater volume specific surface area vssa than their microplastic counterparts liu et al 2018 the sorption capacity of plastic particles increases with decreasing particle size wang and wang 2018 zhan et al 2016 and increasing vssa and the time needed to reach partition equilibrium may significantly differ compared to microplastics counterparts when npd enter the environment they immediately interact with natural organic matter nom resulting in the formation of nom coated npd nom originate from the degradation of plants and animals residuals in the environment and is ubiquitous at different concentrations in natural surface water murphy et al 1999 the presence of nom on the surface of npd not only influences the colloidal stability of the particles shams et al 2020 but might also influence the sorption of chemicals onto the npd as a result the amount of chemicals sorbed to the npd might change as a function of nom concentration wu et al 2016 yu et al 2019 decreased wu et al 2016 and increased sorption chen et al 2017 of chemicals in the presence of nom has been already reported this can consequently alter the toxicity profile of the npd and their co occurring contaminants although the influence of nom on the toxicity profile of microplastics was investigated qiao et al 2019 there is no study available to show how the presence of nom may influence the sorption of chemicals onto npd and eventually the trojan horse effect of npd in aquatic organisms other environmental parameters such as salinity and ph may also influence the sorption of chemicals onto npd alimi et al 2018 this necessitates understanding the sorption of chemicals to npd and their subsequent toxicity to organisms under environmentally relevant conditions rather than in pure water nom contains many reactive groups such as hydroxyls amines thiols and carboxylic acids that can complex with chemicals and alter mostly decrease the bioavailability and subsequently the toxicity of the chemicals kungolos et al 2006 roy and campbell 1997 wang et al 2016 in case of metal for example nom can influence the speciation of metals and alter their toxicity kungolos et al 2006 it is important to understand whether this can be extrapolated to a system in which npd are present in this study we investigated the sorption of silver ag ions onto 300 and 600 nm polystyrene ps nanomaterials and 300 nm polyethylene pe nanomaterilas as models of npd in the presence and absence of dissolved organic matter dom for 6 days the sorption experiments were performed in a standard exposure medium of daphnia magna elendt m7 medium ph 8 to mimic natural condition as much as possible it is well documented that ag is a toxic and non essential metal to organisms which can cause oxidative stress in organisms bury et al 1999b hogstrand et al 1996 we investigated how npd influence the toxicity profile of ag in the presence and absence of dom 2 materials and methods 2 1

ps npd the pe npd were dispersed in ethanol 30 and sonicated using a bath sonicator for 5 min after sonication the dispersion of pe npd was filtered through a whatman filter paper of 400 nm cut off and the filtrate was used as a stock of pe npd the particle number concentration of the npd in the stock dispersions was measured using nanoparticle tracking analyzer nta nanosight s ns200 malvern the netherlands and kept at around 30 106 particles ml it is reported that nta produces a number based distribution and can deal with polydisperse samples abdolahpur monikh et al 2019a we therefore used this technique to measure the npd particle number for imaging the npd aliquots of the dispersion were diluted with mq for ps npd and with 0 01 ethanol for pe npd put on copper grids and left to dry out for 24 h a jeol 1400 transmission electron microscope tem operating at 80 kv accelerating voltage was used to image the npd and determine their shape and size distribution a zetasizer nanodevice malvern panalytical netherlands was used to determine the hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of the npd in the samples accordingly aliquots of the dispersion were diluted with mq water and immediately measured with regard to zeta potential and hydrodynamic size it is possible that the npd undergo aggregation in the exposure media to determine the aggregation profile of the npd in the exposure media the hydrodynamic size of the particles in the exposure medium was measured over time according to our previous study abdolahpur monikh et al 2019c 2 3 sorption experiments the sorption experiments to npd were carried out using a batch adsorption approach liu et al 2018 in the presence and absence of dom in the exposure medium elendt m7 medium ph 8 which was used to culture d magna the experimental design and the treatments are illustrated in fig 1 a ten replicates were used for each treatment the npd were dispersed in the exposure medium to reach a final nominal concentration of 1 2 105 particles ml and sonicated for 5 min we must emphasize that the particle number concentration might be dynamic and the particle number concentration refers to the initial concentration agno3 46 9 as ag was added to the dispersion to reach a final concentration of 100 µg l ag we used a high concentration of ag because we assumed that a part of the ag added would bind to cl to form insoluble agcl to obtain the dom suspensions nom was dissolved in mq water following the method reported by arenas logo et al arenas lago et al 2019 and filtered through a whatman filter paper of a 0 45 µm cut off the final concentration of the dom in the filtrate was 450 mg l dom was added to the mixture of npd and ag to reach a final concentration of 1 10 or 50 mg l of dom fig 1a all samples were covered with parafilm and shaken on a rotator at 18 rpm in the dark at 4 c for 6 days aliquots of the samples were taken every day for 6 days in total and centrifuged thermo scientific sorvall st 16r centrifuge at 3000 g for 20 min to assure that the centrifugation force has removed the npd from the supernatant top 2 mm in a separate sample the npd were dispersed in mq water and centrifuged at 3000 g for 20 min after centrifugation the particle number in the 2 mm supernatant was measured using nta no particles could be detected in the supernatant after centrifugation which confirms the removal of the npd from the top 2 mm of the supernatant control samples including ag dom and a mixture of ag and dom without npd were also used alongside the samples the ag control without npd was used to evaluate the formation of insoluble ag in the samples which may lead to the removal of ag from the supernatant after centrifugation the supernatants were removed and digested using aqua regia 3 ml hcl 1 ml hno3 for 1 h at 70 c in a water bath the residuals were diluted to a final volume of 15 ml and the ag concentration in the samples was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 2 4 immobilization assay with d magna for the acute immobilization tests with d magna the neonates less than 24 h old were separated and cultured for the experiments when they became adult after 9 days the adult d magna were cultured in a 200 ml of elendt m7 medium with an average of three organisms per beaker the young adults were tested because at this stage they are large enough to have particles sized 600 nm as food items acute immobilization was determined following the methods described within oecd guidelines 202 oecd 2004 five replicates per treatment were tested 15 organisms per each treatment the organisms were kept at 22 ᵒc with a 16 h light 8 h dark cycle the daphnids were fed 3 times per week prior to the exposure with 100 mg of wet weight green microalgae per daphnia the d magna were exposed to npd and different concentrations of ag and dom as illustrated in fig 1b for each size and type of npd separately the exposure was performed with mixtures of all possible combinations of npd initial concentration of 6 74 1010 particles l ag 0 1 2 5 and 10 µg l and dom 0 1 10 and 50 mg l fig 1b these dom concentrations were selected to represent a range that occurs in various natural surface waters chaves et al 2011 ag concentrations were selected based on previous studies bianchini and wood 2003 shen et al 2015 a detailed explanation of the exposure conditions is provided in the s1 supporting information the organisms were exposed to a mixture of the ag dom npd after the ag concentration in the supernatant almost reached a steady state after 72 h of exposure the number of immobile daphnids in each treatment was counted to obtain the percentage of survival per treatment 2 5 sublethal toxicity measurements the sublethal effects of ag were determined by measuring the bioconcentration factor bcf of ag to determine the uptake of ag in the organisms and prove the trojan horse principle the activity of superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and glutathione peroxidase gpx were determined to monitor the oxidative stress induced by ag the sublethal toxicity was only determined within organisms that did not die and measurements were restricted to the 1 µg l ag treatment 2 5 1 determining the bcf of ag after exposure for 72 h 1 ml of the exposure media was taken and analyzed to determine the concentration of ag in the exposure media the organisms were removed and put in clean media for 24 h as a depuration period depuration experiments were performed to allow the organisms to empty their gut our hypothesis is that the fraction of the npd that could not pass the gut epithelium and internalize into the organisms is excreted during the depuration period the 24 h depuration time was arbitrary selected according to previous studies which showed that after 24 h depuration considerable amounts of npd are removed from the gut of d magna rist et al 2017 after 24 h the organisms were removed cleaned gently with tap water and dried at 60 c to constant weight the dried organisms were weighted and digested using aqua regia for 1 h at 70 c in a water bath the residuals were diluted and the ag concentration in the samples was measured to obtain the bcf of ag for each treatment separately the bcf of ag was calculated as follows in which the possible adsorption on organisms and absorption in organisms were taken as the total mass concentration in the organisms after 24 h of depuration b c f l k g t o t a l l m a s s c o n c e n e t r a t i o n o f a g i n a n d o n o r g a n i s m s μ g k g a t 72 h t o t a l

previously reported methods as described below briefly the organisms were homogenized using a glass homogenizer in 10 vol w v ice cold 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer ph 7 4 for 2 minutes at 3000 rpm the homogenates were then centrifuged at 10 000 g for 20 min at 4 c and the supernatant was removed and kept at 80 c for enzymatic assay the sod activity was determined at 420 nm by determining the rate of pyrogallol auto oxidation for 3 min using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis following the method reported previously marklund and marklund 1974 the cat activity as measured by hydrogen peroxide consumption was assayed at 240 nm using uv vis following the method reported by aebi bergmeyer 1974 gpx activity estimated by the rate of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidation was assayed at 340 nm using uv vis according to the method reported by drotar et al drotar et al 1985 controls without enzymes were subtracted from the total rate to yield the enzymatic activity rate the activities of the enzyme were reported after normalization with the value obtained for the control 2 6 ag measurements in the samples the ag concentration in water samples and the ag body burden in the organisms were measured using icp ms a perkinelmer nexion 2000 icp ms operating in standard mode was used for this purpose the conditional set up of the icp ms is given in table s1 supporting information 2 7 data analyses the ibm spss statistics 25 software was used to run the statistical analyses of the data the normality and homogeneity of variances were checked using kolmogorov smirnov and levene tests respectively the results are expressed as the mean standard deviation sd one way anova followed by dunnett s test was used to evaluate the significant differences between ag sorption onto npd of different types in the presence of various concentrations of dom and to evaluate the toxicity of ag to daphnids exposed to different treatments the difference between the sorption of ag onto 300 nm ps npd and 300 nm pe npd and also the difference between ps npd of different particle sizes were measured using a t test differences were considered to be significant at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 npd characterization the obtained tem images for the npd figure s1 supporting information indicated that the particles were spherical in shape with a narrow size distribution the sonication force did not break the particles in mq water the hydrodynamic size of the particles was around 730 45 nm 320 28 nm and 410 85 nm and the zeta potential was 38 3 mv 34 2 mv and 43 3 mv for 630 nm ps npd 300 nm ps npd and 300 nm pe npd respectively this high absolute value of the zeta potential is indicative of the electrostatic stability of the particles against agglomeration the physicochemical properties of the npd in 50 mg l dom solution is reported in table s2 supporting information when the particles were dispersed in the exposure media the absolute value of the zeta potential decreased to 24 4 21 3 and 32 4 for 630 nm ps npd 300 nm ps npd and 300 nm pe npd respectively this could lead to particle agglomeration over time for particularly the 300 nm and 600 nm ps npd we indeed determined a slight increase in the hydrodynamic size of the ps npd over 48 h measurement fig 2 a however the hydrodynamic size of the pe npd increased dramatically over 48 h we obtained the ps npd in liquid meaning that the surface of ps npd was modified to make the particles dispersible in aqueous media on the other hand the pe npd was powder and we dispersed them in water using ethanol thus the obtained fast aggregation for pe npd is highly likely to be attributed to the hydrophobic force that attracts the pe npd together and not because of the electrostatic force as the particle had a highly negative zeta potential in the exposure media 3 2 sorption of silver onto npd in the presence and absence of dom in this study we did not focus on the influence of the electrolyte on the ag sorption onto the npd and we restricted the study to determine the final influence of the exposure medium as an environmentally relevant medium on the npd and their capacity in adsorbing and absorbing ag our results confirm that the size and chemical composition of the npd can influence the sorption of ag onto npd fig 2b d shows the time resolved sorption of ag onto the npd in the presence and absence of dom in the treatment without npd and dom the concentration of ag in the supernatant remained relatively stable over 6 days of mixing fig 2b suggesting that the formation of insoluble ag could be neglectable or the insoluble ag did not sediment over time the presence of dom also did not influence the quantity of ag in the supernatant fig 2b this is in agreement with our previous studies for dom and copper cu where the presence of dom did not decrease the quantity of cu in the supernatant after centrifugation arenas lago et al 2019 in the treatment containing 300 nm ps npd fig 2b the concentration of ag decreased in the supernatant over time indicating that ag is ab adsorbed onto the surface of the particles and was removed from the supernatant after centrifugation this finding is in agreement with a previous study which showed that metals such as ag are ad absorbed onto ps particles kalčíková et al 2020 note that there might be desorption of ag from the npd back into the medium however we could not observe this because it might occur within the few primary hours of the exposure liu et al 2018 the sorption of ag onto the 300 nm npd reaches a steady state after 1 day dom increased the sorption of ag onto the particles as confirmed by the reduced amount of ag in the supernatant increasing the concentration of the dom from 1 mg l to 50 mg l significantly anova p 0 05 decreased the quantity of ag in the supernatant this indicates that the sorption of ag onto the npd increased dom has a variety of functional groups such as carbonyl carboxyl aromatic acetal and phenolic groups which allows for complexation with metal ions iskrenova tchoukova et al 2010 karlsson et al 2005 when the ag absorbs to the dom that is attached to the surface of the npd the quantity of ag in the supernatant decreases after centrifugation as a result of npd sedimentation this is in agreement with the literature as it is reported that nom attached to the surface of nanomaterials e g fe3o4 liu et al 2008 tio2 chen et al 2012 and carbon nanotubes tian et al 2012 increases the removal of metals from water this can explain the higher removal of ag from the supernatant by dom coated npd compared to the bare npd our finding showed that the sorption of ag onto ps npd is a function of ps npd size as the 300 nm ps npd ad absorbed a lower amount of ag compared to the 600 nm ps npd fig 2c in this experiment we kept the particle number concentration equal for all the treatments the comparison between npd is on a particle number concentration basis and not on a mass basis therefore the available surface for sorption of ag in the treatment with 600 nm particles 1 36 10 3 cm2 is larger than in the treatment with 300 nm 3 4 10 4 cm2 which could explain the higher quantity of ag removed from the supernatant by the 600 nm ps npd the sorption of ag onto the 600 nm ps npd reached a steady state roughly after 3 days of incubation sorption of chemicals onto npd involves absorption in and adsorption on the npds alimi et al 2018 rochman et al 2013a the 600 nm ps npd have a larger volume compared to the 300 nm ps npd although surface adsorption of chemicals may reach a steady state a few hours after the exposure liu et al 2018 the diffusion of ag into the npd matrix and absorption into the particle with a larger volume may take a longer time interestingly the presence of dom decreased the sorption of ag onto the 600 nm ps npd compared to the 300 nm ps npd it is likely that the attached dom on the surface of the npd acts as an absorbent layer which absorbs ag ions when the dom layer reaches saturation further diffusion of ag into the npd is electrostatically unfavorable this can be confirmed by reaching an earlier steady state in the presence of dom compared to the naked npd fig 2c we also demonstrated that the chemical composition of npd plays a significant role in the sorption of ag onto the particles in the treatment containing pe npd and ag figure 3d the concentration of the removed ag from the supernatant after centrifugation decreased over time suggesting the sorption of the ag onto the pe npd however the quantity of the ab adsorbed ag onto the 300 nm pe npd was significantly t test p 0 05 lower than the ab adsorbed ag onto the 300 ps npd the two npd were similar in size 300 nm and shape spherical but varied in polymeric chemical composition the pe npd has a relatively rubbery and flexible structure at room temperature and is expected to allow for greater diffusion of the chemical into the matrix of the npd as compared to ps npd liu et al 2018 pascall et al 2005 as the ps npd has a dense glassy polymeric structure liu et al 2018 which limits the absorption of chemicals however this generalization did not hold in our findings a possible explanation for this is the fast agglomeration of the pe npd fig 2a which can decrease the available surface area for sorption of ag onto the particles the presence of dom increased the total quantity of ag removed from the medium by the pe npd confirming our hypothesis that aggregation decreases the capacity of chemical sorption by pe npd dom increased the stability of the pe npd due to steric stabilization as observed for other npd oriekhova and stoll 2018 this consequently increases the available surface area for chemical sorption as previously observed for dom coated carbon nanotubes tian et al 2012 increasing the concentration of the dom from 1 mg l to 50 mg l increased the removal of ag from the supernatant by pe npd 3 3 the toxicity of ag dom npd cocktails to d magna 3 3 1 immobilization bioassay the results of the immobilization bioassays are reported in table 1 the ps npd and the pe npd did not induce any mortality to the organism when compared to the control without any chemical it is well known that ag could be a toxic metal to organisms including d magna even at trace levels of 1 10 µg l glover et al 2005 in this study the immobilization bioassay showed that 1 µg l ag did not induce lethal toxicity to d magna table 1 however in the presence of ps npd of 300 nm and 600 nm the concentration of 1 µg l ag led to mortality to the organisms where the survival decreased to 64 2 5 and 85 1 in comparison to the control without any chemicals respectively the pe npd did not change the toxicity profile of 1 µg l ag compared to the ps npd and the control it is clear that the presence of ps npd led to an increased toxicity of ag it is possible that ps npd increase the bioavailability and uptake of the ag in the daphnids or change the uptake pathway of the ag the ps npd may for example facilitate the transport of ag ions into an organ within the daphnids whilst the ag ions alone cannot target that organ when the ag concentration in the exposure media increased from 0 to 10 µg l the survival of d magna decreased from roughly 98 to 0 the toxicity in the presence of 300 nm ps npd was higher than in the presence of 600 nm ps npd and 300 nm pe npd although a previous study showed that npd may increase the toxicity of metals due to the trojan horse mechanism lee et al 2019 our study for the first time shows that the size and chemical composition of npd influence the toxicity of ag to d magna overall our findings not only showed that due to the trojan horse mechanism the npd increased the lethal toxicity of the ag but also confirmed that the smaller npd are more hazardous compared to the larger particles of the same chemical composition the presence of dom at concentrations of 1 mg l up to 50 mg l reduced the combined toxicity of ag npd for all the tested npd regardless of size and chemical composition this is in agreement with a previous study which showed that nom decreases the toxicity of ps npd to d magna fadare et al 2019 dom binds ag ions and prevents the ions from binding to the site of toxic action glover et al 2005 in the presence of 5 µg l ag the dom could not totally inhibit ag toxicity and the dom coated 300 nm ps nps induce higher toxicity compared to the dom coated 600 nm ps npd the toxicity of ag in the presence of the dom coated npd was not affected by the chemical composition of the npd because there was no difference between the toxicity induced by dom coated ps npd and dom coated pe npd of the same size it is likely that dom offers a similar surface composition to npd regardless of the chemical bulk composition of the particles which in return determines the interaction of the npd with organisms apparently dom decreases the toxicity of metals in aquatic organisms independent of the metals being present in their dissolved form or sorbed onto npd by decreasing their bioavailability to the organisms 3 3 2 bioconcentration of ag organisms exposed to 1 µg l ag showed the highest survival rate compared to other treatments thus we selected 1 µg l ag concentration to investigate the sublethal toxicity in d magna first we must understand whether ag is taken up and bioconcentrate in the organisms from the exposure media and how the presence of npd and dom influences the ag uptake the bcfs of ag were calculated in organisms exposed to 1 µg l ag 6 74 1010 particles l npd and different concentrations of dom the results table 2 showed that the bcfs of ag in the organisms exposed to the mixture of npd and ag were significantly higher than the bcfs of the other treatments and higher than the bcf for the organisms exposed to ag alone this is in agreement with a previous study investigating the mixture effects of ni and microplastics in d magna where the exposure to the mixture of the microplastics and ni led to a higher bcf of ni compared to the exposure to ni alone kim et al 2017 this supports our hypothesis that npd increase the uptake of ag in daphnids the higher bcf observed for 300 nm ps npd 0 7 compared to the 600 nm ps npd 0 3 confirms that smaller npd may increase the uptake of chemicals due to penetration of biological barriers and entering organisms in a higher quantity compared to their larger counterparts although the increase in the uptake of chemicals in the presence of microplastics has been documented kim et al 2017 rochman et al 2013b very few studies reported this phenomenon for npd chen et al 2017 lee et al 2019 ma et al 2016 for example ma et al ma et al 2016 reported that the presence of 50 nm npd significantly increased the bioaccumulation of chemicals in d magna and increased the bcf over the entire exposure period they suggested that unlike microplastics npd can easily accumulate on the thoracopods and in the digestive tract ma et al 2016 the bcf of the ag in the presence of 300 nm pe npd was similar to the bcfs calculated for 300 nm ps npd this finding showed that 300 nm pe npd and ps npd have a similar influence on the uptake of ag regardless of the difference in the chemical composition of the npd the npd of different chemical composition however had a different influence on the toxicity profile of ag as described by ma et al ma et al 2016 one explanation could be that the ag pe npd complexes accumulate on the appendages of the organisms ma et al 2016 due to the hydrophobic surface which explains the high bcf while no lethal toxicity is observed whilst this accumulation did not occur in the case of 300 nm ps npd because the surface was modified the presence of dom significantly decreases the bcf of ag in all treatments regardless of npd size and shapes the high affinity of dom for ag was reported to be responsible for the observed protective effects regarding freshwater organisms in toxicity tests bury et al 1999a glover et al 2005 3 3 3 activities of antioxidant enzymes after confirming that npd can increase the uptake of ag in d magna as a function of npd size and chemical composition we aimed to understand whether the npd can also influence the sublethal toxicity of ag in the organisms it is well documented that exposure to ag induces the production of reactive oxygen species ros and consequently oxidative stress in organisms gomes et al 2015 like other organisms d magna has also developed antioxidant defense mechanisms to balance the naturally formed ros kim et al 2018 poynton et al 2007 accordingly d magna uses enzymes such as sod cat and gpx which are directly involved in the removal of ros to eliminate the oxidative stress induced by ag we measured the activities of these enzymes to determine the oxidative stress induced as a result of exposure to ag the results table 2 showed that the highest biomarker response was observed in d magna exposed to ag and to the mixture of ag and npds the increase in the activities of sod cat and gpx indicated that the organisms are responding to the increased levels of ros the activities of all analyzed enzymes increased significantly after exposure to the mixture of npd and ag compared to ag alone this is an indication that npd enhance the oxidative stress of ag and the activity of the enzymes increased to eliminate the ros our findings showed that the activity of sod was independent of npd size and chemical composition however the activity of cat and gpx in organisms exposed to 300 ps npd was significantly higher than in the organisms exposed to 600 nm ps npd this further confirms that the size of npd dramatically influences their trojan horse mechanism likely due to the higher uptake of the 300 nm particles compared to the 600 nm particles the organisms exposed to pe npd showed higher activities in the cat and gpx enzymes compared to organisms exposed to 300 nm ps npd our study for the first time documents that the chemical composition of npd influences their trojan horse effect interestingly in the presence of dom the activity of the enzymes was not significantly different from to the activity measured in control organisms previous studies reported that dom sorbed to particles inhibits the toxicity of ag nanomaterials to organisms collin et al 2016 due to decreasing the ag release from the dom coated particles 4 conclusions in this study we demonstrated that the size and chemical composition of npd influence the sorption of ag ions onto the npd under environmentally relevant conditions we kept the particle number concentration equal for all treatments our findings showed that the 600 nm ps npd ad absorb a higher quantity of ag compared to the 300 nm ps npd and pe npd when the same particle number concentration was used however different dose metrics such as particle mass and surface area may result in different outcomes we used particle number as the dose metric because it was reported to be more suitable for determining the influence of nanomaterial physicochemical properties on their toxicity abdolahpur monikh et al 2019b however the toxicity of ag in the presence of the 300 nm ps npd and pe npd was higher than in the presence of the 600 nm ps npd this implies that smaller particles of npd can be potentially more hazardous than the larger npd even if they sorb a lower quantity of contaminants ps npd sorbed a higher quantity of ag ions compared to pe npd of the same size however the toxicity of ag in the presence of pe npd was higher in few cases this suggests that chemical composition can influence the toxicity of npd this requires further research as most of the current publications focus solely on ps npd the presence of dom decreased the sorption of ag onto 600 nm ps npd while it increased the sorption of ag onto 300 ps npd and pe npd moreover dom inhibited the toxicity of ag npd regardless of npd size our findings suggest that the presence of dom in natural freshwater may inhibit the trojan horse effects of npd however in some ecosystems e g marine ecosystems where the concentration of dom is low trojan horse effects of npd may become a critical issue we demonstrated that the chemical composition and particle size of npd are fundamentally important factors to determine the trojan horse effects in organisms further studies may focus on how the other environmental parameters such as salinity and ph influence the sorption and subsequent trojan horse effects of npd following our

17567,the rapid and selective peroxymonosulfate pms induced transformation of h1 antihistamines cetirizine cet and diphenhydramine dph can be influenced by the presence of common organic and inorganic

promotion is demonstrated by the changed solution ph through detailed kinetic studies the impact of halide ions is remarkable with i inhibiting the process through consumption of pms while cl

introduction our recent study has demonstrated rapid transformation of h1 antihistamines cetirizine cet and diphenhydramine dph by direct peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation without activation he and o shea 2020 while reaction kinetics can be affected by solution ph it is also essential to assess the performance of pms under a variety of water treatment conditions this study was thus initiated to investigate how the presence of anions e g h2po4 hpo4 2 no3 cl hco3 co3 2 br and i impacted the degradation of model h1 antihistamines by unactivated pms these anions are naturally present or extensively discharged by human activities ansari et al 2010 battin et al 2009 pena pereira et al 2020 pennino et al 2020 warner et al 2013 they may have powerful inhibitory influence on the pms based advanced oxidation processes aops through interfering with the generation and subsequent reactions of radical species e g hydroxyl radical oh and or sulfate radical so4 despite the considerable literature on the influence of anions on the activated pms degradation systems ghanbari and moradi 2017 there are limited studies on their impacts on unactivated pms systems that are not based on oh or so4 reactions a number of recent studies demonstrate pms via non radical reactions can be enhanced by the presence of anions lou et al 2014 nie et al 2019 yang et al 2018a b zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2018b however we reported previously that the presence of phosphate at 5 50 mm at ph 7 2 both h2po4 and hpo4 2 with the pka of h3po4 as 2 2 6 8 and 12 4 or 8 6 mainly hpo4 2 exhibits no effect on the degradation of cet by unactivated pms where trapping studies demonstrate the absence of oh so4 or singlet oxygen 1o2 he and o shea 2020 we did not observe any effect of 10 mm no3 on the transformation of cet in this study either influence of phosphate or no3 was not further discussed superoxide anion radical o2 and 1o2 are reported to be generated in the co3 2 pms system and responsible for removing effectively dye acid orange 7 nie et al 2019 while o2 is likely absent under acidic neutral conditions employed in our experiments nie et al 2019 the formation and role of 1o2 in our co3 2 pms system are unconfirmed the pka s of h2co3 are 6 4 and 10 3 with hco3 dominating the alkalinity in natural water formation of peroxoanions by the reaction of pms and oxoanions such as hco3 is proposed to facilitate the degradation of organic compounds via two electron electrophilic reactions richardson et al 2000 yang et al 2018b with the transfer of distal oxygen in the peroxo bond of pms identified as the major pathway for the transformation of cet and dph to their corresponding n oxide products the potential of hco3 to inhibit or enhance the transformation of cet or dph in the hco3 pms system is unexplored halide ions present in a variety of wastewater and drinking water sources davis et al 1998 fuge and johnson 1986 have different reactivities with pms eqs 1 3 lente et al 2009 in the base cl pms system the enhanced degradation of dye methylene blue mb has been attributed to the formation of 1o2 and hypochlorous acid hocl yang et al 2018a hocl is further identified to be responsible for the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp zeng et al 2020 and steroid estrogens e g 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 zhou et al 2018b under cl pms treatment the second

reactivity of 2 4 dcp pka 7 9 with hocl is lower than 4 cp lee and morris 1962 meanwhile the second order rate constants of tertiary amines with hocl are in general 103 104 m 1 s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore with the tertiary amines potentially more reactive with hocl than 2 4 dcp the presence of cl is expected to promote hocl induced transformation of cet and dph 1o2 also has the potential to degrade h1 antihistamines in the cl pms system and warrants careful examination ogryzlo and tang 1970 moreover enhanced degradation of phenolic compounds in the i pms system is attributed to the formation of hypoiodous acid hoi eq 3 as the reactive species li et al 2017 2018 the br pms system may likewise serve to increase the degradation of cet via the formation of hypobromous acid

aqueous reactions of unactivated pms the influence of inorganic anions is unclear especially the roles of the anions in the generation and reaction of reactive species responsible for the chemical transformation one major objective of this study was to obtain information on how common inorganic compounds impacted the degradation of h1 antihistamines by unactivated pms specifically hco3 co3 2 cl br or i at different initial concentrations and or ph conditions was spiked into the cet or dph pms system addition of furfuryl alcohol ffa a 1o2 trap with kffa 1o2 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 and use of deuterium oxide d2o as the solvent were applied to assess the role of 1o2 merkel et al 1972 wilkinson et al 1995 individual experiments spiked with certain species such as i2 io3 and br2 were also examined to distinguish the reactive species in the halide pms system we observed different results than reported in the literature including but not limited to 1 enhanced effect in the presence of hco3 co3 2 due to the changed solution ph but not bi carbonate species 2 no detection of 1o2 in the optimal hco3 co3 2 pms systems 3 strong inhibition by i due to pms consumption 4 extremely low and diverse contribution of 1o2 and hocl in the cl pms system and 5 promoted effect of br by complex role of hobr li et al 2017 nie et al 2019 zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2018b moreover organic compounds are widely present in water in the form of natural organic matter nom derrien et al 2019 it is unknown whether presence of nom can impact the transformation of cet dph by unactivated pms the second objective of this study was thus to identify the influence of nom by spiking a different concentration humic acid ha phenol pyridine or sorbate at different ph conditions ha was used in this study as a representative of large molecular weight nom phenol represents the phenolic functional group in nom conjugated dienes are naturally occurring they are commonly used in synthesis industry and found in wastewater al sheikhly et al 2006 sorbate was used as a representative conjugated diene pyridine a major contributor to the odor problem in drinking water is a nitrogen heterocyclic compound atsdr 1992 it was used to evaluate whether such nitrogen structure could interfere with the transformation of h1 anthistamines by pms we observed that the presence of these organic constituents had a minimal effect on the pms mediated oxidation processes highlighting the strong selectivity of unactivated pms reactions with the role of the common inorganic and organic water constituents carefully elucidated in this study the results are expected to present useful information on the application of unactivated pms which has been limited in the literature for the removal of organic water pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals cet as c21h25cln2o3 2hcl and dph as c17h21no hcl were purchased from alfa aesar and mp biomedicals llc respectively sorbate as ch3ch ch chch co2k pms

nahco3 acros organics na2co3 nacl nabr ki solid iodine i2 acros organics na2s2o3 ffa acros organics phenol and pyridine were acquired from fisher scientific all chemicals were used without further purification 2 2 experimental procedures experimental procedure was described in detail in our recent study he and o shea 2020 in general a 2 ml high performance liquid chromatography hplc vial was used as a reaction vessel the initial concentration of pms was maintained at 1 mm while that of the competing organic or inorganic compound ranged from 0 1 to 50 mm solution ph was adjusted by addition of 0 1 n naoh or 10 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs whereas indicated the total reaction volume was kept at 1 5 ml the reaction was initiated upon mixture of the oxidant with the other chemicals the 30 µl na2s2o3 at a final concentration of 10 mm was applied at the predetermined time interval to quench the reaction the control experiments for the figures in the absence of the competing compound were previously reported he and o shea 2020 carbon dioxide co2 can be transferred from air into water park et al 2015 yang and lu 2019 leading to the formation of hco3 and co3 2 which can dramatically impact water treatment processes the tightly capped vial with each data point collected from one individual experiment minimized the influence of co2 transfer comparison between the headspace maintained experimental series and those in the absence of headspace is illustrated in fig s1a experiments with continual mixing and no mixing gave similar results fig s1b therefore in addition to the relatively low diffusion coefficient of 1 91 10 5 cm2 s 1 in deionized water at 25 c jähne et al 1987 as well as an employed short reaction time of 15 min in this study the air water co2 transfer was insignificant solution ph was measured directly for the hco3 and co3 2 pms experiments without any further ph adjustment to assess the formation of 1o2 in the hco3 and co3 2 pms systems a set of experiments was conducted by using the 1o2 trap ffa wilkinson et al 1995 i e 100 µm ffa 1 mm pms 0 5 mm naoh 10 mm nahco3 or 0 5 mm na2co3 the ffa was similarly used to assess whether cl can promote the formation of 1o2 in the employed cl pms system since oh a common product in pms systems can also lead to the degradation of ffa kffa oh 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 50 mm tbuoh was added especially to those conditions where degradation of ffa was observed the disappearance of ffa proportional to the production of 1o2 was also monitored and compared in h2o and d2o solvent to identify the role of 1o2 merkel et al 1972 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of cet dph their respective major n oxide products pcet and pdph and ffa were monitored by hplc cui et al 2018 he and o shea 2020 briefly a varian pro star 210 hplc was used as the analytical instrument coupled with a phenomenex luna c18 2 100 å column 250 4 60 mm 5 µm as the stationary phase and 40 acetonitrile and 60 20 mm phosphate buffer in millipore filtered water at ph 3 0 v v with a flow of 1 ml min 1 as the mobile phase the retention times are around 7 5 5 5 9 1 6 3 and 4 1 min and the quantification wavelengths are 230 219 230 219 and 230 nm respectively for cet dph pcet pdph and ffa due to a lack of standards for the pcet and pdph the hplc area mau min is used directly as a representative of relative concentration to compare the influence of experimental parameters on parent compound degradation and product formation lastly solution ph was measured by a mettler toledo le438 ph electrode 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of bicarbonate and carbonate on the transformation of cet both hco3 and co3 2 appeared to increase the degradation of cet figs s2a b the species dependent reaction was previously reported between pms and cet he and o shea 2020 the estimated second order rate constants were thus used to calculate the theoretical pseudo first order rate constant kobs min 1 at each spiked hco3 and co3 2 presence of which changed the solution ph as shown in fig 1 a b the calculated ph dependent kobs were generally comparable to the observed ones p 0 05 n 8 the kinetics appeared strongly dependent on solution ph than the carbonate species faster observed degradation of cet in the presence of equal concentrations of added co3 2 as compared to hco3 was attributed to the more alkaline conditions produced by addition of co3 2 the concentration of ffa remained constant under the pms only conditions no degradation of ffa was observed for the 10 mm hco3 or 0 5 mm co3 2 1 mm pms systems data not shown suggesting the absence of 1o2 we thus assigned the solution ph as predominant factor for the degradation of cet in the hco3 co3 2 pms system without formation of 1o2 the primary product pcet from direct reaction of cet with pms was reactive towards pms he and o shea 2020 the formation of pcet in the hco3 co3 2 pms system correlated well with the cet disappearance figs s2c d over the course of 60 min solution ph did not change significantly figs s2e f in general under our conditions hco3 or co3 2 species did not inhibit or impact the transformation of cet a major benefit of unactivated pms compared to aops in water treatment applications 3 2 influence of iodide on the transformation of cet the second order rate constant between cet and pms was calculated as 8 86 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 2 he and o shea 2020 the second order rate constant between pms and i is much higher as 1 4 103 m 1 s 1 eq 3 lente et al 2009 thus the reaction of i with pms was dominant when 1 mm pms 0 1 10 mm i and 50 µm cet were present the pms induced degradation of cet was strongly inhibited by the presence of i at ph 4 3 7 2 and 8 6 as shown in fig 2 a c significant inhibition was observed even at i 0 0 1 mm the solution went from colorless to orange brown immediately after mixing of i and pms suggesting formation of i2 eq 4 or the triiodide complex i3 eq 5 under excess i conditions feng et al 2017 li et al 2018 wacławek et al 2015 addition of 1 mm i into 1 mm pms solution stoichiometrically yields 0 5 mm pms and 0 5 mm i2 in accordance with stoichiometry represented by eq 4 however the reaction in this 1 mm i 1 mm pms system was still much slower than the control experiment with 0 5 mm pms only figs s3a b or with a lower concentration of 0 25 mm pms only condition figs s3c d i2 alone or in combination of ki did not degrade cet fig 2d or induce any activation of pms i e i2 pms comparable with pms only series fig 2e these observations indicate the reaction in eq 4 was not the only one under the stated conditions there was formation of other iodine species such as hoi eq 3 and iodate io3 eqs 6 8 4 hso5 2i so4 2 i2 oh 5 i2 i i3 6 hso5 hoi io2 so4 2 2h 7 hso5 io2 io3 so4 2 h 8 3hso5 i io3 3so4 2 3h influence of solution ph appeared to be less significant in the presence of 0 5 or 1 mm i for the first time in this study we observed no or minimal influence of the solution ph the degradation of cet at ph 7 2 and 8 6 fig 2a b were comparable in the presence i since the established ph effect was not observed we proposed a change in the transformation pathway the reaction between pms and i produces hoi under acidic ph conditions eq 3 while io3 is generated at higher solution ph eqs 6 8 huang and zhang 2020 li et al 2017 2018 addition of 1 mm io3 as a control experiment demonstrated the degradation of cet was independent of io3 fig 2f the formation of pcet the primary product of unactivated pms oxidation of cet was lower in the presence of i in fact pcet was not detected at 0 5 mm i fig 2a c consumption of pms by i with the formation of hoi and io3 blocked the oxygen transfer route observed in a clean selective pms system and completely inhibited the n oxide product formation in summary kinetics inhibition and changes in the mechanism of the pms mediated transformation of cet were observed in the presence of i 3 3 influence of chloride on the transformation of cet and dph the presence of cl in the cl pms system was reported to enhance the transformation of dye mb 2 4 dcp and steroid estrogens yang et al 2018a zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2018b under our condition at concentrations between 1 and 50 mm cl did not influence the degradation of cet or the formation of pcet at ph 4 3 fig s4a or ph 9 1 fig s4b however when dph was the target substrate a promoting effect with the addition of cl was clearly observed fig 3 a which intrigued us to investigate in more detail the influence of cl the presence of cl under a variety of reaction conditions did not affect the transformation of cet fig 3b c in addition to those illustrated in figs s4a b the different pms mediated degradation of ffa was negligible under cl pms conditions in the presence and absence of tbuoh at ph 4 3 9 1 fig 3 comparable results in h2o and d2o confirmed the absence of 1o2 in our cl pms system at ph 9 1 fig 3c given the low reactivity of hocl with alcohols and conjugated double bonds deborde and von gunten 2008 the degradation of ffa in fig 3b at ph 4 3 was a result of 1o2 reaction the steady state concentration of 1o2 1o2 ss was calculated as 3 4 10 12 m from the kobs ffa of 2 4 0 2 10 2 min 1 r2 0 99 and kffa 1o2 of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 wilkinson et al 1995 based on the ktriethylamine 1o2 1 9 107 m 1 s 1 ogryzlo and tang 1970 as a representative second order rate constant of tertiary amine cet dph with 1o2 which is 10 times less reactive than ffa towards 1o2 the kobs cet 1o2 could be calculated as 3 8 10 3 min 1 with the overall degradation of cet in fig 3b as 1 3 0 1 10 1 min 1 the role of 1o2 was minimal 2 9 similarly the 1o2 ss in fig 3a was calculated as 5 1 10 12 m from the kobs ffa of 3 66 10 2 min 1 r2 0 98 the kobs dph 1o2 was calculated as 5 80 10 3 min 1 which was a slightly less than kobs dph pms of 1 60 10 2 min 1 r2 0 92 because the sum of kobs dph 1o2 and kobs dph pms was much lower than the overall dph removal in fig 3a by cl pms contribution of 1o2 was small consequently although the kinetics of cet degradation was unchanged fig 3b hocl was likely formed and contributed to the elevated degradation of dph in the cl pms system fig 3a cet and dph have different reactivities with pms i e kcet pms 2 21 0 14 m 1 s 1 fig 3b at ph 4 3 and kdph pms 3 49 1 12 10 1 m 1 s 1 fig 3a at ph 5 2 he and o shea 2020 the 50 µm cet dph and 50 mm cl competed for reaction with pms for the comparison purpose the ratio of the initial reaction rate was calculated as eqs 9 and 10 9 r pms cet r pms c l k pms cet pms 0 cet 0 k pms c l pms 0 c l 0 1 05 p h 4 3 10 r pms dph r pms c l k pms dph pms 0 dph 0 k pms c l pms 0 c l 0 0 17 p h 5 2 the results suggested pms was more likely to react with cl in the dph cl pms system than in cet cl pms system thus leading to higher hocl generation potential in the dph cl pms system recent studies on the pms mediated degradation of 2 4 dcp zeng et al 2020 and steroid estrogens zhou et al 2018b showed these substrates have extremely low reactivity with unactivated pms zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2018b yet a promoting effect of cl was observed likely the result of the generation and subsequent reactions of hocl in general the presence of cl one of the most common inorganic water constituents can promote the pms mediated formation of hocl as a powerful oxidant for contaminate degradation and water disinfection specific experimental conditions can also lead to generation of highly selective 1o2 and contribute to the pollutant degradation yang et al 2018a 3 4 influence of bromide on the transformation of cet and dph we observed enhanced pms mediated degradation of cet with the addition of 1 50 mm br fig 4 a the presence of br also led to lower levels of the primary unactivated pms oxidation product pcet the formation of hobr eq 2 in br pms system zhou et al 2018b likely contributed to the promoted degradation of cet change of solution color colorless to yellow brown was observed at a high br concentration suggesting the formation of br2 as shown in fig 4b br2 that forms hobr by eqs 11 14 could rapidly degrade cet huang and zhang 2020 the pcet was not formed under br2 only condition fig 4b thus the degradation of cet with less pcet formation in fig 4a was achieved by the different oxidant hobr than pms the latter of which would lead to higher formation of pcet 11 b r 2 h 2 o b r 2 o h h k 9 7 10 1 m 1 s 1 12 b r 2 o h h b r 2 h 2 o k 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 13 b r 2 o h hobr b r k 5 10 9 s 1 14 hobr b r b r 2 o h k 5 10 9 s 1 effect of br on the pms mediated conversion of dph was complex enhancing the degradation in the presence of 1 mm br without any additional influence at the higher br concentrations fig 5 a at the higher br concentrations lower pdph was produced fig 5b while minimum level of a second product was observed for cet data not shown a unique and obvious second product was detected for dph by br pms in hplc analysis with a retention time of 5 0 min as compared to 5 5 min for dph and 6 3 min for pdph the concentration of the second product paralleled the concentration of br fig 5c an additional set of experiments was conducted by adding an equal molar concentration of 1o2 trapping agent ffa insignificant kinetic differences in the presence of 50 mm tbuoh ruled out the generation of oh and oh mediated ffa degradation in the br pms system fig 5d f ffa is susceptible to br2 oxidation with 50 µm ffa completely degraded within 30 s by the spiked 1 mm br2 data not shown therefore the rapid disappearance of ffa within 30 s at the conditions in fig 5d f was not an indication of an extensive 1o2 generation instead it confirmed the generation of br2 or hobr that degraded ffa rapidly however no degradation of dph was observed by br2 in the presence or absence of pms fig s5 suggesting insignificant role of br2 or hobr on the transformation of dph the kobs of the degradation of cet was found to be faster in h2o at 7 24 0 05 10 1 min 1 than in d2o at 4 88 0 76 10 1 min 1 in the br pms system fig 4a consistent with the deuterium effect of halogenation hanzlik et al 1987 patel et al 1973 and confirming the essential effect of hobr for the degradation of cet in the br pms system however the kobs of the degradation of dph in h2o and in d2o by 10 mm br 1 mm pms 0 5 mm naoh naod were calculated to be comparable at 1 68 0 04 10 1 min 1 and 1 83 0 11 10 1 min 1 respectively suggesting a different and non hobr based degradation route distinctive reactivities between h1 antihistamines were thus demonstrated more studies are needed to explore the fundamental reactions within the br pms system 3 5 influence of other organic compounds on the transformation of cet and dph tertiary amine was the primary reaction site in pms oxidation he and o shea 2020 ha the main components of which were phenolic and sugar moieties mcdonald et al 2004 was thus not reactive with pms and did not show any significant influence on the degradation or transformation of cet at ph 7 2 or 8 6 fig 6 a b other small molecule organic compounds i e phenol pyridine and sorbate did not show any influence on the degradation of cet either no significant influence of these organic compounds was similarly observed for the transformation of dph fig 6c d indicating minimal effect of such organic compounds in water on selective oxidation of h1 antihistamines using unactivated pms 4 conclusions with strong removal of h1 antihistamines cet and dph previously demonstrated by unactivated pms this study further investigated in detail the influence of common organic and inorganic water constituents although an enhanced effect was observed in the presence of hco3 co3 2 the observed faster degradation kinetics were attributed to the changed solution ph but not bi carbonate species no 1o2 was detected in the optimal hco3 co3 2 pms systems in this study inhibition of pms induced transformation was generally observed in the presence of i likely a result of pms consumption transformation of pms into iodine based oxidant species altered the transformation mechanism no influence of 1 50 mm cl was observed for the degradation of cet while that of dph was promoted in the presence of 50 mm cl contribution of 1o2 was minimal in the cl pms systems for the degradation of cet dph lower reactivity of dph with pms than cet allowed dph to compete less strongly with cl for pms reactions resulting in higher hocl formation potential in the presence of br faster degradation of cet dph and lower yields of the n oxide products pcet pdph were observed at relative high concentrations of br a second product of dph in addition to pdph was detected by the hplc analysis while the observed kinetics and mechanism for the transformation of cet were attributed to hobr formation by br pms the transformation of dph under similar conditions involved different species than pms and hobr over a range of concentrations ha phenol sorbate or pyridine at different ph conditions did not influence the transformation of cet or dph in summary a diverse group of representative organic and inorganic water constituents had minimal influence on the direct pms mediated transformation of h1 antihistamines in cases where appropriate amount of br is present the contaminant removal can be strongly accelerated the selective reaction kinetics of pms mediated transformation can thus be tailored through varying the reaction conditions highlighting a strong potential of unactivated pms for water treatment one such application is the in situ remediation zeng et al 2020 weak self decomposition yang et al 2018b allows an effective delivery of pms to the contaminated zones selective but strong reactivity nature of unactivated pms makes the degradation of contaminants readily achievable chen et al 2018 he and o shea 2020 liu et al 2020 nihemaiti et al 2020 ruiz et al 2019 yang et al 2018b zhou et al 2018a absence of external chemical and energy input needed for the activation of pms lowers the application cost whereas the presence of in situ chemicals such as transitional metals may otherwise activate pms for water decontamination purposes ghanbari and moradi 2017 more work such as by using more realistic synthetic water or field water samples is needed to demonstrate the applicability of

17567,the rapid and selective peroxymonosulfate pms induced transformation of h1 antihistamines cetirizine cet and diphenhydramine dph can be influenced by the presence of common organic and inorganic water constituents presence of hco3 and or co3 2 which often exhibit powerful inhibition on the advanced oxidation processes aops can enhance the pms mediated transformation of cet dph the observed promotion is demonstrated by the changed solution ph through detailed kinetic studies the impact of halide ions is remarkable with i inhibiting the process through consumption of pms while cl increases slightly the transformation kinetics through the formation and subsequent reactions of hocl the cet dph degradation in the br pms system is influenced by the generation of reactive species such as hobr which leads to different reaction pathways as compared to pms alone the results demonstrated the performance of pms can be tailored through varying the experimental parameters in addition

introduction our recent study has demonstrated rapid transformation of h1 antihistamines cetirizine cet and diphenhydramine dph by direct peroxymonosulfate pms oxidation without activation he and o shea 2020 while reaction kinetics can be affected by solution ph it is also essential to assess the performance of pms under a variety of water treatment conditions this study was thus initiated to investigate how the presence of anions e g h2po4 hpo4 2 no3 cl hco3 co3 2 br and i impacted the degradation of model h1 antihistamines by unactivated pms these anions are naturally present or extensively discharged by human activities ansari et al 2010 battin et al 2009 pena pereira et al 2020 pennino et al 2020 warner et al 2013 they may have powerful inhibitory influence on the pms based advanced oxidation processes aops through interfering with the generation and subsequent reactions of radical species e g hydroxyl radical oh and or sulfate radical so4 despite the considerable literature on the influence of anions on the activated pms degradation systems ghanbari and moradi 2017 there are limited studies on their impacts on unactivated pms systems that are not based on oh or so4 reactions a number of recent studies demonstrate pms via non radical reactions can be enhanced by the presence of anions lou et al 2014 nie et al 2019 yang et al 2018a b zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2018b however we reported previously that the presence of phosphate at 5 50 mm at ph 7 2 both h2po4 and hpo4 2 with the pka of h3po4 as 2 2 6 8 and 12 4 or 8 6 mainly hpo4 2 exhibits no effect on the degradation of cet by unactivated pms where trapping studies demonstrate the absence of oh so4 or singlet oxygen 1o2 he and o shea 2020 we did not observe any effect of 10 mm no3 on the transformation of cet in this study either influence of phosphate or no3 was not further discussed superoxide anion radical o2 and 1o2 are reported to be generated in the co3 2 pms system and responsible for removing effectively dye acid orange 7 nie et al 2019 while o2 is likely absent under acidic neutral conditions employed in our experiments nie et al 2019 the formation and role of 1o2 in our co3 2 pms system are unconfirmed the pka s of h2co3 are 6 4 and 10 3 with hco3 dominating the alkalinity in natural water formation of peroxoanions by the reaction of pms and oxoanions such as hco3 is proposed to facilitate the degradation of organic compounds via two electron electrophilic reactions richardson et al 2000 yang et al 2018b with the transfer of distal oxygen in the peroxo bond of pms identified as the major pathway for the transformation of cet and dph to their corresponding n oxide products the potential of hco3 to inhibit or enhance the transformation of cet or dph in the hco3 pms system is unexplored halide ions present in a variety of wastewater and drinking water sources davis et al 1998 fuge and johnson 1986 have different reactivities with pms eqs 1 3 lente et al 2009 in the base cl pms system the enhanced degradation of dye methylene blue mb has been attributed to the formation of 1o2 and hypochlorous acid hocl yang et al 2018a hocl is further identified to be responsible for the degradation of 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp zeng et al 2020 and steroid estrogens e g 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 zhou et al 2018b under cl pms treatment the second

reactivity of 2 4 dcp pka 7 9 with hocl is lower than 4 cp lee and morris 1962 meanwhile the second order rate constants of tertiary amines with hocl are in general 103 104 m 1 s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 therefore with the tertiary amines potentially more reactive with hocl than 2 4 dcp the presence of cl is expected to promote hocl induced transformation of cet and dph 1o2 also has the potential to degrade h1 antihistamines in the cl pms system and warrants careful examination ogryzlo and tang 1970 moreover enhanced degradation of phenolic compounds in the i pms system is attributed to the formation of hypoiodous acid hoi eq 3 as the reactive species li et al 2017 2018 the br pms system may likewise serve to increase the degradation of cet via the formation of hypobromous acid

aqueous reactions of unactivated pms the influence of inorganic anions is unclear especially the roles of the anions in the generation and reaction of reactive species responsible for the chemical

examined to distinguish the reactive species in the halide pms system we observed different results than reported in the literature including but not limited to 1 enhanced effect in the presence of

objective of this study was thus to identify the influence of nom by spiking a different concentration humic acid ha phenol pyridine or sorbate at different ph conditions ha was used in this study as a representative of large molecular weight nom phenol represents the phenolic functional group in nom conjugated dienes are naturally occurring they are commonly used in synthesis industry and found in wastewater al sheikhly et al 2006 sorbate was used as a representative conjugated diene pyridine a major contributor to the odor problem in drinking water is a nitrogen heterocyclic compound atsdr 1992 it was used to evaluate whether such nitrogen structure could interfere with the transformation of h1 anthistamines by pms we observed that the presence of these organic constituents had a minimal effect on the pms mediated oxidation processes highlighting the strong selectivity of unactivated pms reactions with the role of the common inorganic and organic water constituents carefully elucidated in this study the results are expected to present useful information on the application of unactivated pms which has been limited in the literature for the removal of organic water pollutants 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals cet as c21h25cln2o3 2hcl and dph as c17h21no hcl were purchased from alfa aesar and mp biomedicals llc respectively sorbate as ch3ch ch chch co2k pms as khso5 0 5khso4 0 5k2so4 ha as humic acid sodium salt and pd adjusting sodium deuteroxide naod 30 wt in d2o were obtained from sigma aldrich d2o was from cambridge isotope laboratories inc the nahco3 acros organics na2co3 nacl nabr ki solid iodine i2 acros organics na2s2o3 ffa acros organics phenol and pyridine were acquired from fisher scientific all chemicals were used without further purification 2 2 experimental procedures experimental procedure was described in detail in our recent study he and o shea 2020 in general a 2 ml high performance liquid chromatography hplc vial was used as a reaction vessel the initial concentration of pms was maintained at 1 mm while that of the competing organic or inorganic compound ranged from 0 1 to 50 mm solution ph was adjusted by addition of 0 1 n naoh or 10 mm phosphate buffer solution pbs whereas indicated the total reaction volume was kept at 1 5 ml the reaction was initiated upon mixture of the oxidant with the other chemicals the 30 µl na2s2o3 at a final concentration of 10 mm was applied at the predetermined time interval to quench the reaction the control experiments for the figures in the absence of the competing compound were previously reported he and o shea 2020 carbon dioxide co2 can be transferred from air into water park et al 2015 yang and lu 2019 leading to the formation of hco3 and co3 2 which can dramatically impact water treatment processes the tightly capped vial with each data point collected from one individual experiment minimized the influence of co2 transfer comparison between the headspace maintained experimental series and those in the absence of headspace is illustrated in fig s1a experiments with continual mixing and no mixing gave similar results fig s1b therefore in addition to the relatively low diffusion coefficient of 1 91 10 5 cm2 s 1 in deionized water at 25 c jähne et al 1987 as well as an employed short reaction time of 15 min in this study the air water co2 transfer was insignificant solution ph was measured directly for the hco3 and co3 2 pms experiments without any further ph adjustment to assess the formation of 1o2 in the hco3 and co3 2 pms systems a set of experiments was conducted by using the 1o2 trap ffa wilkinson et al 1995 i e 100 µm ffa 1 mm pms 0 5 mm naoh 10 mm nahco3 or 0 5 mm na2co3 the ffa was similarly used to assess whether cl can promote the formation of 1o2 in the employed cl pms system since oh a common product in pms systems can also lead to the degradation of ffa kffa oh 1 5 1010 m 1 s 1 50 mm tbuoh was added especially to those conditions where degradation of ffa was observed the disappearance of ffa proportional to the production of 1o2 was also monitored and compared in h2o and d2o solvent to identify the role of 1o2 merkel et al 1972 2 3 analytical methods concentrations of cet dph their respective major n oxide products pcet and pdph and ffa were monitored by hplc cui et al 2018 he and o shea 2020 briefly a varian pro star 210 hplc was used as the analytical instrument coupled with a phenomenex luna c18 2 100 å column 250 4 60 mm 5 µm as the stationary phase and 40 acetonitrile and 60 20 mm phosphate buffer in millipore filtered water at ph 3 0 v v with a flow of 1 ml min 1 as the mobile phase the retention times are around 7 5 5 5 9 1 6 3 and 4 1 min and the quantification wavelengths are 230 219 230 219 and 230 nm respectively for cet dph pcet pdph and ffa due to a lack of standards for the pcet and pdph the hplc area mau min is used directly as a representative of relative concentration to compare the influence of experimental parameters on parent compound degradation and product formation lastly solution ph was measured by a mettler toledo le438 ph electrode 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of bicarbonate and carbonate on the transformation of cet both hco3 and co3 2 appeared to increase the degradation of cet figs s2a b the species dependent reaction was previously reported between pms and cet he and o shea 2020 the estimated second order rate constants were thus used to calculate the theoretical pseudo first order rate constant kobs min 1 at each spiked hco3 and co3 2 presence of which changed the solution ph as shown in fig 1 a b the calculated ph dependent kobs were generally comparable to the observed ones p 0 05 n 8 the kinetics appeared strongly dependent on solution ph than the carbonate species faster observed degradation of cet in the presence of equal concentrations of added co3 2 as compared to hco3 was attributed to the more alkaline conditions produced by addition of co3 2 the concentration of ffa remained constant under the pms only conditions no degradation of ffa was observed for the 10 mm hco3 or 0 5 mm co3 2 1 mm pms systems data not shown suggesting the absence of 1o2 we thus assigned the solution ph as predominant factor for the degradation of cet in the hco3 co3 2 pms system without formation of 1o2 the primary product pcet from direct reaction of cet with pms was reactive towards pms he and o shea 2020 the formation of pcet in the hco3 co3 2 pms system correlated well with the cet disappearance figs s2c d over the course of 60 min solution ph did not change significantly figs s2e f in general under our conditions hco3 or co3 2 species did not inhibit or impact the transformation of cet a major benefit of unactivated pms compared to aops in water treatment applications 3 2 influence of iodide on the transformation of cet the second order rate constant between cet and pms was calculated as 8 86 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 2 he and o shea 2020 the second order rate constant between pms and i is much higher as 1 4 103 m 1 s 1 eq 3 lente et al 2009 thus the reaction of i with pms was dominant when 1 mm pms 0 1 10 mm i and 50 µm cet were present the pms induced degradation of cet was strongly inhibited by the presence of i at ph 4 3 7 2 and 8 6 as shown in fig 2 a c significant inhibition was observed even at i 0 0 1 mm the solution went from colorless to orange brown immediately after mixing of i and pms suggesting formation of i2 eq 4 or the triiodide complex i3 eq 5 under excess i conditions feng et al 2017 li et al 2018 wacławek et al 2015 addition of 1 mm i into 1 mm pms solution stoichiometrically yields 0 5 mm pms and 0 5 mm i2 in accordance with stoichiometry represented by eq 4 however the reaction in this 1 mm i 1 mm pms system was still much slower than the control experiment with 0 5 mm pms only figs s3a b or with a lower concentration of 0 25 mm pms only condition figs s3c d i2 alone or in combination of ki did not degrade cet fig 2d or induce any activation of pms i e i2 pms comparable with pms only series fig 2e these observations indicate the reaction in eq 4 was not the only one under the stated conditions there was formation of other iodine species such as hoi eq 3 and iodate io3 eqs 6 8 4 hso5 2i so4 2 i2 oh 5 i2 i i3 6 hso5 hoi io2 so4 2 2h 7 hso5 io2 io3 so4 2 h 8 3hso5 i io3 3so4 2 3h influence of solution ph appeared to be less significant in the presence of 0 5 or 1 mm i for the first time in this study we observed no or minimal influence of the solution ph the degradation of cet at ph 7 2 and 8 6 fig 2a b were comparable in the presence i since the established ph effect was not observed we proposed a change in the transformation pathway the reaction between pms and i produces hoi under acidic ph conditions eq 3 while io3 is generated at higher solution ph eqs 6 8 huang and zhang 2020 li et al 2017 2018 addition of 1 mm io3 as a control experiment demonstrated the degradation of cet was independent of io3 fig 2f the formation of pcet the primary product of unactivated pms oxidation of cet was lower in the presence of i in fact pcet was not detected at 0 5 mm i fig 2a c consumption of pms by i with the formation of hoi and io3 blocked the oxygen transfer route observed in a clean selective pms system and completely inhibited the n oxide product formation in summary kinetics inhibition and changes in the mechanism of the pms mediated transformation of cet were observed in the presence of i 3 3 influence of chloride on the transformation of cet and dph the presence of cl in the cl pms system was reported to enhance the transformation of dye mb 2 4 dcp and steroid estrogens yang et al 2018a zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2018b under our condition at concentrations between 1 and 50 mm cl did not influence the degradation of cet or the formation of pcet at ph 4 3 fig s4a or ph 9 1 fig s4b however when dph was the target substrate a promoting effect with the addition of cl was clearly observed fig 3 a which intrigued us to investigate in more detail the influence of cl the presence of cl under a variety of reaction conditions did not affect the transformation of cet fig 3b c in addition to those illustrated in figs s4a b the different pms mediated degradation of ffa was negligible under cl pms conditions in the presence and absence of tbuoh at ph 4 3 9 1 fig 3 comparable results in h2o and d2o confirmed the absence of 1o2 in our cl pms system at ph 9 1 fig 3c given the low reactivity of hocl with alcohols and conjugated double bonds deborde and von gunten 2008 the degradation of ffa in fig 3b at ph 4 3 was a result of 1o2 reaction the steady state concentration of 1o2 1o2 ss was calculated as 3 4 10 12 m from the kobs ffa of 2 4 0 2 10 2 min 1 r2 0 99 and kffa 1o2 of 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 wilkinson et al 1995 based on the ktriethylamine 1o2 1 9 107 m 1 s 1 ogryzlo and tang 1970 as a representative second order rate constant of tertiary amine cet dph with 1o2 which is 10 times less reactive than ffa towards 1o2 the kobs cet 1o2 could be calculated as 3 8 10 3 min 1 with the overall degradation of cet in fig 3b as 1 3 0 1 10 1 min 1 the role of 1o2 was minimal 2 9 similarly the 1o2 ss in fig 3a was calculated as 5 1 10 12 m from the kobs ffa of 3 66 10 2 min 1 r2 0 98 the kobs dph 1o2 was calculated as 5 80 10 3 min 1 which was a slightly less than kobs dph pms of 1 60 10 2 min 1 r2 0 92 because the sum of kobs dph 1o2 and kobs dph pms was much lower than the overall dph removal in fig 3a by cl pms contribution of 1o2 was small consequently although the kinetics of cet degradation was unchanged fig 3b hocl was likely formed and contributed to the elevated degradation of dph in the cl pms system fig 3a cet and dph have different reactivities with pms i e kcet pms 2 21 0 14 m 1 s 1 fig 3b at ph 4 3 and kdph pms 3 49 1 12 10 1 m 1 s 1 fig 3a at ph 5 2 he and o shea 2020 the 50 µm cet dph and 50 mm cl competed for reaction with pms for the comparison purpose the ratio of the initial reaction rate was calculated as eqs 9 and 10 9 r pms cet r pms c l k pms cet pms 0 cet 0 k pms c l pms 0 c l 0 1 05 p h 4 3 10 r pms dph r pms c l k pms dph pms 0 dph 0 k pms c l pms 0 c l 0 0 17 p h 5 2 the results suggested pms was more likely to react with cl in the dph cl pms system than in cet cl pms system thus leading to higher hocl generation potential in the dph cl pms system recent studies on the pms mediated degradation of 2 4 dcp zeng et al 2020 and steroid estrogens zhou et al 2018b showed these substrates have extremely low reactivity with unactivated pms zeng et al 2020 zhou et al 2018b yet a promoting effect of cl was observed likely the result of the generation and subsequent reactions of hocl in general the presence of cl one of the most common inorganic water constituents can promote the pms mediated formation of hocl as a powerful oxidant for contaminate degradation and water disinfection specific experimental conditions can also lead to generation of highly selective 1o2 and contribute to the pollutant degradation yang et al 2018a 3 4 influence of bromide on the transformation of cet and dph we observed enhanced pms mediated degradation of cet with the addition of 1 50 mm br fig 4 a the presence of br also led to lower levels of the primary unactivated pms oxidation product pcet the formation of hobr eq 2 in br pms system zhou et al 2018b likely contributed to the promoted degradation of cet change of solution color colorless to yellow brown was observed at a high br concentration suggesting the formation of br2 as shown in fig 4b br2 that forms hobr by eqs 11 14 could rapidly degrade cet huang and zhang 2020 the pcet was not formed under br2 only condition fig 4b thus the degradation of cet with less pcet formation in fig 4a was achieved by the different oxidant hobr than pms the latter of which would lead to higher formation of pcet 11 b r 2 h 2 o b r 2 o h h k 9 7 10 1 m 1 s 1 12 b r 2 o h h b r 2 h 2 o k 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 13 b r 2 o h hobr b r k 5 10 9 s 1 14 hobr b r b r 2 o h k 5 10 9 s 1 effect of br on the pms mediated conversion of dph was complex enhancing the degradation in the presence of 1 mm br without any additional influence at the higher br concentrations fig 5 a at the higher br concentrations lower pdph was produced fig 5b while minimum level of a second product was observed for cet data not shown a unique and obvious second product was detected for dph by br pms in hplc analysis with a retention time of 5 0 min as compared to 5 5 min for dph and 6 3 min for pdph the concentration of the second product paralleled the concentration of br fig 5c an additional set of experiments was conducted by adding an equal molar concentration of 1o2 trapping agent ffa insignificant kinetic differences in the presence of 50 mm tbuoh ruled out the generation of oh and oh mediated ffa degradation in the br pms system fig 5d f ffa is susceptible to br2 oxidation with 50 µm ffa completely degraded within 30 s by the spiked 1 mm br2 data not shown therefore the rapid disappearance of ffa within 30 s at the conditions in fig 5d f was not an indication of an extensive 1o2 generation instead it confirmed the generation of br2 or hobr that degraded ffa rapidly however no degradation of dph was observed by br2 in the presence or absence of pms fig s5 suggesting insignificant role of br2 or hobr on the transformation of dph the kobs of the degradation of cet was found to be faster in h2o at 7 24 0 05 10 1 min 1 than in d2o at 4 88 0 76 10 1 min 1 in the br pms system fig 4a consistent with the deuterium effect of halogenation hanzlik et al 1987 patel et al 1973 and confirming the essential effect of hobr for the degradation of cet in the br pms system however the kobs of the degradation of dph in h2o and in d2o by 10 mm br 1 mm pms 0 5 mm naoh naod were calculated to be comparable at 1 68 0 04 10 1 min 1 and 1 83 0 11 10 1 min 1 respectively suggesting a different and non hobr based degradation route distinctive reactivities between h1 antihistamines were thus demonstrated more studies are needed to explore the fundamental reactions within the br pms system 3 5 influence of other organic compounds on the transformation of cet and dph tertiary amine was the primary reaction site in pms oxidation he and o shea 2020 ha the main components of which were phenolic and sugar moieties mcdonald et al 2004 was thus not reactive with pms and did not show any significant influence on the degradation or transformation of cet at ph 7 2 or 8 6 fig 6 a b other small molecule organic compounds i e phenol pyridine and sorbate did not show any influence on the degradation of cet either no significant influence of these organic compounds was similarly observed for the transformation of dph fig 6c d indicating minimal effect of such organic compounds in water on selective oxidation of h1 antihistamines using unactivated pms 4 conclusions with strong removal of h1 antihistamines cet and dph previously demonstrated by unactivated pms this study further investigated in detail the influence of common organic and inorganic water constituents although an enhanced effect was observed in the presence of hco3 co3 2 the observed faster degradation kinetics were attributed to the changed solution ph but not bi carbonate species no 1o2 was detected in the optimal hco3 co3 2 pms systems in this study inhibition of pms induced transformation was generally observed in the presence of i likely a result of pms consumption transformation of pms into iodine based oxidant species altered the transformation mechanism no influence of 1 50 mm cl was observed for the degradation of cet while that of dph was promoted in the presence of 50 mm cl contribution of 1o2 was minimal in the cl pms systems for the degradation of cet dph lower reactivity of dph with pms than cet allowed dph to compete less strongly with cl for pms reactions resulting in higher hocl formation potential in the presence of br faster degradation of cet dph and lower yields of the n oxide products pcet pdph were observed at relative high concentrations of br a second product of dph in addition to pdph was detected by the hplc analysis while the observed kinetics and mechanism for the transformation of cet were attributed to hobr formation by br pms the transformation of dph under similar conditions involved different species than pms and hobr over a range of concentrations ha phenol sorbate or pyridine at different ph conditions did not influence the transformation of cet or dph in summary a diverse group of representative organic and inorganic water constituents had minimal influence on the direct pms mediated transformation of h1 antihistamines in cases where appropriate amount of br is present the contaminant removal can be strongly accelerated the selective reaction kinetics of pms mediated transformation can thus be tailored through varying the reaction conditions highlighting a strong potential of unactivated pms for water treatment one such application is the in situ remediation zeng et al 2020 weak self decomposition yang et al 2018b allows an effective delivery of pms to the contaminated zones selective but strong reactivity nature of unactivated pms makes the degradation of contaminants readily achievable chen et al 2018 he and o shea 2020 liu et al 2020 nihemaiti et al 2020 ruiz et al 2019 yang et al 2018b zhou et al 2018a absence of external chemical and energy input needed for the activation of pms lowers the application cost whereas the presence of in situ chemicals such as transitional metals may otherwise activate pms for water decontamination purposes ghanbari and moradi 2017 more work such as by using more realistic synthetic water or field water samples is needed to demonstrate the applicability of

17568,biofouling is a key problem in membrane filtration and extracellular polymer substances eps play a key role in biofouling biofouling contributes to membrane fouling during ultrafiltration of up flow biological activated carbon filter ubacf effluent eps are released when pollutants get attached with membrane surface and when pollutants are in solution phase from cell lysis and by cell secretions in our study of eps humic acid ha prepared as the effluent pollutants for ultrafiltration we found that eps increased the interfacial forces between the pollutants and the membrane resulting in membrane fouling in the early stages of filtration the main contribution of eps to membrane fouling was to bond with organic colloids which led to an increase in the pollutant particle size and zeta potential this increased the short range lewis acid base ab forces from 4 89 nn to 12 59 nn and accelerated the formation of a cake layer in the late stage of filtration the eps increased both the ab and london van der waals lw forces thus accelerating membrane fouling in order to mitigate biofouling we developed a method of pretreating the effluent with 0 4 mg l ozone prior to ultrafiltration and backwashing with 8 mg l h2o2 to sterilize bacteria attached to the membrane surface this method not only changed the characteristics of the eps but also inactivated bacteria by disinfection with h2o2 thereby reducing the amount of eps the proposed method provided a long term stable operation guarantee for ultrafiltration of ubacf effluent graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eps o3 h2o2 ultrafiltration membrane biofouling ubacf effluent xdlvo 1 introduction under conditions of continuously deteriorating raw water quality in order for drinking water to meet water quality standards advanced treatment processes are required teodosiu gilca barjoveanu and fiore 2018 ozone integrated with biological activated carbon o3 bac is a typical advanced treatment process used to improve water quality hong hongliang nanxiang and jun 2020 shu and zhang 2008 at present the bac process includes the down flow bac filter dbacf and the up flow bac filter ubacf the dbacf is located after sand filtration and has been widely used at water treatment plants in china liao et al 2013 however it has been found that there is uneven distribution of microorganisms higher water head loss and potential risk due to biological leakage hong xian chun nan xiang and hong bin 2018 in order to resolve these issues a new process is recently developed in which the ubacf is located between the sedimentation tank and the sand filter increased removal of natural organic matter nom has been recorded with the ubacf compared to the dbacf han et al 2013 however the effluent had increased turbidity and more bacteria were present compared to the dbacf ao liu zhang and wang 2018 therefore a process is required following ubacf to ensure drinking water safety ultrafiltration uf a typical low pressure membrane filtration technology has been widely used to treat drinking water boleda galceran and ventura 2011 and to remove particles and bacteria geismar bérubé and barbeau 2012 therefore ubacf effluent can be treated with ultrafiltration to ensure turbidity and biological safety unfortunately membrane fouling has restricted the large scale application of membrane technology shi tal hankins and gitis 2014 based on the type of pollutants membrane fouling can be categorized into organic fouling xiao xiao wang qin and he 2012 inorganic fouling ma et al 2018 and biofouling shao et al 2018 biofouling plays an important role in the contribution to membrane fouling when ultrafiltration is used to treat the ubacf effluent due to the presence of bacteria which release extracellular polymer substances eps resulting in biofouling previous studies have shown that eps are the main pollutants in biofouling yu zhang and graham 2017 eps are biopolymers secreted by microorganisms which form the structural substrates of biopolymers adav and lee 2008 excess eps are presented in a soluble form soluble microbial products smp and are loosely bound to biomass all of which becomes part of the biocontamination layer on the membrane surface chang lee and lee 2019 however there are few studies that report on the mechanism of membrane biofouling and in particular on the contribution of eps during the process of ultrafiltration combined with ubacf like eps ubacf effluent also contains nom and membrane fouling is caused by the interaction of nom and eps however the mechanism of this interaction is not clear previous studies have used polysaccharides and proteins to simulate eps ye le clech chen fane and jefferson 2005 or smp wang wang zhu mei and wu 2013 but no study to our knowledge has directly extracted eps and studied the mechanism of membrane fouling from the perspective of the interaction between eps and nom quantitative research on the contribution of biofouling to total membrane fouling is still scarce this paper investigated eps as a whole and studied the interfacial forces between eps and membrane according to the change of interfacial forces a quantitative analysis was made on the contribution of eps to membrane fouling at different interfaces several pretreatment processes have been proposed to alleviate membrane fouling such as coagulation oxidation yu graham and fowler 2016 and adsorption wang et al 2016 these processes remove some components or change the properties of the feed water thus affecting the interaction between the feed pollutants and the membrane among them chemical oxidation is widely used due to its effect on the change of the chemical structure and valence state of organic inorganic pollutants the inactivation of microorganisms and the partial mineralization of organic substances li et al 2019 however with strong oxidants such as ozone o3 in situ dosing at certain concentration levels may gradually lead to membrane damage or deterioration li et al 2019 it was previously reported that o3 may interact with intrinsic membrane materials during the ultrafiltration process to narrow the membrane pore size zhang lin and chen 2017 therefore a method to attain a better effect on both the mitigation of membrane fouling and reducing the negative influence on membrane materials was required in this study we investigated an innovative approach of o3 pretreatment to control membrane fouling followed by h2o2 backwashing ozonation changed the characteristics of the organics in the feed water to mitigate organic fouling on the condition that there was no residual o3 in membrane tank to avoid the negative influence on membrane materials due to oxidation h2o2 with low oxidation capacity but good sterilization was used to mitigate biofouling due to the inhibition of microorganism growth on membrane surface thereby reducing the formation of metabolites such as eps we used the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory to elucidate the mechanism of membrane fouling chen tian cao zhang and li 2012 wang et al 2013 lin et al 2014 and in particular the influence and contribution of eps we also discuss whether adding h2o2 backwashing after pre ozonation during ultrafiltration of ubacf is an effective way to alleviate membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1

pumped into the membrane tank during the last 30 s backwash the concentration of h2o2 was determined by the kmno4 method wang et al 2018 in the synthetic water experiment as shown in fig 1 b the ultrafiltration membrane system was operated according to the same cycle and backwash process tmp was measured by a pressure gauge htp 1 ej3c58 huatian instrument china and a paperless data logger htp

as follows the fouled membrane was removed from the membrane tank and soaked in 50 mg l naoh solution for 3 h then backwashed in 10 mg l naoh solution for 10 min and finally backwashed with filtered water for 10 min 2 4 feed water all chemicals used were analytical reagents with a purity 99 unless stated otherwise for the ubacf effluent experiment the effluent was collected from a drinking water treatment plant located in nanjing the water quality of the ubacf effluent and filtered water are shown in table 2 indicating that the turbidity and the number of bacteria were significantly reduced by ultrafiltration it can be speculated that the pollutants including the bacteria would be retained on the membrane resulting in membrane fouling in particular biofouling during the direct filtration process the water temperature ranged from 23 to 25 c during the experiment as biofouling of the membrane occurred during ultrafiltration in the laboratory we used synthetic water containing nom eps and divalent ions consistent with ubacf effluent as the feed water to study the mechanism of biofouling in a general way humic substances generate a more important fouling than fulvic acids schäfer schwicker fischer fane and waite 2000 aoustin schäfer fane and waite 2001 and our previous studies had also shown this lin et al 2014 in the appendix we have also provided information on the hydrophilic organic fulvic acid fa the experimental trend of membrane fouling was consistent with that of hydrophobic organics table s2 therefore in this study we mainly used hydrophobic organics represented by humic acid ha to demonstrate the mechanism of membrane fouling the synthetic water was prepared as follows humic acid solution humic acid ha with a purity of 98 was provided by sigma aldrich usa the reserve ha 1 g l solution was prepared as follows we dissolved 1 g ha in a 100 mm naoh solution to ensure complete dissolution the solution was then diluted to 1 l with deionized di water particles and insolubles in the ha were removed by a microfiltration membrane of 0 45 μm the ha reserve solution was stored at 4 c before each filtration experiment a fresh ha solution was prepared at ph 7 5 and dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 2 5 mg l to simulate the ubacf effluent ha eps mixture as eps are secreted by microorganisms it is not possible to directly select the pharmaceutical configuration therefore in the laboratory scale trial we used a method to extract eps from the bacterial liquid bacteria such as salmonella wang et al 2018 and pseudomonas aeruginosa are responsible for membrane biocontamination p aeruginosa is widely found in nature and easily cultured in the laboratory herzberg and elimelech 2007 herzberg and elimelech inoculated p aeruginosa bacteria into reverse osmosis filtration systems resulting in serious biological contamination and flux loss therefore in this experiment we used p aeruginosa for the extraction of eps once the p aeruginosa had been activated it was cultured in a 37 c incubator with lb nutrient medium for 24 h to obtain a concentration of 107 cfu ml we used the most common and efficient ultrasonic method to extract eps from the p aeruginosa liquid and defined the eps concentration according to the protein and polysaccharide content the protein concentration was determined using a bca kit tiangen china and the polysaccharide concentration was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method felz vermeulen van loosdrecht and lin 2019 the eps concentrations added were 1 mg l protein and 0 45 mg l polysaccharide we then added the diluted ha solution to the eps and made the doc concentration of the ha eps mixture consistent with that of the ha solution this ensured that the doc levels of the synthetic water were consistent and the organic fouling caused by the organic matter was consistent allowing for investigation of the mechanism of membrane biofouling the ph was adjusted to 7 5 with 0 1 mol l hcl and naoh the specific water quality characteristics are shown as table 3 2 5 measurement of pollutants in the cake layer 2 5 1 eps extraction once the membrane fibers had been used for 60 days we carefully scraped the external dirt cake layer off the surface of the membrane with a length of 0 2 m using a plastic sheet the removed cake layer was shaken in 1 l di water the supernatant was used to determine the eps concentration and the separated sludge was dried and weighed the eps concentration was then measured as described in section 2 4 2 5 2 confocal laser scanning microscopy images the cake layer formed on the membrane surface was also investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm lsm700 carl zeiss jena germany with a 20 objective lens the cake layer scraped from the membrane surface was stained using three biological dyes concanavalin a cona sigma st louis mo 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi molecular probes carlsbad ca and fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma st louis mo cona was used to stain carbohydrates and was detected by excitation at 561 nm dapi as a cell permeable nucleic acid stain could distinguish between eps and cells and was detected by excitation at 454 nm the proteins were stained by fitc and determined by excitation at 488 nm 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 turbidity uv254 and doc turbidity was measured using a turbidimeter 2100 n hach usa uv254 was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer ev300 thermo fisher usa doc concentration was measured using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany 2 6 2 membrane surface morphology and foulant layer components the structure of the biofilm cake layer was investigated using scanning electron microscopy sem regulus 8100 hitachi japan prior to measurement the samples were dried for 24 h in clean plastic bags at room temperature and sputter coated with a thin layer of gold nanoparticles the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir technique nexus870 thermo nicolet c usa was used to provide information on the functional groups of the foulants on the membrane 2 6 3 colloid size zeta potential and contact angle a dynamic light scattering measurement zetasizer nano zs90 malven instruments ltd uk was used to determine the size of the organic aggregates the zeta potential was measured using the tangential streaming potential method with a streaming potential analyzer delsa nano c solid surface beckman germany the zeta potential of the membrane surface was calculated by the measured streaming potential as described in our previous paper lin et al 2014 using the helmholtz smoluchowski equation with the fairbrother and mastin substitution sharma and hanumantha rao 2003 the zeta potential of the organic colloids was determined using a nanoparticle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malven instruments ltd uk contact angles were measured using the sessile drop method with a standard contact angle goniometer dsa100 kruss germany as described in our previous paper lin shen chen and zhang 2014b organic colloids were deposited onto a non porous ro membrane using a dead end membrane filtration system for a 24 h period after which the colloidal deposit on the ro membrane was allowed to dry for 1 h the contact angle measurement was performed on the colloidal deposit surface using the above sessile drop method 2 6 4 mechanical properties of the hollow fiber membrane the hollow fiber membrane was tested using an electronic single yarn strength tester model ym065cs 50 pc the membrane was clamped on both sides of the machine which then applied tension both ends of the membrane were slowly drawn to the sides at a fixed rate until the membrane was elongated and broken we recorded the tension exerted by the machine when the film broke and the increase in length of the membrane due to it being stretched 3 results and discussion 3 1 tmp in the two stages of filtration as shown in fig 2 the tmp showed an upward trend during ultrafiltration and membrane fouling the initial tmp variation of the two water samples was similar which may be related to the same influent doc concentration there was an inflection point in the process and the tmp changed at different rates before and after the inflection point before the inflection point the rate of change of tmp was slow and this can be considered as the early stage of filtration during this stage water penetrated the membrane modules and contaminants gradually accumulated on the membrane surface until a cake layer was formed this constituted the pollutants membrane micro interface and was formed from the interaction between the pollutants and membrane with increased filtration time the tmp inflection point occurred when the cake layer including the gel layer formed and the tmp changed at a higher rate the contaminants continued to accumulate and compressed onto the cake layer this stage is considered the late stage of filtration the change of micro interface in the two stages is shown in fig s1 the tmp inflection point in the ha eps system was observed on the 10th day and days 0 10 were considered the early stage of filtration the tmp increased from 20 3 kpa to 25 4 kpa and the average growth rate was 0 51 kpa d from days 10 24 the tmp increased from 25 4 kpa to 38 5 kpa and the growth rate was 0 94 kpa d in the ha system the tmp inflection point was observed on day 14 and the growth rates in the two stages were 0 23 kpa d and 0 65 kpa d respectively the tmp growth rate was high in the presence of eps which indicated that eps cause more serious membrane fouling compared to ha at the same doc concentration 3 2 interfacial forces in the two stages of filtration the tmp inflection point of was used as the indicator of the two filtration stages due to the complex properties of colloidal ha and eps the xdlvo theory was used to analyze the distribution and variation of interfacial forces in the two stages as the pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface during the filtration process the total interaction energy gtot per unit area changed as shown in fig 3 for convenience the initial value of gtot and the corresponding interfacial forces at the beginning of the experiment were taken to represent the interaction in the early stage of filtration and those at the point of inflection for ha due to the delay compared to the ha eps system were taken to represent the interaction at the late stage 3 2 1 interfacial forces in the early stage of filtration in the early stage of filtration the degree of membrane fouling was determined by the interaction between the organic pollutants and the membrane surface table 4 shows the contact angles of the virgin membrane ha and ha eps it can be seen that the water sample with ha eps was more hydrophobic than ha as shown in table 5 in the ha membrane and ha eps membrane systems the unit area interaction energy of the lw ab and the total interfacial forces was negative while el was positive according to the xdlvo theory the positive value of the interfacial force between the membrane and the colloid represents the resistance to membrane fouling which can alleviate membrane fouling while the negative value represents the attraction which will promote membrane fouling lin et al 2014 the ab energy and the negative absolute value of the total energy in ha eps were larger than that of ha indicating that the presence of eps could cause more serious membrane fouling the interfacial forces of the ha membrane and ha eps membrane systems at different distances and the percentage of each force obtained are shown in fig 4 regardless of whether eps was added to ha or not the total interfacial force was always negative within 1 nm indicating that organic matter was attracted to the membrane surface resulting in membrane fouling when the distance was 4 nm ab force accounted for the majority of the total interfacial force controlling the attraction between the organic colloids and the membrane surface to form the cake layer the total force was always negative indicating that the membrane was contaminated which was consistent with the continuous increase in tmp the total force change trend was coincident with the ab force ab force over a short distance was the main force affecting membrane fouling in the early stage of filtration in the ha eps system the short range ab forces increased from 4 89 nn to 12 59 nn at 1 nm and had little influence on the long range el and lw forces therefore due to the presence of eps the interfacial forces between the pollutants and membrane increased this could be because the eps were negatively charged containing macromolecular proteins polysaccharides and other substances after the addition of eps the contact angles of the mixture increased indicating that ha eps contained more hydrophobic pollutants ha had a strong adsorption chelation ability and the protein in eps had a micro flocculation ability which enabled ha and eps to adsorb to each other and form larger particles the particle size in the feed water increased from 295 4 nm to 354 6 nm the larger particle size and more hydrophobic organics in the ha eps resulted in greater ab forces at the ha eps membrane interface and quicker adsorption of pollutants to the membrane surface resulting in more serious membrane fouling therefore in order to alleviate membrane fouling in the early stages of filtration it was necessary to change the nature of the influent organic matter improve the hydrophilicity reduce the ab force between the pollutants and the membrane and thereby reduce the total force to alleviate membrane fouling 3 2 2 interfacial forces between pollutants and the cake layer in the late filtration stage organic pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface to form a cake layer onto which organic pollutants in the water then adhered therefore in the late stage of filtration the degree of membrane fouling can be calculated and analyzed by the interaction between the pollutants and the cake layer as shown in table 6 in the late stage of filtration in the ha cake layer and ha eps cake layer systems the lw ab and total interfacial forces were still negative while el was positive the absolute value of the interaction energy of ha eps was greater than that of ha compared to the early stage of filtration there was an increase in the absolute value of action energy for both ha and ha eps indicating that the formation of a cake layer aggravated membrane fouling which was consistent with the increased rate of tmp following the inflection point fig 5 shows the interfacial forces of the ha cake layer and the ha eps cake layer and the percentage of each force during the late stage of filtration the positive and negative forces were consistent with those of the early stage and the ab forces were still dominant compared with the early stage of filtration at the remote distance 10 nm the el forces were reduced and the long distance lw dominated at the interface this is because after the formation of the cake layer on the membrane surface the organic matter deposited on the membrane surface increased the zeta potential on the membrane surface the negative absolute value of the membrane zeta potential resulted in stronger electrostatic double layer repulsion therefore the resistance to fouling by the negatively charged solute was greater thus during the late stage of filtration the electrostatic repulsion decreases and the proportion of el force decreased and the proportion of lw increased resulting in a faster rate of membrane fouling due to the long distance force in the early filtration stage the increase of ab forces from 4 89 nn to 12 59 nn at 1 nm was 7 7 nn while at the later filtration stage the increase from 9 33 nn to 21 45 nn was 12 02 nn this indicated that the eps had a greater influence on the ab forces in the late stage of filtration this could be due to the presence of eps in the cake layer favoring bonding with organic colloids thereby increasing the cohesion and adhesion between the organic matter and the cake layer ding tian li zuo and zhang 2015 therefore in order to alleviate membrane fouling in the late stage of filtration besides improving the hydrophilicity of the influent organic matter it is necessary to reduce the accumulation of eps on the membrane by controlling the growth of microorganisms attached to the membrane or cake layer 3 3 the role of eps in membrane fouling fig 6 shows the change in ab forces at 1 nm and lw and el forces at 10 nm under different systems during the two filtration stages it can be concluded that the role of eps in membrane fouling is that at the beginning of the filtration process they bond with organic colloids thereby increasing the size of the pollutants and the proportions of hydrophobic fractions leading to an increase in the ab forces between the pollutants and the membrane and increasing the speed of cake layer formation on the membrane surface in the late stage of the filtration process eps have attached to the cake layer thereby increasing both the ab forces in the short distance and the lw forces in the long distance between the influent pollutants and the cake layer more eps attached to the membrane result in significantly increased ab and lw forces compared to the early filtration stage with increased membrane fouling sweity et al 2011 this indicates that eps attached to the membrane have a greater impact on membrane fouling than those present in the influent water kim et al 2006 table 7 shows the role of eps on membrane resistance in the two filtration stages in the early stage when eps were present the membrane resistance increased rrev increased which was consistent with the above discussion on the interfacial forces rirr was also affected indicating that eps caused internal pore constriction and pore sealing but the contribution to the resistance of the cake layer was greater which may be because eps accelerated the formation of the cake layer in the late stage rirr increased significantly after the cake layer was formed more eps blocked the pores causing more serious membrane fouling 3 4 method for alleviating membrane fouling we used pre ozonation integrated with h2o2 backwashing to alleviate membrane fouling in this experiment the ozone doses investigated were 0 1 mg l 0 2 mg l 0 4 mg l and 0 6 mg l table s3 shows the contact angles and residual ozone concentrations with varying ozone doses ozonation can change the features of organic matter wang et al 2017 oxidizing macromolecular and hydrophobic organic matter into small molecular and hydrophilic organic matter zhang et al 2017 thus reducing the angle of contact of the organic colloids and relieving membrane fouling bai et al 2020 at an o3 dosage of 0 6 mg l a residual ozone concentration was recorded which could have an adverse effect on membrane materials therefore an o3 dosage of 0 4 mg l was selected for pre ozonation h2o2 concentrations of 2 mg l 5 mg l 8 mg l and 10 mg l were selected to mitigate membrane fouling by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms to reduce the production of eps the tmp p1 of pure water in the ultrafiltration system at 240 min was selected as the evaluation index to determine the optimal dosage of h2o2 table s4 shows that different concentrations of h2o2 have different effects on reducing p1 and alleviating membrane fouling with increasing h2o2 concentration there was a gradual reduction in p1 there was not much difference in p1 and membrane fouling at h2o2 concentrations of 8 mg l and 10 mg l therefore from an economic perspective 8 mg l was determined to be the optimal h2o2 dosage table s5 shows that o3 uf h2o2 can guarantee the water quality of the membrane effluent making the process feasible for large scale application 3 5 effect of alleviating membrane fouling 3 5 1 tmp development as shown in fig 7 when filtering directly tmp reached 48 kpa in 30 days at which point chemical cleaning of the membrane was required prior to the next filtration process by implementing 8 mg l h2o2 backwashing growth rate and tmp slowed down and chemical cleaning was needed at day 40 by adding 0 4 mg l ozone the tmp was significantly reduced and then increased from 14 kpa to 48 kp over 47 days i e the chemical cleaning process was delayed by 17 days addition of 8 mg l h2o2 allowed the tmp to stabilize below 20 kpa within 60 days this shows that pretreatment with ozone and intermittent addition of h2o2 was effective at reducing membrane fouling this could be because addition of the h2o2 inhibited bacterial growth on the membrane thus decreasing secretion of eps and their accumulation the membrane can intercept macromolecular organic matter to form the cake layer where the pollutants can easily be washed off thus mitigating membrane fouling 3 5 2 variation of functional groups on the membrane surface as shown in fig 8 the virgin membrane showed characteristics of pvdf i e the membrane material the 2848 cm 1 and 2917 cm 1 wavelength positions represented the ch bond the 1726 cm 1 and 1071 cm 1 wavelength positions represented the c o and cn bonds respectively the peak intensity at 1401cm 1 and 1174 cm 1 increased indicating the existence of a signal of the c f bond most of the absorption band was sharp indicated a virgin membrane the characteristic pvdf polymer material was still observed on the contaminated membrane but the characteristic peak strength was significantly reduced as the pollutants on the membrane surface weakened the reflection of the characteristic peak following direct filtration the membrane featured new peaks representing the organic pollutants the 3000 3500 cm 1 wavelength range represented the nh and oh bonds suggesting that the membrane surface pollutants contained amino acid and protein like groups ch signals were detected at a wavelength of 2930 cm 1 indicating the presence of fatty groups on the membrane surface organic pollutants on the membrane surface at the 1025 cm 1 wavelength indicated carbohydrates which may be related to smps alkanes were observed at a wavelength of 1438 cm 1 wavelength and the peak intensity was stronger at the wavelength of 1724 cm 1 indicating that the pollutants may have included natural organic pollutants such as fulvic acid by using h2o2 backwashing the peak at 3791 cm 1 was weakened it showed that adding h2o2 reduced the biofouling caused by eps but the mitigation of organic fouling was not obvious after adding ozone the peak strength of each pollutant was reduced indicating that following pre ozonation the organic pollutants on the membrane surface decreased which was consistent with the previous conclusion due to the ozonation the signal of the co bond at the 1250 cm 1 wavelength was stronger which meant the hydrophilic functional groups in the organic pollutants on the membrane surface increased at the 3791 cm 1 wavelength the peak was more enhanced than with the virgin membrane which may be the polysaccharide peak this indicated that some eps still accumulated on the membrane surface after the addition of ozone following addition of h2o2 the peaks detected on the membrane surface were similar to those of the virgin membranes in particular the peaks at wavelengths 3791cm 1 representing polysaccharides and 3000 3500cm 1 representing proteins were greatly reduced indicating that after the dual effects of o3 and h2o2 even during the late stage accumulation of eps on the membrane had also been controlled and membrane fouling had been greatly alleviated 3 5 3 variation of the cake layer after 60 days of operation under different conditions contamination of the membrane surface was characterized using sem as shown in fig 9 the clean membrane fig 9a had a smooth surface distributed with some fine membrane holes following direct filtration of ubacf fig 9b the membrane surface was rough and uneven which may have been due to the adhesion of organic matter to the membrane and reproduction of bacteria the cake layer deposited on the membrane surface was dense rough and thick with a large amount of suspended materials and organic pollutants such that the membrane holes could not be seen membrane fouling was severe within the red circle in fig 9 there were some elliptical objects of 1 μm in size which were thought to be bacteria this proved that the presence of bacteria in the water caused a certain amount of fouling to the membrane and a decrease in tmp after using h2o2 backwashing fig 9c the number of bacteria was significantly reduced but there was still a large amount of organic pollutants accumulated on the surface of the membrane comparison with sem of the membrane following ozone addition fig 9d we observed that the pollutants were significantly reduced the membrane surface was relatively flat and the cake layer was relatively loose however there were still more pollutants and microorganisms on the membrane surface than after the addition of h2o2 fig 9e here the membrane surface was smoother had fewer pollutants and an average distribution state there was no obvious presence of bacteria in the cake layer this indicates that adding h2o2 for backwashing can effectively relieve membrane fouling in the long term operation of the membrane the concentration of proteins and polysaccharides in the cake layer and the weight of the cake layer are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the largest cake layer 15 9 0 4 g m2 formed by direct ultrafiltration contained the highest levels of protein and polysaccharide 0 95 0 05 mg g and 0 31 0 03 mg g while the concentration of both in the cake layer of membrane subjected to o3 h2o2 was significantly reduced indicating the reduced accumulation of eps on the membrane clsm images of the cake layer on the membrane surface are shown in fig 11 red fluorescence occurs when dapi is conjugated with dna green fluorescence occurs when fitc is conjugated with protein and blue fluorescence when cona is conjugated with polysaccharide wu lee waite and guan 2002 as shown in fig 11 the ratio of protein to polysaccharide was similar throughout without any treatment a biofilm formed on the membrane surface and the concentrations of microorganisms protein and polysaccharide were highest with the addition of o3 the concentration of microorganisms decreased in the presence of h2o2 that is there were fewer eps on the membrane surface but using o3 or h2o2 alone there were still more eps and microorganisms accumulated on the membrane surface this showed that the combined process of o3 and h2o2 was effective and necessary for alleviating membrane fouling 3 5 4 variation of interfacial forces according to the change in tmp using the 10th day to represent the early stage of filtration and the 47th day to represent the late stage we calculated the interaction energy and interfacial forces for both stages under different operating conditions the variation in interfacial forces under different operating conditions is shown in table 8 the ab force was calculated at 1 nm and the lw and el forces at 10 nm it can be seen that in the late stages of filtration the interaction energy and forces were greater than in the early stage when h2o2 backwashing was used the interaction energy and interfacial forces in the late stage were more reduced when ozonation was added as a pretreatment the interaction energy and interfacial forces were reduced but the effect was no longer obvious in the late stage when pre ozonation was combined with h2o2 backwashing the interaction energy and ab and lw forces were the lowest in both the early and late stages of filtration this also verified that when the minimum amount of eps accumulated on the membrane the force between the pollutants and the degree of membrane fouling was lowest 3 6 impact of h2o2 on membrane material following long term filtration although pvdf generally has good resistance to oxidants the presence of impurities or other materials in the commercial pvdf membrane may be sensitive to h2o2 yu graham and liu 2019 therefore it was important to detect the physical and chemical properties of the membrane after long term operation 180 days it can be seen from table 9 that following long term operation with residual ozone the tensile properties of the pvdf membrane deteriorated and the physical properties changed however there was no detectable difference in the tensile properties of the membrane with h2o2 indicating that the physical properties of the membrane had not changed the surface functional groups were examined using fitr as shown in fig 12 the characteristic peak of the pvdf membrane did not change at the same time the contact angle of the membrane was between the virgin membrane and the o3 uf membrane which was normal therefore h2o2 did not change the chemical structure of the membrane 4 conclusion eps resulted in serious membrane fouling during ultrafiltration of ubac effluent eps increased the ab and lw forces between pollutants and the membrane and the time taken for a cake layer to form was reduced due to the biofouling caused by the eps to control membrane biofouling the amount of eps must be reduced in the early stage to slow down the formation of a cake layer and control its accumulation on the membrane in the late stage to reduce the ab and lw forces pre ozonation changed the characteristics of the organic components reduced the contact angle of the organic matter and reduced the ab forces between the organic matter and the membrane however if only o3 at a dose of 0 4 mg l was used prior to ultrafiltration some bacteria still flowed into the membrane tank this could result in the growth of microorganisms on the membrane surface and the secretion of eps in the late stage of filtration causing biofouling the h2o2 backwashing could inhibit the growth of microorganisms change the nature of the pollutants accumulated on the membrane and control the speed of formation of the cake layer it could effectively control membrane fouling caused by eps however if only h2o2 backwashing was used membrane organic fouling cannot be effectively alleviated and some bacteria still exist due to the low oxidation of h2o2 moreover the addition of 8 mg l h2o2 in the backwash water did not damage or deteriorate the pvdf membrane therefore o3 uf h2o2 for alleviating membrane fouling was feasible for

17568,biofouling is a key problem in membrane filtration and extracellular polymer substances eps play a key role in biofouling biofouling contributes to membrane fouling during ultrafiltration of up flow biological activated carbon filter ubacf effluent eps are released when pollutants get attached with membrane surface and when pollutants are in solution phase from cell lysis and by cell secretions in our study of eps humic acid ha prepared as the effluent pollutants for ultrafiltration we found that eps increased the interfacial forces between the pollutants and the membrane resulting in membrane fouling in the early stages of filtration the main contribution of eps to membrane fouling was to bond with organic colloids which led to an increase in the pollutant particle size and zeta potential this increased the short range lewis acid base ab forces from 4 89 nn to 12 59 nn and accelerated the formation of a cake layer in the late stage of filtration the eps increased both the ab and london van der waals lw forces thus accelerating membrane fouling in order to mitigate biofouling we developed a method of pretreating the effluent with 0 4 mg l ozone prior to ultrafiltration and backwashing with 8 mg l h2o2 to sterilize bacteria attached to the membrane surface this method not only changed the characteristics of the eps but also inactivated bacteria by disinfection with h2o2 thereby reducing the amount of eps the proposed method provided a long term stable operation guarantee for ultrafiltration of ubacf effluent graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eps o3 h2o2 ultrafiltration membrane biofouling ubacf effluent xdlvo 1 introduction under conditions of continuously deteriorating raw water quality in order for drinking water to meet water quality standards advanced treatment processes are required teodosiu gilca barjoveanu and fiore 2018 ozone integrated with biological activated carbon o3 bac is a typical advanced treatment process used to improve water quality hong hongliang nanxiang and jun 2020 shu and zhang 2008 at present the bac process includes the down flow bac filter dbacf and the up flow bac filter ubacf the dbacf is located after sand filtration and has been widely used at water treatment plants in china liao et al 2013 however it has been found that there is uneven distribution of microorganisms higher water head loss and potential risk due to biological leakage hong xian chun nan xiang and hong bin 2018 in order to resolve these issues a new process is recently developed in which the ubacf is located between the sedimentation tank and the sand filter increased removal of natural organic matter nom has been recorded with the ubacf compared to the dbacf han et al 2013 however the effluent had increased turbidity and more bacteria were present compared to the dbacf ao liu zhang and wang 2018 therefore a process is required following ubacf to ensure drinking water safety ultrafiltration uf a typical low pressure membrane filtration technology has been widely used to treat drinking water boleda galceran and ventura 2011 and to remove particles and bacteria geismar bérubé and barbeau 2012 therefore ubacf effluent can be treated with ultrafiltration to ensure turbidity and biological safety unfortunately membrane fouling has restricted the large scale application of membrane technology shi tal hankins and gitis 2014 based on the type of pollutants membrane fouling can be categorized into organic fouling xiao xiao wang qin and he 2012 inorganic fouling ma et al 2018 and biofouling shao et al 2018 biofouling plays an important role in the contribution to membrane fouling when ultrafiltration is used to treat the ubacf effluent due to the presence of bacteria which release extracellular polymer substances eps resulting in biofouling previous studies have shown that eps are the main pollutants in biofouling yu zhang and graham 2017 eps are biopolymers secreted by microorganisms which form the structural substrates of biopolymers adav and lee 2008 excess eps are presented in a soluble form soluble microbial products smp and are loosely bound to biomass all of which becomes part of the biocontamination layer on the membrane surface chang lee and lee 2019 however there are few studies that report on the mechanism of membrane biofouling and in particular on the contribution of eps during the process of ultrafiltration combined with ubacf like eps ubacf effluent also contains nom and membrane fouling is caused by the interaction of nom and eps however the mechanism of this interaction is not clear previous studies have used polysaccharides and proteins to simulate eps ye le clech chen fane and jefferson 2005 or smp wang wang zhu mei and wu 2013 but no study to our knowledge has directly extracted eps and studied the mechanism of membrane fouling from the perspective of the interaction between eps and nom quantitative research on the contribution of biofouling to total membrane fouling is still scarce this paper investigated eps as a whole and studied the interfacial forces between eps and membrane according to the change of interfacial forces a quantitative analysis was made on the contribution of eps to membrane fouling at different interfaces several pretreatment processes have been proposed to alleviate membrane fouling such as coagulation oxidation yu graham and fowler 2016 and adsorption wang et al 2016 these processes remove some components or change the properties of the feed water thus affecting the interaction between the feed pollutants and the membrane among them chemical oxidation is widely used due to its effect on the change of the chemical structure and valence state of organic inorganic pollutants the inactivation of microorganisms and the partial mineralization of organic substances li et al 2019 however with strong oxidants such as ozone o3 in situ dosing at certain concentration levels may gradually lead to membrane damage or deterioration li et al 2019 it was previously reported that o3 may interact with intrinsic membrane materials during the ultrafiltration process to narrow the membrane pore size zhang lin and chen 2017 therefore a method to attain a better effect on both the mitigation of membrane fouling and reducing the negative influence on membrane materials was required in this study we investigated an innovative approach of o3 pretreatment to control membrane fouling followed by h2o2 backwashing ozonation changed the characteristics of the organics in the feed water to mitigate organic fouling on the condition that there was no residual o3 in membrane tank to avoid the negative influence on membrane materials due to oxidation h2o2 with low oxidation capacity but good sterilization was used to mitigate biofouling due to the inhibition of microorganism growth on membrane surface thereby reducing the formation of metabolites such as eps we used the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory to elucidate the mechanism of membrane fouling chen tian cao zhang and li 2012 wang et al 2013 lin et al 2014 and in particular the influence and contribution of eps we also discuss whether adding h2o2 backwashing after pre ozonation during ultrafiltration of ubacf is an effective way to alleviate membrane fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1

of pure water rrev is the difference between r1 and r2 and the rirr is the difference between r2 and rm 2 2 membrane hollow fiber ultrafiltration membranes made of pvdf were provided by the litree purifying technology co ltd suzhou china the membrane had a molecular weight cut off mwco of 50 000 da and an effective surface area of 0 0125 m2 the effective length of the membrane was 0 2 m arranged as a single length pure water permeate flux was measured at 20 kpa detailed characteristics of the membrane module are summarized in table 1 2 3 ultrafiltration experiments the two bench scale ultrafiltration systems are shown schematically in fig 1 prior to the experiment virgin membranes were soaked in pure water overnight to achieve a stable permeate flux in the ubacf effluent experiment as shown in fig 1 a the ubacf effluent was exposed to a range of ozone doses 0 0 5 mg l in a closed ozone contact column the contact time was 5 min the ozone generated by a generator was introduced at the desired dose by the potassium iodide thiosulfate titration method the ultrafiltration membrane system was operated in a cycle of 60 min filtration 25 lm 2 h 1 and 90 s backwash 50 l m 2 h 1 filtered water a certain amount of h2o2 0 10 mg l was pumped into the membrane tank through the backwash pump during the first 60 s backwash period after adding the h2o2 the filtered water was pumped into the membrane tank during the last 30 s backwash the concentration of h2o2 was determined by the kmno4 method wang et al 2018 in the synthetic water experiment as shown in fig 1 b the ultrafiltration membrane system was operated according to the same cycle and backwash process tmp was measured by a pressure gauge htp 1 ej3c58 huatian instrument china and a paperless data logger htp 200d huatian instrument china connected to the pressure gauge and recorded the tmp data every 10 s during the experiment according to the liquid flow meter lzb 3 yuyao china the constant flux operating conditions were controlled by adjusting the speed of the peristaltic pump bt 100 2 j yz1515x longer pump china when the tmp increased to 55 kpa the chemical cleaning process was carried out as follows the fouled membrane was removed from the membrane tank and soaked in 50 mg l naoh solution for 3 h then backwashed in 10 mg l naoh solution for 10 min and finally backwashed with filtered water for 10 min 2 4 feed water all chemicals used were analytical reagents with a purity 99 unless stated otherwise for the ubacf effluent experiment the effluent was collected from a drinking water treatment plant located in nanjing the water quality of the ubacf effluent and filtered water are shown in table 2 indicating that the turbidity and the number of bacteria were significantly reduced by ultrafiltration it can be speculated that the pollutants including the bacteria would be retained on the membrane resulting in membrane fouling in particular biofouling during the direct filtration process the water temperature ranged from 23 to 25 c during the experiment as biofouling of the membrane occurred during ultrafiltration in the laboratory we used synthetic water containing nom eps and divalent ions consistent with ubacf effluent as the feed water to study the mechanism of biofouling in a general way humic substances generate a more important fouling than fulvic acids schäfer schwicker fischer fane and waite 2000 aoustin schäfer fane and waite 2001 and our previous studies had also shown this lin et al 2014 in the appendix we have also provided information on the hydrophilic organic fulvic acid fa the experimental trend of membrane fouling was consistent with that of hydrophobic organics table s2 therefore in this study we mainly used hydrophobic organics represented by humic acid ha to demonstrate the mechanism of membrane fouling the synthetic water was prepared as follows humic acid solution humic acid ha with a purity of 98 was provided by sigma aldrich usa the reserve ha 1 g l solution was prepared as follows we dissolved 1 g ha in a 100 mm naoh solution to ensure complete dissolution the solution was then diluted to 1 l with deionized di water particles and insolubles in the ha were removed by a microfiltration membrane of 0 45 μm the ha reserve solution was stored at 4 c before each filtration experiment a fresh ha solution was prepared at ph 7 5 and dissolved organic carbon doc concentration of 2 5 mg l to simulate the ubacf effluent ha eps mixture as eps are secreted by microorganisms it is not possible to directly select the pharmaceutical configuration therefore in the laboratory scale trial we used a method to extract eps from the bacterial liquid bacteria such as salmonella wang et al 2018 and pseudomonas aeruginosa are responsible for membrane biocontamination p aeruginosa is widely found in nature and easily cultured in the laboratory herzberg and elimelech 2007 herzberg and elimelech inoculated p aeruginosa bacteria into reverse osmosis filtration systems resulting in serious biological contamination and flux loss therefore in this experiment we used p aeruginosa for the extraction of eps once the p aeruginosa had been activated it was cultured in a 37 c incubator with lb nutrient medium for 24 h to obtain a concentration of 107 cfu ml we used the most common and efficient ultrasonic method to extract eps from the p aeruginosa liquid and defined the eps concentration according to the protein and polysaccharide content the protein concentration was determined using a bca kit tiangen china and the polysaccharide concentration was measured using the phenol sulfuric acid method felz vermeulen van loosdrecht and lin 2019 the eps concentrations added were 1 mg l protein and 0 45 mg l polysaccharide we then added the diluted ha solution to the eps and made the doc concentration of the ha eps mixture consistent with that of the ha solution this ensured that the doc levels of the synthetic water were consistent and the organic fouling caused by the organic matter was consistent allowing for investigation of the mechanism of membrane biofouling the ph was adjusted to 7 5 with 0 1 mol l hcl and naoh the specific water quality characteristics are shown as table 3 2 5 measurement of pollutants in the cake layer 2 5 1 eps extraction once the membrane fibers had been used for 60 days we carefully scraped the external dirt cake layer off the surface of the membrane with a length of 0 2 m using a plastic sheet the removed cake layer was shaken in 1 l di water the supernatant was used to determine the eps concentration and the separated sludge was dried and weighed the eps concentration was then measured as described in section 2 4 2 5 2 confocal laser scanning microscopy images the cake layer formed on the membrane surface was also investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm lsm700 carl zeiss jena germany with a 20 objective lens the cake layer scraped from the membrane surface was stained using three biological dyes concanavalin a cona sigma st louis mo 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dapi molecular probes carlsbad ca and fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc sigma st louis mo cona was used to stain carbohydrates and was detected by excitation at 561 nm dapi as a cell permeable nucleic acid stain could distinguish between eps and cells and was detected by excitation at 454 nm the proteins were stained by fitc and determined by excitation at 488 nm 2 6 analytical methods 2 6 1 turbidity uv254 and doc turbidity was measured using a turbidimeter 2100 n hach usa uv254 was measured using a uv visible spectrophotometer ev300 thermo fisher usa doc concentration was measured using a toc analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany 2 6 2 membrane surface morphology and foulant layer components the structure of the biofilm cake layer was investigated using scanning electron microscopy sem regulus 8100 hitachi japan prior to measurement the samples were dried for 24 h in clean plastic bags at room temperature and sputter coated with a thin layer of gold nanoparticles the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir technique nexus870 thermo nicolet c usa was used to provide information on the functional groups of the foulants on the membrane 2 6 3 colloid size zeta potential and contact angle a dynamic light scattering measurement zetasizer nano zs90 malven instruments ltd uk was used to determine the size of the organic aggregates the zeta potential was measured using the tangential streaming potential method with a streaming potential analyzer delsa nano c solid surface beckman germany the zeta potential of the membrane surface was calculated by the measured streaming potential as described in our previous paper lin et al 2014 using the helmholtz smoluchowski equation with the fairbrother and mastin substitution sharma and hanumantha rao 2003 the zeta potential of the organic colloids was determined using a nanoparticle size analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malven instruments ltd uk contact angles were measured using the sessile drop method with a standard contact angle goniometer dsa100 kruss germany as described in our previous paper lin shen chen and zhang 2014b organic colloids were deposited onto a non porous ro membrane using a dead end membrane filtration system for a 24 h period after which the colloidal deposit on the ro membrane was allowed to dry for 1 h the contact angle measurement was performed on the colloidal deposit surface using the above sessile drop method 2 6 4 mechanical properties of the hollow fiber membrane the hollow fiber membrane was tested using an electronic single yarn strength tester model ym065cs 50 pc the membrane was clamped on both sides of the machine which then applied tension both ends of the membrane were slowly drawn to the sides at a fixed rate until the membrane was elongated and broken we recorded the tension exerted by the machine when the film broke and the increase in length of the membrane due to it being stretched 3 results and discussion 3 1 tmp in the two stages of filtration as shown in fig 2 the tmp showed an upward trend during ultrafiltration and membrane fouling the initial tmp variation of the two water samples was similar which may be related to the same influent doc concentration there was an inflection point in the process and the tmp changed at different rates before and after the inflection point before the inflection point the rate of change of tmp was slow and this can be considered as the early stage of filtration during this stage water penetrated the membrane modules and contaminants gradually accumulated on the membrane surface until a cake layer was formed this constituted the pollutants membrane micro interface and was formed from the interaction between the pollutants and membrane with increased filtration time the tmp inflection point occurred when the cake layer including the gel layer formed and the tmp changed at a higher rate the contaminants continued to accumulate and compressed onto the cake layer this stage is considered the late stage of filtration the change of micro interface in the two stages is shown in fig s1 the tmp inflection point in the ha eps system was observed on the 10th day and days 0 10 were considered the early stage of filtration the tmp increased from 20 3 kpa to 25 4 kpa and the average growth rate was 0 51 kpa d from days 10 24 the tmp increased from 25 4 kpa to 38 5 kpa and the growth rate was 0 94 kpa d in the ha system the tmp inflection point was observed on day 14 and the growth rates in the two stages were 0 23 kpa d and 0 65 kpa d respectively the tmp growth rate was high in the presence of eps which indicated that eps cause more serious membrane fouling compared to ha at the same doc concentration 3 2 interfacial forces in the two stages of filtration the tmp inflection point of was used as the indicator of the two filtration stages due to the complex properties of colloidal ha and eps the xdlvo theory was used to analyze the distribution and variation of interfacial forces in the two stages as the pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface during the filtration process the total interaction energy gtot per unit area changed as shown in fig 3 for convenience the initial value of gtot and the corresponding interfacial forces at the beginning of the experiment were taken to represent the interaction in the early stage of filtration and those at the point of inflection for ha due to the delay compared to the ha eps system were taken to represent the interaction at the late stage 3 2 1 interfacial forces in the early stage of filtration in the early stage of filtration the degree of membrane fouling was determined by the interaction between the organic pollutants and the membrane surface table 4 shows the contact angles of the virgin membrane ha and ha eps it can be seen that the water sample with ha eps was more hydrophobic than ha as shown in table 5 in the ha membrane and ha eps membrane systems the unit area interaction energy of the lw ab and the total interfacial forces was negative while el was positive according to the xdlvo theory the positive value of the interfacial force between the membrane and the colloid represents the resistance to membrane fouling which can alleviate membrane fouling while the negative value represents the attraction which will promote membrane fouling lin et al 2014 the ab energy and the negative absolute value of the total energy in ha eps were larger than that of ha indicating that the presence of eps could cause more serious membrane fouling the interfacial forces of the ha membrane and ha eps membrane systems at different distances and the percentage of each force obtained are shown in fig 4 regardless of whether eps was added to ha or not the total interfacial force was always negative within 1 nm indicating that organic matter was attracted to the membrane surface resulting in membrane fouling when the distance was 4 nm ab force accounted for the majority of the total interfacial force controlling the attraction between the organic colloids and the membrane surface to form the cake layer the total force was always negative indicating that the membrane was contaminated which was consistent with the continuous increase in tmp the total force change trend was coincident with the ab force ab force over a short distance was the main force affecting membrane fouling in the early stage of filtration in the ha eps system the short range ab forces increased from 4 89 nn to 12 59 nn at 1 nm and had little influence on the long range el and lw forces therefore due to the presence of eps the interfacial forces between the pollutants and membrane increased this could be because the eps were negatively charged containing macromolecular proteins polysaccharides and other substances after the addition of eps the contact angles of the mixture increased indicating that ha eps contained more hydrophobic pollutants ha had a strong adsorption chelation ability and the protein in eps had a micro flocculation ability which enabled ha and eps to adsorb to each other and form larger particles the particle size in the feed water increased from 295 4 nm to 354 6 nm the larger particle size and more hydrophobic organics in the ha eps resulted in greater ab forces at the ha eps membrane interface and quicker adsorption of pollutants to the membrane surface resulting in more serious membrane fouling therefore in order to alleviate membrane fouling in the early stages of filtration it was necessary to change the nature of the influent organic matter improve the hydrophilicity reduce the ab force between the pollutants and the membrane and thereby reduce the total force to alleviate membrane fouling 3 2 2 interfacial forces between pollutants and the cake layer in the late filtration stage organic pollutants accumulated on the membrane surface to form a cake layer onto which organic pollutants in the water then adhered therefore in the late stage of filtration the degree of membrane fouling can be calculated and analyzed by the interaction between the pollutants and the cake layer as shown in table 6 in the late stage of filtration in the ha cake layer and ha eps cake layer systems the lw ab and total interfacial forces were still negative while el was positive the absolute value of the interaction energy of ha eps was greater than that of ha compared to the early stage of filtration there was an increase in the absolute value of action energy for both ha and ha eps indicating that the formation of a cake layer aggravated membrane fouling which was consistent with the increased rate of tmp following the inflection point fig 5 shows the interfacial forces of the ha cake layer and the ha eps cake layer and the percentage of each force during the late stage of filtration the positive and negative forces were consistent with those of the early stage and the ab forces were still dominant compared with the early stage of filtration at the remote distance 10 nm the el forces were reduced and the long distance lw dominated at the interface this is because after the formation of the cake layer on the membrane surface the organic matter deposited on the membrane surface increased the zeta potential on the membrane surface the negative absolute value of the membrane zeta potential resulted in stronger electrostatic double layer repulsion therefore the resistance to fouling by the negatively charged solute was greater thus during the late stage of filtration the electrostatic repulsion decreases and the proportion of el force decreased and the proportion of lw increased resulting in a faster rate of membrane fouling due to the long distance force in the early filtration stage the increase of ab forces from 4 89 nn to 12 59 nn at 1 nm was 7 7 nn while at the later filtration stage the increase from 9 33 nn to 21 45 nn was 12 02 nn this indicated that the eps had a greater influence on the ab forces in the late stage of filtration this could be due to the presence of eps in the cake layer favoring bonding with organic colloids thereby increasing the cohesion and adhesion between the organic matter and the cake layer ding tian li zuo and zhang 2015 therefore in order to alleviate membrane fouling in the late stage of filtration besides improving the hydrophilicity of the influent organic matter it is necessary to reduce the accumulation of eps on the membrane by controlling the growth of microorganisms attached to the membrane or cake layer 3 3 the role of eps in membrane fouling fig 6 shows the change in ab forces at 1 nm and lw and el forces at 10 nm under different systems during the two filtration stages it can be concluded that the role of eps in membrane fouling is that at the beginning of the filtration process they bond with organic colloids thereby increasing the size of the pollutants and the proportions of hydrophobic fractions leading to an increase in the ab forces between the pollutants and the membrane and increasing the speed of cake layer formation on the membrane surface in the late stage of the filtration process eps have attached to the cake layer thereby increasing both the ab forces in the short distance and the lw forces in the long distance between the influent pollutants and the cake layer more eps attached to the membrane result in significantly increased ab and lw forces compared to the early filtration stage with increased membrane fouling sweity et al 2011 this indicates that eps attached to the membrane have a greater impact on membrane fouling than those present in the influent water kim et al 2006 table 7 shows the role of eps on membrane resistance in the two filtration stages in the early stage when eps were present the membrane resistance increased rrev increased which was consistent with the above discussion on the interfacial forces rirr was also affected indicating that eps caused internal pore constriction and pore sealing but the contribution to the resistance of the cake layer was greater which may be because eps accelerated the formation of the cake layer in the late stage rirr increased significantly after the cake layer was formed more eps blocked the pores causing more serious membrane fouling 3 4 method for alleviating membrane fouling we used pre ozonation integrated with h2o2 backwashing to alleviate membrane fouling in this experiment the ozone doses investigated were 0 1 mg l 0 2 mg l 0 4 mg l and 0 6 mg l table s3 shows the contact angles and residual ozone concentrations with varying ozone doses ozonation can change the features of organic matter wang et al 2017 oxidizing macromolecular and hydrophobic organic matter into small molecular and hydrophilic organic matter zhang et al 2017 thus reducing the angle of contact of the organic colloids and relieving membrane fouling bai et al 2020 at an o3 dosage of 0 6 mg l a residual ozone concentration was recorded which could have an adverse effect on membrane materials therefore an o3 dosage of 0 4 mg l was selected for pre ozonation h2o2 concentrations of 2 mg l 5 mg l 8 mg l and 10 mg l were selected to mitigate membrane fouling by inhibiting the growth of microorganisms to reduce the production of eps the tmp p1 of pure water in the ultrafiltration system at 240 min was selected as the evaluation index to determine the optimal dosage of h2o2 table s4 shows that different concentrations of h2o2 have different effects on reducing p1 and alleviating membrane fouling with increasing h2o2 concentration there was a gradual reduction in p1 there was not much difference in p1 and membrane fouling at h2o2 concentrations of 8 mg l and 10 mg l therefore from an economic perspective 8 mg l was determined to be the optimal h2o2 dosage table s5 shows that o3 uf h2o2 can guarantee the water quality of the membrane effluent making the process feasible for large scale application 3 5 effect of alleviating membrane fouling 3 5 1 tmp development as shown in fig 7 when filtering directly tmp reached 48 kpa in 30 days at which point chemical cleaning of the membrane was required prior to the next filtration process by implementing 8 mg l h2o2 backwashing growth rate and tmp slowed down and chemical cleaning was needed at day 40 by adding 0 4 mg l ozone the tmp was significantly reduced and then increased from 14 kpa to 48 kp over 47 days i e the chemical cleaning process was delayed by 17 days addition of 8 mg l h2o2 allowed the tmp to stabilize below 20 kpa within 60 days this shows that pretreatment with ozone and intermittent addition of h2o2 was effective at reducing membrane fouling this could be because addition of the h2o2 inhibited bacterial growth on the membrane thus decreasing secretion of eps and their accumulation the membrane can intercept macromolecular organic matter to form the cake layer where the pollutants can easily be washed off thus mitigating membrane fouling 3 5 2 variation of functional groups on the membrane surface as shown in fig 8 the virgin membrane showed characteristics of pvdf i e the membrane material the 2848 cm 1 and 2917 cm 1 wavelength positions represented the ch bond the 1726 cm 1 and 1071 cm 1 wavelength positions represented the c o and cn bonds respectively the peak intensity at 1401cm 1 and 1174 cm 1 increased indicating the existence of a signal of the c f bond most of the absorption band was sharp indicated a virgin membrane the characteristic pvdf polymer material was still observed on the contaminated membrane but the characteristic peak strength was significantly reduced as the pollutants on the membrane surface weakened the reflection of the characteristic peak following direct filtration the membrane featured new peaks representing the organic pollutants the 3000 3500 cm 1 wavelength range represented the nh and oh bonds suggesting that the membrane surface pollutants contained amino acid and protein like groups ch signals were detected at a wavelength of 2930 cm 1 indicating the presence of fatty groups on the membrane surface organic pollutants on the membrane surface at the 1025 cm 1 wavelength indicated carbohydrates which may be related to smps alkanes were observed at a wavelength of 1438 cm 1 wavelength and the peak intensity was stronger at the wavelength of 1724 cm 1 indicating that the pollutants may have included natural organic pollutants such as fulvic acid by using h2o2 backwashing the peak at 3791 cm 1 was weakened it showed that adding h2o2 reduced the biofouling caused by eps but the mitigation of organic fouling was not obvious after adding ozone the peak strength of each pollutant was reduced indicating that following pre ozonation the organic pollutants on the membrane surface decreased which was consistent with the previous conclusion due to the ozonation the signal of the co bond at the 1250 cm 1 wavelength was stronger which meant the hydrophilic functional groups in the organic pollutants on the membrane surface increased at the 3791 cm 1 wavelength the peak was more enhanced than with the virgin membrane which may be the polysaccharide peak this indicated that some eps still accumulated on the membrane surface after the addition of ozone following addition of h2o2 the peaks detected on the membrane surface were similar to those of the virgin membranes in particular the peaks at wavelengths 3791cm 1 representing polysaccharides and 3000 3500cm 1 representing proteins were greatly reduced indicating that after the dual effects of o3 and h2o2 even during the late stage accumulation of eps on the membrane had also been controlled and membrane fouling had been greatly alleviated 3 5 3 variation of the cake layer after 60 days of operation under different conditions contamination of the membrane surface was characterized using sem as shown in fig 9 the clean membrane fig 9a had a smooth surface distributed with some fine membrane holes following direct filtration of ubacf fig 9b the membrane surface was rough and uneven which may have been due to the adhesion of organic matter to the membrane and reproduction of bacteria the cake layer deposited on the membrane surface was dense rough and thick with a large amount of suspended materials and organic pollutants such that the membrane holes could not be seen membrane fouling was severe within the red circle in fig 9 there were some elliptical objects of 1 μm in size which were thought to be bacteria this proved that the presence of bacteria in the water caused a certain amount of fouling to the membrane and a decrease in tmp after using h2o2 backwashing fig 9c the number of bacteria was significantly reduced but there was still a large amount of organic pollutants accumulated on the surface of the membrane comparison with sem of the membrane following ozone addition fig 9d we observed that the pollutants were significantly reduced the membrane surface was relatively flat and the cake layer was relatively loose however there were still more pollutants and microorganisms on the membrane surface than after the addition of h2o2 fig 9e here the membrane surface was smoother had fewer pollutants and an average distribution state there was no obvious presence of bacteria in the cake layer this indicates that adding h2o2 for backwashing can effectively relieve membrane fouling in the long term operation of the membrane the concentration of proteins and polysaccharides in the cake layer and the weight of the cake layer are shown in fig 10 it can be seen that the largest cake layer 15 9 0 4 g m2 formed by direct ultrafiltration contained the highest levels of protein and polysaccharide 0 95 0 05 mg g and 0 31 0 03 mg g while the concentration of both in the cake layer of membrane subjected to o3 h2o2 was significantly reduced indicating the reduced accumulation of eps on the membrane clsm images of the cake layer on the membrane surface are shown in fig 11 red fluorescence occurs when dapi is conjugated with dna green fluorescence occurs when fitc is conjugated with protein and blue fluorescence when cona is conjugated with polysaccharide wu lee waite and guan 2002 as shown in fig 11 the ratio of protein to polysaccharide was similar throughout without any treatment a biofilm formed on the membrane surface and the concentrations of microorganisms protein and polysaccharide were highest with the addition of o3 the concentration of microorganisms decreased in the presence of h2o2 that is there were fewer eps on the membrane surface but using o3 or h2o2 alone there were still more eps and microorganisms accumulated on the membrane surface this showed that the combined process of o3 and h2o2 was effective and necessary for alleviating membrane fouling 3 5 4 variation of interfacial forces according to the change in tmp using the 10th day to represent the early stage of filtration and the 47th day to represent the late stage we calculated the interaction energy and interfacial forces for both stages under different operating conditions the variation in interfacial forces under different operating conditions is shown in table 8 the ab force was calculated at 1 nm and the lw and el forces at 10 nm it can be seen that in the late stages of filtration the interaction energy and forces were greater than in the early stage when h2o2 backwashing was used the interaction energy and interfacial forces in the late stage were more reduced when ozonation was added as a pretreatment the interaction energy and interfacial forces were reduced but the effect was no longer obvious in the late stage when pre ozonation was combined with h2o2 backwashing the interaction energy and ab and lw forces were the lowest in both the early and late stages of filtration this also verified that when the minimum amount of eps accumulated on the membrane the force between the pollutants and the degree of membrane fouling was lowest 3 6 impact of h2o2 on membrane material following long term filtration although pvdf generally has good resistance to oxidants the presence of impurities or other materials in the commercial pvdf membrane may be sensitive to h2o2 yu graham and liu 2019 therefore it was important to detect the physical and chemical properties of the membrane after long term operation 180 days it can be seen from table 9 that following long term operation with residual ozone the tensile properties of the pvdf membrane deteriorated and the physical properties changed however there was no detectable difference in the tensile properties of the membrane with h2o2 indicating that the physical properties of the membrane had not changed the surface functional groups were examined using fitr as shown in fig 12 the characteristic peak of the pvdf membrane did not change at the same time the contact angle of the membrane was between the virgin membrane and the o3 uf membrane which was normal therefore h2o2 did not change the chemical structure of the membrane 4 conclusion eps resulted in serious membrane fouling during ultrafiltration of ubac effluent eps increased the ab and lw forces between pollutants and the membrane and the time taken for a cake layer to form was reduced due to the biofouling caused by the eps to control membrane biofouling the amount of eps must be reduced in the early stage to slow down the formation of a cake layer and control its accumulation on the membrane in the late stage to reduce the ab and lw forces pre ozonation changed the characteristics of the organic components reduced the contact angle of the organic matter and reduced the ab forces between the organic matter and the membrane however if only o3 at a dose of 0 4 mg l was used prior to ultrafiltration some bacteria still flowed into the membrane tank this could result in the growth of microorganisms on the membrane surface and the secretion of eps in the late stage of filtration causing biofouling the h2o2 backwashing could inhibit the growth of microorganisms change the nature of the pollutants accumulated on the membrane and control the speed of formation of the cake layer it could effectively control membrane fouling caused by eps however if only h2o2 backwashing was used membrane organic fouling cannot be effectively alleviated and some bacteria still exist due to the low oxidation of h2o2 moreover the addition of 8 mg l h2o2 in the backwash water did not damage or deteriorate the pvdf membrane therefore o3 uf h2o2 for alleviating membrane fouling was feasible for

17569,cities are wrestling with the practical challenges of transitioning urban water services to become water sensitive capable of enhancing liveability sustainability resilience and productivity in the face of climate change rapid urbanisation degraded ecosystems and ageing infrastructure indicators can be valuable for guiding actions for improvement but there is not yet an established index that measures the full suite of attributes that constitute water sensitive performance this paper therefore presents the water sensitive cities wsc index a new benchmarking and diagnostic tool to assess the water sensitivity of a municipal or metropolitan city set aspirational targets and inform management responses to improve water sensitive practices its 34 indicators are organised into seven goals ensure good water sensitive governance increase community capital achieve equity of essential services improve productivity and resource efficiency improve ecological health ensure quality urban spaces and promote adaptive infrastructure the wsc index design is a quantitative framework based on qualitative rating descriptions and a participatory assessment methodology enabling local contextual interpretations of the indicators while maintaining a robust universal framework for city comparison and benchmarking the paper demonstrates its application on three illustrative cases

that integrated and adaptive approaches to urban water services are needed to improve flexibility and agility for coping with unpredictability and change while delivering multi functional benefits that support social wellbeing healthy ecosystems and strong economies while different terms are used to in water management literature to represent combinations of these attributes in this paper we refer to them as water sensitive despite this consensus cities around the world are wrestling with the practical challenges of shifting urban water services in a water sensitive direction guiding and motivating action for change is difficult as existing structures and processes often reinforce conventional practices brown and farrelly 2009 van de meene et al 2011 even when there are good intentions and policy aspirations it can be difficult to achieve coordinated and aligned action across multiple organisations ferguson et al 2013a decisions makers within water utilities and city governments are in need of more targeted and tailored insight to guide collective local efforts to overcome existing institutional and infrastructure challenges as cities transition from conventional to water sensitive practices ferguson et al 2013b how should activities and investments be prioritised what measures and targets can be used to monitor and assess progress which structures and processes support and enable cross sectoral collaboration and inclusive planning and design solutions indicators have been shown to be valuable for guiding system changes by reducing ambiguity and

feedback on the effects of policies chiras and corson 1997 swanson et al 2010 and co constructing visions and evaluating pathways towards desired societal change lehtonen et al 2016 however the assessment of city sustainability is not a well established practice marques et al 2015 the conditions for assessing city sustainability are ambiguous mori and christodoulou 2012 and there is misalignment between future city visions and available performance indicators renouf et al 2017 moreover complex urban challenges and stakeholder interests means processes for identifying priorities negotiating trade offs and tracking progress are important aspects of sustainable water management but often overlooked in the development and application of indicators against this background our paper presents the development of the water sensitive cities wsc index a new benchmarking and diagnostic tool developed by the cooperative research centre for water sensitive cities 1 1 an interdisciplinary research program funded by the australian government and industry partners 2012 2021 aud 120 million www watersensitivecities org au crcwsc the wsc index is designed to facilitate assessment of the water sensitivity of a city from the scale of local municipality to large metropolitan centre set targets based on best available research and inform management responses to improve water sensitive practices the tool can support strategic planning and decision making foster inter city learning and enable governments to assess their cities urban water management trajectories in relation to other cities the theoretical underpinnings of the wsc index framework is presented in section 2 followed by a summary of the development approach in section 3 the wsc index goals and indicators are outlined in section 4 a case study application of the wsc index in three diverse australian cities is illustrated in section 5 insights from applications of the wsc index to date and further development needs are discussed in section 6 followed by a conclusion in section 7 this paper will be of interest to scholars policy makers and practitioners of urban water management and sustainability assessment more broadly 2 background in setting out to develop a wsc index that can meaningfully guide policy and action for driving water sensitive transitions it is important to define what attributes of a water system will need measurement as well as to learn from the experiences of existing indicator initiatives the wsc vision is underpinned by three principles of practices wong and brown 2009 1 understanding cities as catchments to provide resources at different scales in fit for purpose applications 2 cities providing ecosystem services to integrate urban water management into the urban landscape providing multiple benefits such as heat mitigation ecological health and landscape amenity and 3 water conscious communities where citizens value and are connected to their water environments and engage in water conscious behaviours and water planning and design professionals work collaboratively to deliver water sensitive outcomes the heuristic in fig 1 demonstrates the transitions in water service delivery functions that are needed to respond to evolving socio political drivers culminating in the wsc the first three stages of the embedded continuum describe the evolution of the water system to provide essential services such as secure access to potable water water supply city public health protection sewered city and flood protection drained city these are followed by the waterways city water cycle city and ultimately a wsc which describe the anticipated and aspirational evolution of the urban water system to deliver higher order services such as social amenity and environmental protection provide reliable water services under constrained resources and ensure intergenerational equity and resilience to climate change defining features of the wsc that go beyond the pollution management function of the waterways city and integrated water cycle management function of the water cycle city include water infrastructure designed sensitively into the urban landscape to deliver multi functional liveability and ecological benefits adaptive planning and management based on flexible hybrid solutions to increase resilience and communities that are active in caring for their water resources and environments while cities and metropolitan areas are awash in indicators which have proliferated since the 1987 brundtland commission report böhringer and jochem 2007 dunn and bakker 2011 there are not yet agreed metrics that define the wsc concept and its constituent collection of attributes without such measures stakeholders will struggle to operationalise their shared wsc vision lack comprehensive insight on current system performance and receive limited guidance on priorities for action to progress their water sensitive transition as a crosscutting issue water related metrics are found in indicator initiatives for sustainability urban greening city governance vulnerability resilience and liveability these provide a useful starting point for considering the assessment of a city s water sensitive performance table 1 highlights the components of water sensitivity in notable water related indicators mapped against the six city states in fig 1 table 1 shows that while many established indices measure multiple aspects of water service performance they have not been designed to assess the full suite of attributes that constitute water sensitive performance they typically either focus too specifically on a particular water servicing attribute e g compliance with drinking water quality standards level of wastewater treatment for effective evaluation of water sensitive city policies and practices or they are too broad in scope to pay significant attention to water there are several notable gaps in available measures that would be important for assessing water sensitivity a dearth of indicators for nature based solutions which are widely seen as important elements of urban sustainability climate change adaptation and land use planning epa 2014 limited green or grey green infrastructure indicators e g de ridder et al 2004 2 2 the most prominent are the two indicators developed by the european environment agency eea to capture the range of benefits that green infrastructure afford urban areas these include climate adaptation and mitigation multiple ecosystem services e g biodiversity and improvements to public health and wellbeing through proximity to green urban spaces and while stormwater is often implied within wastewater quality indicators there are few indicators of physical hydrological or biological changes to measure the cumulative effects of urban runoff within the past decade a handful of frameworks have been developed that facilitate a broader understanding of sustainable urban water management or have relevance to water sensitive principle see bottom rows of table 1 the ecocity standards clean and safe water examines water demand in relation to supply emphasising resource constraints the importance of integrated water management including stormwater as a resource pricing and ecological health however the ecocity standards does not provide tools guidance or methodology to enable practitioners to benchmark progress toward the ten levels proposed which the standards recognise are context specific the sustainable cities water index scwi developed by arcadis is intended to be a global ranking tool arcadis 2016 the index centres around three key sub indices for water sustainability resiliency efficiency and quality which are further supported by a series of sub indices and indicators such as disaster risk water charges green space and pollution scwi focuses on resources public health and the economic dimensions of water but does not include social and governance aspects of integrated water management arup s city resilience index comprises 52 indicators across 12 goals that measure and assess multiple factors contributing to urban resilience including water and sanitation services flood resilience and ecosystem stewardship arup 2015 there are additional indicators for leadership and strategy economy and society health and wellbeing although these are broader city resilience indicators that are not specific to water the city blueprint approach comprises three frameworks trends and pressures framework tpf with 12 descriptive trends and pressure indicators the city blueprint framework cbf with 7 categories and 25 indicators and the governance capacity framework gcf van leeuwen 2013 feingold et al 2018 the cbf enables a baseline assessment of the sustainability of urban water resources management and is intended as a first step or quick scan to benchmark the sustainability of the urban water cycle and facilitate awareness of current water challenges koop and van leeuwen 2015 whilst each of the above frameworks provide valuable insights for improving water system planning and management none covers the full range of social governance economic liveability multi functional and adaptive attributes that are defining attributes of water sensitivity beyond these thematic gaps in existing water related metrics in relation to water sensitive objectives there are emerging critical perspectives on indicators highlighting their limited uptake and impact on policy and practice boyko et al 2012 lehtonen 2013 turnpenny et al 2014 diehl et al 2016 there are various explanations for this disconnect first indicators often fail to meet the needs of policy and decisions makers as the development process does not adequately engage them or identify their information requirements brennin 2007 dunn and bakker 2011 norman et al 2012 second data collection methods vary between government agencies and across sectors which can impact on the scale of assessment that is possible and is further compounded by the scalar mismatch between administrative and hydrological boundaries van der zaag and gupta 2008 van den brandeler et al 2019 third spatial and temporal data gaps 3 3 existing datasets can be incomplete have different parameters and use different sampling standards and frequencies inconsistent data collection methods and data storage protocols limit the usability of datasets and impede data sharing and integration of datasets between different users can make indicators difficult to calculate and limit the ability to develop baselines and threshold values monitor trends or understand the broader impacts of climate change and land use practices hak et al 2007 fourth indicator projects require long term commitment of resources both financial and staff to ensure continued relevance and provide end user support mayer 2008 dunn and bakker 2009 other limitations of indicators include inadequately capturing the system s complexity with its associated subjectivity and inherent biases barnett et al 2008 pintér et al 2005 sagar and najam 1998 mayer 2008 as well as overlooking processes of negotiation and prioritisation that are critical for sustainability planning starkl et al 2013 furthermore poorly constructed indicators can be misinterpreted risking misleading or overly simplistic policy messages oecd 2003 these interrelated challenges mean that multifaceted indicators are often unwieldy impractical and costly in terms of both the time and resources needed to gain valuable insights and improve decision making norman et al 2012 drawing on these insights and in a quest to address the identified challenges through design features to support its uptake in practice the development of the wsc index aimed to create a tool that 1 is reliable and scientifically robust 2 takes a holistic and integrative approach to assessing water sensitivity 3 is applicable at both metropolitan and municipal council scales 4 enables benchmarking and comparison across diverse contexts and 5 has clear benefits and meets the practical needs of decision makers policy makers and practitioners 3 development of the wsc index the wsc index was developed over a two year period 2014 2016 in the phases depicted in fig 2 prototyping refinement and piloting trialling and industry release the development process was guided by an industry steering committee and an internal working group consisting of crcwsc leaders and key researchers from across the range of disciplines covered by the wsc index these inputs aimed to ensure that both scientific and end user considerations informed and shaped the tool the prototype framework for the wsc index was developed drawing on existing water indicators and supplemented with emerging knowledge from crcwsc research including insights from water sensitive city envisioning processes ferguson et al 2013b the inventory and analysis of existing indicators identified more than 230 individual indicators from over 50 frameworks organisational initiatives e g the global indicator facility 4 4 source https www iso org organization 660833 html and academic research e g sullivan et al 2003 these spanned multiple scales from global assessments e g vorosmarty et al 2010 to national measures e g pri 2007 and to municipal level initiatives such as city report cards the indicators most closely aligned with attributes of the wsc are shown in table 1 for wsc performance objectives that did not have an existing associated indicator that adequately represented its intent particularly for those more closely aligned with the water cycle city and water sensitive city we developed a new measure that could be used to qualitatively distinguish between low and high water sensitive performance scientific expertise and emerging knowledge from the crcwsc s research network and projects were drawn on to develop these new indicators and integrated them into the prototype framework for the wsc index the prototype was tested with two councils city of knox and city of port phillip located in melbourne australia this provided detailed feedback on its usability functionality benefits and reliability which led to a range of refinements and enhancements numerous indicators were consolidated to reduce the overall number and therefore the time and effort burden for assessment we refined the assessment methodology in consultation with our industry partners whose feedback was that a data driven approach was unwieldy inefficient and unlikely to be broadly adopted in practice reconfirming earlier insights from literature that time intensive and costly benchmarking processes impede uptake norman et al 2012 instead we judged that practitioners equipped with system knowledge and available evidence and guided by a well facilitated assessment process would reach a sufficiently robust score for the purposes of benchmarking prioritisation and action planning to this end we developed an assessment methodology based on deliberation by local experts of available evidence to determine indicator scores the indicator descriptions were clarified through rewording to simplify language in accordance with the prototyping participant feedback ease of understanding was considered particularly crucial for an assessment methodology based on facilitated discussion to ensure a reliable and consistent approach to scoring across diverse cities we developed the conceptual basis for analysing results through a number of different frameworks that would support the development of management responses we also developed web based software to support visualisation and interpretation of the wsc index results the revised wsc index was piloted in three locations within greater perth as a single metropolitan area in australia one case at the metropolitan scale and two cases of municipal council areas an 18 month industry trial period followed the pilot cases 2016 2018 during which time the wsc index was applied to an additional 11 australian cities assessments were conducted by members of the research team who had in depth knowledge of the framework and indicators and could provide consistent guidance to workshop participants in helping them understand the indicators and decide on the most appropriate scores again minor refinements were made to the indicator rating descriptions over this period to provide greater clarity in response to participant feedback in preparation for broad industry release of the wsc index in early 2018 a training program and facilitation guidance were prepared eight industry practitioners were trained by the research team to become accredited wsc index providers see supplementary material for details on the training and accreditation process to date wsc index workshops have been facilitated by accredited providers to assess water sensitive performance and develop management responses in more than 50 cities see supplementary material for the list of cities that have been benchmarked 4 presenting the wsc index the wsc index offers users the ability to benchmark cities at the metropolitan or municipal scale based on performance against a range of urban water indicators across the societal biophysical and ecological dimensions that characterise a wsc these insights enable cities around the world to be ranked according to their water sensitivity as well as diagnose key areas of strength and weakness this enables governments to assess their cities urban water management trajectories in relation to other cities identify priorities for management actions and learn from other cities that are experiencing similar challenges or opportunities the wsc index is accessed through a web interface that provides visualisations of the results to facilitate understanding and support communication with broad audiences including policy makers service providers and community 4 1 wsc index goals and indicators the seven wsc index goals are 1 ensure good water sensitive governance 2 increase community capital 3 achieve equity of essential services 4 improve productivity and resource efficiency 5 improve ecological health 6 ensure quality urban spaces and 7 promote adaptive infrastructure 34 indicators span these goals collectively representing the full suite of wsc objectives that have emerged over the last ten years in the australian water context 5 5 early testing internationally shows that the suite of indicators is relevant in other contexts although potentially with some refinements this is discussed further in section 6 table 2 scoring for each indicator is based on a rating from 1 to 5 assigned according to the description that best fits the city s current situation half scores 1 5 2 5 can be assigned where the conditions are between the integer descriptions however scores of finer granularity 1 1 1 2 are not assigned since the degree of accuracy that would be implied by such scores has little meaning in the context of the wsc index s key purpose of identifying a city s relative strengths and weaknesses to inform priorities for management actions while some indicators use quantitative thresholds to inform the score 3 1 3 2 3 3 4 2 4 3 6 3 the majority are based on qualitative thresholds this enables assessment through evidence based judgement and provides opportunity for local expression of how the indicator may manifest in different contexts once priority indicators for action have been identified through the assessment process attention can be given to defining quantitative measures relevant to the local context that correspond to its 1 5 rating so that more accurate tracking of progress can be done as further wscs research is conducted including city and water practitioners testing and applying their own measures it is anticipated that further indicator ratings descriptions could be updated to be more quantitative this measurement approach relies on clear methodological structure and detailed scoring guidance to ensure consistency of application for diverse conditions table 3 provides an example of an indicator rating description and associated scoring guidance that has been developed to prompt due consideration of relevant evidence and to limit ambiguity when deciding on a score the full rating descriptions for each indicator are provided as supplementary material 4 2 assessment methodology while the wsc index framework can be applied in diverse ways to provide value to city stakeholders the crcwsc has developed and certified a workshop process methodology for using it to benchmark the water sensitive performance of cities it has trained and accredited providers in this methodology see supplementary material for details on the accreditation process to ensure that the assessment approach including how discussion amongst workshop participants is facilitated and how final indicator scores are decided on will be consistent regardless of who is facilitating the workshop cities that are assessed by an accredited provider are considered to have official benchmarks and have their scores included in the database of wsc index results this is creating an invaluable dataset for enabling consistent benchmarking and comparison helping cities learn from each other as they implement management actions and supporting meta analysis across cities to inform new research insights the certified assessment methodology requires involvement of at least 15 and up to 50 participants who represent different interests functions and responsibilities from various relevant organisations and different departments within those organisations with water related responsibilities in the geographic and or socio political area being benchmarked participant organisations in applications to date have included local municipalities water utilities consultants developers research institutes and government departments including planning environment water health sports and recreation parks and wildlife fig 3 presents an overview of the assessment methodology prior to the workshop participants are provided with the framework and definitions of the indicators in the wsc index framework they are asked to consider indicators they have particular knowledge on and to collect relevant evidence to contribute in workshop discussions providers will often engage with their main client contact to suggest an appropriate distribution of indicators among participants while full preparation by participants is not necessary for a successful workshop and the robustness of the scoring is not compromised if there has been less preparation for some indicators workshop discussions are enriched if participants have done this pre thinking during the workshop scoring is done goal by goal a workshop duration of one day requires some of the goals to be scored concurrently by splitting the participant group in two separate rooms with participants freely choosing which goals they can best contribute to the assessment of within each goal approximately 15 min is spent per indicator the facilitator introduces the indicator explaining its intent and providing any local interpretations and examples needed to provide clarity participants initially individually score the indicator using a live polling system drawing on their own tacit knowledge understanding of evidence or opinion if they do not have access to relevant information through facilitated discussion participants then explain their scores and substantiate their view with supporting evidence participants deliberate the insights and information provided and decide on the final score based on near consensus there may be some disagreement amongst participants on the final score although rarely by more than 0 5 difference in the applications to date this is not considered problematic however as accuracy of the score itself is less important than having a sound basis for identifying a city s relative strengths and weaknesses and understanding the issues that need to be addressed through management actions at this point the degree of confidence in the score is noted for reference in the development of management actions and wsc index applications in the future high means consensus and supported by strong evidence medium means consensus but lack of evidence and low means lack of both consensus and evidence the assessment method allows a diversity of perspectives and opinions to be revealed and explored while inviting critical reflection on the available evidence to then lead to a collective decision on the score at the end of the workshop overall results are shared with the participants and preliminary reflection amongst the group is facilitated to begin the process of collective sense making and identification of priorities this process is typically expanded after the workshop by the wsc index provider who may prepare a report that provides more in depth analysis of the results and recommended strategies and actions instead of the collaborative workshop process described above the scoring could be undertaken by an informed individual or expert panel for example however a cautionary note a single individual is unlikely to have the necessary in depth understanding or access to evidence across all goals and indicators to provide a reliable assessment and there is a risk that the results would not be considered valid amongst key stakeholders without wider participation an expert driven assessment also means that city stakeholders miss out on participating in the dialogue that leads to the scoring which applications of the wsc index to date have shown to be an effective way to share knowledge and generate commitment to action to improve scores 5 illustrative case study applications we now demonstrate application of the wsc index by presenting three case study cities in contrasting contexts ranging from metropolitan scale greater sydney hammer et al 2018 regional city city of greater bendigo rogers et al 2018 to municipal council moonee valley city council lloyd et al 2016 5 1 comparing wsc index results table 4 briefly outlines the context of each city and compares their wsc index results in order to highlight key insights the tool was able to reveal leading to discussion of how these insights supported the development of specific management responses across the different contexts the radar charts show the cities performances against the seven wsc goals 5 2 interpreting wsc index results when interpreting the results in table 4 it is important to remember that the purpose of the wsc index and the intent of the assessment methodology is not to determine precise scores rather it is to understand the water sensitive performance of the system relative to an aspirational benchmark or other comparable cities so that opportunities for management responses can be identified hence while the results may be expressed with a precise number between 0 and 5 where 0 indicates the lowest and 5 the highest performance relative to the water sensitive city aspirations it is important to attribute meaning from the results with careful reference to the specific indicators that are diagnosed to be performance enhancing or inhibiting comparing performance across cities will require analysis of the types of ongoing challenges and potential management responses for specific indicators rather than drawing sweeping insights based on their aggregated scores the following analysis will show how such comparison can reveal valuable detail on key aspects of a city s urban water services the wsc index goal scores averaged across component indicators in the three cities ranged from 2 to 4 indicating a moderate level of overall performance however looking at the scores on the individual goal and indicator level reveals contrasting performances all three cities scored highest on achieve equity of essential services which is not surprising given the generally high performance of australian water utilities in the provision of basic water supply and sanitation services bendigo is reliably serviced by a network of drainage systems managed by the local government agency on this aspect bendigo performed slightly better than sydney and moonee valley sydney s lower drainage performance reflects an uneven distribution of flood protection across the city with some inhabitants at greater risk of flooding hammer et al 2018 while a range of flood related risk analyses and strategies were being implemented at the municipal or sub catchment levels they were not strategically aligned with one another limiting opportunities for learning and scaling up at the catchment level meanwhile in moonee valley rainfall events generally do not disrupt everyday activities although there are known localised flooding issues and inconsistent planning controls which has resulted in some overland flow paths being built over sydney demonstrated higher performance for improve ecological health than bendigo and moonee valley while point source pollution in bendigo is well managed and there is growing acknowledgement of the need to manage diffuse source pollution adoption of new industry standards for stormwater management are yet to be mainstreamed in established suburbs similarly in moonee valley compliance to best practice stormwater discharge guidelines can also be improved while major waterway corridors are accessible to community active recreation infrastructures such as bicycle and walking paths can be increased along smaller blue green assets e g ponds wetlands moonee valley shows the highest relative performance for improve productivity and resource efficiency compared to sydney and bendigo this reflects a range of efforts by the municipality to implement decentralised alternative supplies stormwater harvesting projects for reuse in local parks and ongoing wsud working groups with multidisciplinary representation whilst these achievements are encouraging there remains significant room for improvement to reach a high level of water cycle performance in the municipality volume of water reuse for instance remains low compared to mains water sydney has diversified its water sources although significant challenges remain in implementing stormwater harvesting and other recycling measures as a viable option at scale bendigo has also promoted diversification of water sources including rainwater tanks bores and wastewater recycling and reuse however water demands in bendigo have grown in recent years and remain quite high despite evidence of some improvement in water management and urban design approaches attainment of an ideal wsc state across the three cases remained elusive in sydney although the overall score for water security and public health was high there is a clear need to integrate governance innovations to increase the city s overall water sensitivity for bendigo while there is evidence of strategic city greening and investments in stormwater harvesting projects there remains relatively few examples of other water sensitive infrastructure such as raingardens the benefit of nature based solutions for mitigating urban heat for instance has not been understood by many residents and overall tree canopy cover appears to have been reduced in moonee valley evidence showed that the municipality s approach in advancing water sensitive practices has been driven by demand management following australia s millennium drought 1997 2010 while this period saw widespread installation of water saving fittings fixtures and appliances water usage has since bounced back to 200 250 l person day across residential and industrial sectors to reach a wsc state management actions that lead to multi functional outcomes need to be implemented more widely across the three cities 5 3 using wsc index results experience in assessing the water sensitive performance of more than 50 cities to date shows the wsc index results can be used in a variety of ways to inform the development of management actions and strategies in response to key priorities examples from this paper s three illustrative cases are given here application of the wsc index in sydney generated high level strategic recommendations that identified priority issues for the short to medium term the city wide benchmarking informed by perspectives from a range of municipal council areas enabled a systematic understanding of the drivers challenges and opportunities for improved water sensitivity the process also strengthened relationships among participants through engaging in new types of discussions with different people and organisations and sharing lessons and experiences from across the city while it was useful to have a metropolitan wide wsc index result participants and facilitators of the sydney application reflected that the aggregated scores at the metropolitan level disguised a high degree of variation in performance across the large geographical and administrative region participants therefore saw value in follow up applications of the wsc index at the sub city and or municipal scale to derive more tailored management actions in response to local issues bendigo participants engaged in a further process to prioritise indicators for strategic action following the benchmarking workshop stakeholders have since committed to an ongoing network of wsc champions who meet regularly and follow up on agreed actions the wsc index and associated processes has led the leaders of key agencies to establish a clear mandate for implementing the changes needed to improve the scores of these priority indicators they plan to reassess bendigo in three years to monitor their progress towards their water sensitive aspirations for moonee valley a nine point action plan was developed using the wsc index results which has provided an overarching framework to guide initiatives across the municipality to advance towards the wsc these actions span on ground practices enabling structures and socio political capital 6 discussion applications to date including both municipal and metropolitan cities have shown that the wsc index can provide reliable meaningful insight across different contexts including coastal and inland locations temperate and tropical climates dense and sparse populations major cities and regional centres within australia and internationally while workshop participants in different cities found that some indicators were less relevant at the municipal scale and some were more challenging to uniformly apply at the metropolitan scale there was value in scoring all indicators for the selected scale of application to lead to meaningful insights about the area s water sensitivity and point to management actions to improve scores the design of the wsc index as a quantitative framework with qualitative rating descriptions and a process based assessment methodology has helped it be applicable across diverse contexts the indicator descriptions allow for contextual interpretations of the indicators while maintaining a robust universal framework that enables city comparison and benchmarking the scoring approach means it is feasible to benchmark any city where there is sufficient stakeholder interest even in situations where there is a lack of quantitative data this is because the evidence needed to determine the wsc index scores is typically readily accessible for example in the form of organisational policies strategies and reports or in the tacit knowledge of key individuals early testing indonesia south africa china fiji and myanmar showed the potential value of the wsc index for developing cities elaboration on this is beyond the scope of this paper beyond suggesting that refinement through further international testing would be valuable to ensure the indicator and rating descriptions are sufficiently robust for universal application for example it may be that finer granularity is needed in the lower rating scores for some indicators or that additional indicators may be needed to suit the particular conditions of developing city contexts for example informal settlements the participatory assessment methodology became a central focus for the wsc index s development and application a novel finding of this research emphasis on a well facilitated process was initially to ensure providers were consistent in how they engaged participants in scoring deliberations however applications of the wsc index to date have revealed a range of unanticipated benefits from the assessment process that would not have been achieved through a desktop assessment methodology workshop participants consistently report that the wsc index framework and workshop process a increased their understanding of wsc principles concepts solutions and practices b introduced them to people who would be important to collaborate and coordinate with to achieve water sensitive outcomes c facilitated new cross sectoral conversations between stakeholders d helped the group develop a collective understanding of their water system context and key drivers e led the group to articulate a shared set of aspirational outcomes for their future water system and f gave them insight into relevant policies programs and other initiatives from other departments and external organisations these insights reinforce findings from studies on the value of participatory processes e g olsson et al 2006 rijke et al 2013 and point to a promising direction for the design of other indicator initiatives beyond water particularly those aiming to drive system change through collaboration and learning across multi sectoral policy makers strategists and practitioners further development of the wsc index could integrate diagnostic filters that interpret the goal and indicator scores in different ways depending on the interest perspective and communication needs of the end user for example the indicator scores could be analysed through the urban water transition framework fig 1 brown et al 2009 to determine a city state benchmark this would allow a city s results to be interpreted with respect to their progress towards the water supply city sewered city drained city waterways city water cycle city and ultimately the wsc helping to give meaning to their results in relation to city state aspirations another potential diagnostic filter is the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs united nations 2015 with which the wsc index has many points of alignment their integration could help city stakeholders assess how improvements to their city s water sensitive performance may contribute to the achievement of sdg targets and vice versa these and other diagnostic filters would support users to gain critical insights into the current state of the urban water services and develop management actions that will address key priorities finally meta analysis of city data collected through the assessment process beyond simple overlaying of results for visual interpretation and ranking of aggregate scores would help to gain comparative insight the water sensitive strengths and weaknesses of cities in diverse contexts meta analysis of data collected longitudinally would also generate insight on the effectiveness of management actions in improving a city s water sensitivity providing an invaluable database for research into water sensitive city transitions 7 conclusion this paper presents for the first time a framework for defining water sensitive performance across the full range of technical social ecological governance economic liveability multi functional and adaptive attributes that are becoming recognised as important features of future water systems in building on established indicators and developing new measures that address gaps in existing water related metrics the wsc index offers a robust and industry relevant tool and process for diagnosing a city s strengths and weaknesses in relation to its water sensitive aspirations and guiding management responses that will help improve a city s water sensitivity rapid uptake of the wsc index in australia highlights its value in helping stakeholders develop collective commitment and evidence based priorities for action to accelerate their city s water sensitive transition we have demonstrated application of the wsc index through three illustrative case studies showing how it can be used to generate insights for benchmarking a city s water sensitive performance setting operational targets for improvement developing management responses and monitoring progress towards its water sensitive aspirations comparing the case study results across the seven wsc index goals reveals which specific aspects of urban water servicing and management responses can be enhanced to strengthen water sensitive principles the case applications also show the suitability of the wsc index tool across a range of biophysical and socio political contexts including large metropolitan scale regional city and municipality with different climates and demography the outlook for the wsc index as a valuable benchmarking and diagnostic tool to support the assessment of urban water services in practice appears positive with applications continuing across australia there has also been increasing interest from international cities further testing and refinement of the wsc index in diverse contexts will help realise its full potential as a global tool there may also be additional diagnostic filters that would provide new ways of interpreting and communicating the wsc index results innovation in the assessment methodology may present opportunity to increase the flexibility of application for example by utilising online collaboration platforms especially relevant in the current covid 19 pandemic finally there would be value in complementing the wsc index s focus on material outcomes of water sensitive practices with transitions focused frameworks that can provide guidance on the process of change

17569,cities are wrestling with the practical challenges of transitioning urban water services to become water sensitive capable of enhancing liveability sustainability resilience and productivity in the face of climate change rapid urbanisation degraded ecosystems and ageing infrastructure indicators can be valuable for guiding actions for improvement but there is not yet an established index that measures the full suite of attributes that constitute water sensitive performance this paper therefore presents the water sensitive cities wsc index a new benchmarking and diagnostic tool to assess the water sensitivity of a municipal or metropolitan city set aspirational targets and inform management responses to improve water sensitive practices its 34 indicators are organised into

urban water services in enhancing a city s liveability sustainability resilience and productivity farrelly and brown 2011 rijke et al 2013 achieving these outcomes particularly against the backdrop of

development 2014 vaux 2015 requires a fundamental shift in the way water system services are planned designed and delivered ashley et al 2013 brown et al 2009 there is now broad scholarly consensus that integrated and adaptive approaches to urban water services are needed to improve flexibility and agility for coping with unpredictability and change while delivering multi functional benefits that support social wellbeing healthy ecosystems and strong economies while different terms are used to in water management literature to represent combinations of these attributes in this paper we refer to them as water sensitive despite this consensus cities around the world are wrestling with the practical challenges of shifting urban water services in a water sensitive direction guiding and motivating action for change is difficult as existing structures and processes often reinforce conventional practices brown and farrelly 2009 van de meene et al 2011 even when there are good intentions and policy aspirations it can be difficult to achieve coordinated and aligned action across multiple organisations ferguson et al 2013a decisions makers within water utilities and city governments are in need of more targeted and tailored insight to guide collective local efforts to overcome existing institutional and infrastructure challenges as cities transition from conventional to water sensitive practices ferguson et al 2013b how should activities and investments be prioritised what measures and targets can be used to monitor and assess progress which structures and processes support and enable cross sectoral collaboration and inclusive planning and design solutions indicators have been shown to be valuable for guiding system changes by reducing ambiguity and enabling effective and clear communication amongst diverse interests mccool and stankey 2004 assessing and quantifying performance spiller et al 2012 providing early warnings spiller et al 2012 giving feedback on the effects of policies chiras and corson 1997 swanson et al 2010 and co constructing visions and evaluating pathways towards desired societal change lehtonen et al 2016 however the assessment of city sustainability is not a well established practice marques et al 2015 the conditions for assessing city sustainability are ambiguous mori and christodoulou 2012 and there is misalignment between future city visions and available performance indicators renouf et al 2017 moreover complex urban challenges and stakeholder interests means processes for identifying priorities negotiating trade offs and tracking progress are important aspects of sustainable water management but often overlooked in the development and application of indicators against this background our paper presents the development of the water sensitive cities wsc index a new benchmarking and diagnostic tool developed by the cooperative research centre for water sensitive cities 1 1 an interdisciplinary research program funded by the australian government and industry partners 2012 2021 aud 120 million www watersensitivecities org au crcwsc the wsc index is designed to facilitate assessment of the water sensitivity of a city from the scale of local municipality to large metropolitan centre set targets based on best available research and inform management responses to improve water sensitive practices the tool can support strategic planning and decision making foster inter city learning and enable governments to assess their cities urban water management trajectories in relation to other cities the theoretical underpinnings of the wsc index framework is presented in section 2 followed by a summary of the development approach in section 3 the wsc index goals and indicators are outlined in section 4 a case study application of the wsc index in three diverse australian cities is illustrated in section 5 insights from applications of the wsc index to date and further development needs are discussed in section 6 followed by a conclusion in section 7 this paper will be of interest to scholars policy makers and practitioners of urban water management and sustainability assessment more broadly 2 background in setting out to develop a wsc index that can meaningfully guide policy and action for driving water sensitive transitions it is important to define what attributes of a water system will need measurement as well as to learn from the experiences of existing indicator initiatives the wsc vision is underpinned by three principles of practices wong and brown 2009 1 understanding cities as catchments to provide resources at different scales in fit for purpose applications 2 cities providing ecosystem services to integrate urban water management into the urban landscape providing multiple benefits such as heat mitigation ecological health and landscape amenity and 3 water conscious communities where citizens value and are connected to their water environments and engage in water conscious behaviours and water planning and design professionals work collaboratively to deliver water sensitive outcomes the heuristic in fig 1 demonstrates the transitions in water service delivery functions that are needed to respond to evolving socio political drivers culminating in the wsc the first three stages of the embedded continuum describe the evolution of the water system to provide essential services such as secure access to potable water water supply city public health protection sewered city and flood protection drained city these are followed by the waterways city water cycle city and ultimately a wsc which describe the anticipated and aspirational evolution of the urban water system to deliver higher order services such as social amenity and environmental protection provide reliable water services under constrained resources and ensure intergenerational equity and resilience to climate change defining features of the wsc that go beyond the pollution management function of the waterways city and integrated water cycle management function of the water cycle city include water infrastructure designed sensitively into the urban landscape to deliver multi functional liveability and ecological benefits adaptive planning and management based on flexible hybrid solutions to increase resilience and communities that are active in caring for their water resources and environments while cities and metropolitan areas are awash in indicators which have proliferated since the 1987 brundtland commission report böhringer and jochem 2007 dunn and bakker 2011 there are not yet agreed metrics that define the wsc concept and its constituent collection of attributes without such measures stakeholders will struggle to operationalise their shared wsc vision lack comprehensive insight on current system performance and receive limited guidance on priorities for action to progress their water sensitive transition as a crosscutting issue water related metrics are found in indicator initiatives for sustainability urban greening city governance vulnerability resilience and liveability these provide a useful starting point for considering the assessment of a city s water sensitive performance table 1 highlights the components of water sensitivity in notable water related indicators mapped against the six city states in fig 1 table 1 shows that while many established indices measure multiple aspects of water service performance they have not been designed to assess the full suite of attributes that constitute water sensitive performance they typically either focus too specifically on a particular water servicing attribute e g compliance with drinking water quality standards level of wastewater treatment for effective evaluation of water sensitive city policies and practices or they are too broad in scope to pay significant attention to water there are several notable gaps in available measures that would be important for assessing water sensitivity a dearth of indicators for nature based solutions which are widely seen as important elements of urban sustainability climate change adaptation and land use planning epa 2014 limited green or grey green infrastructure indicators e g de ridder et al 2004 2 2 the most prominent are the two indicators developed by the european environment agency eea to capture the range of benefits that green infrastructure afford urban areas these include climate adaptation and mitigation multiple ecosystem services e g biodiversity and improvements to public health and wellbeing through proximity to green urban spaces and while stormwater is often implied within wastewater quality indicators there are few indicators of physical hydrological or biological changes to measure the cumulative effects of urban runoff within the past decade a handful of frameworks have been developed that facilitate a broader understanding of sustainable urban water management or have relevance to water sensitive principle see bottom rows of table 1 the ecocity standards clean and safe water examines water demand in relation to supply emphasising resource constraints the importance of integrated water management including stormwater as a resource pricing and ecological health however the ecocity standards does not provide tools guidance or methodology to enable practitioners to benchmark progress toward the ten levels proposed which the standards recognise are context specific the sustainable cities water index scwi developed by arcadis is intended to be a global ranking tool arcadis 2016 the index centres around three key sub indices for water sustainability resiliency efficiency and quality which are further supported by a series of sub indices and indicators such as disaster risk water charges green space and pollution scwi focuses on resources public health and the economic dimensions of water but does not include social and governance aspects of integrated water management arup s city resilience index comprises 52 indicators across 12 goals that measure and assess multiple factors contributing to urban resilience including water and sanitation services flood resilience and ecosystem stewardship arup 2015 there are additional indicators for leadership and strategy economy and society health and wellbeing although these are broader city resilience indicators that are not specific to water the city blueprint approach comprises three frameworks trends and pressures framework tpf with 12 descriptive trends and pressure indicators the city blueprint framework cbf with 7 categories and 25 indicators and the governance capacity framework gcf van leeuwen 2013 feingold et al 2018 the cbf enables a baseline assessment of the sustainability of urban water resources management and is intended as a first step or quick scan to benchmark the sustainability of the urban water cycle and facilitate awareness of current water challenges koop and van leeuwen 2015 whilst each of the above frameworks provide valuable insights for improving water system planning and management none covers the full range of social governance economic liveability multi functional and adaptive attributes that are defining attributes of water sensitivity beyond these thematic gaps in existing water related metrics in relation to water sensitive objectives there are emerging critical perspectives on indicators highlighting their limited uptake and impact on policy and practice boyko et al 2012 lehtonen 2013 turnpenny et al 2014 diehl et al 2016 there are various explanations for this disconnect first indicators often fail to meet the needs of policy and decisions makers as the development process does not adequately engage them or identify their information requirements brennin 2007 dunn and bakker 2011 norman et al 2012 second data collection methods vary between government agencies and across sectors which can impact on the scale of assessment that is possible and is further compounded by the scalar mismatch between administrative and hydrological boundaries van der zaag and gupta 2008 van den brandeler et al 2019 third spatial and temporal data gaps 3 3 existing datasets can be incomplete have different parameters and use different sampling standards and frequencies inconsistent data collection methods and data storage protocols limit the usability of datasets and impede data sharing and integration of datasets between different users can make indicators difficult to calculate and limit the ability to develop baselines and threshold values monitor trends or understand the broader impacts of climate change and land use practices hak et al 2007 fourth indicator projects require long term commitment of resources both financial and staff to ensure continued relevance and provide end user support mayer 2008 dunn and bakker 2009 other limitations of indicators include inadequately capturing the system s complexity with its associated subjectivity and inherent biases barnett et al 2008 pintér et al 2005 sagar and najam 1998 mayer 2008 as well as overlooking processes of negotiation and prioritisation that are critical for sustainability planning starkl et al 2013 furthermore poorly constructed indicators can be misinterpreted risking misleading or overly simplistic policy messages oecd 2003 these interrelated challenges mean that multifaceted indicators are often unwieldy impractical and costly in terms of both the time and resources needed to gain valuable insights and improve decision making norman et al 2012 drawing on these insights and in a quest to address the identified challenges through design features to support its uptake in practice the development of the wsc index aimed to create a tool that 1 is reliable and scientifically robust 2 takes a holistic and integrative approach to assessing water sensitivity 3 is applicable at both metropolitan and municipal council scales 4 enables benchmarking and comparison across diverse contexts and 5 has clear benefits and meets the practical needs of decision makers policy makers and practitioners 3 development of the wsc index the wsc index was developed over a two year period 2014 2016 in the phases depicted in fig 2 prototyping refinement and piloting trialling and industry release the development process was guided by an industry steering committee and an internal working group consisting of crcwsc leaders and key researchers from across the range of disciplines covered by the wsc index these inputs aimed to ensure that both scientific and end user considerations informed and shaped the tool the prototype framework for the wsc index was developed drawing on existing water indicators and supplemented with emerging knowledge from crcwsc research including insights from water sensitive city envisioning processes ferguson et al 2013b the inventory and analysis of existing indicators identified more than 230 individual indicators from over 50 frameworks organisational initiatives e g the global indicator facility 4 4 source https www iso org organization 660833 html and academic research e g sullivan et al 2003 these spanned multiple scales from global assessments e g vorosmarty et al 2010 to national measures e g pri 2007 and to municipal level initiatives such as city report cards the indicators most closely aligned with attributes of the wsc are shown in table 1 for wsc performance objectives that did not have an existing associated indicator that adequately represented its intent particularly for those more closely aligned with the water cycle city and water sensitive city we developed a new measure that could be used to qualitatively distinguish between low and high water sensitive performance scientific expertise and emerging knowledge from the crcwsc s research network and projects were drawn on to develop these new indicators and integrated them into the prototype framework for the wsc index the prototype was tested with two councils city of knox and city of port phillip located in melbourne australia this provided detailed feedback on its usability functionality benefits and reliability which led to a range of refinements and enhancements numerous indicators were consolidated to reduce the overall number and therefore the time and effort burden for assessment we refined the assessment methodology in consultation with our industry partners whose feedback was that a data driven approach was unwieldy inefficient and unlikely to be broadly adopted in practice reconfirming earlier insights from literature that time intensive and costly benchmarking processes impede uptake norman et al 2012 instead we judged that practitioners equipped with system knowledge and available evidence and guided by a well facilitated assessment process would reach a sufficiently robust score for the purposes of benchmarking prioritisation and action planning to this end we developed an assessment methodology based on deliberation by local experts of available evidence to determine indicator scores the indicator descriptions were clarified through rewording to simplify language in accordance with the prototyping participant feedback ease of understanding was considered particularly crucial for an assessment methodology based on facilitated discussion to ensure a reliable and consistent approach to scoring across diverse cities we developed the conceptual basis for analysing results through a number of different frameworks that would support the development of management responses we also developed web based software to support visualisation and interpretation of the wsc index results the revised wsc index was piloted in three locations within greater perth as a single metropolitan area in australia one case at the metropolitan scale and two cases of municipal council areas an 18 month industry trial period followed the pilot cases 2016 2018 during which time the wsc index was applied to an additional 11 australian cities assessments were conducted by members of the research team who had in depth knowledge of the framework and indicators and could provide consistent guidance to workshop participants in helping them understand the indicators and decide on the most appropriate scores again minor refinements were made to the indicator rating descriptions over this period to provide greater clarity in response to participant feedback in preparation for broad industry release of the wsc index in early 2018 a training program and facilitation guidance were prepared eight industry practitioners were trained by the research team to become accredited wsc index providers see supplementary material for details on the training and accreditation process to date wsc index workshops have been facilitated by accredited providers to assess water sensitive performance and develop management responses in more than 50 cities see supplementary material for the list of cities that have been benchmarked 4 presenting the wsc index the wsc index offers users the ability to benchmark cities at the metropolitan or municipal scale based on performance against a range of urban water indicators across the societal biophysical and ecological dimensions that characterise a wsc these insights enable cities around the world to be ranked according to their water sensitivity as well as diagnose key areas of strength and weakness this enables governments to assess their cities urban water management trajectories in relation to other cities identify priorities for management actions and learn from other cities that are experiencing similar challenges or opportunities the wsc index is accessed through a web interface that provides visualisations of the results to facilitate understanding and support communication with broad audiences including policy makers service providers and community 4 1 wsc index goals and indicators the seven wsc index goals are 1 ensure good water sensitive governance 2 increase community capital 3 achieve equity of essential services 4 improve productivity and resource efficiency 5 improve ecological health 6 ensure quality urban spaces and 7 promote adaptive infrastructure 34 indicators span these goals collectively representing the full suite of wsc objectives that have emerged over the last ten years in the australian water context 5 5 early testing internationally shows that the suite of indicators is relevant in other contexts although potentially with some refinements this is discussed further in section 6 table 2 scoring for each indicator is based on a rating from 1 to 5 assigned according to the description that best fits the city s current situation half scores 1 5 2 5 can be assigned where the conditions are between the integer descriptions however scores of finer granularity 1 1 1 2 are not assigned since the degree of accuracy that would be implied by such scores has little meaning in the context of the wsc index s key purpose of identifying a city s relative strengths and weaknesses to inform priorities for management actions while some indicators use quantitative thresholds to inform the score 3 1 3 2 3 3 4 2 4 3 6 3 the majority are based on qualitative thresholds this enables assessment through evidence based judgement and provides opportunity for local expression of how the indicator may manifest in different contexts once priority indicators for action have been identified through the assessment process attention can be given to defining quantitative measures relevant to the local context that correspond to its 1 5 rating so that more accurate tracking of progress can be done as further wscs research is conducted including city and water practitioners testing and applying their own measures it is anticipated that further indicator ratings descriptions could be updated to be more quantitative this measurement approach relies on clear methodological structure and detailed scoring guidance to ensure consistency of application for diverse conditions table 3 provides an example of an indicator rating description and associated scoring guidance that has been developed to prompt due consideration of relevant evidence and to limit ambiguity when deciding on a score the full rating descriptions for each indicator are provided as supplementary material 4 2 assessment methodology while the wsc index framework can be applied in diverse ways to provide value to city stakeholders the crcwsc has developed and certified a workshop process methodology for using it to benchmark the water sensitive performance of cities it has trained and accredited providers in this methodology see supplementary material for details on the accreditation process to ensure that the assessment approach including how discussion amongst workshop participants is facilitated and how final indicator scores are decided on will be consistent regardless of who is facilitating the workshop cities that are assessed by an accredited provider are considered to have official benchmarks and have their scores included in the database of wsc index results this is creating an invaluable dataset for enabling consistent benchmarking and comparison helping cities learn from each other as they implement management actions and supporting meta analysis across cities to inform new research insights the certified assessment methodology requires involvement of at least 15 and up to 50 participants who represent different interests functions and responsibilities from various relevant organisations and different departments within those organisations with water related responsibilities in the geographic and or socio political area being benchmarked participant organisations in applications to date have included local municipalities water utilities consultants developers research institutes and government departments including planning environment water health sports and recreation parks and wildlife fig 3 presents an overview of the assessment methodology prior to the workshop participants are provided with the framework and definitions of the indicators in the wsc index framework they are asked to consider indicators they have particular knowledge on and to collect relevant evidence to contribute in workshop discussions providers will often engage with their main client contact to suggest an appropriate distribution of indicators among participants while full preparation by participants is not necessary for a successful workshop and the robustness of the scoring is not compromised if there has been less preparation for some indicators workshop discussions are enriched if participants have done this pre thinking during the workshop scoring is done goal by goal a workshop duration of one day requires some of the goals to be scored concurrently by splitting the participant group in two separate rooms with participants freely choosing which goals they can best contribute to the assessment of within each goal approximately 15 min is spent per indicator the facilitator introduces the indicator explaining its intent and providing any local interpretations and examples needed to provide clarity participants initially individually score the indicator using a live polling system drawing on their own tacit knowledge understanding of evidence or opinion if they do not have access to relevant information through facilitated discussion participants then explain their scores and substantiate their view with supporting evidence participants deliberate the insights and information provided and decide on the final score based on near consensus there may be some disagreement amongst participants on the final score although rarely by more than 0 5 difference in the applications to date this is not considered problematic however as accuracy of the score itself is less important than having a sound basis for identifying a city s relative strengths and weaknesses and understanding the issues that need to be addressed through management actions at this point the degree of confidence in the score is noted for reference in the development of management actions and wsc index applications in the future high means consensus and supported by strong evidence medium means consensus but lack of evidence and low means lack of both consensus and evidence the assessment method allows a diversity of perspectives and opinions to be revealed and explored while inviting critical reflection on the available evidence to then lead to a collective decision on the score at the end of the workshop overall results are shared with the participants and preliminary reflection amongst the group is facilitated to begin the process of collective sense making and identification of priorities this process is typically expanded after the workshop by the wsc index provider who may prepare a report that provides more in depth analysis of the results and recommended strategies and actions instead of the collaborative workshop process described above the scoring could be undertaken by an informed individual or expert panel for example however a cautionary note a single individual is unlikely to have the necessary in depth understanding or access to evidence across all goals and indicators to provide a reliable assessment and there is a risk that the results would not be considered valid amongst key stakeholders without wider participation an expert driven assessment also means that city stakeholders miss out on participating in the dialogue that leads to the scoring which applications of the wsc index to date have shown to be an effective way to share knowledge and generate commitment to action to improve scores 5 illustrative case study applications we now demonstrate application of the wsc index by presenting three case study cities in contrasting contexts ranging from metropolitan scale greater sydney hammer et al 2018 regional city city of greater bendigo rogers et al 2018 to municipal council moonee valley city council lloyd et al 2016 5 1 comparing wsc index results table 4 briefly outlines the context of each city and compares their wsc index results in order to highlight key insights the tool was able to reveal leading to discussion of how these insights supported the development of specific management responses across the different contexts the radar charts show the cities performances against the seven wsc goals 5 2 interpreting wsc index results when interpreting the results in table 4 it is important to remember that the purpose of the wsc index and the intent of the assessment methodology is not to determine precise scores rather it is to understand the water sensitive performance of the system relative to an aspirational benchmark or other comparable cities so that opportunities for management responses can be identified hence while the results may be expressed with a precise number between 0 and 5 where 0 indicates the lowest and 5 the highest performance relative to the water sensitive city aspirations it is important to attribute meaning from the results with careful reference to the specific indicators that are diagnosed to be performance enhancing or inhibiting comparing performance across cities will require analysis of the types of ongoing challenges and potential management responses for specific indicators rather than drawing sweeping insights based on their aggregated scores the following analysis will show how such comparison can reveal valuable detail on key aspects of a city s urban water services the wsc index goal scores averaged across component indicators in the three cities ranged from 2 to 4 indicating a moderate level of overall performance however looking at the scores on the individual goal and indicator level reveals contrasting performances all three cities scored highest on achieve equity of essential services which is not surprising given the generally high performance of australian water utilities in the provision of basic water supply and sanitation services bendigo is reliably serviced by a network of drainage systems managed by the local government agency on this aspect bendigo performed slightly better than sydney and moonee valley sydney s lower drainage performance reflects an uneven distribution of flood protection across the city with some inhabitants at greater risk of flooding hammer et al 2018 while a range of flood related risk analyses and strategies were being implemented at the municipal or sub catchment levels they were not strategically aligned with one another limiting opportunities for learning and scaling up at the catchment level meanwhile in moonee valley rainfall events generally do not disrupt everyday activities although there are known localised flooding issues and inconsistent planning controls which has resulted in some overland flow paths being built over sydney demonstrated higher performance for improve ecological health than bendigo and moonee valley while point source pollution in bendigo is well managed and there is growing acknowledgement of the need to manage diffuse source pollution adoption of new industry standards for stormwater management are yet to be mainstreamed in established suburbs similarly in moonee valley compliance to best practice stormwater discharge guidelines can also be improved while major waterway corridors are accessible to community active recreation infrastructures such as bicycle and walking paths can be increased along smaller blue green assets e g ponds wetlands moonee valley shows the highest relative performance for improve productivity and resource efficiency compared to sydney and bendigo this reflects a range of efforts by the municipality to implement decentralised alternative supplies stormwater harvesting projects for reuse in local parks and ongoing wsud working groups with multidisciplinary representation whilst these achievements are encouraging there remains significant room for improvement to reach a high level of water cycle performance in the municipality volume of water reuse for instance remains low compared to mains water sydney has diversified its water sources although significant challenges remain in implementing stormwater harvesting and other recycling measures as a viable option at scale bendigo has also promoted diversification of water sources including rainwater tanks bores and wastewater recycling and reuse however water demands in bendigo have grown in recent years and remain quite high despite evidence of some improvement in water management and urban design approaches attainment of an ideal wsc state across the three cases remained elusive in sydney although the overall score for water security and public health was high there is a clear need to integrate governance innovations to increase the city s overall water sensitivity for bendigo while there is evidence of strategic city greening and investments in stormwater harvesting projects there remains relatively few examples of other water sensitive infrastructure such as raingardens the benefit of nature based solutions for mitigating urban heat for instance has not been understood by many residents and overall tree canopy cover appears to have been reduced in moonee valley evidence showed that the municipality s approach in advancing water sensitive practices has been driven by demand management following australia s millennium drought 1997 2010 while this period saw widespread installation of water saving fittings fixtures and appliances water usage has since bounced back to 200 250 l person day across residential and industrial sectors to reach a wsc state management actions that lead to multi functional outcomes need to be implemented more widely across the three cities 5 3 using wsc index results experience in assessing the water sensitive performance of more than 50 cities to date shows the wsc index results can be used in a variety of ways to inform the development of management actions and strategies in response to key priorities examples from this paper s three illustrative cases are given here application of the wsc index in sydney generated high level strategic recommendations that identified priority issues for the short to medium term the city wide benchmarking informed by perspectives from a range of municipal council areas enabled a systematic understanding of the drivers challenges and opportunities for improved water sensitivity the process also strengthened relationships among participants through engaging in new types of discussions with different people and organisations and sharing lessons and experiences from across the city while it was useful to have a metropolitan wide wsc index result participants and facilitators of the sydney application reflected that the aggregated scores at the metropolitan level disguised a high degree of variation in performance across the large geographical and administrative region participants therefore saw value in follow up applications of the wsc index at the sub city and or municipal scale to derive more tailored management actions in response to local issues bendigo participants engaged in a further process to prioritise indicators for strategic action following the benchmarking workshop stakeholders have since committed to an ongoing network of wsc champions who meet regularly and follow up on agreed actions the wsc index and associated processes has led the leaders of key agencies to establish a clear mandate for implementing the changes needed to improve the scores of these priority indicators they plan to reassess bendigo in three years to monitor their progress towards their water sensitive aspirations for moonee valley a nine point action plan was developed using the wsc index results which has provided an overarching framework to guide initiatives across the municipality to advance towards the wsc these actions span on ground practices enabling structures and socio political capital 6 discussion applications to date including both municipal and metropolitan cities have shown that the wsc index can provide reliable meaningful insight across different contexts including coastal and inland locations temperate and tropical climates dense and sparse populations major cities and regional centres within australia and internationally while workshop participants in different cities found that some indicators were less relevant at the municipal scale and some were more challenging to uniformly apply at the metropolitan scale there was value in scoring all indicators for the selected scale of application to lead to meaningful insights about the area s water sensitivity and point to management actions to improve scores the design of the wsc index as a quantitative framework with qualitative rating descriptions and a process based assessment methodology has helped it be applicable across diverse contexts the indicator descriptions allow for contextual interpretations of the indicators while maintaining a robust universal framework that enables city comparison and benchmarking the scoring approach means it is feasible to benchmark any city where there is sufficient stakeholder interest even in situations where there is a lack of quantitative data this is because the evidence needed to determine the wsc index scores is typically readily accessible for example in the form of organisational policies strategies and reports or in the tacit knowledge of key individuals early testing indonesia south africa china fiji and myanmar showed the potential value of the wsc index for developing cities elaboration on this is beyond the scope of this paper beyond suggesting that refinement through further international testing would be valuable to ensure the indicator and rating descriptions are sufficiently robust for universal application for example it may be that finer granularity is needed in the lower rating scores for some indicators or that additional indicators may be needed to suit the particular conditions of developing city contexts for example informal settlements the participatory assessment methodology became a central focus for the wsc index s development and application a novel finding of this research emphasis on a well facilitated process was initially to ensure providers were consistent in how they engaged participants in scoring deliberations however applications of the wsc index to date have revealed a range of unanticipated benefits from the assessment process that would not have been achieved through a desktop assessment methodology workshop participants consistently report that the wsc index framework and workshop process a increased their understanding of wsc principles concepts solutions and practices b introduced them to people who would be important to collaborate and coordinate with to achieve water sensitive outcomes c facilitated new cross sectoral conversations between stakeholders d helped the group develop a collective understanding of their water system context and key drivers e led the group to articulate a shared set of aspirational outcomes for their future water system and f gave them insight into relevant policies programs and other initiatives from other departments and external organisations these insights reinforce findings from studies on the value of participatory processes e g olsson et al 2006 rijke et al 2013 and point to a promising direction for the design of other indicator initiatives beyond water particularly those aiming to drive system change through collaboration and learning across multi sectoral policy makers strategists and practitioners further development of the wsc index could integrate diagnostic filters that interpret the goal and indicator scores in different ways depending on the interest perspective and communication needs of the end user for example the indicator scores could be analysed through the urban water transition framework fig 1 brown et al 2009 to determine a city state benchmark this would allow a city s results to be interpreted with respect to their progress towards the water supply city sewered city drained city waterways city water cycle city and ultimately the wsc helping to give meaning to their results in relation to city state aspirations another potential diagnostic filter is the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs united nations 2015 with which the wsc index has many points of alignment their integration could help city stakeholders assess how improvements to their city s water sensitive performance may contribute to the achievement of sdg targets and vice versa these and other diagnostic filters would support users to gain critical insights into the current state of the urban water services and develop management actions that will address key priorities finally meta analysis of city data collected through the assessment process beyond simple overlaying of results for visual interpretation and ranking of aggregate scores would help to gain comparative insight the water sensitive strengths and weaknesses of cities in diverse contexts meta analysis of data collected longitudinally would also generate insight on the effectiveness of management actions in improving a city s water sensitivity providing an invaluable database for research into water sensitive city transitions 7 conclusion this paper presents for the first time a framework for defining water sensitive performance across the full range of technical social ecological governance economic liveability multi functional and adaptive attributes that are becoming recognised as important features of future water systems in building on established indicators and developing new measures that address gaps in existing water related metrics the wsc index offers a robust and industry relevant tool and process for diagnosing a city s strengths and weaknesses in relation to its water sensitive aspirations and guiding management responses that will help improve a city s water sensitivity rapid uptake of the wsc index in australia highlights its value in helping stakeholders develop collective commitment and evidence based priorities for action to accelerate their city s water sensitive transition we have demonstrated application of the wsc index through three illustrative case studies showing how it can be used to generate insights for benchmarking a city s water sensitive performance setting operational targets for improvement developing management responses and monitoring progress towards its water sensitive aspirations comparing the case study results across the seven wsc index goals reveals which specific aspects of urban water servicing and management responses can be enhanced to strengthen water sensitive principles the case applications also show the suitability of the wsc index tool across a range of biophysical and socio political contexts including large metropolitan scale regional city and municipality with different climates and demography the outlook for the wsc index as a valuable benchmarking and diagnostic tool to support the assessment of urban water services in practice appears positive with applications continuing across australia there has also been increasing interest from international cities further testing and refinement of the wsc index in diverse contexts will help realise its full potential as a global tool there may also be additional diagnostic filters that would provide new ways of interpreting and communicating the wsc index results innovation in the assessment methodology may present opportunity to increase the flexibility of application for example by utilising online collaboration platforms especially relevant in the current covid 19 pandemic finally there would be value in complementing the wsc index s focus on material outcomes of water sensitive practices with transitions focused frameworks that can provide guidance on the process of change itself such as how to drive organisational cultural change enhance collaborative practices and establish enabling institutional structures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
