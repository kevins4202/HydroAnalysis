2010,export coefficients of nutrients from nonpoint sources are significant parameters in managing nutrient loading into coastal waters estimating the export coefficients based solely on field measurements requires water sampling at multiple sites with different land use characteristics in a watershed which leads to high sampling costs in this study we propose a method that combines simulation tools and observed data at a single point to inversely estimate the export coefficients for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp from different land uses in one of the most important watersheds of western japan combining the results from a physically based distributed runoff model with nutrients observed concentrations at a single point near the estuary multiple linear regression mlr models for predicting nutrient loads in the mainstream were developed geographical and observed meteorological data were used to simulate the total direct runoff discharged from each land use type during rainfall events adding time series and climate deviation detection into the mlr observed data from 24 months between april 2010 and march 2012 were split into two sets to construct two mlrs for each nutrient and obtain two sets of annual export coefficients the applicability of the obtained export coefficients was tested in numerical simulations for the studied area using a physically distributed hydro chemical model verification and validation at different time resolutions of the export coefficient sets were performed and found to be highly satisfactory for estimating loads in the mainstream for both nutrients the presented method implementation reduces the amount of observed data jointly avoiding data transformation and excessive data filtering issues additionally it has shown to be effective in considering the influence of the typical extreme climatic events in east asia typhoons rainy season etc on the estimation of the export coefficients keywords export coefficient linear regression nonpoint source watershed modeling total nitrogen total phosphorous data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the geological and geographical characteristics of a water reservoir are directly related to the water quality however the severe deterioration of ecosystems and most human health problems associated with water consumption and its usage have anthropogenic causes vitousek et al 1997 access to water is a human right and governments and international organizations are responsible for securing water reservoirs and guaranteeing their availability and access to people un general assembly 2010 for modern societies one of the most significant challenges to achieving sustainable development is solving most issues associated with water resources management and water pollution arenas s√°nchez et al 2016 pollution sources can be divided at the basin scale into point and nonpoint sources point source pollution can be easily tracked because it is punctual and easy to identify and quantify carpenter et al 1998 nonpoint source pollution is diffuse pollution driven by human activities and changes in land use novotny 2003 major nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous are critical for maintaining terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems but their unbalanced concentrations can lead to severe environmental problems derived from eutrophication processes conley et al 2009 nitrogen and phosphorous are common constituents of agricultural fertilizers sewage waters and industrial wastewaters having importance as pollutants in superficial waters from medium to high in urban farming and agricultural land uses fuhrer et al 1999 responsible and efficient watershed management involves estimating point and nonpoint source loads of major nutrients to determine the amount of land derived nutrients in water bodies and aquatic systems and to prevent environmental damage nutrient export coefficients are valuable tools for estimating nonpoint source pollution in hydrological systems hence many efforts are made to improve their determination the main problems when estimating watershed export coefficients are the theoretical considerations and the amount and quality of the observed data required to scale and extend those coefficients applicability to an entire river basin among the most common challenges are the isolation of water catchments from each land use the high costs associated with obtaining long series of observed water quality and streamflow data in multiple points and scaling the coefficients for an entire basin shrestha et al 2008 over the past decades many strategies have been suggested to improve the quality of the export coefficients using empirical numerical methods distributed hydrological simulation tools and both approaches together still identifying pollution sources and their relative weights as much as the representability of the obtained coefficients at the basin level remain challenging watershed modeling is one of the most commonly extended and valuable tools for assessing practical environmental issues and solving a wide range of water environmental problems including pollutants transport and their quantification the modeling approach for estimating nonpoint source loads can be empirical physical based or a mix of both since the effectivity of the export coefficient model ecm was proved by johnes 1996 the idea that nutrient loads are the sum of individual sources in a basin was extended as a part of more complex physical models ding et al 2010 improved the original empirical ecm adding the effect of precipitation and terrain heterogeneity in a more generalized export coefficients estimation moreover many studies have been conducted on the physical and physical empirical modeling approaches hodge and armstrong 1993 proposed exploiting the direct relationship between stormwater land use and export coefficients to estimate nonpoint source pollution shrestha et al 2008 presented a methodological framework for environmental assessments that includes an empirical source contribution model to estimate export coefficients and their integration in catchment modeling using common water quality data from a mainstream hua et al 2019 identified individual agricultural nonpoint sources and their relative contributions to mainstream at the sub basin level wang et al 2020 proposed using dynamic export coefficients to better represent river basin heterogeneity and minimize the scaling problems associated with global export coefficients despite the above and similar approaches the problem of complex mathematical expressions that link variables in empirical models and the requirement for a large amount of observed data to reduce uncertainties remain unsolved this study proposes a combined physical empirical method to inversely estimate the export coefficients at the basin scale using a multiple linear regression mlr model in hydrology regression models can explain relationships between variables and desired responses in a relatively easy to implement and straightforward manner since many distributional parameters are expected to correlate and directly interact with system variables in the form of ordinary least squares or multivariate linear regression models in complex hydrological systems helsel and hirsch 2002 the original idea that the pollutant load can be estimated from the river streamflow land runoff discharge and pollutant concentration at any point in the water body as a function of the land use distribution and the water catchment upstream of the observation point proposed by hodge and armstrong 1993 was modified annual rain events were considered to add to the model the strong correlation between rainfall nutrient load and river concentration haygarth et al 2004 yang et al 2017 and the importance of rainfall and terrain heterogeneities in nonpoint source pollution studies and export coefficients estimation ding et al 2010 observed water quality mainstream data were combined with the simulated total direct runoff from each land use during rainfall events which added a temporal distribution to the multiple linear regression mlr considered the seasonal deviations and helped detect variabilities from linearity this study defines direct runoff as the water over the land surface and the first 30 cm of soil layer a in figure s1 that flows towards stream channels after rainfall or snowmelt the data were regressed using a robust method for estimating the export coefficients this method avoided excessive data filtering and considered the statistical data distribution caused for the presence of extreme meteorological events like typhoons or long periods of heavy rain that are common in east asia 2 methods and models 2 1 study site the kako river is one of the largest rivers in western japan with a catchment area of approximately 1 730 km2 and is located east of hyogo prefecture fig 1 the length of the kako river mainstream is approximately 100 km and is the most important contributor to the freshwater and land derived nutrients of harima nada harada and tanda 2011 yoshida et al 2010 harima nada is one of the numerous marine basins of the seto inland sea where the past eutrophication problems have turned into oligotrophication issues affecting fish catchment the seaweed production and endangering many regional pelagic species abo et al 2018 abo and yamamoto 2019 yanagi 2015 previous research has found that the nutrient concentrations in harima nada could be significantly affected by rivers and land derived loads due to its enclosed geography and water circulation dynamics abo et al 2018 abo and yamamoto 2019 according to geographic information provided by the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit more than 60 of the total area of the kako river watershed contains forests and mountains while the rest splits among other land use types for this study five representative classes of land use were used mountain 66 4 paddy fields 18 7 city 11 3 farm 1 0 and water bodies 2 6 the average rain event concentration on the mainstream for tn and tp in the kako river is 1 0 mg l and 0 10 mg l with a standard deviation of 0 2 and 0 04 mg l respectively 2 2 computational domain framework and data sets fig 2 shows the locations of the observatory stations used to collect different types of data in this study a and the land use distribution of the four representative nutrient input sources in the kako river basin b e using geographical information system gis datasets and processing tools the total area of the kako river basin was represented as a mesh of 1 1 km cells gis datasets for elevation land use watershed boundaries and river channels were obtained from the national land numerical information system ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit 2022 the streamflow data and location of the mainstream discharge observatories correspond to the japanese water information system ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit 2022 the water information system has monitoring stations that automatically collect hourly information on the mainstream discharge and water levels among other parameters for the studied period from the three observatory stations along the mainstream of the kako river fig 2 a only stations d2 and d3 had available datasets for tuning and validating the hydrological model temperature wind speed solar irradiance water vapor pressure precipitation and atmospheric pressure datasets were obtained from the meteorological observatories and automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas japan meteorological agency jma 2022 information from the amedas stations was assigned to the basin mesh using the thiessen polygon method because the kako river watershed is a mountainous region and the interpolation method does not consider the significant orographic influence of rain and temperature goovaerts 1999 both values were corrected for each cell according to a digital elevation map dem temperature and precipitation were corrected using equations 1 and 2 respectively where t j is the temperature in the j th cell k t v 0 is the observed temperature at the assigned station k Œ≥ is the lapse rate k m 1 and z is the difference in altitude between the elevation of the corresponding cell and an observatory m in equation 2 the precipitation in the j cell r j mm was estimated using the observed precipitation value at the station r s 0 mm altitude correction coefficient c Œ≥ m 1 1 t j t v 0 Œ≥ z 2 r j r s 0 1 c Œ≥ z the observed river concentration values for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp corresponded to the samples collected at the chemical observatory near the estuary which receives water from more than 90 of the watershed area and integrates the nutrient contributions from the entire basin fig 2 a water samples were collected daily and analyzed at the hyogo institute of environmental sciences hies from april 2010 to march 2012 unpublished data sampling and instrumental analysis of the samples were conducted according to guidelines published previously in the examination plan to restore materials circulation in sea areas study in the northeastern harima nada 2013 forestation datasets were obtained from the biodiversity center of japan biodiversity center of japan 2022 all datasets are summarized in table s1 2 3 study period and rainfall events the study was conducted over 24 months between april 2010 and march 2012 to research the influence of annual rainfall variations and because validation of the results was required for simulation results the observed data series for the tn and tp were split into two subsets of 12 months one subset was used to estimate the export coefficients and the other to validate the obtained results year i included the 12 months between april 2010 and march 2011 and year ii included the remaining 12 months april 2011 to march 2012 the cumulative precipitation values for years i and ii april to march were compared with the annual average estimations for the same months between 2006 and 2015 it was found that the total precipitation for year i 1 470 mm was very close to the annual average approximately 1 510 mm year whereas for year ii the total precipitation was 30 higher in addition the total cumulative precipitation during year ii was considered an outlier because its value was the highest among the ten years used to estimate the average value for the area see figure s2 a because of the aforementioned differences it was decided to separate the analysis into two cases i and ii for case i data from april 2010 to march 2011 were used to construct the mlr and the following 12 months were used to validate the obtained export coefficients performance using the physically distributed hydrological model for case ii data from year ii april 2011 march 2012 were used for constructing the mlr and the previous 12 months were used for validation the direct runoff from each land use type during each rain event was used as the regression variable adding rain duration and intensity to the model to identify rainfall events the hourly average rainfall in the basin was used and the duration of the events was defined from the start of rainfall precipitation different to zero to one hour before it started raining again the intensity and duration of the individual rainfall events were obtained by summation as a result 821 rain events were identified between april 2010 and march 2012 399 during year i and 422 during year ii 2 4 linear regression model 2 4 1 data handling in the entire basin the direct runoff contribution to the total mainstream discharge at the chemical observatory was estimated by hourly tracing the direct runoff of each land use using simulation results from the physically distributed hydrological model fig 3 the simulated direct runoff of the individual land uses was matched with the identified rainfall events and used as a regression variable in the mlr the concentrations of tn and tp in the mainstream were linearly interpolated to smooth the values when estimating the hourly tn and tp loads in the mainstream to verify that the linearity assumption between nutrient load and discharged water in the kako river was correct the average observed load tn or tp in the mainstream was plotted against the average total direct runoff during each rainfall event over the entire period figure s3 from the beginning of april until the end of october yearly rainy and typhoon seasons occur in japan adding significant outliers extreme rainfall events to accurately predict the watershed s standard conditions the maximum number of outliers was considered in the proposed mlr a robust regression method was used to adjust the regression model to handle heteroscedasticity problems and avoid issues associated with data power transformations and the significance of the constants derived from the regression the iterative reweighted least squares method irls was the robust regression method chosen because it can be used in multivariate systems see considerations for its implementation in table s4 and figures s9 and s10 additionally this method can be applied when data has an unequal variance and buffers the outliers pulling effect on the intercept and slope of the mlr kutner et al 2005 the huber and bisquare weight functions were selected to adjust the regression weights scaled studentized residuals were used to increase the sensitivity of the fitting due to direct runoff outliers the tuning values for both weight functions were chosen to provide a 95 efficiency of the regression estimator 1 345 for the huber function and 4 685 for the bisquare function the iterative process was conducted until the difference between the mlr coefficients for the j th and j th 1 iteration steps was less than 5 2 4 2 the mlr the assumptions of hodge and armstrong 1993 can be described by equation 3 where for each i th land use type tl is the total pollutant load from the i th land use kg s 1 Œ± i is the associated pollutant concentration kg m 3 and qs i is the runoff discharge from the i th land use m3 s 1 during the k th rainfall event from the initial four land uses for which the hydro chemical model requires input parameters and data mountain paddy city and farms it was decided to collapse the city and farm land uses into one land use for the construction of the mlr the most important reasons for doing this were 1 farm land use represents only 1 0 of the kako river basin s total area 2 the farm locations overlap with the city areas and 3 the occupation ratio in the cells where farms were distributed is relatively small fig 2 e collapsing these two variables reduced the error in estimating the regression and export coefficients the new variable was expressed as the summation of the direct runoff flows in the mlr the average nutrient load in the mainstream was plotted against the direct runoff qs ik from each i th land use m mountain p paddy c city and f farm during the k th rainfall event to check the validity of the linear relationship between the mlr variables additionally a scatter plot matrix for the predictor variables qs ik was created to check whether there was a correlation between the regression variables but no significant trends were detected figures s4 and s5 under all the previous considerations the adjusted mlr takes the form of equation 4 where ps accounts for other contributions point source runoff erosion contribution etc and Œµ is the error term 3 tl k i Œ± i qs i k 4 t l k Œ± m q s m Œ± p q s p Œ± c f q s c q s f k p s Œµ from the datasets for year i and year ii two mlrs were obtained with their corresponding sets of Œ± i parameters for tn and tp the annual export coefficient for the i th land use w i kg ha 1 y 1 was calculated using equation 5 as the annual summation of the hourly h load from the i th land use Œ± i qs i kg h 1 divided by the total area a i of the i th land use in the basin ha 5 w i 1 a i h Œ± i q s i h 2 5 hydro chemical model the physically distributed model was used to numerically predict the mainstream water discharge and it was coupled with a hydro chemical model to estimate nutrient concentration in the chemical observatory the resolution and source of the datasets used for both model modules are summarized in table s1 2 5 1 hydrological model the physically distributed hydrological model was based on the hydrological river basin environment assessment model hydro beam from kojiri 2006 hydro beam is a four layered runoff model developed to estimate water quantity and quality under climate change scenarios by combining gis and meteorological data in this model the river basin is divided into cells of 1 1 km with a unique straight water channel per cell the direction of which is defined by the dem each land use type was weighted according to its occupation ratio per cell to estimate the corresponding infiltration values kojiri et al 2008 the direct runoff discharges from mountains urban areas and farms were modeled using the kinematic wave method whereas a linear storage model was used for the vertical groundwater exchange fluxes kojiri and park 2002 the hydraulic model is different for paddy land use because of the particular operating conditions of paddy fields a tank model with three holes is used where the upper hole is for direct runoff discharge the lateral hole is for base flow in the upper layer and the bottom hole represents the flow exchange with the groundwater layers see figure s1 2 5 2 nutrients load model nutrient loads were estimated using a conservative method that integrates advection diffusion lateral runoff and emission processes derived from the slopes provided using the dem this model is a modification of the transport model developed by ikenoue et al 2020 and was coupled to the hydrological model it does not consider chemical reactions or physicochemical processes such as the absorption or adsorption of nutrient species in soil particles or during sediment transport the transport processes considered are expressed as equation 6 where a r is the river channel cross sectional area m2 c tn is the concentration of nutrients in the river channel g m 3 u is the average cross sectional flow speed m s 1 d tn is the diffusivity coefficient of the nutrients m2 s 1 and f tn represents the lateral inflow of nutrients from the terrain slope g m 1 s 1 the term f tn in equation 6 accounts for the surface load that enters the river from land and was calculated using equation 7 this calculation was performed in every cell of the watershed mesh and added to obtain the entire area the j index is the identification number of each cell in the basin the term œâ i is the average exported concentration from each i th land use g m 3 qs i is the superficial water discharge runoff flow from each i th land use m3 s 1 and bl is the length of the river channel on each cell of the basin mesh m the value of œâ i was calculated from the annual export coefficients as shown in equation 8 where w i is the export coefficient of each i th land use g m 1s 1 qs i year is the total volume of direct runoff discharged per year from the i th land use m3 s 1 and a i is the total area of the i th land use in the river basin m2 6 t a r c t n x a r u c t n d

sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error observation standard deviation ratio rsr and the percentage of bias pbias were chosen as the quantitative statistics tools to evaluate the model performance and associated error see table s2 the guidelines described in moriasi et al 2007 were followed to clarify the simulations and model performance because they can be considered sufficiently strict to ensure the quality of the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 discharged water simulations before they were used in the construction of the mlr model mainstream discharge results from the hydrological model were validated against the observed data in the two observatories with increasing catchment areas d2 and d3 in fig 2 a from april 2010 to december 2011 to ensure the accuracy of the results observed data for 2012 were not available the hydrological model was evaluated at daily weekly and monthly resolutions for the r2 nse and rsr statistics a very high performance of the model was found at all resolutions for both observatories at all studied time resolutions the hyeto hydrographs and detailed performance statistics results for the mainstream discharge are presented in figure s6 and table s3 3 2 mlr and export coefficient analysis the export coefficient values are affected by rainfall and substantial differences in the annual and monthly precipitation values were observed between years i and ii figure s2 case i and case ii were used to visualize and study changes in the magnitude of the linear relationship between the regression and export coefficients between years for both nutrients on each land use according to equation 5 if the total area of land use does not change the value of one coefficient as a function of the other can only be influenced by changes in the annual direct runoff of the particular land use 3 2 1 tn export coefficients for both mlr models case i and case ii the irls method converged in the third iteration step filtering only five of over 399 rain events for case i and three of over 422 for case ii the export coefficients obtained for the mountain and city farm positively correlated with their corresponding regression coefficients when comparing year i and year ii table 1 the regression coefficients were almost constant in both cases however the export coefficients behaved differently for the mountain land use the export coefficient values were largely equal between years while for the city farm land use the obtained value for year ii was double that for year i the increase found for the city farm coefficient can be associated with differences in the direct runoff volumes discharged during year ii from this land use see fig 3 in paddy land use the relationship between regression and export coefficients varies to different extents both coefficients were positively correlated but the magnitude of the change in case i and case ii was approximately 4 1 for the regression and 2 1 for the export coefficients previous studies have shown that nutrient export coefficients for paddies are easily influenced by rain particularly during the fertilization period from may to june in east asia these rain events during fertilization periods can stabilize nutrient concentration very fast inside the paddy as well as provoke the leaching of nutrients into superficial freshwaters liao et al 2021 wang et al 2015 see figure s2 b moreover because of the paddy field s special operating characteristics the differences in the hydraulic model from that used for the other land use types can be responsible for a different type of correlation with rain that needs to be studied more table 2 summarizes the contribution ratios per land use for years i and ii as a first observation the annual tn load input was approximately 20 higher during year ii than during year i while the trend of the contribution per land use remained constant the city farm land use was the main contributor to the tn followed by mountain and paddy fields on the other hand their contribution ratios differed considerably between years during year ii the relative contributions of the mountain and paddies decreased by approximately 24 and 55 respectively while the city farm land use increased by approximately 65 in year ii the intercept Œ± 0 of the mlr accounts for point sources and other types of contributions for tn values were significantly close for years i and ii 100 4 and 115 5 kg h 1 respectively and the ratio of its contributions was almost constant table 2 these results were expected because point source contributions do not substantially change yearly unless critical economic or demographic changes occur the existent difference can be explained among other factors by the error associated with the regression model or the increase in the nitrogen wet deposition and soil runoff due to the additional 30 of precipitation recorded during that year 3 2 2 tp export coefficients for tp both mlr models converged on the 7th iteration filtering ten rain events each year i and ii the values of the export coefficients for tp table 1 showed less variation than those of the corresponding tn coefficients similar to their annual ratio contributions table 2 for the mountain and paddy land uses the export coefficients showed 30 increases in year ii compared to year i whereas for the city farm land use the values remained almost constant given these results it can be inferred from equation 5 that the magnitude of the runoff discharges per land use increased during year ii to maintain constant values of export coefficients a 30 increase in the regression coefficient for the mountain land use was found in year ii while for the paddy and city farm land uses the coefficients decreased by 30 in the same year since phosphorous availability was higher during year ii because soil runoff increased due to additional precipitation the average tp concentration from the mountain land use increased directly influencing the export coefficient on the contrary for the paddy and city farm land uses the decrease in the average concentration of tp indicated that soil runoff occurred to a lesser extent because of the type of soil coverage the trend of the contribution ratio of each land use as for tn did not change between years with the city farm land use being the main contributor followed by the mountain land use and then the paddy field land use table 2 when comparing the values of the total tp load input there was an increase of approximately 30 from year i to year ii also in comparing yearly contributions the total tp load input differences were smaller than those for tn the contribution ratios of the mountain and paddy land uses remained almost constant from year i to ii 5 and 1 4 relative differences respectively however for the city farm land use a 20 decrement in contribution was found the point source contributions for phosphorous are more restricted than those of nitrogen since primary sources of phosphorus pollution are sewage treatment plants and agricultural activities because of how the study was conducted contributions from other sources were expected to remain almost constant for tp as for tn however year ii s intercept value was 40 larger than that of year i table 1 this difference corresponds with an increment in the tp contribution from other sources of approximately 20 table 2 that may be associated with soil runoff and other mechanisms that substantially affect the amount and intensity of tp loads with rainfall for phosphorous the corresponding wet deposition values are on the order of 20 to 30 times smaller than those for nitrogen anderson and downing 2006 he et al 2011 hence this type of contribution is not significant enough to account for the difference on the other hand dry deposition and soil runoff contributions may be very significant when evaluating tp contributions to water bodies he et al 2011 riemersma et al 2006 yang and toor 2018 because more than 60 of the kako river basin s topography and land use corresponds to steep mountains changes in annual precipitation can easily influence soil runoff and erosion increasing tp availability and its transport into the mainstream moreover significant increases in tp concentrations or loads have been reported downstream of dams after discharge particularly during the rainy season and summer in east asia bao et al 2020 nukazawa et al 2017 the biggest of the kako river s dams is located very close upstream to the chemical observatory therefore its discharge may directly affect the observed tp concentrations pulling the value of the intercept of the mlr 3 3 export coefficient performance and model validation table 3 statistically summarizes the performance at all studied resolutions figs 3 and 4 show weekly and monthly hyeto load graphs of the average nutrient loads for cases i and ii daily resolution graphs are presented in the supplementary materials figures s7 and s8 verification and validation of the export coefficients were performed for cases i and ii daily weekly and monthly averaged nutrient loads were calculated from hourly simulated results in the chemical observatory 3 3 1 tn performance the tn export coefficients showed good or very good performance under cases i and ii during the 12 months of verification and the corresponding months of validation according to the proposed benchmark scores in moriasi et al 2007 for case i it was found from the evaluation of all the chosen statistics that the export coefficients and model performance were very good for the verification period at all resolutions during the validation period the daily resolution showed values for nse and rsr in the benchmark of satisfactory performance this indicates that the obtained export coefficients for case i at a higher resolution than weekly decreased their performance when the rainfall conditions differed considerably from the ones they were estimated from the performance at the weekly and monthly resolutions were evaluated as very good for all statistics when observing the performance statistics for the export coefficients of case ii a situation similar to case i was observed during the verification period the daily resolution showed lower values of nse in the benchmark of good performance while all other statistics were considered very good however for the validation period the export coefficients showed very good model performance at all time resolutions the decrease in the performance for simulating trends lower value of nse was less of a problem under case ii and occurred during the verification period for cases i and ii the performance in simulating the average magnitudes pbias was considered very good at all studied time resolutions besides the pbias values were higher in absolute value under case i additionally from the sign of pbias it can be inferred that the model underestimates the average tn loads under case i while the opposite occurred under case ii this can be seen in fig 3 where the simulation results are slightly lower than the observed values under case i green lines and higher in case ii purple lines at both time resolutions fig 3 also shows the strong correlation between the observed and simulated data and the good performance in simulating the observed trends which is consistent with the obtained r2 and nse values additionally a strong correlation between the observed and simulated data and the total rainfall was observed at both time resolutions 3 3 2 tp performance variations in the obtained export coefficients for tp with the amount of yearly precipitation in the watershed were more proportional than those for tn however the values obtained from the intercept of the mlr showed that the contributions from other sources were significantly different between years under case i the evaluated statistics during the verification period were in the benchmark of very good performance at all considered time resolutions however during the validation period the performance was lower the daily resolution statistics demonstrated only an acceptable performance at the weekly and monthly time resolutions the export coefficients performed better and the model s performance was considered good for reproducing trends higher nse values and residual variations smaller rsr values under case ii the performance statistics were better during the verification period the export coefficients showed very good performance at all resolution times see table 3 when analyzing the values for the validation period the performance was considered very good at all studied time resolutions in addition under case ii as for tn the export coefficients performed better in estimating slightly different conditions than those in which they were estimated validation period as observed for tn the model performed better when the time resolution was weeks or months more significant absolute values of pbias were found during the validation period under case i the model underestimated the average tp loads by approximately 30 which can be observed in fig 5 at both presented resolutions under case ii smaller differences were observed in the average magnitude of the tp load during the validation period the sign of pbias was negative under case ii at the daily and weekly time resolutions revealing a tendency to overestimate the average results which is also evident in fig 5 the simulation results fit better with the observed values for the export coefficients under case ii at both time resolutions smaller difference nevertheless the differences in the peaks were more significant for tp than for tn which could indicate that other types of processes not considered in this approach affect the tp load in the mainstream fig 5 3 3 3 general considerations on the mlr model performance and limitations extreme rain events have associated significant rainfall peaks and big direct runoff discharges into the mainstream in relatively short periods among the physical processes during these phenomena soil runoff and erosion are the most important ones and are translated into prominent peaks of nutrient concentration and load on the mainstream the physical mechanisms involved in soil runoff and erosion are very complex and have particular characteristics depending on the study site and the type of soil coverage on the same extension the relationships between nutrient availability and soil runoff and erosion are complex multivariant dependent and are affected by the aqueous solution properties of the substances under study which adds more variability and makes the reality more divergent from the simplicity of a linear approach in this work to keep the mlr model as simple as possible and because of the lack of data we did not consider any related term in the regression or the transport model to account for nutrient load contribution from soil runoff and erosion besides this the statistical analysis of the obtained results showed that model s performance is good for the kako river watershed but it must be necessary to adjust the mlr as well as the transport model to consider nutrient loads from soil runoff and erosion processes in those places where the phenomena are common the mathematical approach used in this work to obtain the mlr models for both study cases was the irls method the method gives weight to the regression variables to normalize the distribution of the residues which means that those values that are close to the mean of the distribution have high weights for the regression close to 1 and the weight of the outliers vary depending on their leverage it can go as low as zero around 1 and 2 5 of the rain events weighted zero in constructing the mlr model for tn and tp load correspondingly and were discarded those particular rain events can be categorized as extreme and their impact on the data distribution was so high that they were outside the linearity conditions the irls method maximizes the number of points considered when building a regression model but pulls down the regression coefficients to normalize the distribution of the regressed variable as a result the obtained model tends to underestimate outliers to a similar extent as the corresponding weight of their relative leverage from the regression model which can be noticed in the obtained values of pbias positive values for the studied nutrients in both cases the present methodology has more limitations related to simplifying the approach to obtain general export coefficients and the amount of available data fixed export coefficients and a single observation point near the estuary are enough for smaller or similar sized watersheds to the one studied still further considerations should be made in those river basins with significantly more extensive areas and the present method needs to be tested and may not be suitable bigger river basins usually have well defined catchment areas with very different land uses that can significantly vary with time and generally fixed export coefficients are not representative of reality wang et al 2020 also in basins where the land uses are clustered independent of the watershed size more observation points are required and catchment areas must be precisely defined the present methodology does not differentiate between categories or sources of contribution for a particular land use because of its simplicity higher resolution land use data is needed to determine specific sources of contribution additionally considerations must be taken when using the obtained nutrient export coefficients under particular conditions export coefficients obtained when precipitation is higher than the annual average year ii showed better statistical performance when used in estimations of tn and tp loads in the mainstream under normal conditions but tend to overestimate the results table 3 on the other hand estimations from average rainfall conditions as in year i have lower model performance in particular conditions especially for tp the observed datasets used in this study particularly correspond to an average year i and a higher year i precipitation year in the studied area under these conditions with the land use distribution of the kako river watershed and because of the chosen methodology to handle the data it was not particularly observed the influence of fertilization periods and how they affect the nutrients load in the mainstream which is a point for further research in the future on the same line it was observed that the amount of precipitation affects the export coefficients values and their performance but to evaluate the extent of this observation in dry years in which rainfall is considerably lower than the averages more observed data is needed 4 conclusions tn and tp nonpoint source export coefficients were successfully estimated and validated in the kako river for the four major types of land use combining observed and simulated data from rain events it was possible to reduce the number of observation points to only one near the river estuary a robust regression method was applied to observed data containing extreme rain events successfully avoiding data transformations and the associated significance problems and excessive data filtering the selected hydrological model was found to be appropriate and showed good performance in reproducing mainstream discharges in both observatories chosen when analyzing the performance statistics the obtained tn and tp export coefficients showed very good performance in reproducing nutrient loads in the mainstream during the verification period in the corresponding years but they tend to underestimate the results however specific considerations about their validity and use need to be considered it can be concluded from the obtained results that annual rainfall differences of 30 or more can significantly downgrade the performance of the export coefficients in the model underestimating nutrient loads to a greater extent rainfall variations affect the value of different land use export coefficients depending on the type of nutrient to a different extent particularly for paddy land use export coefficients showed to be very sensitive to rainfall during its estimation independently of the nutrient from the intercept of the mlr model which accounts for other types of nutrient contributions it can be concluded that tp loads in the mainstream are more affected by annual rainfall variations in particular as previous research has found soil runoff and dam operation significantly impact mainstream tp loads soil runoff and erosion have an important role under extreme rainfall events so their addition to the current approach is an improvement for future works the presented approach has the advantage of being simple to implement with the appropriate amount of data and has shown to be statistically robust in its performance but its limitations need to be carefully analyzed this approach may be unsuitable for large continental river watersheds or those with high spatiotemporal variations the applicability and performance of the obtained export coefficients need to be tested and modifications to the implementation and mlr models should be required before their use when the study site conditions are considerably different funding information this research did not receive any specific grant funding

2010,export coefficients of nutrients from nonpoint sources are significant parameters in managing nutrient loading into coastal waters estimating the export coefficients based solely on field measurements requires water sampling at multiple sites with different land use characteristics in a watershed which leads to high sampling costs in this study we propose a method that combines simulation tools and observed data at a single point to inversely estimate the export coefficients for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp from different land uses in one of the most important watersheds of western japan combining the results from a physically based distributed runoff model with nutrients observed concentrations at a single point near the estuary multiple linear regression mlr models for predicting nutrient loads in the mainstream were developed geographical and observed meteorological data were used to simulate the total direct runoff discharged from each land use type during rainfall events adding time series and climate deviation detection into the mlr observed data from 24 months between april 2010 and march 2012 were split into two sets to construct two mlrs for each nutrient and obtain two sets of annual export coefficients the applicability of the obtained export coefficients was tested in numerical simulations for the studied area using a physically distributed hydro chemical model verification and validation at different time resolutions of the export coefficient sets were performed and found to be highly satisfactory for estimating loads in the mainstream for both nutrients the presented method implementation reduces the amount of observed data jointly avoiding data transformation and excessive data filtering issues additionally it has shown to be effective in considering the influence of the typical extreme climatic events in east asia typhoons rainy season etc on the estimation of the export coefficients keywords export coefficient linear regression nonpoint source watershed modeling total nitrogen total phosphorous data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the geological and geographical characteristics of a water reservoir are directly related to the water quality however the severe deterioration of ecosystems and most human health problems associated with water consumption and its usage have anthropogenic causes vitousek et al 1997 access to water is a human right and governments and international organizations are responsible for securing water reservoirs and guaranteeing their availability and access to people un general assembly 2010 for modern societies one of the most significant challenges to achieving sustainable development is solving most issues associated with water resources management and water pollution arenas s√°nchez et al 2016 pollution sources can be divided at the basin scale into point and nonpoint sources point source pollution can be easily tracked because it is punctual and easy to identify and quantify carpenter et al 1998 nonpoint source pollution is diffuse pollution driven by human activities and changes in land use novotny 2003 major nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous are critical for maintaining terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems but their unbalanced concentrations can lead to severe environmental problems derived from eutrophication processes conley et al 2009 nitrogen and phosphorous are common constituents of agricultural fertilizers sewage waters and industrial wastewaters having importance as pollutants in superficial waters from medium to high in urban farming and agricultural land uses fuhrer et al 1999 responsible and efficient watershed management involves estimating point and nonpoint source loads of major nutrients to determine the amount of land derived nutrients in water bodies and aquatic systems and to prevent environmental damage nutrient export coefficients are valuable tools for estimating nonpoint source pollution in hydrological systems hence many efforts are made to improve their determination the main problems when estimating watershed export coefficients are the theoretical considerations and the amount and quality of the observed data required to scale and extend those coefficients applicability to an entire river basin among the most common challenges are the isolation of water catchments from each land use the high costs associated with obtaining long series of observed water quality and streamflow data in multiple points and scaling the coefficients for an entire basin shrestha et al 2008 over the past decades many strategies have been suggested to improve the quality of the export coefficients using empirical numerical methods distributed hydrological simulation tools and both approaches together still identifying pollution sources and their relative weights as much as the representability of the obtained coefficients at the basin level remain challenging watershed modeling is one of the most commonly extended and valuable tools for assessing practical environmental issues and solving a wide range of water environmental problems including pollutants transport and their quantification the modeling approach for estimating nonpoint source loads can be empirical physical based or a mix of both since the effectivity of the export coefficient model ecm was proved by johnes 1996 the idea that nutrient loads are the sum of individual sources in a basin was extended as a part of more complex physical models ding et al 2010 improved the original empirical ecm adding the effect of precipitation and terrain heterogeneity in a more generalized export coefficients estimation moreover many studies have been conducted on the physical and physical empirical modeling approaches hodge and armstrong 1993 proposed exploiting the direct relationship between stormwater land use and export coefficients to estimate nonpoint source pollution shrestha et al 2008 presented a methodological framework for environmental assessments that includes an empirical source contribution model to estimate export coefficients and their integration in catchment modeling using common water quality data from a mainstream hua et al 2019 identified individual agricultural nonpoint sources and their relative contributions to mainstream at the sub basin level wang et al 2020 proposed using dynamic export coefficients to better represent river basin heterogeneity and minimize the scaling problems associated with global export coefficients despite the above and similar approaches the problem of complex mathematical expressions that link variables in empirical models and the requirement for a large amount of observed data to reduce uncertainties remain unsolved this study proposes a combined physical empirical method to inversely estimate the export coefficients at the basin scale using a multiple linear regression mlr model in hydrology regression models can explain relationships between variables and desired responses in a relatively easy to implement and straightforward manner since many distributional parameters are expected to correlate and directly interact with system variables in the form of ordinary least squares or multivariate linear regression models in complex hydrological systems helsel and hirsch 2002 the original idea that the pollutant load can be estimated from the river streamflow land runoff discharge and pollutant concentration at any point in the water body as a function of the land use distribution and the water catchment upstream of the observation point proposed by hodge and armstrong 1993 was modified annual rain events were considered to add to the model the strong correlation between rainfall nutrient load and river concentration haygarth et al 2004 yang et al 2017 and the importance of rainfall and terrain heterogeneities in nonpoint source pollution studies and export coefficients estimation ding et al 2010 observed water quality mainstream data were combined with the simulated total direct runoff from each land use during rainfall events which added a temporal distribution to the multiple linear regression mlr considered the seasonal deviations and helped detect variabilities from linearity this study defines direct runoff as the water over the land surface and the first 30 cm of soil layer a in figure s1 that flows towards stream channels after rainfall or snowmelt the data were regressed using a robust method for estimating the export coefficients this method avoided excessive data filtering and considered the statistical data distribution caused for the presence of extreme meteorological events like typhoons or long periods of heavy rain that are common in east asia 2 methods and models 2 1 study site the kako river is one of the largest rivers in western japan with a catchment area of approximately 1 730 km2 and is located east of hyogo prefecture fig 1 the length of the kako river mainstream is approximately 100 km and is the most important contributor to the freshwater and land derived nutrients of harima nada harada and tanda 2011 yoshida et al 2010 harima nada is one of the numerous marine basins of the seto inland sea where the past eutrophication problems have turned into oligotrophication issues affecting fish catchment the seaweed production and endangering many regional pelagic species abo et al 2018 abo and yamamoto 2019 yanagi 2015 previous research has found that the nutrient concentrations in harima nada could be significantly affected by rivers and land derived loads due to its enclosed geography and water circulation dynamics abo et al 2018 abo and yamamoto 2019 according to geographic information provided by the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit more than 60 of the total area of the kako river watershed contains forests and mountains while the rest splits among other land use types for this study five representative classes of land use were used mountain 66 4 paddy fields 18 7 city 11 3 farm 1 0 and water bodies 2 6 the average rain event concentration on the mainstream for tn and tp in the kako river is 1 0 mg l and 0 10 mg l with a standard deviation of 0 2 and 0 04 mg l respectively 2 2 computational domain framework and data sets fig 2 shows the locations of the observatory stations used to collect different types of data in this study a and the land use distribution of the four representative nutrient input sources in the kako river basin b e using geographical information system gis datasets and processing tools the total area of the kako river basin was represented as a mesh of 1 1 km cells gis datasets for elevation land use watershed boundaries and river channels were obtained from the national land numerical information system ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit 2022 the streamflow data and location of the mainstream discharge observatories correspond to the japanese water information system ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism of japan mlit 2022 the water information system has monitoring stations that automatically collect hourly information on the mainstream discharge and water levels among other parameters for the studied period from the three observatory stations along the mainstream of the kako river fig 2 a only stations d2 and d3 had available datasets for tuning and validating the hydrological model temperature wind speed solar irradiance water vapor pressure precipitation and atmospheric pressure datasets were obtained from the meteorological observatories and automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas japan meteorological agency jma 2022 information from the amedas stations was assigned to the basin mesh using the thiessen polygon method because the kako river watershed is a mountainous region and the interpolation method does not consider the significant orographic influence of rain and temperature goovaerts 1999 both values were corrected for each cell according to a digital elevation map dem temperature and precipitation were corrected using equations 1 and 2 respectively where t j is the temperature in the j th cell k t v 0 is the observed temperature at the assigned station k Œ≥ is the lapse rate k m 1 and z is the difference in altitude between the elevation of the corresponding cell and an observatory m in equation 2 the precipitation in the j cell r j mm was estimated using the observed precipitation value at the station r s 0 mm altitude correction coefficient c Œ≥ m 1 1 t j t v 0 Œ≥ z 2 r j r s 0 1 c Œ≥ z the observed river concentration values for total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp corresponded to the samples collected at the chemical observatory near the estuary which receives water from more than 90 of the watershed area and integrates the nutrient contributions from the entire basin fig 2 a water samples were collected daily and analyzed at the hyogo institute of environmental sciences hies from april 2010 to march 2012 unpublished data sampling and instrumental analysis of the samples were conducted according to guidelines published previously in the examination plan to restore materials circulation in sea areas study in the northeastern harima nada 2013 forestation datasets were obtained from the biodiversity center of japan biodiversity center of japan 2022 all datasets are summarized in table s1 2 3 study period and rainfall events the study was conducted over 24 months between april 2010 and march 2012 to research the influence of annual rainfall variations and because validation of the results was required for simulation results the observed data series for the tn and tp were split into two subsets of 12 months one subset was used to estimate the export coefficients and the other to validate the obtained results year i included the 12 months between april 2010 and march 2011 and year ii included the remaining 12 months april 2011 to march 2012 the cumulative precipitation values for years i and ii april to march were compared with the annual average estimations for the same months between 2006 and 2015 it was found that the total precipitation for year i 1 470 mm was very close to the annual average approximately 1 510 mm year whereas for year ii the total precipitation was 30 higher in addition the total cumulative precipitation during year ii was considered an outlier because its value was the highest among the ten years used to estimate the average value for the area see figure s2 a because of the aforementioned differences it was decided to separate the analysis into two cases i and ii for case i data from april 2010 to march 2011 were used to construct the mlr and the following 12 months were used to validate the obtained export coefficients performance using the physically distributed hydrological model for case ii data from year ii april 2011 march 2012 were used for constructing the mlr and the previous 12 months were used for validation the direct runoff from each land use type during each rain event was used as the regression variable adding rain duration and intensity to the model to identify rainfall events the hourly average rainfall in the basin was used and the duration of the events was defined from the start of rainfall precipitation different to zero to one hour before it started raining again the intensity and duration of the individual rainfall events were obtained by summation as a result 821 rain events were identified between april 2010 and march 2012 399 during year i and 422 during year ii 2 4 linear regression model 2 4 1 data handling in the entire basin the direct runoff contribution to the total mainstream discharge at the chemical observatory was estimated by hourly tracing the direct runoff of each land use using simulation results from the physically distributed hydrological model fig 3 the simulated direct runoff of the individual land uses was matched with the identified rainfall events and used as a regression variable in the mlr the concentrations of tn and tp in the mainstream were linearly interpolated to smooth the values when estimating the hourly tn and tp loads in the mainstream to verify that the linearity assumption between nutrient load and discharged water in the kako river was correct the average observed load tn or tp in the mainstream was plotted against the average total direct runoff during each rainfall event over the entire period figure s3 from the beginning of april until the end of october yearly rainy and typhoon seasons occur in japan adding significant outliers extreme rainfall events to accurately predict the watershed s standard conditions the maximum number of outliers was considered in the proposed mlr a robust regression method was used to adjust the regression model to handle heteroscedasticity problems and avoid issues associated with data power transformations and the significance of the constants derived from the regression the iterative reweighted least squares method irls was the robust regression method chosen because it can be used in multivariate systems see considerations for its implementation in table s4 and figures s9 and s10 additionally this method can be applied when data has an unequal variance and buffers the outliers pulling effect on the intercept and slope of the mlr kutner et al 2005 the huber and bisquare weight functions were selected to adjust the regression weights scaled studentized residuals were used to increase the sensitivity of the fitting due to direct runoff outliers the tuning values for both weight functions were chosen to provide a 95 efficiency of the regression estimator 1 345 for the huber function and 4 685 for the bisquare function the iterative process was conducted until the difference between the mlr coefficients for the j th and j th 1 iteration steps was less than 5 2 4 2 the mlr the assumptions of hodge and armstrong 1993 can be described by equation 3 where for each i th land use type tl is the total pollutant load from the i th land use kg s 1 Œ± i is the associated pollutant concentration kg m 3 and qs i is the runoff discharge from the i th land use m3 s 1 during the k th rainfall event from the initial four land uses for which the hydro chemical model requires input parameters and data mountain paddy city and farms it was decided to collapse the city and farm land uses into one land use for the construction of the mlr the most important reasons for doing this were 1 farm land use represents only 1 0 of the kako river basin s total area 2 the farm locations overlap with the city areas and 3 the occupation ratio in the cells where farms were distributed is relatively small fig 2 e collapsing these two variables reduced the error in estimating the regression and export coefficients the new variable was expressed as the summation of the direct runoff flows in the mlr the average nutrient load in the mainstream was plotted against the direct runoff qs ik from each i th land use m mountain p paddy c city and f farm during the k th rainfall event to check the validity of the linear relationship between the mlr variables additionally a scatter plot matrix for the predictor variables qs ik was created to check whether there was a correlation between the regression variables but no significant trends were detected figures s4 and s5 under all the previous considerations the adjusted mlr takes the form of equation 4 where ps accounts for other contributions point source runoff erosion contribution etc and Œµ is the error term 3 tl

the annual export coefficient for the i th land use w i kg ha 1 y 1 was calculated using equation 5 as the annual summation of the hourly h load from the i th land use Œ± i qs i kg h 1 divided by the total area a i of the i th land use in the basin ha 5 w i 1 a i h Œ± i q s i h 2 5 hydro chemical model the physically distributed model was used to numerically predict the mainstream water discharge and it was coupled with a hydro chemical model to estimate nutrient concentration in the chemical observatory the resolution and source of the datasets used for both model modules are summarized in table s1 2 5 1 hydrological model the physically distributed hydrological model was based on the hydrological river basin environment assessment model hydro beam from kojiri 2006 hydro beam is a four layered runoff model developed to estimate water quantity and quality under climate change scenarios by combining gis and meteorological data in this model the river basin is divided into cells of 1 1 km with a unique straight water channel per cell the direction of which is defined by the dem each land use type was weighted according to its occupation ratio per cell to estimate the corresponding infiltration values kojiri et al 2008 the direct runoff discharges from mountains urban areas and farms were modeled using the kinematic wave method whereas a linear storage model was used for the vertical groundwater exchange fluxes kojiri and park 2002 the hydraulic model is different for paddy land use because of the particular operating conditions of paddy fields a tank model with three holes is used where the upper hole is for direct runoff discharge the lateral hole is for base flow in the upper layer and the bottom hole represents the flow exchange with the groundwater layers see figure s1 2 5 2 nutrients load model nutrient loads were estimated using a conservative method that integrates advection diffusion lateral runoff and emission processes derived from the slopes provided using the dem this model is a modification of the transport model developed by ikenoue et al 2020 and was coupled to the hydrological model it does not consider chemical reactions or physicochemical processes such as the absorption or adsorption of nutrient species in soil particles or during sediment transport the transport processes considered are expressed as equation 6 where a r is the river channel cross sectional area m2 c tn is the concentration of nutrients in the river channel g m 3 u is the average cross sectional flow speed m s 1 d tn is the diffusivity coefficient of the nutrients m2 s 1 and f tn represents the lateral inflow of nutrients from the terrain slope g m 1 s 1 the term f tn in equation 6 accounts for the surface load that enters the river from land and was calculated using equation 7 this calculation was performed in every cell of the watershed mesh and added to obtain the entire area the j index is the identification number of each cell in the basin the term œâ i is the average exported concentration from each i th land use g m 3 qs i is the superficial water discharge runoff flow from each i th land use m3 s 1 and bl is the length of the river channel on each cell of the basin mesh m the value of œâ i was calculated from the annual export coefficients as shown in equation 8 where w i is the export coefficient of each i th land use g m 1s 1 qs i year is the total volume of direct runoff discharged per year from the i th land use m3 s 1 and a i is the total area of the i th land use in the river basin m2 6 t a r c t n x a r u c t n d

sutcliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error observation standard deviation ratio rsr and the percentage of bias pbias were chosen as the quantitative statistics tools to evaluate the model performance and associated error see table s2 the guidelines described in moriasi et al 2007 were followed to clarify the simulations and model performance because they can be considered sufficiently strict to ensure the quality of the results 3 results and discussion 3 1 discharged water simulations before they were used in the construction of the mlr model mainstream discharge results from the hydrological model were validated against the observed data in the two observatories with increasing catchment areas d2 and d3 in fig 2 a from april 2010 to december 2011 to ensure the accuracy of the results observed data for 2012 were not available the hydrological model was evaluated at daily weekly and monthly resolutions for the r2 nse and rsr statistics a very high performance of the model was found at all resolutions for both observatories at all studied time resolutions the hyeto hydrographs and detailed performance statistics results for the mainstream discharge are presented in figure s6 and table s3 3 2 mlr and export coefficient analysis the export coefficient values are affected by rainfall and substantial differences in the annual and monthly precipitation values were observed between years i and ii figure s2 case i and case ii were used to visualize and study changes in the magnitude of the linear relationship between the regression and export coefficients between years for both nutrients on each land use according to equation 5 if the total area of land use does not change the value of one coefficient as a function of the other can only be influenced by changes in the annual direct runoff of the particular land use 3 2 1 tn export coefficients for both mlr models case i and case ii the irls method converged in the third iteration step filtering only five of over 399 rain events for case i and three of over 422 for case ii the export coefficients obtained for the mountain and city farm positively correlated with their corresponding regression coefficients when comparing year i and year ii table 1 the regression coefficients were almost constant in both cases however the export coefficients behaved differently for the mountain land use the export coefficient values were largely equal between years while for the city farm land use the obtained value for year ii was double that for year i the increase found for the city farm coefficient can be associated with differences in the direct runoff volumes discharged during year ii from this land use see fig 3 in paddy land use the relationship between regression and export coefficients varies to different extents both coefficients were positively correlated but the magnitude of the change in case i and case ii was approximately 4 1 for the regression and 2 1 for the export coefficients previous studies have shown that nutrient export coefficients for paddies are easily influenced by rain particularly during the fertilization period from may to june in east asia these rain events during fertilization periods can stabilize nutrient concentration very fast inside the paddy as well as provoke the leaching of nutrients into superficial freshwaters liao et al 2021 wang et al 2015 see figure s2 b moreover because of the paddy field s special operating characteristics the differences in the hydraulic model from that used for the other land use types can be responsible for a different type of correlation with rain that needs to be studied more table 2 summarizes the contribution ratios per land use for years i and ii as a first observation the annual tn load input was approximately 20 higher during year ii than during year i while the trend of the contribution per land use remained constant the city farm land use was the main contributor to the tn followed by mountain and paddy fields on the other hand their contribution ratios differed considerably between years during year ii the relative contributions of the mountain and paddies decreased by approximately 24 and 55 respectively while the city farm land use increased by approximately 65 in year ii the intercept Œ± 0 of the mlr accounts for point sources and other types of contributions for tn values were significantly close for years i and ii 100 4 and 115 5 kg h 1 respectively and the ratio of its contributions was almost constant table 2 these results were expected because point source contributions do not substantially change yearly unless critical economic or demographic changes occur the existent difference can be explained among other factors by the error associated with the regression model or the increase in the nitrogen wet deposition and soil runoff due to the additional 30 of precipitation recorded during that year 3 2 2 tp export coefficients for tp both mlr models converged on the 7th iteration filtering ten rain events each year i and ii the values of the export coefficients for tp table 1 showed less variation than those of the corresponding tn coefficients similar to their annual ratio contributions table 2 for the mountain and paddy land uses the export coefficients showed 30 increases in year ii compared to year i whereas for the city farm land use the values remained almost constant given these results it can be inferred from equation 5 that the magnitude of the runoff discharges per land use increased during year ii to maintain constant values of export coefficients a 30 increase in the regression coefficient for the mountain land use was found in year ii while for the paddy and city farm land uses the coefficients decreased by 30 in the same year since phosphorous availability was higher during year ii because soil runoff increased due to additional precipitation the average tp concentration from the mountain land use increased directly influencing the export coefficient on the contrary for the paddy and city farm land uses the decrease in the average concentration of tp indicated that soil runoff occurred to a lesser extent because of the type of soil coverage the trend of the contribution ratio of each land use as for tn did not change between years with the city farm land use being the main contributor followed by the mountain land use and then the paddy field land use table 2 when comparing the values of the total tp load input there was an increase of approximately 30 from year i to year ii also in comparing yearly contributions the total tp load input differences were smaller than those for tn the contribution ratios of the mountain and paddy land uses remained almost constant from year i to ii 5 and 1 4 relative differences respectively however for the city farm land use a 20 decrement in contribution was found the point source contributions for phosphorous are more restricted than those of nitrogen since primary sources of phosphorus pollution are sewage treatment plants and agricultural activities because of how the study was conducted contributions from other sources were expected to remain almost constant for tp as for tn however year ii s intercept value was 40 larger than that of year i table 1 this difference corresponds with an increment in the tp contribution from other sources of approximately 20 table 2 that may be associated with soil runoff and other mechanisms that substantially affect the amount and intensity of tp loads with rainfall for phosphorous the corresponding wet deposition values are on the order of 20 to 30 times smaller than those for nitrogen anderson and downing 2006 he et al 2011 hence this type of contribution is not significant enough to account for the difference on the other hand dry deposition and soil runoff contributions may be very significant when evaluating tp contributions to water bodies he et al 2011 riemersma et al 2006 yang and toor 2018 because more than 60 of the kako river basin s topography and land use corresponds to steep mountains changes in annual precipitation can easily influence soil runoff and erosion increasing tp availability and its transport into the mainstream moreover significant increases in tp concentrations or loads have been reported downstream of dams after discharge particularly during the rainy season and summer in east asia bao et al 2020 nukazawa et al 2017 the biggest of the kako river s dams is located very close upstream to the chemical observatory therefore its discharge may directly affect the observed tp concentrations pulling the value of the intercept of the mlr 3 3 export coefficient performance and model validation table 3 statistically summarizes the performance at all studied resolutions figs 3 and 4 show weekly and monthly hyeto load graphs of the average nutrient loads for cases i and ii daily resolution graphs are presented in the supplementary materials figures s7 and s8 verification and validation of the export coefficients were performed for cases i and ii daily weekly and monthly averaged nutrient loads were calculated from hourly simulated results in the chemical observatory 3 3 1 tn performance the tn export coefficients showed good or very good performance under cases i and ii during the 12 months of verification and the corresponding months of validation according to the proposed benchmark scores in moriasi et al 2007 for case i it was found from the evaluation of all the chosen statistics that the export coefficients and model performance were very good for the verification period at all resolutions during the validation period the daily resolution showed values for nse and rsr in the benchmark of satisfactory performance this indicates that the obtained export coefficients for case i at a higher resolution than weekly decreased their performance when the rainfall conditions differed considerably from the ones they were estimated from the performance at the weekly and monthly resolutions were evaluated as very good for all statistics when observing the performance statistics for the export coefficients of case ii a situation similar to case i was observed during the verification period the daily resolution showed lower values of nse in the benchmark of good performance while all other statistics were considered very good however for the validation period the export coefficients showed very good model performance at all time resolutions the decrease in the performance for simulating trends lower value of nse was less of a problem under case ii and occurred during the verification period for cases i and ii the performance in simulating the average magnitudes pbias was considered very good at all studied time resolutions besides the pbias values were higher in absolute value under case i additionally from the sign of pbias it can be inferred that the model underestimates the average tn loads under case i while the opposite occurred under case ii this can be seen in fig 3 where the simulation results are slightly lower than the observed values under case i green lines and higher in case ii purple lines at both time resolutions fig 3 also shows the strong correlation between the observed and simulated data and the good performance in simulating the observed trends which is consistent with the obtained r2 and nse values additionally a strong correlation between the observed and simulated data and the total rainfall was observed at both time resolutions 3 3 2 tp performance variations in the obtained export coefficients for tp with the amount of yearly precipitation in the watershed were more proportional than those for tn however the values obtained from the intercept of the mlr showed that the contributions from other sources were significantly different between years under case i the evaluated statistics during the verification period were in the benchmark of very good performance at all considered time resolutions however during the validation period the performance was lower the daily resolution statistics demonstrated only an acceptable performance at the weekly and monthly time resolutions the export coefficients performed better and the model s performance was considered good for reproducing trends higher nse values and residual variations smaller rsr values under case ii the performance statistics were better during the verification period the export coefficients showed very good performance at all resolution times see table 3 when analyzing the values for the validation period the performance was considered very good at all studied time resolutions in addition under case ii as for tn the export coefficients performed better in estimating slightly different conditions than those in which they were estimated validation period as observed for tn the model performed better when the time resolution was weeks or months more significant absolute values of pbias were found during the validation period under case i the model underestimated the average tp loads by approximately 30 which can be observed in fig 5 at both presented resolutions under case ii smaller differences were observed in the average magnitude of the tp load during the validation period the sign of pbias was negative under case ii at the daily and weekly time resolutions revealing a tendency to overestimate the average results which is also evident in fig 5 the simulation results fit better with the observed values for the export coefficients under case ii at both time resolutions smaller difference nevertheless the differences in the peaks were more significant for tp than for tn which could indicate that other types of processes not considered in this approach affect the tp load in the mainstream fig 5 3 3 3 general considerations on the mlr model performance and limitations extreme rain events have associated significant rainfall peaks and big direct runoff discharges into the mainstream in relatively short periods among the physical processes during these phenomena soil runoff and erosion are the most important ones and are translated into prominent peaks of nutrient concentration and load on the mainstream the physical mechanisms involved in soil runoff and erosion are very complex and have particular characteristics depending on the study site and the type of soil coverage on the same extension the relationships between nutrient availability and soil runoff and erosion are complex multivariant dependent and are affected by the aqueous solution properties of the substances under study which adds more variability and makes the reality more divergent from the simplicity of a linear approach in this work to keep the mlr model as simple as possible and because of the lack of data we did not consider any related term in the regression or the transport model to account for nutrient load contribution from soil runoff and erosion besides this the statistical analysis of the obtained results showed that model s performance is good for the kako river watershed but it must be necessary to adjust the mlr as well as the transport model to consider nutrient loads from soil runoff and erosion processes in those places where the phenomena are common the mathematical approach used in this work to obtain the mlr models for both study cases was the irls method the method gives weight to the regression variables to normalize the distribution of the residues which means that those values that are close to the mean of the distribution have high weights for the regression close to 1 and the weight of the outliers vary depending on their leverage it can go as low as zero around 1 and 2 5 of the rain events weighted zero in constructing the mlr model for tn and tp load correspondingly and were discarded those particular rain events can be categorized as extreme and their impact on the data distribution was so high that they were outside the linearity conditions the irls method maximizes the number of points considered when building a regression model but pulls down the regression coefficients to normalize the distribution of the regressed variable as a result the obtained model tends to underestimate outliers to a similar extent as the corresponding weight of their relative leverage from the regression model which can be noticed in the obtained values of pbias positive values for the studied nutrients in both cases the present methodology has more limitations related to simplifying the approach to obtain general export coefficients and the amount of available data fixed export coefficients and a single observation point near the estuary are enough for smaller or similar sized watersheds to the one studied still further considerations should be made in those river basins with significantly more extensive areas and the present method needs to be tested and may not be suitable bigger river basins usually have well defined catchment areas with very different land uses that can significantly vary with time and generally fixed export coefficients are not representative of reality wang et al 2020 also in basins where the land uses are clustered independent of the watershed size more observation points are required and catchment areas must be precisely defined the present methodology does not differentiate between categories or sources of contribution for a particular land use because of its simplicity higher resolution land use data is needed to determine specific sources of contribution additionally considerations must be taken when using the obtained nutrient export coefficients under particular conditions export coefficients obtained when precipitation is higher than the annual average year ii showed better statistical performance when used in estimations of tn and tp loads in the mainstream under normal conditions but tend to overestimate the results table 3 on the other hand estimations from average rainfall conditions as in year i have lower model performance in particular conditions especially for tp the observed datasets used in this study particularly correspond to an average year i and a higher year i precipitation year in the studied area under these conditions with the land use distribution of the kako river watershed and because of the chosen methodology to handle the data it was not particularly observed the influence of fertilization periods and how they affect the nutrients load in the mainstream which is a point for further research in the future on the same line it was observed that the amount of precipitation affects the export coefficients values and their performance but to evaluate the extent of this observation in dry years in which rainfall is considerably lower than the averages more observed data is needed 4 conclusions tn and tp nonpoint source export coefficients were successfully estimated and validated in the kako river for the four major types of land use combining observed and simulated data from rain events it was possible to reduce the number of observation points to only one near the river estuary a robust regression method was applied to observed data containing extreme rain events successfully avoiding data transformations and the associated significance problems and excessive data filtering the selected hydrological model was found to be appropriate and showed good performance in reproducing mainstream discharges in both observatories chosen when analyzing the performance statistics the obtained tn and tp export coefficients showed very good performance in reproducing nutrient loads in the mainstream during the verification period in the corresponding years but they tend to underestimate the results however specific considerations about their validity and use need to be considered it can be concluded from the obtained results that annual rainfall differences of 30 or more can significantly downgrade the performance of the export coefficients in the model underestimating nutrient loads to a greater extent rainfall variations affect the value of different land use export coefficients depending on the type of nutrient to a different extent particularly for paddy land use export coefficients showed to be very sensitive to rainfall during its estimation independently of the nutrient from the intercept of the mlr model which accounts for other types of nutrient contributions it can be concluded that tp loads in the mainstream are more affected by annual rainfall variations in particular as previous research has found soil runoff and dam operation significantly impact mainstream tp loads soil runoff and erosion have an important role under extreme rainfall events so their addition to the current approach is an improvement for future works the presented approach has the advantage of being simple to implement with the appropriate amount of data and has shown to be statistically robust in its performance but its limitations need to be carefully analyzed this approach may be unsuitable for large continental river watersheds or those with high spatiotemporal variations the applicability and performance of the obtained export coefficients need to be tested and modifications to the implementation and mlr models should be required before their use when the study site conditions are considerably different funding information this research did not receive any specific grant funding

2011,complicated topography can drastically affect the geographical distribution of evaporation runoff production water cycle and water security guarantee however whether the elevation and alp valley have differentiated effects on basin evaporation and handle the change with constant variables is still being determined this manuscript calculates reference evapotranspiration et0 of the red river basin with a typical alp valley and elevation gradient from 1960 to 2021 then at the scales of the whole basin both sides of the main alp western of ailao mountain wal and eastern of ailao mountain eal the mainstream valley yuanjiang valley yjv the spatial temporal distribution pattern of et0 and its sensitivity of climate variables are depicted from the insights of barrier corridor and elevation effects the results indicate that et0 grows at a rate of 27 77 mm per decade throughout the red river basin china rrbc gradually declines from northwest to southeast and increases with increasing elevation the barrier effect of the ailao mountains within the rrbc alters the elevation distribution pattern of et0 on both sides of the mountain in contrast the corridor effect along the yjv causes the et0 increases with the depth of the valley accordingly the aridity index increases with rising elevation resulting in drier climatic conditions in the north of the rrbc and suffers a significant influence from alp valley topography resulting in wet wal dry eal and drier yjv the topography plays an impact on et0 through the climatic control variables solar radiation rs has the highest impact on et0 followed in descending order by relative humidity rh air temperature t and wind speed u with the elevation increases rs and t reduce the effect on et0 whereas rh increases its effect also the barrier effect changed the dominant factors rs and rh control the et0 on wal and eal respectively while the corridor effect enhances the role of t and u moreover the schematic diagram of the et0 s change with elevation gradient and alp valley and its climate controls is deduced this research can help us comprehend the spatial differentiation of et0 in complicated topographical areas as well as uncover its dynamic mechanisms under elevation and alp valley effects keywords reference evapotranspiration sensitivity analysis alp valley effects climate variables geographical differentiation red river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a crucial process of water energy exchange between the terrestrial surface and the atmosphere sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 alizamir et al 2020 ahmadi et al 2022 peerbhai et al 2022 and is deeply affected by complex topography milano et al 2015 moraga et al 2021 strohmenger et al 2022 the mechanism of evapotranspiration is extraordinarily complicated and difficult to quantify accurately silva et al 2017 due to the complex underlying surface and composite effects of climate drivers and geographic differentiation considering the measurement scarcity of the actual et in mountain regions and complex topography basins reference evapotranspiration et0 allen et al 1998 is proposed and firstly employed to represent the regional environmental evaporation demand and soil water availability alexandris and proutsos 2020 dinpashoh 2006 jhajharia et al 2012

resilience measures dinpashoh 2006 citakoglu et al 2014 jhajharia et al 2015 biazar et al 2019 yang et al 2021 complex topography which has diverse influences on the climate hydrology vegetation and other factors liu et al 2021 moraga et al 2021 strohmenger et al 2022 will change basin atmospheric circulation patterns and then change the distribution and dynamic mechanism of et gisolo et al 2022 deem that topographic parameters aspect slope and so on have a considerable impact on the et of mountain grasslands in the alp region the topography causes the spatial temporal distribution of et in the basins countries and areas milano et al 2015 ma et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 gebremedhin et al 2022 the elevation gradient of et can be found in these literatures showing as et change along with some certain elevation gradually and may be changed from sharp changes of topography or climate variables ma et al 2019 point out that et increases first and then decreases with the increase of altitude and its peak value appears at 3600 3700 m in the state of s√£o paulo brazil the highest evapotranspiration occurs at the highest altitude and slope and the lowest occurs at the lowest altitude which shows an unequivocal linear relationship between evapotranspiration and topographic characteristics bosquilia et al 2019 et0 in sichuan province showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with increasing altitude the et0 at different altitudes is 745 mm year below 1500 m 1001 mm year between 1500 and 3000 m and 964 mm year above 3000 m zhang et al 2018 because of changes in climatic conditions across and within basins dominant variables like solar radiation wind speed air temperature relative humidity and terrain qualities such as elevation slope and reflectivity influencing et0 vary enormously particularly in topographically complicated basins zhang et al 2019 gebremedhin et al 2022 the et of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs were under water stress at low middle elevations and under energy stress at high elevations in the taihang mountains peng et al 2020 in the qilian mountains potential evapotranspiration is sensitive to wind speed in some areas and then switches to relative humidity in other areas yang et al 2019 in the heihe basin relative humidity is the most sensitive meteorological factor followed by wind speed zhao et al 2015 along the shaliu river the higher et mainly appeared in the midstream and in the southern region of qinghai lake ma et al 2019 as the dominant controls for et switched from water conditions to energy conditions in fact the corridor effect of the river valley on the et is partly shown but not emphasized in these literatures however few researchers have looked at the causes of vertical zonation of et0 in topographically complex basins as well as the mechanisms by how special topography characteristics impact the distribution of et0 at different elevation gradients due to a lack of stations and the observation difficulty the evapotranspiration and potential changes of complex conditions basins are currently poorly known ragettli et al 2016 the red river basin china rrbc is part of the longitudinal range gorge region in southwest china with unique geographical and ecological features climatic conditions of rrbc exhibit highly distinct vertical zonal characteristics as a variety of climate types at the same time le et al 2018 and unique dry hot valleys duan et al 2015 ailao mountain range stretches nearly parallel to the mainstream of the yuanjiang river along its crest line the western ailao mountains wal and eastern ailao mountains eal own distinct slopes and landscapes on the eal yuanjiang runs north to south and forms yuanjiang valley yjv the average vertical drop between the valley of yuanjiang river and the ailao mountains peak is approximately 2400 m with the maximum being 3360 m due to the alp and valley terrain the et0 of the rrbc will exhibit completely different vertical zonation characteristics than other watersheds under the influence of special topographic features and different climatic factors hence rrbc is an ideal basin to depict the geographical differentiation of et0 and its climate variables due to the composite effcts of the mountain valley terrain and elevation gradient overall the research mentioned above shows much representative progress of evapotranspiration change with topography change however patterns and mechanisms of the et0 change under the effects of elevation and alp valley still need to be clarified therefore this manuscript employs the elevation and alp valley as the topography background and aims to reveal the elevation gradient differentiation of et0 the effect of climatic variables on et0 and their differentiation formed by the alp valley effect especially in eal wal and yjv accordingly this manuscript aims to 1 characterize the spatial and temporal variation of rrbc reference evapotranspiration by using fao 56 penman monteith and non parametric trend tests on 32 meteorological stations from 1960 to 2021 2 quantify the sensitivity of et0 to different climate variables and their changing characteristics based on partial differential sensitivity 3 demonstrate the geographical differentiation of reference evapotranspiration from insights of elevation gradient and alp valley distribution 4 exemplify the topography effect on climate conditions in alp valley areas by aridity index 5 discusse and synthesize the et0 s change with elevation gradient and alp valley effect and its climate controls using the schematic diagram 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 study area the red river basin china rrbc contains complex landforms such as alp valleys mountains rivers mid low mountain gorges v u valleys et al and various elevation gradients of geomorphology the red river is an international river that flows through china vietnam and laos it comprises the main stem and five distinct outbound tributaries including the lixianjiang tengtiao panlong nanli and nanxi river the rrbc is distributed in the yunnan guizhou plateau region in southwest china occupying 7 9 104 km2 areas of the total red river basin ailao mountains is roughly 800 km long and has an area of about 503 6 km2 stretching across the central rrbc the ailao mountains form the eastern boundary of the longitudinal range gorge region that run north south with elevation decreasing from 3360 m to about 70 m at hekou county due to geological tectonics the ailao mountain has a natural drop of up to 2400 m to the red river valley according to the crest on the west side of the red river rising and the strata on the east side sliding down moreover the ailao mountains on the red river s west side are 200 800 m higher than the mountains on the east side on average on the east side of ailao mountain the mainstream named yuanjiang river in china runs along yuanjiang valley yjv lixianjiang river named heishui river in vietnam flows along the lixianjiang valley lxv on the west side of the mountain fig 1 another major tributary named panlong river runs along the panlong valley which located east of the rrbc hence the rrbc is an ideal area for investigating the vertical gradient and effects on the geographic elements and its dominant variables the rrbc is located in the low latitude subtropical plateau with a humid monsoon climate under the atmospheric circulation and complicated terrain conditions the climate types show unique stereoscopic climate characteristics and the plant cover types and agricultural cultivation types are diverse assortments the rrbc is at the boundaries between the southwest indian ocean monsoon and the southeast pacific ocean monsoon may to october is the wet season with an average temperature of about 27 to 29 c and 85 90 of total precipitation november to april of the following year is the dry season with an average temperature about 16 21 c three climatic sub types is predominant in the corresponding three zones above the sanjiangkou and the jingdong the altitude ranges from 1600 to 2200 m and the annual average temperature and precipitation is 15 18 c and 800 1000 mm respectively the area belongs to the central plateau temperate zone below the sanjiangkou and jingdong above malipo maguan pingbian and jinping belongs to the hot area of yuanjiang with an average annual temperature varies between 20 and 21 c and rainfall between 700 and 1200 mm malipo maguan pingbian and jinping are tropical monsoon forest areas with an altitude of 70 100 m an annual average temperature above 21 c and precipitation of 1500 2000 mm the rrbc has a diverse assortment of plant cover types and agricultural cultivation types including primarily rice cultivation in terraced fields and along flat land maize and potato in the mountains sloping fields tea gardens in sloping fields yuanjiang valley with a vegetation type of savanna similar to that of tropical africa is the main agricultural irrigation area of rrbc the total water resources in the rrbc is 45 76 billion m3 the exploitation rate is only 4 27 and 86 2 of water utilization is agriculture consumption climate characterized by contemporaneous heat and rainfall makes most water vapors return to the atmosphere in evaporation during the rainy season and cannot be effectively used as the various climate conditions and unbalanced water resource distribution frequent droughts lead to high evapotranspiration demands with a complex seasonal variation that substantially influence local agricultural development the contradiction between water use and crop evapotranspiration makes the treatment and management of water use in the rrbc need to be supported by objective and scientific evapotranspiration assessments 2 1 2 data the daily meteorological data includes average daily air temperature t at the height of 2 m atmospheric pressure p wind speed at the height of 2 m u mean relative humidity rh daily precipitation prep and sunshine duration sd from 1960 to 2021 the meteorological data of a total of 32 meteorological stations in rrbc appendix table 1 are collected fig 1 the dataset is rigorously quality controlled by the national climatic centre of china meteorological administration national meteorological information center 2019 and is used to calculate the et0 with the fao 56 penman monteith function allen et al 1998 and climate elasticity with sensitivity equation among stations huapo station only provided monitoring data in 2020 due to observation constraints moreover the dem data in 30 30 m are from nasa s land processes distributed active archive center lp daac and downloaded from usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov the basin data and introduction information are from the statistical bureau of yunnan province china 2 2 research design and reference evapotranspiration calculation 2 2 1 vertical gradient and alp valley setting in flat land the geography parameters are appreciably similar at close geographic locations and only affected by latitude and longitude however with the elevation change vertical zonality will be dominant the south north and east west temperature gradients are changed with the latitude and elevation change in the alp valley area the sharp elevation change in alp valley will constantly change the evapotranspiration and has an overlapping effect complementary with latitude and longitude variation alp valley areas are terrain areas with lofty mountains standing significantly above their surroundings and deep valleys with steep rocky sides and rivers flowing through many landscapes as mountains valleys canyons rivers basins basin ranges and piedmont flat land distribute and combine stochastically in these areas fig 2 uplifted mountains with high elevations and steep slopes divide the total areas into different sides hills valleys multi peaks and basin ranges the deep incised valleys distribute low areas between mountains along river sides there are piedmont flat land and erosion hillside fields distributing from the river end to the source the geomorphologic feature should contain the u shaped valley v shaped alp gorge narrow gorge and mountain feature uplifted terrains and low settled rivers may block water vapor exchange on both sides of the mountain like a barrier and through the foehn effect generated by the vast elevation difference the moist air at the top of the mountain is changed to dry air on the river a corridor effect by long and narrow valleys overlaps with terrain gradient and valley transportation along the mountain different slope sides may exhibit the cardinal points and correspondingly directed overall effects of barrier corridor effects along the river valley the constant change trend or orientation may be displayed according to the similar water vapor transfer the complex topography characteristics of the alp valley area and the resulting barrier corridor effects cause a variety of climate types and atmospheric circulation leading to a dry hot river valley landscape fig 2 2 2 2 reference evapotranspiration calculation reference evapotranspiration representing the environmental demand for evapotranspiration is an evaporation process background on the evapotranspiration rate of a short green crop with a height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m and an albedo of 0 23 completely shading the ground and with adequate water status in the soil profile in this study daily et0 defined by the food and agriculture organization fao is calculated using the recommended and revised method based on the penman monteith equation fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 at meteorological stations then the monthly et0 seasonal et0 and yearly et0 are aggregated from daily et0 the fao 56 penman monteith method is expressed as follows 1 e t 0 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 e s 0 611

calculation of et0 can be seen in allen et al 1998 2 2 3 research key points point 1 the elevation gradient differentiation of et 0 the impact of vertical gradient on reference evapotranspiration mainly depends on the elevation varies with the mountains valleys and composite terrains in rrbc under normal circumstances meteorological stations at different elevations are selected as much as possible to represent the meterogical change from alp terrains to valleys however the idea stations in similar latitude and longitude diffirent elevation are extremely scarce hence the elevation gradient differentiation should be digged from the situation of different elevation with similar latitude and longitude in alp regions of rrbc the evapotranspiration of different slope sides near similar elevation refer specifically to the basal latitude zonality meanwhile the evapotranspiration difference from similar longitude and latitude but different elevation displays the vertical zonality due to the vertical distribution of natural zones in mountainous areas and valleys in valleys the reference evapotranspiration is calculated based on the representative stations from the river end to the source therefore a completed station scale elevation gradient differentiation of et 0 is presented and discussed point 2 the mountain and accompanied river valley cause et 0 differentiation through barrier corridor as shown by the characteristics of et0 along the elevation an elevation gradient differentiation of reference evapotranspiration is demonstrated however differentiations from the barrier corridor effects may alter the original et0 s elevation gradient change should be identified meteorological stations distributed along different slope sides of alp are chosen to reveal the values and change trend diffenrence due to the water vapor transfer barrier effect increase with increasing mountains elevation and the warm humid air and dry hot air shift in the same way respective stations settled along valleys are chosen to elucidate the composite effects of elevation gradient evapotranspiration change and corridor effect of evapotranspiration besides the topographical impacts and barrier corridor effects can be demonstrated and characterized with the aridity index ai based on the dryness of climatic conditions determined by potential evaporation and precipitation point 3 et 0 shows different responses sensitivity to climatic variables at mountains and accompanied river valley areas there are many variables contributing to et 0 such as surface solar radiation wind speed relative humidity soil heat flux saturation vapor pressure actual vapor pressure and psychrometric constant under the circumstances of et 0 changes with elevation and affected under the effects of barrier corridor the climate factor of et 0 sensitive response requires to be deduced and examined and then the dominant climate variables for mountains valleys and slopes should be determined to reveal the mechanism of how the complex terrains impact the et 0 spatial temporal distribution and trend change moreover whether the variable plays a negative or positive effect is proceeded and then how the variable changes in its trend and with elevation are extended 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity coefficients are converted into the dimensionless form by employing a differential equation to quantify the degree of different factors impacts on et0 mccuen 1974 the sensitivity coefficients can be calculated as follows 4 s x i lim Œ¥ x i 0 Œ¥ e t 0 e t 0 Œ¥ x i x i e t 0 x i x i e t 0 where xi is the climatic variable and s xi is the sensitivity coefficient of et 0 related to xi with a range from 1 to 1 a positive negative s xi of xi indicates that et 0 will increase decrease as the xi increases essentially a larger absolute value of the s xi indicates that the xi has a larger effect on et 0 more details about the calculation of s xi can be found in supplemental files many meteorological factors are involved in the fao 56 penman monteith method considering surface solar radiation rs u the relative humidity rh and t are widely used in previous studies huo et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 she et al 2017 and these four variables can string all other climatic factors and causing fewer uncertainties according to eq 4 hence they are settled to be representive climate variables to discuss the et 0 sensitivity 2 4 aridity index the aridity index ai characterizes the degree of dryness of climatic conditions determined by potential evaporation and precipitation thornthwaite 1948 first expressed ai as the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation or et0 and then this method became widely used tsiros et al 2020 in this study a similar definition proposed by huo et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 is used then ai is transformed into a number values from 1 to 1 to distinguish between dry and wet climatic conditions 5 ai e t 0 p r e p e t 0 where et0 is the annual reference evapotranspiration mm day and prep is the annual precipitation mm day when ai is higher than 0 it means that the climate conditions are dry whereas ai 0 means that the climate conditions are wet 2 5 mann kendall trend detection the mann kendall mk trend detection a rank based non parametric test method is employed to detect the temporal trend test of sequence in this work mann 1945 kendall 1975 accordingly each value in the sequence is compared with the rest then the sum of the number of values greater than the value is calculated as s chen et al 2019 6 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i when n 8 the sequence is approximately normally distributed then the expected mean of s e s and the variance value var s is determined as follows mann 1945 kendall

pass the significance test that z 2 32 to ensure the credibility of the results 2 6 spearman rho test spearman rho test sr is another non parametric trend test using the correlation between time series and variables the mathematical term of sr test can be defined as shadmani et al 2012 10 r 1 6 i 1 n d i 2 n 3 n where r is the correlation coefficient between time series and variables n is the length of the time series di represents the difference between a ranked pair the t value is used to test the significance of the correlation and its calculation is as follows wang et al 2007 11 t r n 4 1 r 2 t obeys a t distribution with n 2 degrees of freedom if t tŒ± 2 the correlation is significance tŒ± 2 is from the t distribution table in this study the significance of the trend is determined by both mk and sr which means the trend can be considered significant only if both mk and sr pass the significance test the result of mk and sr appendix table 2 can be found in the supplemental files 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal differentiation of et0 along the elevation gradient a significant spatial difference exists in et0 in rrbc along the elevation gradient and within complex topography fig 3 a the highest et0 reaches 1308 49 mm year at yuanjiang station while the lowest is only 892 64 mm year at xichou station located in the easternmost part of the basin fig 1 the multi year average et0 in rrbc decreases from the northwestern to the southeastern part of the basin as the average elevation decrease from 2300 to 130 m at stations areas with higher multi year average et0 mainly appear in the northwestern part of rrbc and the yjv demonstrating a zonal distribution along the yuanjiang river et0 within 22 stations of the total 32 stations in rrbc displays an increasing trend during 1960 2021 according to the mk trend detection among them 3 stations show a significant increase at the 0 01 test level the other 8 stations display a decrease trend two has no trend as just one year of data was provided for one station and the other station has no trend indeed no one station in the 8 stations in decrease trend shows siginificant decrease trend fig 3b besides 6 of the 8 stations with a decreasing trend distributes in the eastern of ailao mountains 12 of the 15 stations with et0 less than 1050 mm year increased and 10 of 16 stations with et0 greater than 1050 mm year increased by combining the geographic distribution features of et0 it is conceivable to find that the stations with lower latitudes and elevations have more significant increasing trends in et0 the intra annual et0 in rrbc varies with the month change and elevation gradient distinctively fig 3b the intra annual et0 in rrbc increases from january to may and decreases till december in which the et0 stays in the bottom value the monthly et0 lasts a high value during march may and peaks in may the et0 at different stations varies less in summer june august and more in spring the difference in monthly et0 at stations between yjv and rrbc is slight in summer and big in winter november to january et0 in stations above 1700 m is significantly higher than stations between 1400 m and 1700 m in spring and winter but lower in summer et0 in stations below 1400 m has a similar intra annual variation with stations between 1400 m and 1700 m et0 shows an increasing trend with increasing elevation fig 3c nonetheless et0 in the yjv is significantly different from other mountain areas as it generally possesses higher values typically et0 during 1200 1400 m in yjv is significantly higher than adjacent elevations the et0 of several stations during 1200 m 1600 m varies dramatically as the latitudinal differences of these stations and the differences in climatic conditions formed by the substantial differences in topography the et0 in rrbc shows a mainly increasing trend during 1960 2021 from the insights of yjv and rrbc fig 3d the average growth rate is 27 77 mm year per decade the inter annual variation is bounded by the 1990s before which et0 mainly shows an increasing trend turns a sharp decline to its lowest value in the 1990s and then increases again the maximum and the minimum et0 in rrbc occured in 2019 and 1990 respectively in contrast the maximum and the minimum et0 in yjv occured in 2020 and 1990 respectively at the interannual scale the average et0 of rrbc is always lower than that of yjv which indicates that when there is no significant difference in precipitation the yjv area will be drier than other areas of the rrbc the difference between yjv and rrbc is particularly significant in high et0 years moreover climate change may affect yjv more sensitively and drastically when climatic conditions become drier 3 2 sensitivity of et0 to climate variables according to the sensitivity analysis results fig 4 rrbc s et0 is sensitive to the climate variables in descending order as rs rh t and u the interannual variation characteristics of the four different climate factors and their sensitivity coefficients indicate that the sensitivity coefficients of rs and rh are decreasing the rh values negative in fig 4 while the sensitivity coefficients of t and u are increasing fig 4a the sensitivity coefficient of rs senrs and rs have the same significant increase trend from 1990 to 2000 and then change out of sync the sensitivity coefficient of t sent and t increased significantly during the past 60 years the sensitivity coefficients of rh senrh and rh showed similar decrease trends during the past 60 years the senrh is negative the sensitivity coefficients of u senu keep increasing during the 60 years while u decreases oppositely the synchronous increase in senrh and senu may cause a rapid rise in et0 around 1970 and the increase in sent and senu may cause a rise around 1980 moreover the et0 sensitivity to climate variables changes may be changed according to the contrast relation of variables sensitivity senrs shows a decreasing trend in most stations whereas sent senrh and senu show an increasing trend at more stations fig 4b 17 stations in rrbc show an increasing trend in senrs 5 of which have a very significant trend 15 stations show a decreasing trend in senrs 3 of which show a significant trend sent shows an increasing trend at 24 stations 5 pass the significance test the significant decreasing trend of sent only is shown at 2 stations the most sensitive areas for et0 to t are concentrated at 3 stations in the yjv with higher values than other stations of rrbc senu shows an increasing trend at 25 stations 6 of which show a significant trend furthermore an opposite trend in senu is shown at the remaining 6 stations none of them show a significant trend in the yjv senu values are higher than in other areas the area where et0 is insensitive to rh is mainly located on the western side of the rrbc and the rh sensitivity increases with areas moving eastward senrh mainly shows a decreasing trend and the decreasing trend passes the significance test in 10 stations only 7 stations show an increasing trend in senrh however none of them passes the significance test the sensitivity coefficients of different climatic factors mainly show a decrease with increasing elevation fig 4c the highest senrs appears at the lowest elevation station while the lowest senrs stay at the station with the highest elevation excluding the station with only a year of monitoring data when the elevation 1000 m the senrs s distributions of the four stations are consistent with the overall elevation gradient distribution characteristics sent decreases with increasing elevation evidently while elevation 1000 m sent significantly shows higher values than that at higher elevation stations senu does not significantly change with increasing elevation its highest and lowest values are around 1400 m the overall characteristics of senrh with elevation change are opposite to those of sent and senrs senrh increases with increasing elevation and fluctuates at some stations 3 3 barrier corridor effect on et0 and its sensitivity 3 3 1 barrier effect alp changes the et0 distribution with elevation change under the mountain barrier effect distributing along different slope sides of the alp produces a water vapor transfer barrier keeps the warm humid condition on the western side of the mountain induces the differentiation of climatic conditions and causes the et0 differentiation at the approximate same latitude and elevation the et0 of the western ailao mountains wal is much lower than that of the eastern ailao mountains eal at station scales fig 5 a the et0 of wal has a decreasing and subsequently rising elevation gradient distribution which elucidate that the lower latitudes of the two locations near 1200 m have lower et0 values the et0 of eal decreases with rising elevation roughly except the et0 at 1400 m at which et0 is extremely lower as the 0 8 latitude difference shows the dominant influence the et0 values change and elevation distribution patterns difference between wal and eal reveals that the alp has a barrier effect that alters the magnitude of et0 and its vertical zonation characteristics fig 5 a the sensitivity analysis results indicate that the barrier effect changes the dominant climate factors of et0 on both sides of ailao mountain fig 5 b the highest sensitivity coefficient of et0 to climate factor is rs at all stations on the wal and rh on the eal adding that senrh exceeds sent only at two wal stations hence et0 in wal is more sensitive to the two energy related climate variables rs and t similar to et0 senu has a partially elevation gradient distribution characteristic that it decreases and subsequently increases with elevation change the lower latitude and higher elevation cause rh higher hence the absolute value of senrh at the low latitude and higher elevation station is higher at each station in eal sent has a minor difference with senrs who exceeds senrh only at two stations senu decreases with elevation increase its value is near zero at pingbian station of the lowest et0 sent s elevation gradient distribution is similar to senu s and consistent with its distribution at rrbc senrs has a distinct elevation distribution pattern on ailao mountains than that on rrbc on which it rises at first and then declines senrh is related chiefly to latitude and elevation as it values higher in low latitude with high elevation or high latitude with low elevation 3 3 2 corridor effect et0 changes in the yjv illustrate the combined effects of elevation gradient and corridor effect on reference evapotranspiration in yjv et0 has a significant increasing trend with increasing elevation as hekou yuanyang honghe yuanjiang and nanjian stations in sequence along these stations the yuanjiang river runs in the corridor of yjv which creeps nearly longitudinally in the longitudinal range gorge region approximately 250 mm year reduction in et0 of hekou station the lowest latitude station in yjv is from of that in nanjian station the highest latitude station fig 6 in the valley spatial sequence the et0 at yuanjiang stations has a higher et0 than at nanjian other drivers influence the et0 and the corridor effect from yuanjiang station to nanjian there is around a 1000 m vertical distance change and approximately 1 5 latitude difference the reduction value may reduce the possible increase value of et0 at nanjian with elevation with latitude increase in addition yuanjiang is the closest station in the yjv to the prominent peak of the ailao mountains and is strongly influenced by the barrier effect superimposing corridor effect notably the dominant dry hot valley landscape formed by the barrier corridor effect intensifies the et0 increase effect which is consistent with the characteristics of the hydrological cycle under the dry hot valley landscape formed by the barrier corridor effect the intensive et0 at yuanjiang station exceeds that at the honghe station at which the dry hot effect degrades as the hill slope location little broad valley and lower mountains around the sensitivity analysis results indicate that the corridor effect changes the et0 s sensitivity to climate controls in the yjv area et0 here is most sensitive to rh at yuanyang and honghe station rs at hekou station and t at nanjian and yuanjiang station fig 6 senu shows a substantial increase along the yjv oriented to the river source in contrast senrs showed a decreasing trend along the yjv due to the location at the yjv s entry and lowest latitude of hekou et0 is most sensitive to rs and least sensitive to u at nanjian station the highest elevation station in yjv et0 is most sensitive to t it seems that sent has a decrease with elevation increase in yjv as the sensitivity distribution mentioned in section 4 2 however the temperature enhances the uncertainty of sent as the highest value turns at yuanjiang station which has the highest temperature in yjv hence the temperature affected by the corridor influences sent in the yjv senrh grows along yjv and also is affected by the barrier of the ailao mountains at honghe and yuanyang stations overall the corridor effect makes the et0 s sensitivity shows a stationary change along yjv in senu a partially stationary change in senrs and senrh and a nonstationary change in sent 3 4 spatial and temporal variation of the aridity index the interannual variation of the aridity index ai indicates that the rrbc is under wet climatic conditions as only 17 years are in dry conditions while 45 73 years are in wet climatic conditions fig 7 a a significant increase in ai of the rrbc occurred in 1980 2009 and 2019 when ai stayed at a positive number especially from 2009 to 2016 the wet dry conditions can be validated by the historical record such as the dry condition during 2009 2015 during which the yunnan province underwent a severe multi year drought lasting nearly 5 years with seasonal drought episodes the interannual variation of ai in wal eal and yjv are affected by the barrier corridor effect the ai of wal is less than 0 all the time implying that wal is always in a wet condition fig 7 b eal is always in a dry condition as its ai is greater than 0 in most years fig 7 c the yjv region stays a dry condition in the overall period as ai values fluctuate between wet and dry conditions during 1961 2001 and then turns into the dry condition and lasts to date fig 7 d furthermore after the 2009 drought the yjv remains dry condition and does not shift to wet conditions after 2015 as rrbc or to dry reduction as eal the difference in ai between wal and eal reveals the wet dry barrier effect of vapor energy and precipitation moreover the difference in ai between yjv and rrbc demonstrates the variation of the valley corridor effect of precipitation and et 0 the ai of wal eal yjv and rrbc shows that the barrier corridor effects modify the wet and dry climate conditions and the changing pattern of regional climate conditions when extreme climatic events such as droughts occur the spatial distribution of ai in the rrbc illustrates the difference in climatic conditions in different areas fig 8 in the western and southern areas of rrbc ai is generally less than 0 and climatic conditions are generally wetter than in the northern and northeastern parts the ai of all wal stations is less than 0 whereas the ai of 2 eal stations is not more than 0 the 5 stations located in the yjv their ais show a typically geographical variation characteristic of progressively rising ai with increasing latitude and along valley corridor which is compatible with the spatial distribution features of et0 and the variation characteristics under barrier corridor in comparison other stations in the rrbc with close distances exhibit opposite ai which might be related to changes in small scale landforms and elevation differences 3 5 geographical differentiation formed by topography in rrbc the combined effects of barrier corridor and vertical elevation gradient on the geographical variation of et0 and its dominant climate factors are revealed by pattern and differentiation analysis combining the elevation gradient distribution of et0 in rrbc and its inducing spatial temporal variation in rrbc fig 9 the barrier corridor effect of rbbc has resulted in a geographical distribution pattern of climatic conditions that is compatible with the et0 distribution pattern fig 3 the ai of rrbc rises with elevation making the climate in the high elevation areas and the northern areas drier forming a spatial distribution pattern of et0 decreasing from higher elevations in the northwest to lower elevations in the southeast the barrier effect of the ailao mountains causes the climatic conditions to be wetter west of the ailao mountains and drier east of the ailao mountains thus making the et0 of the wal lower than that of the eal additionally the barrier effect alters et0 distribution in the vertical gradient and sensitivity to climatic variables between the eastern and western sides of the ailao mountains so that et0 in wal decreases and subsequently rises along with the elevation and is mainly dominated by rs and et0 in eal mainly controlled by rh decreases with rising elevation the corridor effect of the yjv causes et0 and ai to change along the river valley making the climatic conditions gradually turn drier along the valley corridor orientated to the river sources furthermore the corridor effect changes the dominant climate factors of et0 making the et0 of yjv mainly influenced by rh and t instead of rs which has the most significant influence on et0 in the whole basin and making the distribution characteristics of sent along the elevation gradient due to the sent of higher elevation stations in yjv area higher than that of lower elevation stations instead the ailao mountains of the rrbc block the warm humid air on the west side of the mountain significantly making the climate on the east side drier and enhancing the negative effect of rh on et0 making the et0 on the west side of the mountain significantly lower than that on the east side the corridor effect of the yuanjiang river valley forces the air to get drier as it advances along the river strengthening the effects of u and t on et0 resulting in et0 being substantially larger at the deeper region of the river than the entry the barrier corridor effect formed by the ailao mountains and the yuanjiang river valley modifies the magnitude of et0 by altering the dominating climatic element of et0 consequently it is the principal cause of et0 geographic variation in rrbc yuanjiang station located in the valley s center is synchronously impacted by the barrier corridor effect and has the maximum et0 of every station in the rrbc the et0 of rrbc primarily exhibits the vertical zonation characteristic of rising with increasing elevation this distribution pattern is shifted by the barrier corridor effect so that the et0 of the western side of the ailao mountains decreases and then rises with increasing elevation the et0 of the eastern side of the ailao mountains decreases with increasing elevation resulting in an elevation gradient pattern in rrbc the vertical cutting of mountains and river valleys creates the height gradient distribution pattern in rrbc 4 discussions 4 1 the linear relationship between et0 and elevation gradient is clarified the distribution of et0 in rrbc with elevation shows an apparent linear relationship that the reference evapotranspiration increase with the increasing elevation the higher reference evapotranspiration occurs at a higher elevation the relationship exists in the mountains areas and the yjv respectively fig 3 similarly the unequivocal linear relationship between evapotranspiration and topographic characteristics are stated in the state of s√£o paulo brazil bosquilia et al 2019 in taihang mountains areas peng et al 2020 they found that the highest evapotranspiration occurs on the highest elevation and slope and the lowest occurs on the lowest elevation and slope in complex topographic landscapes with a 2000 m elevation difference et0 in sichuan province showed a trend of increasing with increasing elevation below 3000 m and then decreasing zhang et al 2018 in the qinghai lake basin on the tibetan plateau evapotranspiration increases with elevation and reaches its highest value in the range of 3600 3700 m after which it decreases with elevation ma et al 2019 a decreasing trend of et0 below 2000 m was found due to the negative contribution of u in the northwest china while above 2000 m et0 shows an increasing trend under the positive effect of t liu et al 2021 these indicated that with the elevation incrseae there is a linear relationship between evapotranspiration and elevation in a specific range of altitude and the relationship reverse at one or more elevation threshold 4 2 barrier corridor effect modifies the et0 s change with elevation gradient and climate variable sensitivity topographic characteristics considering barrier corridor are critical for understanding et0 s spatial temporal differentiation among the mountain stations although there is a linear relationship between et0 and elevation gradient the realistic relationship lines around the fitted line during 1000 m 2400 m and fluctuates up and down fig 3 if considering the stations in the yjv the fitted line will change sharply even turns into a nonlinear relationship fig 3c typically during 1200 1400 m where et0 is higher than the adjacent elevation range the reason for this anomaly is mainly due to the nanjian et0 affected by the ailao mountains barrier and the yjv corridor et0 distributes differently on the different sides of the ailao mountains due to the water vapor transfer barrier along the elevation the et0 of wal has a decreasing and subsequently rising elevation gradient distribution in contrast the et0 of eal decreases with rising elevation roughly except for the et0 at 1400 m even at the approximate same latitude and elevation the et0 of wal is much lower than that of eal at station scales hence a validated linear relationship between et0 and elevation gradient is demonstrated from the overall basin distribution the mountain areas distribution and the valley areas distribution however the linear relationship between et0 and elevation gradient has a limitation of universality and should be modified with the complex topography overall the barrier effect from the alp and the corridor effect from the valley should be considered and given more attention to understanding its influence on et0 the effect of elevation on the sensitivity of climate factors is evident even in basins with very small areas yang et al 2019 in the rrbc the dominant climate factor for et0 is rs which is consistent with the results of previous studies based on the wholly china perspective fan et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zeng et al 2021 however to the difference of climatic conditions and large dominant landforms the dominant climate factor for et0 in northwestern china is u in the northeastern is maximum temperature and in the south is the sunshine duration wang et al 2017 similarly et0 in loess plateau shows significant spatial differences in the sensitivity distribution wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 she et al 2017 based on the national scale plateau scale and basin scale a consensus based sensitivity of climate factors on elevation distribution is not provided as the nonlinear change liu et al 2012 yang et al 2019 and linear change can be found mixed nonlinear roughly in rrbc the sensitivity coefficients of different climatic factors mainly decrease with increasing elevation fig 4c senrs and sent decrease with increasing elevation but senrs fluctuates significantly senu does not show a significant change with increasing elevation and senrh changes with elevation change opposite those of sent and senrs in the yjv senrs is weakening but senrh and senu are enhancing fig 4 the nonlinear relationship between sensitivity coefficients and elevation and location is more suitable to elucidate the corridor effect of yjv scientifically in the areas within elevation 1000 m the barrier effect of the ailao mountains and the effect of elevation gradient on the sensitivity of different climate factors are significantly different among them senrs and sent show a distinguished decrease with elevation which is not only related to their own distribution characteristics at elevation but also related to the topographic features in the basin mountains in rrbc are mainly distributed in the northern part of the basin and higher latitude leads to weaker rs this distribution characteristic also coincides with the results of existing studies li et al 2015 she et al 2017 yang et al 2019 4 3 impact of et0 geographical differentiation on hydrological simulation and agricultural irrigation hydrological simulation in topographically complex basins has long been the focus and challenge of hydrological research as an essential input parameter of the hydrological model the unique geographic differentiation of et0 in the alp valley region and the difference in variation between it and flat terrain will increase the uncertainty of the hydrological simulation process besides current hydrological models take less consideration of the effects of alp valley while our results can help comprehend and investigate the sources of uncertainty in hydrological simulations in basins with complex topography in perspective of evapotranspiration and its sensitivity to climate factors moraga et al 2021 as the representation of evaporative demand of a reference crop of the terrestrial surface the increase of et0 will increase crop transpiration soil and interception evaporation affecting agricultural irrigation sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 she et al 2017 the upward trend in et0 will lead to a higher requirement for irrigation and the complex spatial variability of et0 s dominant climate factors will pose significant challenges for irrigation management especially in basins with distinct climatic differences including the rrbc zeng et al 2021 in watersheds with flat topography insignificant spatial differences in climatic conditions allow for a convergence of agricultural irrigation practices but in watersheds with complex topography this management policy will fail our research on the geographical heterogeneity of ai and the effects of alp valley on et0 and its dominant climate factor can significantly help enhance irrigation management in complex terrain watersheds 4 4 uncertainty complicated composited topography and not enough observations in the rrbc take some uncertainty on the spatial temporal differentiation of et0 and its attribution analysis et0 is calculated by employing the fao 56 penman monteith formula based on artificially determined homogeneous surface parameters however due to the intricacy of underlying surface properties overestimation or underestimation of et0 exists landeras et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 as the hydrological parameter evapotranspiration is not independent of changes in the land surface climate variables as the non linear relationship of hydrology processes chen et al 2014 especially in this complicated composited topography of mountainous terrain longitudinal range gorge region limited by not enough stations in the rrbc and the monitoring period the barrier effect lacks more fine scale analysis on the et0 on the whole ailao mountains he et al 2005 wu et al 2012 while in the analysis of the corridor effect on et0 the et0 at yuanyang station should be part of the dry hot valley and affected by the foehn effect duan et al 2015 should values closer to honghe and yuanjiang than hekou the possible effect is from the barrier effect however the effect here lacks support from the stations near the elevation which climbs upward along ailao mountain s slope meanwhile the et0 in nanjian is higher than the surrounding stations due to the corridor effect as partly affected by the dry hot valley fan et al 2020 and may be reduced by the foehn effect which requires deep discussion several trend tests have been proposed and have been used in many studys haktanir and citakoglu 2014 demir 2022 adding methods or cross vilidation can enhance the reliability of trend analysis however considering the workload and method advantage the mk and sr tests are included in this manuscript mann kendall trend detection is a rank based non parametric trend detection test recommended by world meteorological organization wmo and has been applied for many decades with the superimposing of this two trend test the results show more robustness and reliability on the one hand limitations such as serial correlation or period covered of mk and sr will decrease the reliability of the results yagbasan et al 2020 on the other hand when using mk with removing the autocorrelation of related data by pre whitening mkpw the results of the mann kendall test are distorted as the size of the time series is large herein the original series were used for the mann kendall test in this case according to the analysis of yue s research yue and wang 2002 in the furture serial correlation and more parameter tests are advised to employ in et0 and climate variables trend detection to reduce the uncertainty results and understand the effects of of serial correlation in research series jhajharia et al 2012 haktanir and citakoglu 2015 g√º√ßl√º 2018 sensitivity coefficients are helpful to identify the et0 s sensitive climate factors and determine the dominant factors and main driver contribution of et0 s change sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 biazar et al 2019 as in some areas u is the dominant factor of et0 as it s the largest contribution to et0 however it has not a high sensitivity coefficient fan et al 2016 li et al 2017 she et al 2017 basically from the definition of sensitivity coefficients eq 4 and differential equation basic method shiri 2019 the difference between sensitivity coefficients and actual contributions of different climatic factors is that higher actual contributions can be obtained if climate variable has marked changes with small sensitivity coefficients however the calculation method and differential equation may take some uncertainties as the hypothetical artificial underlying surface shiri 2019 and the interactions between climatic factors alexandris and proutsos 2020 although we choose the four climatic factors as independent if we ignore their interactions uncertainty may be present in the spatial and temporal characteristics of the sensitivity coefficients of et0 meanwhile the distribution characteristics of senrh and senu on the elevation gradient are more complicated than senrs and sent if not enough stations are considered and other datasets are used the specific and validated sensitivity coefficient distribution characteristics with elevation gradient and under barrier corridor effects cannot be fully summarized hence based on the exploratory research the barrier corridor effects on the climate factors sensitivity can be found preliminary however the specific mechanism of the superimposed effects on et0 its dominant variable and factor sensitivity needs further analysis 5 conclusion reference evapotranspiration et0 in rrbc is calculated from 1960 to 2021 based on 32 meteorological stations the spatial temporal pattern of et0 is demonstrated with the elevation gradients and by using the mann kendall trend four climatic factors solar radiation rs wind speed u relative humidity rh and average daily air temperature t are employed to assess the et0 s sensitivity to climatic factors via partial differential sensitivity analysis and then the aridity index ai provides more information to validate the spatiotemporal pattern of et0 and effects from elevation and topography furthermore the schematic diagram of the et0 s change with elevation and mountain valley and the sensitivity in rrbc is illustrated to explore the et0 spatial temporal pattern the influence of the barrier corridor effect on et0 formed by the ailao mountains and yuanjiang river valley yjv and et0 s dominating climatic variables the results presented and discussed in this article provide an attractive new look at elevation behavior in et0 distribution over complex terrain as in alp valley areas such results may play an essential role in water cycle modeling and water resources security guarantee in mountain areas and the agricultural sector and water resources management can take targeted measures to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water wastage based on the variability of et0 and the prominent impact climate factors in alp valley areas the main results are as follows 1 the et0 in rrbc gradually decreases from northwest to southeast increases with increasing elevation as the higher et0 occurs at a higher elevation the linear relationship between et0 and elevation that et0 increases with increasing elevation exists in the mountain areas and the yuanjiang river valley has been validated during 1960 2021 the et0 increased at an average rate of 27 77 mm per decade but the increase trend and rate varied in different stations 2 et0 is most sensitive to rs followed in descending order by rh t and u the interannual variation characteristics of the four different climate factors and their sensitivity coefficients indicate that the sensitivity coefficients of rs and rh are decreasing while the sensitivity coefficients of t and u are increasing during 1960 2021 the sensitivity coefficients of different climatic factors mainly show a decrease with increasing elevation senrs and sent show a decrease with increasing elevation but senrs fluctutes significantly senu does not show a significant change with increasing elevation in contrast senrh changes with elevation change opposite those of sent and senrs in the yjv senrs is weakening but senrh and senu are enhancing 3 the spatial and temporal variations of aridity index ai indicate that the ai increases with rising elevation resulting in drier climatic conditions in the north of the rrbc and the ai increases with time through resulting in the rrbc is under wet climatic conditions during 1960 2008 and mainly dry during 2009 2021 the spatial distribution of ai in the rrbc illustrates that the western and southern areas of rrbc are generally wetter than the northern and northeastern wal is wetter than eal which follows by yjv 4 barrier corridor effect and elevation gradient influence the et0 and its dominant climate factors on the spatial temporal distribution pattern and climate variables sensitivity in rrbc a schematic diagram is illustrated to explore the et0 s spatial temporal pattern the barrier corridor effect and et0 s dominating climatic variables the barrier effect of the ailao mountains in rrbc makes et0 on the west side lower than on the east side and it will first decrease and then increase with elevation whereas et0 on the east side decreases with elevation meanwhile the barrier effect causes et0 on the west side to be the most sensitive to rs and on the east side to rh the corridor effect causes et0 to grow along the yjv s latitudinal rise making the climatic conditions substantially gradually turn drier along the valley corridor orientated to the river source while the sensitivity coefficients of u rise and the sensitivity coefficients of rs fall the barrier corridor effect causes the climate on the west side of the ailao mountains to be wet and the east side dry and causes the ai of the yjv to rise with latitude additionally the barrier effect alters et0 distribution and sensitivity to climatic variables in the vertical gradient between the eastern and western sides of the ailao mountains furthermore the specific mechanism of the superimposed effects on et0 its dominant variable and factor sensitivity needs further analysis credit authorship contribution statement junxu chen conceptualization

2011,complicated topography can drastically affect the geographical distribution of evaporation runoff production water cycle and water security guarantee however whether the elevation and alp valley have differentiated effects on basin evaporation and handle the change with constant variables is still being determined this manuscript calculates reference evapotranspiration et0 of the red river basin with a typical alp valley and elevation gradient from 1960 to 2021 then at the scales of the whole basin both sides of the main alp western of ailao mountain wal and eastern of ailao mountain eal the mainstream valley yuanjiang valley yjv the spatial temporal distribution pattern of et0 and its sensitivity of climate variables are depicted from the insights of barrier corridor and elevation effects the results indicate that et0 grows at a rate of 27 77 mm per decade throughout the red river basin china rrbc gradually declines from northwest to southeast and increases with increasing elevation the barrier effect of the ailao mountains within the rrbc alters the elevation distribution pattern of et0 on both sides of the mountain in contrast the corridor effect along the yjv causes the et0 increases with the depth of the valley accordingly the aridity index increases with rising elevation resulting in drier climatic conditions in the north of the rrbc and suffers a significant influence from alp valley topography resulting in wet wal dry eal and drier yjv the topography plays an impact on et0 through the climatic control variables solar radiation rs has the highest impact on et0 followed in descending order by relative humidity rh air temperature t and wind speed u with the elevation increases rs and t reduce the effect on et0 whereas rh increases its effect also the barrier effect changed the dominant factors rs and rh control the et0 on wal and eal respectively while the corridor effect enhances the role of t and u moreover the schematic diagram of the et0 s change with elevation gradient and alp valley and its climate controls is deduced this research can help us comprehend the spatial differentiation of et0 in complicated topographical areas as well as uncover its dynamic mechanisms under elevation and alp valley effects keywords reference evapotranspiration sensitivity analysis alp valley effects climate variables geographical differentiation red river basin data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a crucial process of water energy exchange between the terrestrial surface and the atmosphere sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 alizamir et al 2020 ahmadi et al 2022 peerbhai et al 2022 and is deeply affected by complex topography milano et al 2015 moraga et al 2021 strohmenger et al 2022 the mechanism of evapotranspiration is extraordinarily complicated and difficult to quantify accurately silva et al 2017 due to the complex underlying surface and composite effects of climate drivers and geographic differentiation considering the measurement scarcity of the actual et in mountain regions and complex topography basins reference evapotranspiration et0 allen

other factors liu et al 2021 moraga et al 2021 strohmenger et al 2022 will change basin atmospheric circulation patterns and then change the distribution and dynamic mechanism of et gisolo et al 2022 deem that topographic parameters aspect slope and so on have a considerable impact on the et of mountain grasslands in the alp region the topography causes the spatial temporal distribution of et in the basins countries and areas milano et al 2015 ma et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 gebremedhin et al 2022 the elevation gradient of et can be found in these literatures showing as et change along with some certain elevation gradually and may be changed from sharp changes of topography or climate variables ma et al 2019 point out that et increases first and then decreases with the increase of altitude and its peak value appears at 3600 3700 m in the state of s√£o paulo brazil the highest evapotranspiration occurs at the highest altitude and slope and the lowest occurs at the lowest altitude which shows an unequivocal linear relationship between evapotranspiration and topographic characteristics bosquilia et al 2019 et0 in sichuan province showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing with increasing altitude the et0 at different altitudes is 745 mm year below 1500 m 1001 mm year between 1500 and 3000 m and 964 mm year above 3000 m zhang et al 2018 because of changes in climatic conditions across and within basins dominant variables like solar radiation wind speed air temperature relative humidity and terrain qualities such as elevation slope and reflectivity influencing et0 vary enormously particularly in topographically complicated basins zhang et al 2019 gebremedhin et al 2022 the et of deciduous broadleaf trees and shrubs were under water stress at low middle elevations and under energy stress at high elevations in the taihang mountains peng et al 2020 in the qilian mountains potential evapotranspiration is sensitive to wind speed in some areas and then switches to relative humidity in other areas yang et al 2019 in the heihe basin relative humidity is the most sensitive meteorological factor followed by wind speed zhao et al 2015 along the shaliu river the higher et mainly appeared in the midstream and in the southern region of qinghai lake ma et al 2019 as the dominant controls for et switched from water conditions to energy conditions in fact the corridor effect of the river valley on the et is partly shown but not emphasized in these literatures however few researchers have looked at the causes of vertical zonation of et0 in topographically complex basins as well as the mechanisms by how special topography characteristics impact the distribution of et0 at different elevation gradients due to a lack of stations and the observation difficulty the evapotranspiration and potential changes of complex conditions basins are currently poorly known ragettli et al 2016 the red river basin china rrbc is part of the longitudinal range gorge region in southwest china with unique geographical and ecological features climatic conditions of rrbc exhibit highly distinct vertical zonal characteristics as a variety of

the valley of yuanjiang river and the ailao mountains peak is approximately 2400 m with the maximum being 3360 m due to the alp and valley terrain the et0 of the rrbc will exhibit completely different vertical zonation characteristics than other watersheds under the influence of special topographic features and different climatic factors hence rrbc is an ideal basin to depict the geographical differentiation of et0 and its climate variables due to the composite effcts of the mountain valley terrain and elevation gradient overall the research mentioned above shows much representative progress of evapotranspiration change with topography change however patterns and mechanisms of the et0 change under the effects of elevation and alp valley still need to be clarified therefore this manuscript employs the elevation and alp valley as the topography background and aims to reveal the elevation gradient differentiation of et0 the effect of climatic variables on et0 and their differentiation formed by the alp valley effect especially in eal wal and yjv accordingly this manuscript aims to 1 characterize the spatial and temporal variation of rrbc reference evapotranspiration by using fao 56 penman monteith and non parametric trend tests on 32 meteorological stations from 1960 to 2021 2 quantify the sensitivity of et0 to different climate variables and their changing characteristics based on partial differential sensitivity 3 demonstrate the geographical differentiation of reference evapotranspiration from insights of elevation gradient and alp valley distribution 4 exemplify the topography effect on climate conditions in alp valley areas by aridity index 5 discusse and synthesize the et0 s change with elevation gradient and alp valley effect and its climate controls using the schematic diagram 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 study area the red river basin china rrbc contains complex landforms such as alp valleys mountains rivers mid low mountain gorges v u valleys et al and various elevation gradients of geomorphology the red river is an international river that flows through china vietnam and laos it comprises the main stem and five distinct outbound tributaries including the lixianjiang tengtiao panlong nanli and nanxi river the rrbc is distributed in the yunnan guizhou plateau region in southwest china occupying 7 9 104 km2 areas of the total red river basin ailao mountains is roughly 800 km long and has an area of about 503 6 km2 stretching across the central rrbc the ailao mountains form the eastern boundary of the longitudinal range gorge region that run north south with elevation decreasing from 3360 m to about 70 m at hekou county due to geological tectonics the ailao mountain has a natural drop of up to 2400 m to the red river valley according to the crest on the west side of the red river rising and the strata on the east side sliding down moreover the ailao mountains on the red river s west side are 200 800 m higher than the mountains on the east side on average on the east side of ailao mountain the mainstream named yuanjiang river in china runs along yuanjiang valley yjv lixianjiang river named heishui river in vietnam flows along the lixianjiang valley lxv on the west side of the mountain fig 1 another major tributary named panlong river runs along the panlong valley which located east of the rrbc hence the rrbc is an ideal area for investigating the vertical gradient and effects on the geographic elements and its dominant variables the rrbc is located in the low latitude subtropical plateau with a humid monsoon climate under the atmospheric circulation and complicated terrain conditions the climate types show unique stereoscopic climate characteristics and the plant cover types and agricultural cultivation types are diverse assortments the rrbc is at the boundaries between the southwest indian ocean monsoon and the southeast pacific ocean monsoon may to october is the wet season with an average temperature of about 27 to 29 c and 85 90 of total precipitation november to april of the following year is the dry season with an average temperature about 16 21 c three climatic sub types is predominant in the corresponding three zones above the sanjiangkou and the jingdong the altitude ranges from 1600 to 2200 m and the annual average temperature and precipitation is 15 18 c and 800 1000 mm respectively the area belongs to the central plateau temperate zone below the sanjiangkou and jingdong above malipo maguan pingbian and jinping belongs to the hot area of yuanjiang with an average annual temperature varies between 20 and 21 c and rainfall between 700 and 1200 mm malipo maguan pingbian and jinping are tropical monsoon forest areas with an altitude of 70 100 m an annual average temperature above 21 c and precipitation of 1500 2000 mm the rrbc has a diverse assortment of plant cover types and agricultural cultivation types including primarily rice cultivation in terraced fields and along flat land maize and potato in the mountains sloping fields tea gardens in sloping fields yuanjiang valley with a vegetation type of savanna similar to that of tropical africa is the main agricultural irrigation area of rrbc the total water resources in the rrbc is 45 76 billion m3 the exploitation rate is only 4 27 and 86 2 of water utilization is agriculture consumption climate characterized by contemporaneous heat and rainfall makes most water vapors return to the atmosphere in evaporation during the rainy season and cannot be effectively used as the various climate conditions and unbalanced water resource distribution frequent droughts lead to high evapotranspiration demands with a complex seasonal variation that substantially influence local agricultural development the contradiction between water use and crop evapotranspiration makes the treatment and management of water use in the rrbc need to be supported by objective and scientific evapotranspiration assessments 2 1 2 data the daily meteorological data includes average daily air temperature t at the height of 2 m atmospheric pressure p wind speed at the height of 2 m u mean relative humidity rh daily precipitation prep and sunshine duration sd from 1960 to 2021 the meteorological data of a total of 32 meteorological stations in rrbc appendix table 1 are collected fig 1 the dataset is rigorously quality controlled by the national climatic centre of china meteorological administration national meteorological information center 2019 and is used to calculate the et0 with the fao 56 penman monteith function allen et al 1998 and climate elasticity with sensitivity equation among stations huapo station only provided monitoring data in 2020 due to observation constraints moreover the dem data in 30 30 m are from nasa s land processes distributed active archive center lp daac and downloaded from usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov the basin data and introduction information are from the statistical bureau of yunnan province china 2 2 research design and reference evapotranspiration calculation 2 2 1 vertical gradient and alp valley setting in flat land the geography parameters are appreciably similar at close geographic locations and only affected by latitude and longitude however with the elevation change vertical zonality will be dominant the south north and east west temperature gradients are changed with the latitude and elevation change in the alp valley area the sharp elevation change in alp valley will constantly change the evapotranspiration and has an overlapping effect complementary with latitude and longitude variation alp valley areas are terrain areas with lofty mountains standing significantly above their surroundings and deep valleys with steep rocky sides and rivers flowing through many landscapes as mountains valleys canyons rivers basins basin ranges and piedmont flat land distribute and combine stochastically in these areas fig 2 uplifted mountains with high elevations and steep slopes divide the total areas into different sides hills valleys multi peaks and basin ranges the deep incised valleys distribute low areas between mountains along river sides there are piedmont flat land and erosion hillside fields distributing from the river end to the source the geomorphologic feature should contain the u shaped valley v shaped alp gorge narrow gorge and mountain feature uplifted terrains and low settled rivers may block water vapor exchange on both sides of the mountain like a barrier and through the foehn effect generated by the vast elevation difference the moist air at the top of the mountain is changed to dry air on the river a corridor effect by long and narrow valleys overlaps with terrain gradient and valley transportation along the mountain different slope sides may exhibit the cardinal points and correspondingly directed overall effects of barrier corridor effects along the river valley the constant change trend or orientation may be displayed according to the similar water vapor transfer the complex topography characteristics of the alp valley area and the resulting barrier corridor effects cause a variety of climate types and atmospheric circulation leading to a dry hot river valley landscape fig 2 2 2 2 reference evapotranspiration calculation reference evapotranspiration representing the environmental demand for evapotranspiration is an evaporation process background on the evapotranspiration rate of a short green crop with a height of 0 12 m a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m and an albedo of 0 23 completely shading the ground and with adequate water status in the soil profile in this study daily et0 defined by the food and agriculture organization fao is calculated using the recommended and revised method based on the penman monteith equation fao 56 penman monteith allen et al 1998 at meteorological stations then the monthly et0 seasonal et0 and yearly et0 are aggregated from daily et0 the fao 56 penman monteith method is expressed as follows 1 e t 0 0 408 Œ¥ r n g Œ≥ 900 t 273 u e s e a Œ¥ Œ≥ 1 0 34 u 2 e s 0 611

calculation of et0 can be seen in allen et al 1998 2 2 3 research key points point 1 the elevation gradient differentiation of et 0 the impact of vertical gradient on reference evapotranspiration mainly depends on the elevation varies with the mountains valleys and composite terrains in rrbc under normal circumstances meteorological stations at different elevations are selected as much as possible to represent the meterogical change from alp terrains to valleys however the idea stations in similar latitude and longitude diffirent elevation are extremely scarce hence the elevation gradient differentiation should be digged from the situation of different elevation with similar latitude and longitude in alp regions of rrbc the evapotranspiration of different slope sides near similar elevation refer specifically to the basal latitude zonality meanwhile the evapotranspiration difference from similar longitude and latitude but different elevation displays the vertical zonality due to the vertical distribution of natural zones in mountainous areas and valleys in valleys the reference evapotranspiration is calculated based on the representative stations from the river end to the source therefore a completed station scale elevation gradient differentiation of et 0 is presented and discussed point 2 the mountain and accompanied river valley cause et 0 differentiation through barrier corridor as shown by the characteristics of et0 along the elevation an elevation gradient differentiation of reference evapotranspiration is demonstrated however differentiations from the barrier corridor effects may alter the original et0 s elevation gradient change should be identified meteorological stations distributed along different slope sides of alp are chosen to reveal the values and change trend diffenrence due to the water vapor transfer barrier effect increase with increasing mountains elevation and the warm humid air and dry hot air shift in the same way respective stations settled along valleys are chosen to elucidate the composite effects of elevation gradient evapotranspiration change and corridor effect of evapotranspiration besides the topographical impacts and barrier corridor effects can be demonstrated and characterized with the aridity index ai based on the dryness of climatic conditions determined by potential evaporation and precipitation point 3 et 0 shows different responses sensitivity to climatic variables at mountains and accompanied river valley areas there are many variables contributing to et 0 such as surface solar radiation wind speed relative humidity soil heat flux saturation vapor pressure actual vapor pressure and psychrometric constant under the circumstances of et 0 changes with elevation and affected under the effects of barrier corridor the climate factor of et 0 sensitive response requires to be deduced and examined and then the dominant climate variables for mountains valleys and slopes should be determined to reveal the mechanism of how the complex terrains impact the et 0 spatial temporal distribution and trend change moreover whether the variable plays a negative or positive effect is proceeded and then how the variable changes in its trend and with elevation are extended 2 3 sensitivity analysis sensitivity coefficients are converted into the dimensionless form by employing a differential equation to quantify the degree of different factors impacts on et0 mccuen 1974 the sensitivity coefficients can be calculated as follows 4 s x i lim Œ¥ x i 0 Œ¥ e t 0 e t 0 Œ¥ x i x i e t 0 x i x i e t 0 where xi is the climatic variable and s xi is the sensitivity coefficient of et 0 related to xi with a range from 1 to 1 a positive negative s xi of xi indicates that et 0 will increase decrease as the xi increases essentially a larger absolute value of the s xi indicates that the xi has a larger effect on et 0 more details about the calculation of s xi can be found in supplemental files many meteorological factors are involved in the fao 56 penman monteith method considering surface solar radiation rs u the relative humidity rh and t are widely used in previous studies huo et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 she et al 2017 and these four variables can string all other climatic factors and causing fewer uncertainties according to eq 4 hence they are settled to be representive climate variables to discuss the et 0 sensitivity 2 4 aridity index the aridity index ai characterizes the degree of dryness of climatic conditions determined by potential evaporation and precipitation thornthwaite 1948 first expressed ai as the ratio of precipitation to potential evaporation or et0 and then this method became widely used tsiros et al 2020 in this study a similar definition proposed by huo et al 2013 zhang et al 2014 is used then ai is transformed into a number values from 1 to 1 to distinguish between dry and wet climatic conditions 5 ai e t 0 p r e p e t 0 where et0 is the annual reference evapotranspiration mm day and prep is the annual precipitation mm day when ai is higher than 0 it means that the climate conditions are dry whereas ai 0 means that the climate conditions are wet 2 5 mann kendall trend detection the mann kendall mk trend detection a rank based non parametric test method is employed to detect the temporal trend test of sequence in this work mann 1945 kendall 1975 accordingly each value in the sequence is compared with the rest then the sum of the number of values greater than the value is calculated as s chen et al 2019 6 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i when n 8 the sequence is approximately normally distributed then the expected mean of s e s and the variance value var s is determined as follows mann 1945 kendall

pass the significance test that z 2 32 to ensure the credibility of the results 2 6 spearman rho test spearman rho test sr is another non parametric trend test using the correlation between time series and variables the mathematical term of sr test can be defined as shadmani et al 2012 10 r 1 6 i 1 n d i 2 n 3 n where r is the correlation coefficient between time series and variables n is the length of the time series di represents the difference between a ranked pair the t value is used to test the significance of the correlation and its calculation is as follows wang et al 2007 11 t r n 4 1 r 2 t obeys a t distribution with n 2 degrees of freedom if t tŒ± 2 the correlation is significance tŒ± 2 is from the t distribution table in this study the significance of the trend is determined by both mk and sr which means the trend can be considered significant only if both mk and sr pass the significance test the result of mk and sr appendix table 2 can be found in the supplemental files 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal differentiation of et0 along the elevation gradient a significant spatial difference exists in et0 in rrbc along the elevation gradient and within complex topography fig 3 a the highest et0 reaches 1308 49 mm year at yuanjiang station while the lowest is only 892 64 mm year at xichou station located in the easternmost part of the basin fig 1 the multi year average et0 in rrbc decreases from the northwestern to the southeastern part of the basin as the average elevation decrease from 2300 to 130 m at stations areas with higher multi year average et0 mainly appear in the northwestern part of rrbc and the yjv demonstrating a zonal distribution along the yuanjiang river et0 within 22 stations of the total 32 stations in rrbc displays an increasing trend during 1960 2021 according to the mk trend detection among them 3 stations show a significant increase at the 0 01 test level the other 8 stations display a decrease trend two has no trend as just one year of data was provided for one station and the other station has no trend indeed no one station in the 8 stations in decrease trend shows siginificant decrease trend fig 3b besides 6 of the 8 stations with a decreasing trend distributes in the eastern of ailao mountains 12 of the 15 stations with et0 less than 1050 mm year increased and 10 of 16 stations with et0 greater than 1050 mm year increased by combining the geographic distribution features of et0 it is conceivable to find that the stations with lower latitudes and elevations have more significant increasing trends in et0 the intra annual et0 in rrbc varies with the month change and elevation gradient distinctively fig 3b the intra annual et0 in rrbc increases from january to may and decreases till december in which the et0 stays in the bottom value the monthly et0 lasts a high value during march may and peaks in may the et0 at different stations varies less in summer june august and more in spring the difference in monthly et0 at stations between yjv and rrbc is slight in summer and big in winter november to january et0 in stations above 1700 m is significantly higher than stations between 1400 m and 1700 m in spring and winter but lower in summer et0 in stations below 1400 m has a similar intra annual variation with stations between 1400 m and 1700 m et0 shows an increasing trend with increasing elevation fig 3c nonetheless et0 in the yjv is significantly different from other mountain areas as it generally possesses higher values typically et0 during 1200 1400 m in yjv is significantly higher than adjacent elevations the et0 of several stations during 1200 m 1600 m varies dramatically as the latitudinal differences of these stations and the differences in climatic conditions formed by the substantial differences in topography the et0 in rrbc shows a mainly increasing trend during 1960 2021 from the insights of yjv and rrbc fig 3d the average growth rate is 27 77 mm year per decade the inter annual variation is bounded by the 1990s before which et0 mainly shows an increasing trend turns a sharp decline to its lowest value in the 1990s and then increases again the maximum and the minimum et0 in rrbc occured in 2019 and 1990 respectively in contrast the maximum and the minimum et0 in yjv occured in 2020 and 1990 respectively at the interannual scale the average et0 of rrbc is always lower than that of yjv which indicates that when there is no significant difference in precipitation the yjv area will be drier than other areas of the rrbc the difference between yjv and rrbc is particularly significant in high et0 years moreover climate change may affect yjv more sensitively and drastically when climatic conditions become drier 3 2 sensitivity of et0 to climate variables according to the sensitivity analysis results fig 4 rrbc s et0 is sensitive to the climate variables in descending order as rs rh t and u the interannual variation characteristics of the four different climate factors and their sensitivity coefficients indicate that the sensitivity coefficients of rs and rh are decreasing the rh values negative in fig 4 while the sensitivity coefficients of t and u are increasing fig 4a the sensitivity coefficient of rs senrs and rs have the same significant increase trend from 1990 to 2000 and then change out of sync the sensitivity coefficient of t sent and t increased significantly during the past 60 years the sensitivity coefficients of rh senrh and rh showed similar decrease trends during the past 60 years the senrh is negative the sensitivity coefficients of u senu keep increasing during the 60 years while u decreases oppositely the synchronous increase in senrh and senu may cause a rapid rise in et0 around 1970 and the increase in sent and senu may cause a rise around 1980 moreover the et0 sensitivity to climate variables changes may be changed according to the contrast relation of variables sensitivity senrs shows a decreasing trend in most stations whereas sent senrh and senu show an increasing trend at more stations fig 4b 17 stations in rrbc show an increasing trend in senrs 5 of which have a very significant trend 15 stations show a decreasing trend in senrs 3 of which show a significant trend sent shows an increasing trend at 24 stations 5 pass the significance test the significant decreasing trend of sent only is shown at 2 stations the most sensitive areas for et0 to t are concentrated at 3 stations in the yjv with higher values than other stations of rrbc senu shows an increasing trend at 25 stations 6 of which show a significant trend furthermore an opposite trend in senu is shown at the remaining 6 stations none of them show a significant trend in the yjv senu values are higher than in other areas the area where et0 is insensitive to rh is mainly located on the western side of the rrbc and the rh sensitivity increases with areas moving eastward senrh mainly shows a decreasing trend and the decreasing trend passes the significance test in 10 stations only 7 stations show an increasing trend in senrh however none of them passes the significance test the sensitivity coefficients of different climatic factors mainly show a decrease with increasing elevation fig 4c the highest senrs appears at the lowest elevation station while the lowest senrs stay at the station with the highest elevation excluding the station with only a year of monitoring data when the elevation 1000 m the senrs s distributions of the four stations are consistent with the overall elevation gradient distribution characteristics sent decreases with increasing elevation evidently while elevation 1000 m sent significantly shows higher values than that at higher elevation stations senu does not significantly change with increasing elevation its highest and lowest values are around 1400 m the overall characteristics of senrh with elevation change are opposite to those of sent and senrs senrh increases with increasing elevation and fluctuates at some stations 3 3 barrier corridor effect on et0 and its sensitivity 3 3 1 barrier effect alp changes the et0 distribution with elevation change under the mountain barrier effect distributing along different slope sides of the alp produces a water vapor transfer barrier keeps the warm humid condition on the western side of the mountain induces the differentiation of climatic conditions and causes the et0 differentiation at the approximate same latitude and elevation the et0 of the western ailao mountains wal is much lower than that of the eastern ailao mountains eal at station scales fig 5 a the et0 of wal has a decreasing and subsequently rising elevation gradient distribution which elucidate that the lower latitudes of the two locations near 1200 m have lower et0 values the et0 of eal decreases with rising elevation roughly except the et0 at 1400 m at which et0 is extremely lower as the 0 8 latitude difference shows the dominant influence the et0 values change and elevation distribution patterns difference between wal and eal reveals that the alp has a barrier effect that alters the magnitude of et0 and its vertical zonation characteristics fig 5 a the sensitivity analysis results indicate that the barrier effect changes the dominant climate factors of et0 on both sides of ailao mountain fig 5 b the highest sensitivity coefficient of et0 to climate factor is rs at all stations on the wal and rh on the eal adding that senrh exceeds sent only at two wal stations hence et0 in wal is more sensitive to the two energy related climate variables rs and t similar to et0 senu has a partially elevation gradient distribution characteristic that it decreases and subsequently increases with elevation change the lower latitude and higher elevation cause rh higher hence the absolute value of senrh at the low latitude and higher elevation station is higher at each station in eal sent has a minor difference with senrs who exceeds senrh only at two stations senu decreases with elevation increase its value is near zero at pingbian station of the lowest et0 sent s elevation gradient distribution is similar to senu s and consistent with its distribution at rrbc senrs has a distinct elevation distribution pattern on ailao mountains than that on rrbc on which it rises at first and then declines senrh is related chiefly to latitude and elevation as it values higher in low latitude with high elevation or high latitude with low elevation 3 3 2 corridor effect et0 changes in the yjv illustrate the combined effects of elevation gradient and corridor effect on reference evapotranspiration in yjv et0 has a significant increasing trend with increasing elevation as hekou yuanyang honghe yuanjiang and nanjian stations in sequence along these stations the yuanjiang river runs in the corridor of yjv which creeps nearly longitudinally in the longitudinal range gorge region approximately 250 mm year reduction in et0 of hekou station the lowest latitude station in yjv is from of that in nanjian station the highest latitude station fig 6 in the valley spatial sequence the et0 at yuanjiang stations has a higher et0 than at nanjian other drivers influence the et0 and the corridor effect from yuanjiang station to nanjian there is around a 1000 m vertical distance change and approximately 1 5 latitude difference the reduction value may reduce the possible increase value of et0 at nanjian with elevation with latitude increase in addition yuanjiang is the closest station in the yjv to the prominent peak of the ailao mountains and is strongly influenced by the barrier effect superimposing corridor effect notably the dominant dry hot valley landscape formed by the barrier corridor effect intensifies the et0 increase effect which is consistent with the characteristics of the hydrological cycle under the dry hot valley landscape formed by the barrier corridor effect the intensive et0 at yuanjiang station exceeds that at the honghe station at which the dry hot effect degrades as the hill slope location little broad valley and lower mountains around the sensitivity analysis results indicate that the corridor effect changes the et0 s sensitivity to climate controls in the yjv area et0 here is most sensitive to rh at yuanyang and honghe station rs at hekou station and t at nanjian and yuanjiang station fig 6 senu shows a substantial increase along the yjv oriented to the river source in contrast senrs showed a decreasing trend along the yjv due to the location at the yjv s entry and lowest latitude of hekou et0 is most sensitive to rs and least sensitive to u at nanjian station the highest elevation station in yjv et0 is most sensitive to t it seems that sent has a decrease with elevation increase in yjv as the sensitivity distribution mentioned in section 4 2 however the temperature enhances the uncertainty of sent as the highest value turns at yuanjiang station which has the highest temperature in yjv hence the temperature affected by the corridor influences sent in the yjv senrh grows along yjv and also is affected by the barrier of the ailao mountains at honghe and yuanyang stations overall the corridor effect makes the et0 s sensitivity shows a stationary change along yjv in senu a partially stationary change in senrs and senrh and a nonstationary change in sent 3 4 spatial and temporal variation of the aridity index the interannual variation of the aridity index ai indicates that the rrbc is under wet climatic conditions as only 17 years are in dry conditions while 45 73 years are in wet climatic conditions fig 7 a a significant increase in ai of the rrbc occurred in 1980 2009 and 2019 when ai stayed at a positive number especially from 2009 to 2016 the wet dry conditions can be validated by the historical record such as the dry condition during 2009 2015 during which the yunnan province underwent a severe multi year drought lasting nearly 5 years with seasonal drought episodes the interannual variation of ai in wal eal and yjv are affected by the barrier corridor effect the ai of wal is less than 0 all the time implying that wal is always in a wet condition fig 7 b eal is always in a dry condition as its ai is greater than 0 in most years fig 7 c the yjv region stays a dry condition in the overall period as ai values fluctuate between wet and dry conditions during 1961 2001 and then turns into the dry condition and lasts to date fig 7 d furthermore after the 2009 drought the yjv remains dry condition and does not shift to wet conditions after 2015 as rrbc or to dry reduction as eal the difference in ai between wal and eal reveals the wet dry barrier effect of vapor energy and precipitation moreover the difference in ai between yjv and rrbc demonstrates the variation of the valley corridor effect of precipitation and et 0 the ai of wal eal yjv and rrbc shows that the barrier corridor effects modify the wet and dry climate conditions and the changing pattern of regional climate conditions when extreme climatic events such as droughts occur the spatial distribution of ai in the rrbc illustrates the difference in climatic conditions in different areas fig 8 in the western and southern areas of rrbc ai is generally less than 0 and climatic conditions are generally wetter than in the northern and northeastern parts the ai of all wal stations is less than 0 whereas the ai of 2 eal stations is not more than 0 the 5 stations located in the yjv their ais show a typically geographical variation characteristic of progressively rising ai with increasing latitude and along valley corridor which is compatible with the spatial distribution features of et0 and the variation characteristics under barrier corridor in comparison other stations in the rrbc with close distances exhibit opposite ai which might be related to changes in small scale landforms and elevation differences 3 5 geographical differentiation formed by topography in rrbc the combined effects of barrier corridor and vertical elevation gradient on the geographical variation of et0 and its dominant climate factors are revealed by pattern and differentiation analysis combining the elevation gradient distribution of et0 in rrbc and its inducing spatial temporal variation in rrbc fig 9 the barrier corridor effect of rbbc has resulted in a geographical distribution pattern of climatic conditions that is compatible with the et0 distribution pattern fig 3 the ai of rrbc rises with elevation making the climate in the high elevation areas and the northern areas drier forming a spatial distribution pattern of et0 decreasing from higher elevations in the northwest to lower elevations in the southeast the barrier effect of the ailao mountains causes the climatic conditions to be wetter west of the ailao mountains and drier east of the ailao mountains thus making the et0 of the wal lower than that of the eal additionally the barrier effect alters et0 distribution in the vertical gradient and sensitivity to climatic variables between the eastern and western sides of the ailao mountains so that et0 in wal decreases and subsequently rises along with the elevation and is mainly dominated by rs and et0 in eal mainly controlled by rh decreases with rising elevation the corridor effect of the yjv causes et0 and ai to change along the river valley making the climatic conditions gradually turn drier along the valley corridor orientated to the river sources furthermore the corridor effect changes the dominant climate factors of et0 making the et0 of yjv mainly influenced by rh and t instead of rs which has the most significant influence on et0 in the whole basin and making the distribution characteristics of sent along the elevation gradient due to the sent of higher elevation stations in yjv area higher than that of lower elevation stations instead the ailao mountains of the rrbc block the warm humid air on the west side of the mountain significantly making the climate on the east side drier and enhancing the negative effect of rh on et0 making the et0 on the west side of the mountain significantly lower than that on the east side the corridor effect of the yuanjiang river valley forces the air to get drier as it advances along the river strengthening the effects of u and t on et0 resulting in et0 being substantially larger at the deeper region of the river than the entry the barrier corridor effect formed by the ailao mountains and the yuanjiang river valley modifies the magnitude of et0 by altering the dominating climatic element of et0 consequently it is the principal cause of et0 geographic variation in rrbc yuanjiang station located in the valley s center is synchronously impacted by the barrier corridor effect and has the maximum et0 of every station in the rrbc the et0 of rrbc primarily exhibits the vertical zonation characteristic of rising with increasing elevation this distribution pattern is shifted by the barrier corridor effect so that the et0 of the western side of the ailao mountains decreases and then rises with increasing elevation the et0 of the eastern side of the ailao mountains decreases with increasing elevation resulting in an elevation gradient pattern in rrbc the vertical cutting of mountains and river valleys creates the height gradient distribution pattern in rrbc 4 discussions 4 1 the linear relationship between et0 and elevation gradient is clarified the distribution of et0 in rrbc with elevation shows an apparent linear relationship that the reference evapotranspiration increase with the increasing elevation the higher reference evapotranspiration occurs at a higher elevation the relationship exists in the mountains areas and the yjv respectively fig 3 similarly the unequivocal linear relationship between evapotranspiration and topographic characteristics are stated in the state of s√£o paulo brazil bosquilia et al 2019 in taihang mountains areas peng et al 2020 they found that the highest evapotranspiration occurs on the highest elevation and slope and the lowest occurs on the lowest elevation and slope in complex topographic landscapes with a 2000 m elevation difference et0 in sichuan province showed a trend of increasing with increasing elevation below 3000 m and then decreasing zhang et al 2018 in the qinghai lake basin on the tibetan plateau evapotranspiration increases with elevation and reaches its highest value in the range of 3600 3700 m after which it decreases with elevation ma et al 2019 a decreasing trend of et0 below 2000 m was found due to the negative contribution of u in the northwest china while above 2000 m et0 shows an increasing trend under the positive effect of t liu et al 2021 these indicated that with the elevation incrseae there is a linear relationship between evapotranspiration and elevation in a specific range of altitude and the relationship reverse at one or more elevation threshold 4 2 barrier corridor effect modifies the et0 s change with elevation gradient and climate variable sensitivity topographic characteristics considering barrier corridor are critical for understanding et0 s spatial temporal differentiation among the mountain stations although there is a linear relationship between et0 and elevation gradient the realistic relationship lines around the fitted line during 1000 m 2400 m and fluctuates up and down fig 3 if considering the stations in the yjv the fitted line will change sharply even turns into a nonlinear relationship fig 3c typically during 1200 1400 m where et0 is higher than the adjacent elevation range the reason for this anomaly is mainly due to the nanjian et0 affected by the ailao mountains barrier and the yjv corridor et0 distributes differently on the different sides of the ailao mountains due to the water vapor transfer barrier along the elevation the et0 of wal has a decreasing and subsequently rising elevation gradient distribution in contrast the et0 of eal decreases with rising elevation roughly except for the et0 at 1400 m even at the approximate same latitude and elevation the et0 of wal is much lower than that of eal at station scales hence a validated linear relationship between et0 and elevation gradient is demonstrated from the overall basin distribution the mountain areas distribution and the valley areas distribution however the linear relationship between et0 and elevation gradient has a limitation of universality and should be modified with the complex topography overall the barrier effect from the alp and the corridor effect from the valley should be considered and given more attention to understanding its influence on et0 the effect of elevation on the sensitivity of climate factors is evident even in basins with very small areas yang et al 2019 in the rrbc the dominant climate factor for et0 is rs which is consistent with the results of previous studies based on the wholly china perspective fan et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zeng et al 2021 however to the difference of climatic conditions and large dominant landforms the dominant climate factor for et0 in northwestern china is u in the northeastern is maximum temperature and in the south is the sunshine duration wang et al 2017 similarly et0 in loess plateau shows significant spatial differences in the sensitivity distribution wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 she et al 2017 based on the national scale plateau scale and basin scale a consensus based sensitivity of climate factors on elevation distribution is not provided as the nonlinear change liu et al 2012 yang et al 2019 and linear change can be found mixed nonlinear roughly in rrbc the sensitivity coefficients of different climatic factors mainly decrease with increasing elevation fig 4c senrs and sent decrease with increasing elevation but senrs fluctuates significantly senu does not show a significant change with increasing elevation and senrh changes with elevation change opposite those of sent and senrs in the yjv senrs is weakening but senrh and senu are enhancing fig 4 the nonlinear relationship between sensitivity coefficients and elevation and location is more suitable to elucidate the corridor effect of yjv scientifically in the areas within elevation 1000 m the barrier effect of the ailao mountains and the effect of elevation gradient on the sensitivity of different climate factors are significantly different among them senrs and sent show a distinguished decrease with elevation which is not only related to their own distribution characteristics at elevation but also related to the topographic features in the basin mountains in rrbc are mainly distributed in the northern part of the basin and higher latitude leads to weaker rs this distribution characteristic also coincides with the results of existing studies li et al 2015 she et al 2017 yang et al 2019 4 3 impact of et0 geographical differentiation on hydrological simulation and agricultural irrigation hydrological simulation in topographically complex basins has long been the focus and challenge of hydrological research as an essential input parameter of the hydrological model the unique geographic differentiation of et0 in the alp valley region and the difference in variation between it and flat terrain will increase the uncertainty of the hydrological simulation process besides current hydrological models take less consideration of the effects of alp valley while our results can help comprehend and investigate the sources of uncertainty in hydrological simulations in basins with complex topography in perspective of evapotranspiration and its sensitivity to climate factors moraga et al 2021 as the representation of evaporative demand of a reference crop of the terrestrial surface the increase of et0 will increase crop transpiration soil and interception evaporation affecting agricultural irrigation sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 she et al 2017 the upward trend in et0 will lead to a higher requirement for irrigation and the complex spatial variability of et0 s dominant climate factors will pose significant challenges for irrigation management especially in basins with distinct climatic differences including the rrbc zeng et al 2021 in watersheds with flat topography insignificant spatial differences in climatic conditions allow for a convergence of agricultural irrigation practices but in watersheds with complex topography this management policy will fail our research on the geographical heterogeneity of ai and the effects of alp valley on et0 and its dominant climate factor can significantly help enhance irrigation management in complex terrain watersheds 4 4 uncertainty complicated composited topography and not enough observations in the rrbc take some uncertainty on the spatial temporal differentiation of et0 and its attribution analysis et0 is calculated by employing the fao 56 penman monteith formula based on artificially determined homogeneous surface parameters however due to the intricacy of underlying surface properties overestimation or underestimation of et0 exists landeras et al 2018 xiang et al 2020 as the hydrological parameter evapotranspiration is not independent of changes in the land surface climate variables as the non linear relationship of hydrology processes chen et al 2014 especially in this complicated composited topography of mountainous terrain longitudinal range gorge region limited by not enough stations in the rrbc and the monitoring period the barrier effect lacks more fine scale analysis on the et0 on the whole ailao mountains he et al 2005 wu et al 2012 while in the analysis of the corridor effect on et0 the et0 at yuanyang station should be part of the dry hot valley and affected by the foehn effect duan et al 2015 should values closer to honghe and yuanjiang than hekou the possible effect is from the barrier effect however the effect here lacks support from the stations near the elevation which climbs upward along ailao mountain s slope meanwhile the et0 in nanjian is higher than the surrounding stations due to the corridor effect as partly affected by the dry hot valley fan et al 2020 and may be reduced by the foehn effect which requires deep discussion several trend tests have been proposed and have been used in many studys haktanir and citakoglu 2014 demir 2022 adding methods or cross vilidation can enhance the reliability of trend analysis however considering the workload and method advantage the mk and sr tests are included in this manuscript mann kendall trend detection is a rank based non parametric trend detection test recommended by world meteorological organization wmo and has been applied for many decades with the superimposing of this two trend test the results show more robustness and reliability on the one hand limitations such as serial correlation or period covered of mk and sr will decrease the reliability of the results yagbasan et al 2020 on the other hand when using mk with removing the autocorrelation of related data by pre whitening mkpw the results of the mann kendall test are distorted as the size of the time series is large herein the original series were used for the mann kendall test in this case according to the analysis of yue s research yue and wang 2002 in the furture serial correlation and more parameter tests are advised to employ in et0 and climate variables trend detection to reduce the uncertainty results and understand the effects of of serial correlation in research series jhajharia et al 2012 haktanir and citakoglu 2015 g√º√ßl√º 2018 sensitivity coefficients are helpful to identify the et0 s sensitive climate factors and determine the dominant factors and main driver contribution of et0 s change sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 biazar et al 2019 as in some areas u is the dominant factor of et0 as it s the largest contribution to et0 however it has not a high sensitivity coefficient fan et al 2016 li et al 2017 she et al 2017 basically from the definition of sensitivity coefficients eq 4 and differential equation basic method shiri 2019 the difference between sensitivity coefficients and actual contributions of different climatic factors is that higher actual contributions can be obtained if climate variable has marked changes with small sensitivity coefficients however the calculation method and differential equation may take some uncertainties as the hypothetical artificial underlying surface shiri 2019 and the interactions between climatic factors alexandris and proutsos 2020 although we choose the four climatic factors as independent if we ignore their interactions uncertainty may be present in the spatial and temporal characteristics of the sensitivity coefficients of et0 meanwhile the distribution characteristics of senrh and senu on the elevation gradient are more complicated than senrs and sent if not enough stations are considered and other datasets are used the specific and validated sensitivity coefficient distribution characteristics with elevation gradient and under barrier corridor effects cannot be fully summarized hence based on the exploratory research the barrier corridor effects on the climate factors sensitivity can be found preliminary however the specific mechanism of the superimposed effects on et0 its dominant variable and factor sensitivity needs further analysis 5 conclusion reference evapotranspiration et0 in rrbc is calculated from 1960 to 2021 based on 32 meteorological stations the spatial temporal pattern of et0 is demonstrated with the elevation gradients and by using the mann kendall trend four climatic factors solar radiation rs wind speed u relative humidity rh and average daily air temperature t are employed to assess the et0 s sensitivity to climatic factors via partial differential sensitivity analysis and then the aridity index ai provides more information to validate the spatiotemporal pattern of et0 and effects from elevation and topography furthermore the schematic diagram of the et0 s change with elevation and mountain valley and the sensitivity in rrbc is illustrated to explore the et0 spatial temporal pattern the influence of the barrier corridor effect on et0 formed by the ailao mountains and yuanjiang river valley yjv and et0 s dominating climatic variables the results presented and discussed in this article provide an attractive new look at elevation behavior in et0 distribution over complex terrain as in alp valley areas such results may play an essential role in water cycle modeling and water resources security guarantee in mountain areas and the agricultural sector and water resources management can take targeted measures to improve irrigation efficiency and reduce water wastage based on the variability of et0 and the prominent impact climate factors in alp valley areas the main results are as follows 1 the et0 in rrbc gradually decreases from northwest to southeast increases with increasing elevation as the higher et0 occurs at a higher elevation the linear relationship between et0 and elevation that et0 increases with increasing elevation exists in the mountain areas and the yuanjiang river valley has been validated during 1960 2021 the et0 increased at an average rate of 27 77 mm per decade but the increase trend and rate varied in different stations 2 et0 is most sensitive to rs followed in descending order by rh t and u the interannual variation characteristics of the four different climate factors and their sensitivity coefficients indicate that the sensitivity coefficients of rs and rh are decreasing while the sensitivity coefficients of t and u are increasing during 1960 2021 the sensitivity coefficients of different climatic factors mainly show a decrease with increasing elevation senrs and sent show a decrease with increasing elevation but senrs fluctutes significantly senu does not show a significant change with increasing elevation in contrast senrh changes with elevation change opposite those of sent and senrs in the yjv senrs is weakening but senrh and senu are enhancing 3 the spatial and temporal variations of aridity index ai indicate that the ai increases with rising elevation resulting in drier climatic conditions in the north of the rrbc and the ai increases with time through resulting in the rrbc is under wet climatic conditions during 1960 2008 and mainly dry during 2009 2021 the spatial distribution of ai in the rrbc illustrates that the western and southern areas of rrbc are generally wetter than the northern and northeastern wal is wetter than eal which follows by yjv 4 barrier corridor effect and elevation gradient influence the et0 and its dominant climate factors on the spatial temporal distribution pattern and climate variables sensitivity in rrbc a schematic diagram is illustrated to explore the et0 s spatial temporal pattern the barrier corridor effect and et0 s dominating climatic variables the barrier effect of the ailao mountains in rrbc makes et0 on the west side lower than on the east side and it will first decrease and then increase with elevation whereas et0 on the east side decreases with elevation meanwhile the barrier effect causes et0 on the west side to be the most sensitive to rs and on the east side to rh the corridor effect causes et0 to grow along the yjv s latitudinal rise making the climatic conditions substantially gradually turn drier along the valley corridor orientated to the river source while the sensitivity coefficients of u rise and the sensitivity coefficients of rs fall the barrier corridor effect causes the climate on the west side of the ailao mountains to be wet and the east side dry and causes the ai of the yjv to rise with latitude additionally the barrier effect alters et0 distribution and sensitivity to climatic variables in the vertical gradient between the eastern and western sides of the ailao mountains furthermore the specific mechanism of the superimposed effects on et0 its dominant variable and factor sensitivity needs further analysis credit authorship contribution statement junxu chen conceptualization

2012,dissolved carbon dc and dissolved nitrogen dn driven by rainfall partitioning are critical components of carbon and nitrogen cycles in terrestrial ecosystems especially in vegetation restoration areas however the variations of dc and dn fluxes in the input throughfall and stemflow and output infiltration and surface runoff water pathways of shrub ecosystem in drylands were poorly understood in this study the rainfall partitioning dissolved organic and inorganic carbon doc and dic and dn fluxes in 52 rainfall events affecting a xerophytic shrub ecosystem on the heavily eroded chinese loess plateau were measured over the 2019 2021 rainy seasons the contributions of plants and topsoil 0 5 cm to the variations in dc and dn fluxes along water pathways were quantified we found that the dc and dn fluxes in throughfall accounted for more than 80 of net input flux and the topsoil infiltration of dc and dn fluxes into soil layer below 5 cm depth were the most important output flux contribution more than 98 the mean event plant derived dc and dn fluxes were 52 2 and 5 3 mg m 2 respectively accounting for 45 4 and 12 2 of net dc and dn input fluxes 115 2 and 43 mg m 2 the soil buffered dc and dn fluxes 455 6 and 29 5 mg m 2 were 3 95 and 0 69 times greater than the net input fluxes respectively the dc and dn fluxes in infiltration had the best correlation and increased most quickly with rainfall depth in the four different water pathways furthermore the soil carbon content in 0 50 cm depth and soil nitrogen content in 0 10 cm depth in shrub covered land was significantly higher than those in bare land p 0 05 this study highlights the important roles of rainfall partitioning in plant sourced and soil buffered dc and dn fluxes which should be considered in soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation in drylands keywords rainfall partitioning hydrological flux carbon and nitrogen accumulation shrub water interaction drylands data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved nutrient cycles in vegetated ecosystems are intrinsically linked to their hydrological cycle as water is the main transporting agent and solvent van stan et al 2021 dissolved carbon dc including dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved nitrogen dn are highly active chemical components of the biogeochemical cycle currie et al 1996 playing an important role in the carbon and nitrogen cycles of vegetated ecosystems michalzik et al 2001 webb et al 2018 in these ecosystems rainfall is intercepted by the plant canopies before reaching the soil this compartment representing the first layer that rainfall passes through can spatiotemporally change the quantity and chemistry of the rainfall that enters the ecosystem van stan and stubbins 2018 atmospheric deposition of solutes on the plant canopy involves a complex suite of processes divided into wet and dry deposition wet deposition of dc and dn by rainfall on the plant canopy is partitioned into throughfall tf diffuse input stemflow sf point input and interception losses i evaporation an et al 2022 alves et al 2022 van stan et al 2017 the tf is a mixture of free rainfall through gaps in the canopy with no contact with the plant and released rainfall e g drips from leaves and stems the sum of tf and sf is defined as net rainfall np representing the effective water that will eventually reach the ground and will be chemically enriched by wash out of the vegetative surfaces momolli et al 2019 subsequently after passing through the ground litter np infiltrates into the soil in and is stored in the topsoil layer and or gives rise to surface runoff r nutrients distribution through infiltration and runoff is important in connecting plant and soil systems doetterl et al 2016 vania et al 2016 thus rainfall redistribution across the plant canopy and topsoil layer alters the spatial and temporal dynamics of water and nutrients leading to significant differences in dc and dn between tf sf in and r alves et al 2022 li et al 2019 song et al 2022 identification of dc and dn fluxes derived from plants and topsoil during the hydrological processes is key to our understanding of the dynamics of the carbon and nitrogen cycles chen et al 2019 song et al 2022 tonello et al 2021 the dc or dn fluxes in tf sf r and soil solution infiltration

concentrations in both tf and sf reveal the importance of plant derived carbon and nitrogen input fluxes of ecosystem alves et al 2022 van stan and stubbins 2018 the dc and dn changes in r and soil solution highlight the buffering effect of topsoil e g leaching and adsorption which is important for soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation li et al 2019 song et al 2022 throughout the input and output water pathways which are relative to the ecosystem the dc and dn fluxes within vegetation soil system are influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors such as rainfall characteristics canopy structure and soil properties alves et al 2022 you et al 2020 most of previous studies have explored the role of canopy exchange in dissolved nutrient transport processes or have discussed topsoil buffering of dissolved nutrient export processes momolli et al 2019 tonello et al 2021 vania et al 2016 van stan and stubbins 2018 zanchi et al 2015 further studies are needed to integrate changes in dc and dn fluxes during both input and output water pathways of ecosystem and quantify the contributions of plants and topsoil effects to dc and dn fluxes the drylands suffer from water and nutrient scarcity which is a critical limiting factor of vegetation growth and investigations of dissolved nutrient fluxes are important for vegetation restoration in drylands however there are markedly fewer studies available on dissolved nutrient fluxes of shrubs in drylands under rainfall redistribution than in forest ecosystems in humid regions previous studies usually explored tf and sf ion enrichment na k ca2 nh4 so4 2 no3 and cl by shrub species e g luna robles et al 2019 whitford et al 1997 zhang et al 2016 a recent study investigated the dc flux in dryland shrub ecosystems li et al 2019 but did not consider the changes in dn flux and ignored the contribution of sf which is an important source of dc and dn inputs for shrubs the lack of observational data on dc and dn fluxes in dryland shrub ecosystems limits our understanding of the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen fluxes in the water pathways leaving considerable uncertainty when calculating soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation in this study we measured doc dic and dn concentrations in rainfall tf sf r and soil solution infiltration of a typical xerophytic shrub salix psammophila on the loess plateau china during the 2019 2021 rainy seasons the effects of plants and topsoil on dc and dn fluxes throughout the hydrological processes were investigated our objectives were 1 to reveal patterns of dc and dn concentrations and fluxes during different water pathways in dryland shrub ecosystems and 2 to quantify the effects of plants and topsoil on dc and dn fluxes the study is a contribution to our understanding and ability to predict ecosystem carbon and nitrogen balances in drylands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design this study was conducted in the liudaogo catchment 110 21 110 23 e 38 46 38 51 n in shenmu shaanxi province the catchment has an area of 6 89 km2 and is located at an elevation of 1274 m in transition zone between the loess plateau and the mu us desert fig 1 a this region has a moderate temperate continental climate with a mean annual rainfall potential evapotranspiration and air temperature of 437 mm 1337 mm and 8 4 c respectively mean for the period 1971 2013 obtained from the climatic station rainfall is concentrated between july and september accounting for approximately 70 80 of annual rainfall the groundwater table exceeds 20 m and rainfall is the most important available water resource for sustaining local ecosystem the main soil type is sandy loess and sand with weak cohesion high permeability and low water holding capacity soil survey staff 2019 due to long term human activities most of the natural vegetation in the catchment has been disturbed in recent decades ecological restoration has been carried out by planting dryland perennial shrubs and semi shrubs such as salix psammophila caragana korshinskii and artemisia ordosica yang et al 2019 the shrubs are distributed sparsely with distinct inter spaces the formation of fertility islands and deposition of organic matter are the main mechanism for shrubs to adapt to the barren sandy environment and efficiently utilize nutrients ridolfi et al 2008 the s psammophila which is the most abundant xerophytic shrub was chosen for study this species is characterized by an inverted cone shaped crown with multiple branches radiating from the base yang et al 2019 a schematic layout of the s psammophila 25 years old site is shown in fig 1 the shrubs density of the site was about 470 shrubs ha the mean height number of branches and branch diameter of shrub plant in the site was 2 99 m 53 and 11 5 mm respectively three hexagonal plots each of 12 3 m2 were set up on approximately 20 slopes fig 1b with each containing one s psammophila plant of similar crown heights and crown areas see table 1 the perimeter of the plots was separated from the external flow production by plaster slabs which were inserted into the soil at a depth of approximately 50 cm a u shaped pvc catch basin was installed at the bottom edge of each plot to collect surface runoff and sediment generated within the plot 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 measurements of plant and soil characteristics plant traits were measured for individual plants and branches within each plot for each plant we measured the shrub height m the number of branches and the projected canopy area m2 which includes the entire area within the canopy boundary as seen from above for each branch we measured branch length cm with a tape measure branch angle o with a pocket geological compass branch

three manual rain gauges 314 12 cm2 collection area were placed near the tbrg at 120 angle and 50 cm radius to calibrate the tbrg for rainfall depth fig 1c in this study a rainfall event is defined as one that is greater than 0 2 mm tbrg resolution a rain free period of at least 4 h apart was considered to define separate events iida et al 2012 nine manual rain gauges 314 12 cm2 collection area were used to measure event based tf at three radial directions 120 beneath each shrub canopy at distance of 10 50 and 100 cm from the base of stems in each plot fig 1d the collectors consisted of stainless steel buckets stainless steel funnels and small balls to prevent evaporation with the funnels 30 cm above the ground to prevent water droplets and soil particles from splashing in from the ground a total of 23 branches 7 7 6 and 3 for branch diameter categories of 0 10 10 15 15 20 and greater than 20 mm respectively were selected to determine sf yield a funnel constructed from flexible aluminum foil sheets was used to collect sf fig 1e the funnel was fixed to each branch near the base and sealed with a neutral silicone sealing compound and a 0 5 cm diameter pvc hose was connected vertically to convey the sf from the funnel to the containers with lids sf collector with minimum travel time below the canopy within each experimental plot volumetric soil water content swc was monitored by ec 5 compact soil moisture sensors installed horizontally at depth of 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 50 cm soil moisture measurements were recorded at 10 min intervals by a datalogger onset hobo u30 usa fig 1g a large bucket 1 0 m3 with a lid was placed under the u shaped pvc catch basin below each plot to collect surface runoff which was measured after the cessation of individual rainfalls fig 1f 2 3 water sample collection and laboratory analysis after individual rainfall event water samples of rainfall tf sf and r were collected from the manual check gauges if the rainfall ended during the daytime we completed the sample collection within 2 h if the rainfall ended at night we completed the collection of water samples in the early morning of next day after water sampling all collection devices were rinsed with deionized water air dried and capped the lids were not removed until the next rainfall to avoid entering of dust on non rainy days in addition soil solution at 5 cm depth was collected using soil water samplers model 1900 spectrum company usa fig 1h with a suction force of 600 hpa pf 2 8 after individual rainfalls three samplers were installed in the soil at a 120 radial direction below the middle canopy of each shrub soil solutions below 5 cm were used to represent infiltrated water individual water samples in polyethylene bottles were refrigerated at 4 c in the laboratory for measuring dc and dn concentrations the laboratory analysis of water samples was completed within one month after field collection prior to analysis all water samples were filtered through a 0 45 Œºm mixed cellulose microporous filter membrane tianjin jinteng experiment equipment co ltd the concentrations of dc and dic concentrations were measured using a toc analyzer vario toc cube elementar germany and the concentration of dn was measured using an auto analyzer seal aa3 germany the doc concentration was the direct difference between the values of dc and dic concentrations we measured dc and dic concentrations for all water samples collected in 2019 2020 and 2021 and dn concentrations in 2020 and 2021 2 4 data analyses 2 4 1 calculation of water fluxes water balance at the event scale in the plot was calculated as follows 1 p t f s f i 2 tf s f i n r Œ¥ w r where p is rainfall depth mm tf is tf depth mm sf is stemflow depth mm i is interception loss mm r is surface runoff depth mm in is infiltration below 5 cm depth topsoil Œ¥wr is the soil water retained within 5 cm depth during rainfall the humidity of the air is high and the evaporation losses from ground litter or the surface of the mineral soil are very small which can be ignored in the water balance equation all the water fluxes were calculated at the plot scale after each rainfall event we measured tf volume of each throughfall gauge by measuring cylinder averaged them and then divided the volume by the open area of throughfall gauge into depth to obtain tf the sf volume measured on the selected branches were averaged and then multiplied by the total number of branches to obtain the total branch sf volume from the shrub plant in order to standardize the calculation of water fluxes the sf depth in the plot was estimated by dividing the total branch sf volume by the canopy area of shrub the r was estimated by dividing the surface runoff volume by the area of the plot the Œ¥wr was estimated by the difference in soil water content before and after the rainfall with the following formula 3 Œ¥ w r sw c 2 s w c 1 50 where swc 2 and swc 1 are the volumetric soil water content in the depth of 5 cm before and after the rainfall event respectively when the soil water has infiltrated and stabilized and 50 is the soil depth mm 2 4 2 calculation of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes the dc flux mg m 2 was calculated by multiplying the average dc concentration mg l 1 and the corresponding water flux l m 2 the dc flux balance during rainfall input was calculated using the following equation 4 f p f plant f tf f sf where fp and fplant were input dc fluxes in rainfall and from plant source secretion and dust respectively ftf and fsf were dc fluxes in tf and sf respectively the dc flux from plant source was estimated as the difference between the dc flux in np tf sf and the dc flux in rainfall 5 f plant f tf f sf f p the dc flux balance during the export of net rainfall from the topsoil was calculated using the following equation 6 f tf f sf f soil f r f in where fr and fin were output dc fluxes in surface runoff and infiltration respectively fsoil was soil buffered dc flux the dc flux from topsoil source was the difference between the output dc fluxes in r and infiltration fr fin and the input dc fluxes in np ftf fsf 7 f soil f r f in f tf f sf calculations of doc dic and dn fluxes were consistent with those of dc 2 4 3 statistical analyses one way analysis of variance anova was used to investigate the differences in dc doc dic and dn concentrations in the different water pathways linear regression models were used to study the effects of meteorological factors especially rainfall depth on the concentrations and fluxes of dc doc dic and dn in different water pathways to investigate the importance of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes sourced from plant and topsoil in soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation the differences of soil carbon and nitrogen contents beneath shrub canopy and inter shrub spaces were analyzed by one way anova statistical significance tests of the results were evaluated at p 0 05 statistical analysis was performed using spss 21 0 3 results 3 1 variations of water fluxes a total of 52 rainfall events with 679 4 mm were monitored during the 2019 2021 rainy seasons therein 21 rainfall events induced both input tf and sf and output r and in water fluxes those rainfalls had an accumulative rainfall depth of 471 4 mm 69 4 of the total amount during the study period including seven events in 2019 188 0 mm nine events in 2020 196 1 mm and five events in 2021 87 3 mm the rainfall depth per event ranged from 4 4 mm to 69 0 mm and mean rainfall intensity varied between 0 4 mm h 1 to 81 7 mm h 1 approximately 80 of the events had mean rainfall intensity 5 mm h 1 rainfall duration ranged from 0 2 h to 47 7 h the rainfall event with maximum rainfall depth 69 0 mm and longest duration 47 7 h occurred on 9 11 september in 2019 with an intensity of 1 4 mm h 1 fig 2 a the percentage of event throughfall tf ranged from 66 1 to 90 3 mean of 79 6 the percentage of stemflow sf ranged from 2 4 to 9 5 mean of 6 3 and interception loss percentage i ranged from 4 4 to 29 1 mean of 14 1 the largest component of rainfall was tf and the smallest component was sf fig 2b the ratios of topsoil infiltration in depth below 5 cm and surface runoff r to output water are presented in fig 2c the very small proportion of r in this study was evident accounting for only 0 1 1 4 with a mean value of 0 7 the output water was dominated by in which accounted for over 98 3 2 variations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen concentrations the concentrations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen in the input tf and sf and output water pathways r and in vary considerably from those in rainfall fig 3 as rainfall passed through the shrub canopy the concentrations of dc doc dic and dn showed an increasing trend from rainfall to tf and sf fig 3a d except for dic the mean event concentrations of dc doc and dn in sf 20 0 mg l 1 17 7 mg l 1 and 5 1 mg l 1 were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in rainfall 4 0 mg l 1 2 8 mg l 1 and 2 4 mg l 1 and tf 6 9 mg l 1 5 5 mg l 1 and 2 7 mg l 1 whereas no significant differences were found between rainfall and tf p greater than 0 05 in addition the composition of dissolved organic matter changed through the water pathway for example the dc dn ratio tended to increase from rainfall to tf and sf although there were no significant differences fig 3e p greater than 0 05 while the doc dic ratio in sf 9 1 was significantly greater than that in rainfall and tf fig 3f p 0 05 in comparison to rainfall tf and sf the concentrations of dc and dn in r and in was further changed being largely enriched fig 3 the concentrations of dc doc dic and dn in r 22 3 mg l 1 6 2 mg l 1 16 2 mg l 1 and 4 3 mg l 1 respectively and in 39 9 mg l 1 14 0 mg l 1 25 9 mg l 1 and 5 4 mg l 1 respectively were significantly higher than those in rainfall and tf p 0 05 and not significantly different between concentrations in r and sf p greater than 0 05 except for dic concentration changes in dissolved organic matter composition mainly occurred in the dc dn ratio with soil solution having the largest dc dn ratio 9 7 significantly greater than that of r 6 4 and sf 4 7 as well as rainfall 2 2 and tf 2 9 fig 3e p 0 05 the doc dic ratio did not differ significantly in rainfall tf r and soil solution fig 3f p greater than 0 05 which were all smaller than that in sf fig 3f p 0 05 3 3 variations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes 3 3 1 dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes in throughfall and stemflow the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in input water pathways of each rainfall event are shown in fig 4 the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in np tf sf 115 1 63 1 91 8 52 7 23 4 15 4 and 43 0 28 1 mg m 2 respectively were 1 83 2 03 1 31 and 1 14 times higher in rainfall 62 9 42 3 45 1 34 2 17 8 15 0 and 37 8 30 7 mg m 2 respectively thus the average event plant sourced dc doc dic and dn fluxes were 52 2 46 6 5 6 and 5 3 mg m 2 respectively table 2 the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in tf 18 4 182 4 12 8 154 9 5 6 62 5 and 13 1 112 9 mg m 2 respectively accounted for 81 5 79 0 89 0 and 87 0 of net input flux respectively fig 4 the maximum dc and doc fluxes in tf occurred on the same day 14 september in 2020 with rainfall amount of 34 8 mm while the largest dic and dn fluxes occurred on 17 july in 2020 with rainfall amount of 46 3 mm in contrast these four nutrient fluxes in sf accounted for 18 5 21 0 11 0 and 13 0 of the net input flux respectively these are larger than the proportion of np provided by sf during rainfall redistribution furthermore doc was the dominant carbon input flux accounting for 79 7 of dc fluxes 3 3 2 dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes in runoff and infiltration the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in in and r of each rainfall event are shown in fig 5 the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in output water pathway sum of r and in were 5 6 9 4 9 and 1 6 times higher than those in net input water sum of tf and sf the difference between the output and input dc doc dic and dn fluxes i e soil buffered nutrient fluxes were 455 7 260 4 195 3 and 29 5 mg m 2 respectively table 2 the dc doc dic and dn fluxes of in 94 8 1680 5 65 3 1006 7 18 2 673 8 and 12 0 213 0 mg m 2 respectively accounted for more than 98 of the total output flux the maximum dc doc dic and dn fluxes in in occurred on 17 july in 2020 with rainfall amount of 46 3 mm of these four nutrient output fluxes 2 were exported via r doc was the dominant carbon output flux accounting for 61 7 of the dc output flux the average fluxes of doc in r and in were 2 0 and 1 6 times higher than those of dic 3 4 relationships of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes with rainfall characteristics correlation tests and regression analysis indicated that rainfall depth was the main factor influencing the dc doc dic and dn concentrations and fluxes in the water pathways and the effects of rainfall intensity duration and antecedent rain free days i e the length of the antecedent dry period were not significant p greater than 0 05 specifically the dc doc dic and dn concentrations in tf sf and r decreased exponentially with rainfall depth until they stabilized at the lowest concentrations in large storms fig 6 however the dc doc dic and dn concentrations in in showed little variations with rainfall depth dc and dn fluxes in each water pathway increased linearly with rainfall depth fig 7 the dc doc and dn fluxes in input water pathway tf and sf were significantly correlated with rainfall depth p 0 05 while dic input fluxes in tf and sf were poorly correlated with rainfall depth p 0 16 and p 0 06 respectively furthermore the dissolved nutrient fluxes in tf increased more rapidly with rainfall compared to those in sf as shown in fig 7 all the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in the output water pathways r and in were significantly correlated with rainfall depth p 0 05 and dissolved nutrient fluxes in in increased more rapidly with rainfall depth with respect to r we also found that dissolved nutrient fluxes in in had the best correlation and increased fastest with rainfall depth in the four different water pathways 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of vegetation canopy to dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes vegetation cover changes the distribution patterns of rainfall and the dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes fig 8 in this study tf and sf accounted for 78 1 and 5 6 of rainfall depths respectively scouring and leaching of plant by rainfall resulted in increased nutrient concentrations in input water pathway tf and sf where organic matter formed by the degradation of the outer bark was washed by sf song et al 2022 sf has a longer residence time in the canopy than tf due to the larger and rougher surface area sf must pass through to reach the stem base portion an et al 2022 johnson and lehmann 2006 in our study differences in sources and residence time led to the different concentrations of nutrients in tf and sf chen et al 2019 van stan et al 2017 the dc and dn concentrations in sf were significantly higher than those in rainfall and tf especially the concentration of doc and the doc dic ratio fig 3 which may be due to the longer contact time between sf and shrub vegetative favoring the dissolution of doc chen et al 2019 van stan et al 2017 tf was the main water pathway of dc doc dic and dn input fluxes 93 9 73 2 20 7 and 37 9 mg m 2 respectively which were 4 41 3 94 7 67 and 7 43 times higher than the nutrient fluxes in sf 21 3 18 6 2 7 and 5 1 mg m 2 respectively this is easy to understand that tf has a greater water flux than sf although the dc and dn concentrations in sf were significantly higher than those in tf plant derived doc accounted for 50 8 of total doc input fluxes while sf which had the highest doc concentration but the lowest water quantity accounted for about 17 0 fig 8 the doc flux from sf was more abundant than the water flux it brought further illustrating the importance of sf for shrub adaptation to drylands the double funneling effect of vegetation aboveground and belowground johnson and lehmann 2006 that concentrates rainfall at shrub base sf and then delivers it as root induced preferential flow suggests that sf is an effective and important source of water and nutrients available for plants especially for plants in drylands with limited water and nutrients li et al 2009 ignoring sf fluxes which is normally the case could lead to large biases in water and nutrient budgets in drylands levia and germer 2015 4 2 contribution of topsoil to dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes increased in vegetation cover can reduce surface runoff from rainfall events in revegetated areas fu et al 2017 in this study in and r accounted for 68 2 and 0 5 of rainfall amount respectively fig 8 the changes in dc doc dic and dn concentrations from input tf sf to output water pathways in r were mainly due to the buffering effect of the topsoil soil buffering of nutrients is a systematic process that includes adsorption onto reactive minerals microbial transformation and re release into the soil solution during nutrient leaching a complex series of reactions that alter the dc doc dic and dn concentrations and fluxes in the output water pathway kaiser and kalbitz 2012 song et al 2022 in general more than 70 of doc in soil solution infiltration in comes from topsoil sources rather than exogenous doc m√ºller et al 2009 scott and rothstein 2014 in this study the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in in contributed over 98 of these in output fluxes in r r contributed little to the output nutrient fluxes due to its exceptionally small volume 1 of the rainfall fig 8 the concentrations of nutrient materials contributed less to the dynamics of the corresponding fluxes than the water fluxes themselves doetterl et al 2016 li et al 2019 4 3 importance of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes for soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation dc fluxes have usually been seen as a lesser component than carbon fluxes associated with primary productivity or heterotrophic respiration in terrestrial systems kalbitz and kaiser 2008 however the important role played by dc fluxes in ecosystems cannot be ignored as dc fluxes are carriers of carbon loss in topsoil kindler et al 2011 and are an important source of organic biomass in deep soils doetterl et al 2016 rumpel and k√∂gel knabner 2010 due to difficulties involved in direct measurements dc fluxes in soil layers particularly dc in in from topsoil to deeper soils are not considered when calculating carbon accumulation zhang et al 2013 doetterl et al 2016 li et al 2019 in this study nutrient dc and dn fluxes in in accounted for more than 98 of output fluxes their contribution will continue to increase as vegetation restoration continues the difference between the aboveground nutrient input fluxes and the output fluxes is regulated by the dynamics of surface soil carbon and nitrogen leaching and the uptake by the deep soil kaiser and kalbitz 2012 proposed a view of cycling downwards to describe doc leaching from surface soil to deep soil the sorption and transformation of plant derived nutrients by the soil may lead to significant storage of soil organic carbon and increase soil fixation of exogenous carbon especially below the root zone osher et al 2003 also observed some photosynthesis generated c3 molecules in deeper soils lost from the surface layer providing evidence for the presence of carbon fluxes from the surface to the subsoil in this study we found that the soil total carbon in 0 50 cm depth of shrub covered land was significantly higher than that of bare land p 0 05 and same result was observed for the soil nitrogen content in 0 10 cm depth fig 9 this provides some evidence of the influence of plant derived dc and dn content in soil solutions on soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation thus the soil buffered doc is an important carbon sink ignoring the contribution of infiltration to carbon accumulated in deep soils we would be overestimating carbon loss due to microbial degradation and underestimating the carbon accumulation capacity of soils 4 4 implications and further scopes as the most mobile and fastest turnover organic matter components in ecosystems dissolved organic matter plays an essential role in the storage and turnover of ecosystem carbon pool and its dynamics play an important role in regulating greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change mcdowell et al 2006 liu et al 2021 our results highlight the significant roles of rainfall partitioning in plant sourced and soil buffered dc and dn fluxes in water limited area which has been always ignored when estimating the nutrient or carbon budget during the last decades the large scale vegetation restoration in dryland is bound to significantly alter the dissolved organic matter fluxes i e dc and dn in the ecosystems which in turn affects the carbon sequestration capacity neglecting this process will lead to a biased estimation of the carbon sinks according to our results quantifying the dynamics of plant sourced and soil buffered dc and dn fluxes mediated by rainfall may contribute to our understanding on carbon cycling and global climate change this study investigated the variations of dc and dn fluxes in different water pathways of dryland shrub ecosystem and quantified their effects on topsoil carbon and nitrogen pool dynamics the findings contribute to a better understanding and prediction of carbon and nitrogen balances in the shrub ecosystems several issues need further investigation firstly we need long term observations of dc and dn concentrations and fluxes for a wider range of shrub plants and species secondly the impact of the dynamics of dc and dn fluxes in tf and sf on the spatial variability of soil carbon and nitrogen is also worth being investigated the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors is responsible for the high spatial variability of nutrient inputs to the surface it is essential to analyze the contribution and influence of litter on hydrological processes and thus on the nutrient cycles floriancic et al 2022 finally the extension from individual plants to larger scales is a challenging topic that could contribute to a better understanding of the role of rainfall redistribution in regional carbon and nitrogen cycling 5 conclusions in this study the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in the input tf and sf and output in and r water pathways of a xerophytic shrub ecosystem were observed over rainy seasons in 2019 2021 we found that the dc and dn fluxes in throughfall accounted for more than 80 of net input flux sum from throughfall and stemflow the plant derived fluxes of dc and dn fplant were 52 2 and 5 3 mg m 2 respectively accounting for 45 4 and 12 2 of net input dc and dn fluxes 115 2 and 43 mg m 2 the soil buffered dc and dn fluxes 455 6 and 29 5 mg m 2 were 3 95 and 0 69 times greater than net input fluxes respectively dc and dn fluxes in in were the most important output flux accounting for more than 98 of the total output fluxes it is important to consider topsoil dc and dn fluxes when calculating soil carbon accumulation capacity this study provides information on the magnitude of dc and dn fluxes along water pathways in shrub ecosystems which improves calculation of carbon

2012,dissolved carbon dc and dissolved nitrogen dn driven by rainfall partitioning are critical components of carbon and nitrogen cycles in terrestrial ecosystems especially in vegetation restoration areas however the variations of dc and dn fluxes in the input throughfall and stemflow and output infiltration and surface runoff water pathways of shrub ecosystem in drylands were poorly understood in this study the rainfall partitioning dissolved organic and inorganic carbon doc and dic and dn fluxes in 52 rainfall events affecting a xerophytic shrub ecosystem on the heavily eroded chinese loess plateau were measured over the 2019 2021 rainy seasons the contributions of plants and topsoil 0 5 cm to the variations in dc and dn fluxes along water pathways were quantified we found that the dc and dn fluxes in throughfall accounted for more than 80 of net input flux and the topsoil infiltration of dc and dn fluxes into soil layer below 5 cm depth were the most important output flux contribution more than 98 the mean event plant derived dc and dn fluxes were 52 2 and 5 3 mg m 2 respectively accounting for 45 4 and 12 2 of net dc and dn input fluxes 115 2 and 43 mg m 2 the soil buffered dc and dn fluxes 455 6 and 29 5 mg m 2 were 3 95 and 0 69 times greater than the net input fluxes respectively the dc and dn fluxes in infiltration had the best correlation and increased most quickly with rainfall depth in the four different water pathways furthermore the soil carbon content in 0 50 cm depth and soil nitrogen content in 0 10 cm depth in shrub covered land was significantly higher than those in bare land p 0 05 this study highlights the important roles of rainfall partitioning in plant sourced and soil buffered dc and dn fluxes which should be considered in soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation in drylands keywords rainfall partitioning hydrological flux carbon and nitrogen accumulation shrub water interaction drylands data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction dissolved nutrient cycles in vegetated ecosystems are intrinsically linked to their hydrological cycle as water is the main transporting agent and solvent van stan et al 2021 dissolved carbon dc including dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved nitrogen dn are highly active chemical components of the biogeochemical cycle currie et al 1996 playing an important role in the carbon and nitrogen cycles of vegetated ecosystems michalzik et al 2001 webb et al 2018 in these ecosystems rainfall is intercepted by the plant canopies before reaching the soil this compartment representing the first layer that rainfall passes through can spatiotemporally change the quantity and chemistry of the rainfall that enters the ecosystem van stan and stubbins 2018 atmospheric deposition of solutes on the plant canopy involves a complex suite of processes divided into wet and dry deposition wet deposition of dc and dn by rainfall on the plant canopy is partitioned into throughfall tf diffuse input stemflow sf point input and interception losses i evaporation an et al 2022 alves et al 2022 van stan et al 2017 the tf is a mixture of free rainfall through gaps in the canopy with no contact with the plant and released rainfall e g drips from leaves and stems the sum of tf and sf is defined as net rainfall np representing the effective water that will eventually reach the ground and will be chemically enriched by wash out of the vegetative surfaces momolli et al 2019 subsequently after passing through the ground litter np infiltrates into the soil in and is stored in the topsoil layer and or gives rise to surface runoff r nutrients distribution through infiltration and runoff is important in connecting plant and soil systems doetterl et al 2016 vania et al 2016 thus rainfall redistribution across the plant canopy and topsoil layer alters the spatial and temporal dynamics of water and nutrients leading to significant differences in dc and dn between tf sf in and r alves et al 2022 li et al 2019 song et al 2022 identification of dc and dn fluxes derived from plants and topsoil during the hydrological processes is key to our understanding of the dynamics of the carbon and nitrogen cycles chen et al 2019 song et al 2022 tonello et al 2021 the dc or dn fluxes in tf sf r and soil solution infiltration

concentrations in both tf and sf reveal the importance of plant derived carbon and nitrogen input fluxes of ecosystem alves et al 2022 van stan and stubbins 2018 the dc and dn changes in r and soil solution highlight the buffering effect of topsoil e g leaching and adsorption which is important for soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation li et al 2019 song et al 2022 throughout the input and output water pathways which are relative to the ecosystem the dc and dn fluxes within vegetation soil system are influenced by a combination of biotic and abiotic factors such as rainfall characteristics canopy structure and soil properties alves et al 2022 you et al 2020 most of previous studies have explored the role of canopy exchange in dissolved nutrient transport processes or have discussed topsoil buffering of dissolved nutrient export processes momolli et al 2019 tonello et al 2021 vania et al 2016 van stan and stubbins 2018 zanchi et al 2015 further studies are needed to integrate changes in dc and dn fluxes during both input and output water pathways of ecosystem and quantify the contributions of plants and topsoil effects to dc and dn fluxes the drylands suffer from water and nutrient scarcity which is a critical limiting factor of vegetation growth and investigations of dissolved nutrient fluxes are important for vegetation restoration in drylands however there are markedly fewer studies available on dissolved nutrient fluxes of shrubs in drylands under rainfall redistribution than in forest ecosystems in humid regions previous studies usually explored tf and sf ion enrichment na k ca2 nh4 so4 2 no3 and cl by shrub species e g luna robles et al 2019 whitford et al 1997 zhang et al 2016 a recent study investigated the dc flux in dryland shrub ecosystems li et al 2019 but did not consider the changes in dn flux and ignored the contribution of sf which is an important source of dc and dn inputs for shrubs the lack of observational data on dc and dn fluxes in dryland shrub ecosystems limits our understanding of the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen fluxes in the water pathways leaving considerable uncertainty when calculating soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation in this study we measured doc dic and dn concentrations in rainfall tf sf r and soil solution infiltration of a typical xerophytic shrub salix psammophila on the loess plateau china during the 2019 2021 rainy seasons the effects of plants and topsoil on dc and dn fluxes throughout the hydrological processes were investigated our objectives were 1 to reveal patterns of dc and dn concentrations and fluxes during different water pathways in dryland shrub ecosystems and 2 to quantify the effects of plants and topsoil on dc and dn fluxes the study is a contribution to our understanding and ability to predict ecosystem carbon and nitrogen balances in drylands 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and experimental design this study was conducted in the liudaogo

mu us desert fig 1 a this region has a moderate temperate continental climate with a mean annual rainfall potential evapotranspiration and air temperature of 437 mm 1337 mm and 8 4 c respectively mean for the period 1971 2013 obtained from the climatic station rainfall is concentrated between july and september accounting for approximately 70 80 of annual rainfall the groundwater table exceeds 20 m and rainfall is the most important available water resource for sustaining local ecosystem the main soil type is sandy loess and sand with weak cohesion high permeability and low water holding capacity soil survey staff 2019 due to long term human activities most of the natural vegetation in the catchment has been disturbed in recent decades ecological restoration has been carried out by planting dryland perennial shrubs and semi shrubs such as salix psammophila caragana korshinskii and artemisia ordosica yang et al 2019 the shrubs are distributed sparsely with distinct inter spaces the formation of fertility islands and deposition of organic matter are the main mechanism for shrubs to adapt to the barren sandy environment and efficiently utilize nutrients ridolfi et al 2008 the s psammophila which is the most abundant xerophytic shrub was chosen for study this species is characterized by an inverted cone shaped crown with multiple branches radiating from the base yang et al 2019 a schematic layout of the s psammophila 25 years old site is shown in fig 1 the shrubs density of the site was about 470 shrubs ha the mean height number of branches and branch diameter of shrub plant in the site was 2 99 m 53 and 11 5 mm respectively three hexagonal plots each of 12 3 m2 were set up on approximately 20 slopes fig 1b with each containing one s psammophila plant of similar crown heights and crown areas see table 1 the perimeter of the plots was separated from the external flow production by plaster slabs which were inserted into the soil at a depth of approximately 50 cm a u shaped pvc catch basin was installed at the bottom edge of each plot to collect surface runoff and sediment generated within the plot 2 2 field measurements 2 2 1 measurements of plant and soil characteristics plant traits were measured for individual plants and branches within each plot for each plant we measured the shrub height m the number of branches and the projected canopy area m2 which includes the entire area within the canopy boundary as seen from above for each branch we measured branch length cm with a tape measure branch angle o with a pocket geological compass branch diameter mm with a vernier caliper there are a total of 203 branches for the three shrub plants and therefore four branch diameter categories 0 10 10 15 15 20 and greater than 20 mm were defined table

three manual rain gauges 314 12 cm2 collection area were placed near the tbrg at 120 angle and 50 cm radius to calibrate the tbrg for rainfall depth fig 1c in this study a rainfall event is defined as one that is greater than 0 2 mm tbrg resolution a rain free period of at least 4 h apart was considered to define separate events iida et al 2012 nine manual rain gauges 314 12 cm2 collection area were used to measure event based tf at three radial directions 120 beneath each shrub canopy at distance of 10 50 and 100 cm from the base of stems in each plot fig 1d the collectors consisted of stainless steel buckets stainless steel funnels and small balls to prevent evaporation with the funnels 30 cm above the ground to prevent water droplets and soil particles from splashing in from the ground a total of 23 branches 7 7 6 and 3 for branch diameter categories of 0 10 10 15 15 20 and greater than 20 mm respectively were selected to determine sf yield a funnel constructed from flexible aluminum foil sheets was used to collect sf fig 1e the funnel was fixed to each branch near the base and sealed with a neutral silicone sealing compound and a 0 5 cm diameter pvc hose was connected vertically to convey the sf from the funnel to the containers with lids sf collector with minimum travel time below the canopy within each experimental plot volumetric soil water content swc was

hobo u30 usa fig 1g a large bucket 1 0 m3 with a lid was placed under the u shaped pvc catch basin below each plot to collect surface runoff which was measured after the cessation of individual rainfalls fig 1f 2 3 water sample collection and laboratory analysis after individual rainfall event water samples of rainfall tf sf and r were collected from the manual check gauges if the rainfall ended during the daytime we completed the sample collection within 2 h if the rainfall ended at night we completed the collection of water samples in the early morning of next day after water sampling all collection devices were rinsed with deionized water air dried and capped the lids were not removed until the next rainfall to avoid entering of dust on non rainy days in addition soil solution at 5 cm depth was collected using soil water samplers model 1900 spectrum company usa fig 1h with a suction force of 600 hpa pf 2 8 after individual rainfalls three samplers were installed in the soil at a 120 radial direction below the middle canopy of each shrub soil solutions below 5 cm were used to represent infiltrated water individual water samples in polyethylene bottles were refrigerated at 4 c in the laboratory for measuring dc and dn concentrations the laboratory analysis of water samples was completed within one month after field collection prior to analysis all water samples were filtered through a 0 45 Œºm mixed cellulose microporous filter membrane tianjin jinteng experiment equipment co ltd the concentrations of dc and dic concentrations were measured using a toc analyzer vario toc cube elementar germany and the concentration of dn was measured using an auto analyzer seal aa3 germany the doc concentration was the direct difference between the values of dc and dic concentrations we measured dc and dic concentrations for all water samples collected in 2019 2020 and 2021 and dn concentrations in 2020 and 2021 2 4 data analyses 2 4 1 calculation of water fluxes water balance at the event scale in the plot was calculated as follows 1 p t f s f i 2 tf s f i n r Œ¥ w r where p is rainfall depth mm tf is tf depth mm sf is stemflow depth mm i is interception loss mm r is surface runoff depth mm in is infiltration below 5 cm depth topsoil Œ¥wr is the soil water retained within 5 cm depth during rainfall the humidity of the air is high and the evaporation losses from ground litter or the surface of the mineral soil are very small which can be ignored in the water balance equation all the water fluxes were calculated at the plot scale after each rainfall event we measured tf volume of each throughfall gauge by measuring cylinder averaged them and then divided the volume by the open area of throughfall gauge into depth to obtain tf the sf volume measured on the selected branches were averaged and then multiplied by the total number of branches to obtain the total branch sf volume from the shrub plant in order to standardize the calculation of water fluxes the sf depth in the plot was estimated by dividing the total branch sf volume by the canopy area of shrub the r was estimated by dividing the surface runoff volume by the area of the plot the Œ¥wr was estimated by the difference in soil water content before and after the rainfall with the following formula 3 Œ¥ w r sw c 2 s w c 1 50 where swc 2 and swc 1 are the volumetric soil water content in the depth of 5 cm before and after the rainfall event respectively when the soil water has infiltrated and stabilized and 50 is the soil depth mm 2 4 2 calculation of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes the dc flux mg m 2 was calculated by multiplying the average dc concentration mg l 1 and the corresponding water flux l m 2 the dc flux balance during rainfall input was calculated using the following equation 4 f p f plant f tf f sf where fp and fplant were input dc fluxes in rainfall and from plant source secretion and dust respectively ftf and fsf were dc fluxes in tf and sf respectively the dc flux from plant source was estimated as the difference between the dc flux in np tf sf and the dc flux in rainfall 5 f plant f tf f sf f p the dc flux balance during the export of net rainfall from the topsoil was calculated using the following equation 6 f tf f sf f soil f r f in where fr and fin were output dc fluxes in surface runoff and infiltration respectively fsoil was soil buffered dc flux the dc flux from topsoil source was the difference between the output dc fluxes in r and infiltration fr fin and the input dc fluxes in np ftf fsf 7 f soil f r f in f tf f sf calculations of doc dic and dn fluxes were consistent with those of dc 2 4 3 statistical analyses one way analysis of variance anova was used to investigate the differences in dc doc dic and dn concentrations in the different water pathways linear regression models were used to study the effects of meteorological factors especially rainfall depth on the concentrations and fluxes of dc doc dic and dn in different water pathways to investigate the importance of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes sourced from plant and topsoil in soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation the differences of soil carbon and nitrogen contents beneath shrub canopy and inter shrub spaces were analyzed by one way anova statistical significance tests of the results were evaluated at p 0 05 statistical analysis was performed using spss 21 0 3 results 3 1 variations of water fluxes a total of 52 rainfall events with 679 4 mm were monitored during the 2019 2021 rainy seasons therein 21 rainfall events induced

approximately 80 of the events had mean rainfall intensity 5 mm h 1 rainfall duration ranged from 0 2 h to 47 7 h the rainfall event with maximum rainfall depth 69 0 mm and longest duration 47 7 h occurred on 9 11 september in 2019 with an intensity of 1 4 mm h 1 fig 2 a the percentage of event throughfall tf ranged from 66 1 to 90 3 mean of 79 6 the percentage of stemflow sf ranged from 2 4 to 9 5 mean of 6 3 and interception loss percentage i ranged from 4 4 to 29 1 mean of 14 1 the largest component of rainfall was tf and the smallest component was sf fig 2b the ratios of topsoil infiltration in depth below 5 cm and surface runoff r to output water are presented in fig 2c the very small proportion of r in this study was evident accounting for only 0 1 1 4 with a mean value of 0 7 the output water was dominated by in which accounted for over 98 3 2 variations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen concentrations the concentrations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen in the input tf and sf and output water pathways r and in vary considerably from those in rainfall fig 3 as rainfall passed through the shrub canopy the concentrations of dc doc dic and dn showed an increasing trend from rainfall to tf and sf fig 3a d except for dic the mean event concentrations of dc doc and dn in sf 20 0 mg l 1 17 7 mg l 1 and 5 1 mg l 1 were significantly higher p 0 05 than those in rainfall 4 0 mg l 1 2 8 mg l 1 and 2 4 mg l 1 and tf 6 9 mg l 1 5 5 mg l 1 and 2 7 mg l 1 whereas no significant differences were found between rainfall and tf p greater than 0 05 in addition the composition of dissolved organic matter changed through the water pathway for example the dc dn ratio tended to increase from rainfall to tf and sf although there were no significant differences fig 3e p greater than 0 05 while the doc dic ratio in sf 9 1 was significantly greater than that in rainfall and tf fig 3f p 0 05 in comparison to rainfall tf and sf the concentrations of dc and dn in r and in was further changed being largely enriched fig 3 the concentrations of dc doc dic and dn in r 22 3 mg l 1 6 2 mg l 1 16 2 mg l 1 and 4 3 mg l 1 respectively and in 39 9 mg l 1 14 0 mg l 1 25 9 mg l 1 and 5 4 mg l 1 respectively were significantly higher than those in rainfall and tf p 0 05 and not significantly different between concentrations in r and sf p greater than 0 05 except for dic concentration changes in dissolved organic matter composition mainly occurred in the dc dn ratio with soil solution having the largest dc dn ratio 9 7 significantly greater than that of r 6 4 and sf 4 7 as well as rainfall 2 2 and tf 2 9 fig 3e p 0 05 the doc dic ratio did not differ significantly in rainfall tf r and soil solution fig 3f p greater than 0 05 which were all smaller than that in sf fig 3f p 0 05 3 3 variations of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes 3 3 1 dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes in throughfall and stemflow the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in input water pathways of each rainfall event are shown in fig 4 the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in np tf sf 115 1 63 1 91 8 52 7 23 4 15 4 and 43 0 28 1 mg m 2 respectively were 1 83 2 03 1 31 and 1 14 times higher in rainfall 62 9 42 3 45 1 34 2 17 8 15 0 and 37 8 30 7 mg m 2 respectively thus the average event plant sourced dc doc dic and dn fluxes were 52 2 46 6 5 6 and 5 3 mg m 2 respectively table 2 the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in tf 18 4 182 4 12 8 154 9 5 6 62 5 and 13 1 112 9 mg m 2 respectively accounted for 81 5 79 0 89 0 and 87 0 of net input flux respectively fig 4 the maximum dc and doc fluxes in tf occurred on the same day 14 september in 2020 with rainfall amount of 34 8 mm while the largest dic and dn fluxes occurred on 17 july in 2020 with rainfall amount of 46 3 mm in contrast these four nutrient fluxes in sf accounted for 18 5 21 0 11 0 and 13 0 of the net input flux respectively these are larger than the proportion of np provided by sf during rainfall redistribution furthermore doc was the dominant carbon input flux accounting for 79 7 of dc fluxes 3 3 2 dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes in runoff and infiltration the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in in and r of each rainfall event are shown in fig 5 the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in output water pathway sum of r and in were 5 6 9 4 9 and 1 6 times higher than those in net input water sum of tf and sf the difference between the output and input dc doc dic and dn fluxes i e soil buffered nutrient fluxes were 455 7 260 4 195 3 and 29 5 mg m 2 respectively table 2 the dc doc dic and dn fluxes of in 94 8 1680 5 65 3 1006 7 18 2 673 8 and 12 0 213 0 mg m 2 respectively accounted for more than 98 of the total output flux the maximum dc doc dic and dn fluxes in in occurred on 17 july in 2020 with rainfall amount of 46 3 mm of these four nutrient output fluxes 2 were exported via r doc was the dominant carbon output flux accounting for 61 7 of the dc output flux the average fluxes of doc in r and in were 2 0 and 1 6 times higher than those of dic 3 4 relationships of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes with rainfall characteristics correlation tests and regression analysis indicated that rainfall depth was the main factor influencing the dc doc dic and dn concentrations and fluxes in the water pathways and the effects of rainfall intensity duration and antecedent rain free days i e the length of the antecedent dry period were not significant p greater than 0 05 specifically the dc doc dic and dn concentrations in tf sf and r decreased exponentially with rainfall depth until they stabilized at the lowest concentrations in large storms fig 6 however the dc doc dic and dn concentrations in in showed little variations with rainfall depth dc and dn fluxes in each water pathway increased linearly with rainfall depth fig 7 the dc doc and dn fluxes in input water pathway tf and sf were significantly correlated with rainfall depth p 0 05 while dic input fluxes in tf and sf were poorly correlated with rainfall depth p 0 16 and p 0 06 respectively furthermore the dissolved nutrient fluxes in tf increased more rapidly with rainfall compared to those in sf as shown in fig 7 all the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in the output water pathways r and in were significantly correlated with rainfall depth p 0 05 and dissolved nutrient fluxes in in increased more rapidly with rainfall depth with respect to r we also found that dissolved nutrient fluxes in in had the best correlation and increased fastest with rainfall depth in the four different water pathways 4 discussion 4 1 contribution of vegetation canopy to dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes vegetation cover changes the distribution patterns of rainfall and the dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes fig 8 in this study tf and sf accounted for 78 1 and 5 6 of rainfall depths respectively scouring and leaching of plant by rainfall resulted in increased nutrient concentrations in input water pathway tf and sf where organic matter formed by the degradation of the outer bark was washed by sf song et al 2022 sf has a longer residence time in the canopy than tf due to the larger and rougher surface area sf must pass through to reach the stem base portion an et al 2022 johnson and lehmann 2006 in our study differences in sources and residence time led to the different concentrations of nutrients in tf and sf chen et al 2019 van stan et al 2017 the dc and dn concentrations in sf were significantly higher than those in rainfall and tf especially the concentration of doc and the doc dic ratio fig 3 which may be due to the longer contact time between sf and shrub vegetative favoring the dissolution of doc chen et al 2019 van stan et al 2017 tf was the main water pathway of dc doc dic and dn input fluxes 93 9 73 2 20 7 and 37 9 mg m 2 respectively which were 4 41 3 94 7 67 and 7 43 times higher than the nutrient fluxes in sf 21 3 18 6 2 7 and 5 1 mg m 2 respectively this is easy to understand that tf has a greater water flux than sf although the dc and dn concentrations in sf were significantly higher than those in tf plant derived doc accounted for 50 8 of total doc input fluxes while sf which had the highest doc concentration but the lowest water quantity accounted for about 17 0 fig 8 the doc flux from sf was more abundant than the water flux it brought further illustrating the importance of sf for shrub adaptation to drylands the double funneling effect of vegetation aboveground and belowground johnson and lehmann 2006 that concentrates rainfall at shrub base sf and then delivers it as root induced preferential flow suggests that sf is an effective and important source of water and nutrients available for plants especially for plants in drylands with limited water and nutrients li et al 2009 ignoring sf fluxes which is normally the case could lead to large biases in water and nutrient budgets in drylands levia and germer 2015 4 2 contribution of topsoil to dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes increased in vegetation cover can reduce surface runoff from rainfall events in revegetated areas fu et al 2017 in this study in and r accounted for 68 2 and 0 5 of rainfall amount respectively fig 8 the changes in dc doc dic and dn concentrations from input tf sf to output water pathways in r were mainly due to the buffering effect of the topsoil soil buffering of nutrients is a systematic process that includes adsorption onto reactive minerals microbial transformation and re release into the soil solution during nutrient leaching a complex series of reactions that alter the dc doc dic and dn concentrations and fluxes in the output water pathway kaiser and kalbitz 2012 song et al 2022 in general more than 70 of doc in soil solution infiltration in comes from topsoil sources rather than exogenous doc m√ºller et al 2009 scott and rothstein 2014 in this study the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in in contributed over 98 of these in output fluxes in r r contributed little to the output nutrient fluxes due to its exceptionally small volume 1 of the rainfall fig 8 the concentrations of nutrient materials contributed less to the dynamics of the corresponding fluxes than the water fluxes themselves doetterl et al 2016 li et al 2019 4 3 importance of dissolved carbon and nitrogen fluxes for soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation dc fluxes have usually been seen as a lesser component than carbon fluxes associated with primary productivity or heterotrophic respiration in terrestrial systems kalbitz and kaiser 2008 however the important role played by dc fluxes in ecosystems cannot be ignored as dc fluxes are carriers of carbon loss in topsoil kindler et al 2011 and are an important source of organic biomass in deep soils doetterl et al 2016 rumpel and k√∂gel knabner 2010 due to difficulties involved in direct measurements dc fluxes in soil layers particularly dc in in from topsoil to deeper soils are not considered when calculating carbon accumulation zhang et al 2013 doetterl et al 2016 li et al 2019 in this study nutrient dc and dn fluxes in in accounted for more than 98 of output fluxes their contribution will continue to increase as vegetation restoration continues the difference between the aboveground nutrient input fluxes and the output fluxes is regulated by the dynamics of surface soil carbon and nitrogen leaching and the uptake by the deep soil kaiser and kalbitz 2012 proposed a view of cycling downwards to describe doc leaching from surface soil to deep soil the sorption and transformation of plant derived nutrients by the soil may lead to significant storage of soil organic carbon and increase soil fixation of exogenous carbon especially below the root zone osher et al 2003 also observed some photosynthesis generated c3 molecules in deeper soils lost from the surface layer providing evidence for the presence of carbon fluxes from the surface to the subsoil in this study we found that the soil total carbon in 0 50 cm depth of shrub covered land was significantly higher than that of bare land p 0 05 and same result was observed for the soil nitrogen content in 0 10 cm depth fig 9 this provides some evidence of the influence of plant derived dc and dn content in soil solutions on soil carbon and nitrogen accumulation thus the soil buffered doc is an important carbon sink ignoring the contribution of infiltration to carbon accumulated in deep soils we would be overestimating carbon loss due to microbial degradation and underestimating the carbon accumulation capacity of soils 4 4 implications and further scopes as the most mobile and fastest turnover organic matter components in ecosystems dissolved organic matter plays an essential role in the storage and turnover of ecosystem carbon pool and its dynamics play an important role in regulating greenhouse gas emissions and global climate change mcdowell et al 2006 liu et al 2021 our results highlight the significant roles of rainfall partitioning in plant sourced and soil buffered dc and dn fluxes in water limited area which has been always ignored when estimating the nutrient or carbon budget during the last decades the large scale vegetation restoration in dryland is bound to significantly alter the dissolved organic matter fluxes i e dc and dn in the ecosystems which in turn affects the carbon sequestration capacity neglecting this process will lead to a biased estimation of the carbon sinks according to our results quantifying the dynamics of plant sourced and soil buffered dc and dn fluxes mediated by rainfall may contribute to our understanding on carbon cycling and global climate change this study investigated the variations of dc and dn fluxes in different water pathways of dryland shrub ecosystem and quantified their effects on topsoil carbon and nitrogen pool dynamics the findings contribute to a better understanding and prediction of carbon and nitrogen balances in the shrub ecosystems several issues need further investigation firstly we need long term observations of dc and dn concentrations and fluxes for a wider range of shrub plants and species secondly the impact of the dynamics of dc and dn fluxes in tf and sf on the spatial variability of soil carbon and nitrogen is also worth being investigated the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors is responsible for the high spatial variability of nutrient inputs to the surface it is essential to analyze the contribution and influence of litter on hydrological processes and thus on the nutrient cycles floriancic et al 2022 finally the extension from individual plants to larger scales is a challenging topic that could contribute to a better understanding of the role of rainfall redistribution in regional carbon and nitrogen cycling 5 conclusions in this study the dc doc dic and dn fluxes in the input tf and sf and output in and r water pathways of a xerophytic shrub ecosystem were observed over rainy seasons in 2019 2021 we found that the dc and dn fluxes in throughfall accounted for more than 80 of net input flux sum from throughfall and stemflow the plant derived fluxes of dc and dn fplant were 52 2 and 5 3 mg m 2 respectively accounting for 45 4 and 12 2 of net input dc and dn fluxes 115 2 and 43 mg m 2 the soil buffered dc and dn fluxes 455 6 and 29 5 mg m 2 were 3 95 and 0 69 times greater than net input fluxes respectively dc and dn fluxes in in were the most important output flux accounting for more than 98 of the total output fluxes it is important to consider topsoil dc and dn fluxes when calculating soil carbon accumulation capacity this study provides information on the magnitude of dc and dn fluxes along water pathways in shrub ecosystems which improves calculation of carbon

short term memory lstm networks have demonstrated their excellent capability in processing long length temporal dynamics and have proven to be effective in precipitation runoff modeling however the current lstm hydrological models lack the incorporation of multi task learning and spatial information which limits their ability to make full use of meteorological and hydrological data to address this issue this study proposes a spatiotemporal deep learning dl based hydrological model that couples the 2 dimension convolutional neural network cnn and lstm and introduces actual evaporation e a as an additional training target the proposed cnn lstm model is tested on three large mountainous basins on the tibetan plateau and the results are compared to those obtained from the lstm only model additionally a probe method is used to decipher the internal embedding layers of the proposed dl models the results indicate that both lstm and cnn lstm hydrological models perform well in simulating runoff q and e a with nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nses higher than 0 82 and 0 95 respectively the higher nses suggest that introducing spatial information into lstm only models can improve the overall and peak model performance moreover multi task simulation with lstm only models shows better accuracy in the estimation of q volume and performance with nses increasing by approximately 0 02 the probe method also reveals that cnn can capture the basin averaged meteorological values in cnn lstm models while lstm q e a models contain the information about the known e a q process overall this study demonstrates the value of spatial information and multi task learning in lstm hydrological modeling and provides a perspective for interpreting the internal embedding layers of dl models

legal ethical reasons 1 introduction hydrological models either physically based or data driven play vital roles in flood and drought disaster prevention as well as in water resources management bl√∂schl et al 2019 recent advances in remote sensing and computational techniques have improved physically based hydrological models by enhancing their capacity in characterizing hydrodynamic processes at finer scales khatakho et al 2021 sood and smakhtin 2015 tarek et al 2020 notably distributed hydrological models dhms can incorporate processes at a sub basin or other calculation unit scale li et al 2021a however the application of dhms is still limited owing to the unsolved issue in scale mismatch bl√∂schl et al 2019 bl√∂schl and sivapalan 1995 gupta et al 2008 hrachowitz et al 2013 nearing et al 2021 data driven models can directly depict the statistical relationship between inputs and outputs without explicit characterization of physical processes nearing et al 2021 since the 1990s machine learning ml techniques have been widely adopted in hydrological modeling and have proven similar or better performance compared with dhms demirel et al 2009 hsu et al 1995 kratzert et al 2018 lees et al 2021 nearing et al 2021 yang et al 2020 in particular deep learning dl models featuring neural networks are the most commonly used ml techniques for hydrological modeling nearing et al 2021 they have evolved from original multi layer perceptron i e artificial neural networks anns yang et al 2020 to more advanced forms with enriched taxonomy such as convolutional neural networks cnns jiang et al 2020 recurrent neural networks rnns sadeghi tabas and samadi 2022 and its variant long short term memory networks lstm lees et al 2021 anns cnns and rnns are among the earliest dl models with promising performance for hydrological modeling demirel et al 2009 hsu et al 1995 khan et al 2019 yang et al 2020 as feed forward neural networks anns and cnns cannot directly represent temporal dynamics and are thus less able to accurately characterize hydrological processes kratzert et al 2018 in contrast rnns which process the input data chronologically by design can consider temporal dynamics although rnns are more ideal for time series analysis vanilla rnns can hardly store sequences over 10 time steps bengio et al 1994 which limits their applicability in modeling slow hydrological processes occurring at larger time scale such as those related to groundwater snow and glacier storage kratzert et al 2018 the recently emerging lstm models can conquer such weakness with the unique internal gate architectures and have demonstrated superior performance than the vanilla rnns in time series analysis hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 since the first application in hydrological modeling by kratzert et al 2018 for a precipitation runoff p q simulation in 530 american basins 2000 km2 the lstm p q models have been used worldwide e g 669 basins in great britain in lees et al 2021 hanjiang river in china in liu et al 2021 and have become one of the most powerful tools in p q simulations being promising in hydrological modeling current dl based hydrological models still need improvements in three notable aspects nearing et al 2021 1 ability to resolve spatiotemporal features hydrological processes modeling depends heavily on the spatial patterns of meteorological forcing and underlying surface characteristics yang et al 2020 employed computer vision to resolve spatial features in ann p q modeling and demonstrated that spatial information plays an important role in enhancing model robustness however most existing studies about lstm hydrological modeling almost utilized basin spatially averaged meteorological data as model inputs e g jiang et al 2022 kratzert et al 2018 lees et al 2021 without fully representing spatial features of inputs for the lstm hydrological modeling coupling 2 d cnn and lstm is expected to bridge such gap by simultaneously considering both temporal dynamics and spatial features miao et al 2019 shi et al 2015 and cnn lstm has proven to be promising in different fields e g p nowcasting miao et al 2019 shi et al 2015 and water quality forecast barzegar et al 2020 yang et al 2021 2 consideration of multiple hydrological processes differing from physically based hydrological models lstm based models simulate the individual hydrological process such as q feng et al 2020 frame et al 2021 groundwater ali et al 2022 nourani et al 2022 and snow water equivalent duan and ullrich 2021 in most studies but rarely simulate multiple processes simultaneously it makes lstm based hydrological models difficult to explicitly consider the interactions between different hydrological processes and diagnose models based on hydrological theories such as the water balance equation reichstein et al 2019 besides some studies found that introducing additional hydrological processes such as the actual evaporation denoted by e a in this work process in calibration for physical based hydrological models can enhance the q simulation performance herman et al 2018 nesru et al 2020 therefore it is beneficial to investigate if considering multiple hydrological processes simultaneously for lstm based hydrological models can enhance their capacity in depicting more hydrological processes and thus provide a more comprehensive diagnosis of hydrological variables 3 physical interpretability due to the black box nature dl based hydrological models have no explicit representation of physical processes and thus remain being questioned by some hydrologists nearing et al 2021 to enhance the confidence of users and policymakers in adopting dl based hydrological models improvements in the understanding of their physical interpretability have been attempted recently arrieta et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 for example lstm hydrological models have proven to learn a generalizable representation of the underlying physical processes lstm regional hydrological models outperform dhms calibrated regionally and even calibrated for each basin individually feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019 sun et al 2021 besides lstm hydrological models are found to be able to store the hidden information consistent with hydrological knowledge jiang et al 2022 kratzert et al 2018 lees et al 2022 however the physical interpretability of dl models with respect to e a process a critical component in the hydrological cycle is yet to be investigated also the physical concepts of cnn outputs in cnn lstm models are still unclear in this work we aim to overcome these deficiencies by developing a spatiotemporal dl based hydrological model by coupling 2 d cnn and lstm cnn lstm and introducing multi task learning the potential of simultaneous multi task mt learning in dl based hydrological models is also investigated by involving e a process as additional learning target besides we also advance the understanding of physical interpretability of dl based models by extracting the meteorological and hydrological processes hidden in the proposed lstm and cnn lstm models in the remainder of this paper we first describe the proposed dl based model by introducing the basic architecture of cnn and lstm and physical interpretability method section 2 then evaluate the model performance in three large mountainous basins on the tibetan plateau with comparison to the lstm hydrological models section 3 we also explore physical interpretations of this model with respect to the hydrological and meteorological processes section 4 2 methods 2 1 model development we propose a dl based hydrological model fig 1 a by coupling 2 d cnn fig 1b and lstm fig 1c to utilize their respective advantages the former for hierarchical spatial feature extraction while the latter for learning long temporal dependencies the proposed model can use 2 d spatial meteorological and underlying surface data as input and predicts hydrological processes with daily q and e a as output we note however only meteorological data daily p and mean temperature are used in this work as inclusion of surface characteristics demonstrate minimal improvement in model performance not shown the model can perform either single task or multi task learning by setting training targets the former simulates the individual hydrological process while the latter focuses on two or more processes simultaneously below we focus on the model design and description of key components more technical details refer to appendix a 2 1 1 convolutional neural networks cnns cnns fig 1b are a particular type of feed forward neural network including the input convolutional pooling and full connection layer lecun et al 1998 the convolutional layer the core of cnns uses convolutional kernels to extract information from various n dimensions model inputs we utilize 2 d cnn to capture the spatial information of meteorological data the convolutional layer processes meteorological data by reducing the spatial size width and height of inputs features increasing the channel number and generating the 1 dimension sequence finally fig 1b takes a study basin as the example to illustrate the data dimensions in internal layers of the cnns in this study and more details refer to appendix a 2 1 2 long short term memory lstm networks the lstm models fig 1c are designed to alleviate the weakness of the vanilla rnns in processing long length temporal dynamics hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 sherstinsky 2020 the success of lstm lies in the coordination of memory cells cell states c t in fig 1c and hidden cells hidden states h t in fig 1c in the internal architecture that capture the slow and quick evolution processes respectively besides three gates i e input forget and output are designed to control the information in each cell to be stored removed and passed respectively these architectures are beneficial for lstm models to process long length temporal dynamics more detailed descriptions of lstm within the context of hydrological modeling refer to kratzert et al 2018 2 1 3 multi task learning multi task mt learning is to set multiple tasks as optimization targets in a dl based model caruana 1997 the training can benefit from the enriched representations of mt information thus enhancing the performance of each task using the information enveloped in the other tasks besides mt learning can achieve higher efficiency and less over fitting than single task st learning because it can lead the model to a more general feature representation preferred by multiple related tasks li et al 2023 the mt learning is introduced to investigate the effect of multi hydrological process learning in lstm based hydrological modeling in this study 2 1 4 coupling between cnn and lstm to utilize the respective advantage of cnn and lstm models we develop a spatiotemporal dl based hydrological model by coupling cnn and lstm models fig 1a at each time step the cnn lstm coupling is realized via two stages 1 the cnn reduces the 2 d gridded meteorological input into a 1 d sequence and feed it to the lstm1 layer 2 the hidden states of the lstm1 layer are input to the lstm2 layer and cell and hidden states of two lstm layers are then fed to the corresponding layers at the next time step respectively after all processing through the cnn lstm coupled layer prior to time step l the outputs of the lstm2 layer at the last time step are passed to the dense layer to obtain the predictions learned hydrological variables fig 1a depending on the target mode st or mt the dl model may produce different number of output variables st model sets one hydrological process as optimization target while mt model sets two or more hydrological processes as optimization targets by mt learning 2 2 physical interpretability method the internal embedding layers of the dl hydrological models contain a large amount of data that is not explicitly interpretable these data may conceal some untrained internal hydrological variables for example the internal embedding layers of q models may contain the information about e a process this study utilizes probes regression models that map the internal embedding layers of trained models to untrained hydrological variables hewitt and liang 2019 lees et al 2022 to test whether trained dl models can learn the known but untrained hydrological variables and examine the internal representation and further physical interpretability of models the simplest form of probes is a linear regression lr model that connects the learned embedding layers to a given output this study explores untrained hydrological variables from proposed lstm and cnn lstm models based on lr models and detailed experiment design refers to section 4 1 3 model evaluation we evaluate the performance of proposed cnn lstm model in three large mountainous basins on the tibetan plateau tp section 3 1 to assess the applicability of cnn lstm in resolving spatial information in hydrological modeling an lstm only model is also configured as a benchmarking baseline differing from the cnn lstm model the basin spatially averaged meteorological data at each time step are directly input to the lstm only model without the involvement of cnn model detailed in kratzert et al 2018 also st and mt experiments section 3 2 are designed to evaluate the mt learning performance of cnn lstm and lstm models and the influence of mt on dl based hydrological modeling in this study the model inputs are daily total p and mean air temperature t in line with similar studies e g jiang et al 2022 in addition to q we also select the e a an important hydrological processes for which data are available as the training target to evaluate the effect of multi task learning in lstm modeling 3 1 study area and data 3 1 1 study area the tibetan plateau tp fig 2 a is the highest plateau in the world known as the roof of the world or the third pole given the high altitude and vast glaciers of tp along with the many mighty rivers e g yangtze lancang mekong yarlung zangbo brahmaputra and yellow among others that provide enormous water sources for downstream livelihoods and agricultural irrigation huss et al 2017 immerzeel et al 2010 nan et al 2021 schaner et al 2012 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2013 tp is also considered the water tower of asia however owing to the incompleteness of knowledge of complex alpine hydrological processes it is challenging to adequately model hydrological processes by dhms in the tp li et al 2019b nan et al 2021 to systematically evaluate the performance of the lstm and cnn lstm hydrological model in such a challenging environment we select source regions of three rivers fig 2a the yellow river fig 2b the yangtze river fig 2c and the lancang river fig 2d characterized as mountainous areas as the study basins the landforms of all three basins undulate greatly with elevation variability greater than 3 000 m the annual average p of three basins ranges from 460 to 830 mm the detailed description of the three study basins is shown in table 1 yellow yangtze and lancang are used hereinafter to denote their respective source regions if not specified otherwise 3 1 2 data due to the limited availability of in situ observations in the study area we utilize either the optimal remote sensing or reanalysis datasets for different input variables as follows 1 precipitation p multi source weighted ensemble

atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate era5 reanalysis dataset with 0 1 spatially and 1 h temporal resolution hersbach et al 2020 while for output evaluation dataset we use the following

datasets are pre processed into daily resolution in line with the model time step and spilt into three periods for training evaluation and testing table 2 3 2 model evaluation experiment 3 2 1

evaluation results 3 3 1 performance of cnn lstm models in general cnn lstm q models work remarkably well in all three study basins with nses greater than 0 89 table 3 moriasi et al 2007 and can accurately capture peak of q with appropriate magnitudes and timing fig 3 the results are compared to some traditional hydrological models in other relevant studies and it is indicated that cnn lstm q models outperform them see detailed in appendix b besides simulated e a processes agree well with gleam data with nses of 0 97 in all three study basins table 4 figs 4 and 5 these results demonstrate that the proposed cnn lstm model performs favorably and thus is a reasonable approach to simulate hydrological processes in large mountainous basins 3 3 2 the capacity of 2 d cnn in extracting spatial characteristics to evaluate the capacity of 2 d cnn in extracting spatial characteristics we developed lstm q and e a models as benchmarking baselines high corrections nses more than 0 87 of q and 0 97 of e a tables 3 and 4 indicate the good performance of lstm models in hydrological simulation by comparing the performance of lstm and cnn lstm q models it is found that cnn lstm models outperform lstm models in overall q simulation with higher nses of q in the yellow and yangtze table 3 also evaluation results of three biases metrics indicate that both lstm and cnn lstm q models underestimate the peak q processes bpv 0 but overestimate the median and low q processes bmv b l v 0 in the yellow and yangtze but the peak q underestimation of cnn lstm models is mitigated compared with that of lstm models with bpv from 0 31 and 0 15 lstm to 0 00 and 0 11 cnn lstm in the yellow and yangtze respectively in contrast the overestimation of simulated median and low q processes by cnn lstm q models are stronger than that by lstm q models in all three study basins we conclude that the introduction of 2 d cnn into lstm q models has a two sided effect it can enhance the overall model performance as well as the capacity in simulating peaking q processes while may work slightly poorly in modeling q in the median and low ranges these effects can be explained by the different lstm inputs in the cnn lstm models the inputs to lstm are the feature vectors size is 1 64 at each time step table a3 extracted from 2 d spatial meteorological data by 2 d cnn whereas those are the spatially averaged p and t data within study basins in the lstm only models based on the remarkable performance of both lstm and cnn lstm models we assume that the lstm inputs of cnn lstm models i e cnn outputs contain the information about basin spatially averaged p and t data discussed later in section 4 2 1 besides we infer that more information hidden in the cnn outputs capturing the peak runoff features contribute to enhancing the downstream lstm performance while remaining redundant information might hurt downstream lstm performance noting that there is one exception in the lancang cnn lstm q model does not outperform lstm models in terms of overall and high q this could be due to different hydrological characteristics of the testing period and shorter training dataset table 2 all three years of the testing dataset in the lancang can be categorized as normal or dry years without extreme q processes e g 2012 in the yellow that might not benefit from the capacity of 2 d cnn in modeling peaking q processes besides we also infer that shorter training dataset might not contain enough information to train the optimal parameters for the cnn lstm model whose training parameters are larger than the lstm only model it causes the cnn lstm model does not outperform lstm model in the lancang on the other hand both lstm and cnn lstm e a models perform well without significant differences between two models in all three study basins table 4 figs 4 and 5 it demonstrates that lstm is a remarkable approach for average e a of the basin modeling and introducing 2 d cnn has little impact on it further suggesting that average p and t play vital roles in e a modeling and cnn outputs might contain the information about it 3 3 3 the effect of multi task learning to investigate the applicability of mt learning in training lstm and cnn lstm models we configured them with q and e a as the simultaneous learning targets in addition to those single task st experiments targeting at only q or e a the simulations by mt models agree well with observations in all three study basins with favorable nses of q 0 89 by lstm mt and 0 82 by cnn lstm mt fig 6 besides both lstm and cnn lstm mt models achieve remarkable performance in predicting e a in all three study basins fig 5 table 4 these results demonstrate that both lstm and cnn lstm models are capable of simulating multiple hydrological processes simultaneously furthermore compared with lstm q models the lstm mt ones achieve higher nses and lower total volume biases Œ≤ suggesting that introducing e a as additional training target can enhance the q performance of lstm models by reducing the total volume biases it is consistent with the effect of introducing the e a process in calibration for physical based hydrological models herman et al 2018 nesru et al 2020 it further motivates us to assume that the internal states of lstm hydrological models similar to physical based hydrological models might encompass multiple untrained physical hydrological processes thus we put forward the hypothesis that e a q process information can be easily reconstructed from internal states of trained lstm q e a models without the aforementioned complicated training procedures this hypothesis will be tested in section 4 2 2 in contrast the q performance of cnn lstm mt models declines significantly compared with their st counterparts in all three study basins significant performance differences between st and mt might be explained by the variant lstm inputs in cnn lstm models with different training references compared with the invariant lstm inputs in lstm models section 2 1 besides the redundant information contained in the cnn outputs might make it difficult to simulate multiple hydrological processes on the other hand differences in e a performance between st and mt mode of both lstm and cnn lstm are not significant indicating that mt learning in the lstm and cnn lstm models has minimal effect on e a modeling 4 physical interpretability of dl hydrological models this section further explores the physical interpretability of cnn and lstm models by using the lr model section 2 2 to look into potential hydrological and meteorological information cnn and lstm may capture fig 7 4 1 experiment design according to the above discussions we design two experiments to test two hypotheses as follows 1 the cnn of trained cnn lstm models can capture spatially averaged meteorological data within basin t basin p basin from gridded meteorological data cnn input fig 7a b to test this hypothesis we construct lr models to map the cnn output of three cnn lstm q e a and mt models fig 7a to spatially averaged precipitation and temperature data within basins p basin and t basin and then use the correlation coefficient r between lr model output and spatially averaged meteorological data within basins namely r cnn as indicator to examine their correlation fig 7a in addition we calculate the r of spatial averages of meteorological data within the basin and those of the original gridded data r ref as the reference indicator fig 7b by comparing r cnn and r ref we can thus infer if the cnn can extract basin scale characteristics of meteorological input data or not 2 e a q process information can be reconstructed from internal states of trained lstm q e a models without the aforementioned complicated training procedures fig 7c similar as lees et al 2022 lr models are constructed to map the cell states vector the memory of lstm e a q models to the untrained q e a processes and examine the resultant nse s to justify if lstm is capable of inferring untrained hydrological information for this we obtain 6 sets of nse s values 2 relations e a q and e a 3 basins yellow yangtze and lancang 4 2 the physical interpretability results 4 2 1 the physical interpretability of cnn outputs as the meteorological data within a studied basin is essentially a subset of the original gridded dataset fig 7b it is expected the spatial average of the former datasets i e p basin and t basin can be highly correlated to those of the latter i e p ref and t ref in particular when their spatial extents are comparable e g the yangtze river basin in fig 2c and our estimation does suggest high p and t correlation for all three basins r ref 0 97 except the lower p correlation for the lancang r ref 0 80 table 5 thus we select the lancang basin as the study area to examine the capacity of cnn in inferring basin specific information from the original gridded dataset our results indicate that the spatial averages of p and t within the lancang can be extracted from the cnn outputs in high fidelity r cnn of all configurations are much larger than r ref for p cf 0 94 vs 0 79 table 5 and close to 1 for t which supports our first hypothesis furthermore it is also interesting to see the difference in r cnn between different configurations for p a lower r cnn is produced by the evapotranspiration targeted model suggesting those runoff targeted models perform better in extracting precipitation related information while a reverse pattern is found for t such results are in line with the common hydrological understanding that p has a more significant impact on q while t is a strong control of e a 4 2 2 the physical interpretability of lstm cell states high correlation is found between the lstm inferred and observed q nses of 0 72 0 84 and 0 86 in the yellow yangtze and lancang fig 8 suggesting the remarkable capacity of lstm in inferring the q related processes solely from ea likewise the inferred e a processes also agree favorably with gleam e a data with nses more than 0 93 in all three study basins fig 9 such results support our second hypothesis that lstm q e a models contain information about untrained e a q processes without prior training procedures 5 conclusion and limitation in this study we develop an integrated spatiotemporal dl based model by coupling cnn and lstm for hydrological simulation and evaluate it in the source regions of the yellow river the yangtze river and the lancang river besides we employ a simple linear regression method to explore the physical interpretability of cnn and lstm in dl based hydrological models to improve our understanding of dlm inferred hydrological processes our main findings are as follows 1 both lstm and cnn lstm models perform favorably with n s e s more than 0 87 q and 0 97 e a in all three study basins the cnn lstm q models achieve better performance than lstm ones in modeling q therefore we recommend the cnn lstm models for hydrological modeling and flooding forecasts in large mountainous basins 2 both lstm and cnn lstm multi task models work well for q n s e s 0 82 and e a n s e s 0 95 simulation and lstm multi task models outperform lstm q models in all three study basins this finding demonstrates that introducing e a as an additional training target in the lstm q model can enhance the model performance and further research can be conducted to evaluate the potential of lstm models for more and even whole hydrological modeling in the future 3 the internal cells of cnn and lstm contain the hydrological and meteorological information consistent with our knowledge cnn outputs in cnn lstm models can capture the basin specific characteristics from 2 d gridded meteorological data of larger domains while the internal cells of lstm q e a models may infer the e a q processes these findings advance the understanding of the physical interpretability of dl based hydrological models being promising in predicting hydrological processes this model has several limitations first unlike the observed runoff data the gleam dataset as the e a training target is of high accuracy but subject to some biases in the tibetan plateau li et al 2019a it might lead trained e a models to a slight deviation from the true e a process besides this model is only evaluated in the three large mountainous basins on the tibetan plateau due to the limitation of computational resources future research will be carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed cnn lstm model in more basins develop cnn lstm regional hydrological models using more underlying surface data and explore more physical information hidden in the internal cells of dl based hydrological models credit

short term memory lstm networks have demonstrated their excellent capability in processing long length temporal dynamics and have proven to be effective in precipitation runoff modeling however the current lstm hydrological models lack the incorporation of multi task learning and spatial information which limits their ability to make full use of meteorological and hydrological data to address this issue this study proposes a spatiotemporal deep learning dl based hydrological model that couples the 2 dimension convolutional neural network cnn and lstm and introduces actual evaporation e a as an additional training target the proposed cnn lstm model is tested on three large mountainous basins on the tibetan plateau and the results are compared to those obtained from the lstm only model additionally a probe method is used to decipher the internal embedding layers of the proposed dl models the results indicate that both lstm and cnn lstm hydrological models perform well in simulating runoff q and e a with nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nses higher than 0 82 and 0 95 respectively the higher nses suggest that introducing spatial information into lstm only models can improve the overall and peak model performance moreover multi task simulation with lstm only models shows better accuracy in the estimation of q volume and performance with nses increasing by approximately 0 02 the probe method also reveals that cnn can capture the basin averaged meteorological values in cnn lstm models while lstm q e a models contain the information about the known e a q process overall this study demonstrates the value of spatial information and multi task learning in lstm hydrological modeling and provides a perspective for interpreting the internal embedding layers of dl models

bl√∂schl et al 2019 recent advances in remote sensing and computational techniques have improved physically based hydrological models by enhancing their capacity in characterizing hydrodynamic processes at finer scales khatakho et al 2021 sood and smakhtin 2015 tarek et al 2020 notably distributed hydrological models dhms can incorporate processes at a sub basin or other calculation unit scale li et al 2021a however the application of dhms is still limited owing to the unsolved issue in scale mismatch bl√∂schl et al 2019 bl√∂schl and sivapalan 1995 gupta et al 2008 hrachowitz et al 2013 nearing et al 2021 data driven models can directly depict the statistical relationship between inputs and outputs without explicit characterization of physical processes nearing et al 2021 since the 1990s machine learning ml techniques have been widely adopted in hydrological modeling and have proven similar or better performance compared with dhms demirel et al 2009 hsu et al 1995 kratzert et al 2018 lees et al 2021 nearing et al 2021 yang et al 2020 in particular deep learning dl models featuring neural networks are the most commonly used ml techniques for hydrological modeling nearing et al 2021 they have evolved from original multi layer perceptron i e artificial neural networks anns yang et al 2020 to more advanced forms with enriched taxonomy such as convolutional neural networks cnns jiang et al 2020 recurrent neural networks rnns sadeghi tabas and samadi 2022 and its variant long short term memory networks lstm lees et al 2021 anns cnns and rnns are among the earliest dl models with promising performance for hydrological modeling demirel et al 2009 hsu et al 1995 khan et al 2019 yang et al 2020 as feed forward neural networks anns and cnns cannot directly represent temporal dynamics and are thus less able to accurately characterize hydrological processes kratzert et al 2018 in contrast rnns which process the input data chronologically by design can consider temporal dynamics although rnns are more ideal for time series analysis vanilla rnns can hardly store sequences over 10 time steps bengio et al 1994 which limits their applicability in modeling slow hydrological processes occurring at larger time scale such as those related to groundwater snow and glacier storage kratzert et al 2018 the recently emerging lstm models can conquer such weakness with the unique internal gate architectures and have demonstrated superior performance than the vanilla rnns in time series analysis hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 since the first application in hydrological modeling by kratzert et al 2018 for a precipitation runoff p q simulation in 530 american basins 2000 km2 the lstm p q models have been used worldwide e g 669 basins in great britain in lees et al 2021 hanjiang river in china in liu et al 2021 and have become one of the most powerful tools in p q simulations being promising in hydrological modeling current dl based hydrological models still need improvements in three notable aspects nearing et al 2021 1 ability to resolve spatiotemporal features hydrological processes modeling depends heavily on the spatial patterns of meteorological forcing and underlying surface characteristics yang et al 2020 employed computer vision to resolve spatial features in ann p q modeling and demonstrated that spatial information plays an important role in enhancing model robustness however most existing studies about lstm hydrological modeling almost utilized basin spatially averaged meteorological data as model inputs e g jiang et al 2022 kratzert et al 2018 lees et al 2021 without fully representing spatial features of inputs for the lstm hydrological modeling coupling 2 d cnn and lstm is expected to bridge such gap by simultaneously considering both temporal dynamics and spatial features miao et al 2019 shi et al 2015 and cnn lstm has proven to be promising in different fields e g p nowcasting miao et al 2019 shi et al 2015 and water quality forecast barzegar et al 2020 yang et al 2021 2 consideration of multiple hydrological processes differing from physically based hydrological models lstm based models simulate the individual hydrological process such as q feng et al 2020 frame et al 2021 groundwater ali et al 2022 nourani et al 2022 and snow water equivalent duan and ullrich 2021 in most studies but rarely simulate multiple processes simultaneously it makes lstm based hydrological models difficult to explicitly consider the interactions between different hydrological processes and diagnose models based on hydrological theories such as the water balance equation reichstein et al 2019 besides some studies found that introducing additional hydrological processes such as the actual evaporation denoted by e a in this work process in calibration for physical based hydrological models can enhance the q simulation performance herman et al 2018 nesru et al 2020 therefore it is beneficial to investigate if considering multiple hydrological processes simultaneously for lstm based hydrological models can enhance their capacity in depicting more hydrological processes and thus provide a more comprehensive diagnosis of hydrological variables 3 physical interpretability due to the black box nature dl based hydrological models have no explicit representation of physical processes and thus remain being questioned by some hydrologists nearing et al 2021 to enhance the confidence of users and policymakers in adopting dl based hydrological models improvements in the understanding of their physical interpretability have been attempted recently arrieta et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 for example lstm hydrological models have proven to learn a generalizable representation of the underlying physical processes lstm regional hydrological models outperform dhms calibrated regionally and even calibrated for each basin individually feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019 sun et al 2021 besides lstm hydrological models are found to be able to store the hidden information consistent with hydrological knowledge jiang et al 2022 kratzert et al 2018 lees et al 2022 however the physical interpretability of dl models with respect to e a process a critical component in the hydrological cycle is yet to be investigated also the physical concepts of cnn outputs in cnn lstm models are still unclear in this work we aim to overcome these deficiencies by developing a spatiotemporal dl based hydrological model by coupling 2 d cnn and lstm cnn lstm and introducing multi task learning the potential of simultaneous multi task mt learning in dl based hydrological models is also investigated by involving e a process as additional learning target besides we also advance the understanding of physical interpretability of dl based models by extracting the meteorological and hydrological processes hidden in the proposed lstm and cnn lstm models in the remainder of this paper we first describe the proposed dl based model by introducing the basic architecture of cnn and lstm and physical interpretability method section 2 then evaluate the model performance in three large mountainous basins on the tibetan plateau with comparison to the lstm hydrological models section 3 we also explore physical interpretations of this model with respect to the hydrological and meteorological processes section 4 2 methods 2 1 model development we propose a dl based hydrological model fig 1 a by coupling 2 d cnn fig 1b and lstm fig 1c to utilize their respective advantages the former for hierarchical spatial feature extraction while the latter for learning long temporal dependencies the proposed model can use 2 d spatial meteorological and underlying surface data as input and predicts hydrological processes with daily q and e a as output we note however only meteorological data daily p and mean temperature are used in this work as inclusion of surface characteristics demonstrate minimal improvement in model performance not shown the model can perform either single task or multi task learning by setting training targets the former simulates the individual hydrological process while the latter focuses on two or more processes simultaneously below we focus on the model design and description of key components more technical details refer to appendix a 2 1 1 convolutional neural networks cnns cnns fig 1b are a particular type of feed forward neural network including the input convolutional pooling and full connection layer lecun et al 1998 the convolutional layer the core of cnns uses convolutional kernels to extract information from various n dimensions model inputs we utilize 2 d cnn to capture the spatial information of meteorological data the convolutional layer processes meteorological data by reducing the spatial size width and height of inputs features increasing the channel number and generating the 1 dimension sequence finally fig 1b takes a study basin as the example to illustrate the data dimensions in internal layers of the cnns in this study and more details refer to appendix a 2 1 2 long short term memory lstm networks the lstm models fig 1c are designed to alleviate the weakness of the vanilla rnns in processing long length temporal dynamics hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 sherstinsky 2020 the success of lstm lies in the coordination of memory cells cell states c t in fig 1c and hidden cells hidden states h t in fig 1c in the internal architecture that capture the slow and quick evolution processes respectively besides three gates i e input forget and output are designed to control the information in each cell to be stored removed and passed respectively these architectures are beneficial for lstm models to process long length temporal dynamics more detailed descriptions of lstm within the context of hydrological modeling refer to kratzert et al 2018 2 1 3 multi task learning multi task mt learning is to set multiple tasks as optimization targets in a dl based model caruana 1997 the training can benefit from the enriched representations of mt information thus enhancing the performance of each task using the information enveloped in the other tasks besides mt learning can achieve higher efficiency and less over fitting than single task st learning because it can lead the model to a more general feature representation preferred by multiple related tasks li et al 2023 the mt learning is introduced to investigate the effect of multi hydrological process learning in lstm based hydrological modeling in this study 2 1 4 coupling between cnn and lstm to utilize the respective advantage of cnn and lstm models we develop a spatiotemporal dl based hydrological model by coupling cnn and lstm models fig 1a at each time step the cnn lstm coupling is realized via two stages 1 the cnn reduces the 2 d gridded meteorological input into a 1 d sequence and feed it to the lstm1 layer 2 the hidden states of the lstm1 layer are input to the lstm2 layer and cell and hidden states of two lstm layers are then fed to the corresponding layers at the next time step respectively after all processing through the cnn lstm coupled layer prior to time step l the outputs of the lstm2 layer at the last time step are passed to the dense layer to obtain the predictions learned hydrological variables fig 1a depending on the target mode st or mt the dl model may produce different number of output variables st model sets one hydrological process as optimization target while mt model sets two or more hydrological processes as optimization targets by mt learning 2 2 physical interpretability method the internal embedding layers of the dl hydrological models contain a large amount of data that is not explicitly interpretable these data may conceal some untrained internal hydrological variables for example the internal embedding layers of q models may contain the information about e a process this study utilizes probes regression models that map the internal embedding layers of trained models to untrained hydrological variables hewitt and liang 2019 lees et al 2022 to test whether trained dl models can learn the known but untrained hydrological variables and examine the internal representation and further physical interpretability of models the simplest form of probes is a linear regression lr model that connects the learned embedding layers to a given output this study explores untrained hydrological variables from proposed lstm and cnn lstm models based on lr models and detailed experiment design refers to section 4 1 3 model evaluation we evaluate the performance of proposed cnn lstm model in three large mountainous basins on the tibetan plateau tp section 3 1 to assess the applicability of cnn lstm in resolving spatial information in hydrological modeling an lstm only model is also configured as a benchmarking baseline differing from the cnn lstm model the basin spatially averaged meteorological data at each time step are directly input to the lstm only model without the involvement of cnn model detailed in kratzert et al 2018 also st and mt experiments section 3 2 are designed to evaluate the mt learning performance of cnn lstm and lstm models and the influence of mt on dl based hydrological modeling in this study the model inputs are daily total p and mean air temperature t in line with similar studies e g jiang et al 2022 in addition to q we also select the e a an important hydrological processes for which data are available as the training target to evaluate the effect of multi task learning in lstm modeling 3 1 study area and data 3 1 1 study area the tibetan plateau tp fig 2 a is the highest plateau in the world known as the roof of the world or the third pole given the high altitude and vast glaciers of tp along with the many mighty rivers e g yangtze lancang mekong yarlung zangbo brahmaputra and yellow among others that provide enormous water sources for downstream livelihoods and agricultural irrigation huss et al 2017 immerzeel et al 2010 nan et al 2021 schaner et al 2012 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2013 tp is also considered the water tower of asia however owing to the incompleteness of knowledge of complex alpine hydrological processes it is challenging to adequately model hydrological processes by dhms in the tp li et al 2019b nan et al 2021 to systematically evaluate the performance of the lstm and cnn lstm hydrological model in such a challenging environment we select source regions of three rivers fig 2a the yellow river fig 2b the yangtze river fig 2c and the lancang river fig 2d characterized as mountainous areas as the study basins the landforms of all three basins undulate greatly with elevation variability greater than 3 000 m the annual average p of three basins ranges from 460 to 830 mm the detailed description of the three study basins is shown in table 1 yellow yangtze and lancang are used hereinafter to denote their respective source regions if not specified otherwise 3 1 2 data due to the limited availability of in situ observations in the study area we utilize either the optimal remote sensing or reanalysis datasets for different input variables as follows 1 precipitation p multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep v2 2 with 0 1 spatial and 3 h temporal resolution beck et al 2017 beck et al 2019 2 air temperature t the air temperature at 2 m agl t2 from the fifth generation of ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate era5 reanalysis dataset with 0 1 spatially and 1 h temporal resolution hersbach et al 2020 while for output evaluation dataset we use the following datasets 1 evaporation e a global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam v3 5a e a dataset with 0 25 spatial and 1 day temporal resolution martens et al 2017 miralles et al 2011 the basin spatially averaged daily e a are calculated as the model learning target 2 runoff q the daily in situ measurements collected at three hydrological stations fig 1 provided by local water agencies all the above datasets are pre processed into daily resolution in line with the model time step and spilt into three periods for training evaluation and testing table 2 3 2 model evaluation experiment 3 2 1

cnn lstm 3 tasks q e a q e a task q and e a are for the st experiment and q e a for mt 3 2 2 evaluation metrics this study utilizes nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 1 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and its three decompositions gupta et al 2009 namely the correlation coefficient r eq 2 the variance bias Œ± eq 3 and the total volume bias Œ≤ eq 4 to evaluation metrics 1 nse 1 t 1 t v sim v obs 2 t 1 t v

evaluation results 3 3 1 performance of cnn lstm models in general cnn lstm q models work remarkably well in all three study basins with nses greater than 0 89 table 3 moriasi et al 2007 and can accurately capture peak of q with appropriate magnitudes and timing fig 3 the results are compared to some traditional hydrological models in other relevant studies and it is indicated that cnn lstm q models outperform them see detailed in appendix b besides simulated e a processes agree well with gleam data with nses of 0 97 in all three study basins table 4 figs 4 and 5 these results demonstrate that the proposed cnn lstm model performs favorably and thus is a reasonable approach to simulate hydrological processes in large mountainous basins 3 3 2 the capacity of 2 d cnn in extracting spatial characteristics to evaluate the capacity of 2 d cnn in extracting spatial characteristics we developed lstm q and e a models as benchmarking baselines high corrections nses more than 0 87 of q and 0 97 of e a tables 3 and 4 indicate the good performance of lstm models in hydrological simulation by comparing the performance of lstm and cnn lstm q models it is found that cnn lstm models outperform lstm models in overall q simulation with higher nses of q in the yellow and yangtze table 3 also evaluation results of three biases metrics indicate that both lstm and cnn lstm q models underestimate the peak q processes bpv 0 but overestimate the median and low q processes bmv b l v 0 in the yellow and yangtze but the peak q underestimation of cnn lstm models is mitigated compared with that of lstm models with bpv from 0 31 and 0 15 lstm to 0 00 and 0 11 cnn lstm in the yellow and yangtze respectively in contrast the overestimation of simulated median and low q processes by cnn lstm q models are stronger than that by lstm q models in all three study basins we conclude that the introduction of 2 d cnn into lstm q models has a two sided effect it can enhance the overall model performance as well as the capacity in simulating peaking q processes while may work slightly poorly in modeling q in the median and low ranges these effects can be explained by the different lstm inputs in the cnn lstm models the inputs to lstm are the feature vectors size is 1 64 at each time step table a3 extracted from 2 d spatial meteorological data by 2 d cnn whereas those are the spatially averaged p and t data within study basins in the lstm only models based on the remarkable performance of both lstm and cnn lstm models we assume that the lstm inputs of cnn lstm models i e cnn outputs contain the information about basin spatially averaged p and t data discussed later in section 4 2 1 besides we infer that more information hidden in the cnn outputs capturing the peak runoff features contribute to enhancing the downstream lstm performance while remaining redundant information might hurt downstream lstm performance noting that there is one exception in the lancang cnn lstm q model does not outperform lstm models in terms of overall and high q this could be due to different hydrological characteristics of the testing period and shorter training dataset table 2 all three years of the testing dataset in the lancang can be categorized as normal or dry years without extreme q processes e g 2012 in the yellow that might not benefit from the capacity of 2 d cnn in modeling peaking q processes besides we also infer that shorter training dataset might not contain enough information to train the optimal parameters for the cnn lstm model whose training parameters are larger than the lstm only model it causes the cnn lstm model does not outperform lstm model in the lancang on the other hand both lstm and cnn lstm e a models perform well without significant differences between two models in all three study basins table 4 figs 4 and 5 it demonstrates that lstm is a remarkable approach for average e a of the basin modeling and introducing 2 d cnn has little impact on it further suggesting that average p and t play vital roles in e a modeling and cnn outputs might contain the information about it 3 3 3 the effect of multi task learning to investigate the applicability of mt learning in training lstm and cnn lstm models we configured them with q and e a as the simultaneous learning targets in addition to those single task st experiments targeting at only q or e a the simulations by mt models agree well with observations in all three study basins with favorable nses of q 0 89 by lstm mt and 0 82 by cnn lstm mt fig 6 besides both lstm and cnn lstm mt models achieve remarkable performance in predicting e a in all three study basins fig 5 table 4 these results demonstrate that both lstm and cnn lstm models are capable of simulating multiple hydrological processes simultaneously furthermore compared with lstm q models the lstm mt ones achieve higher nses and lower total volume biases Œ≤ suggesting that introducing e a as additional training target can enhance the q performance of lstm models by reducing the total volume biases it is consistent with the effect of introducing the e a process in calibration for physical based hydrological models herman et al 2018 nesru et al 2020 it further motivates us to assume that the internal states of lstm hydrological models similar to physical based hydrological models might encompass multiple untrained physical hydrological processes thus we put forward the hypothesis that e a q process information can be easily reconstructed from internal states of trained lstm q e a models without the aforementioned complicated training procedures this hypothesis will be tested in section 4 2 2 in contrast the q performance of cnn lstm mt models declines significantly compared with their st counterparts in all three study basins significant performance differences between st and mt might be explained by the variant lstm inputs in cnn lstm models with different training references compared with the invariant lstm inputs in lstm models section 2 1 besides the redundant information contained in the cnn outputs might make it difficult to simulate multiple hydrological processes on the other hand differences in e a performance between st and mt mode of both lstm and cnn lstm are not significant indicating that mt learning in the lstm and cnn lstm models has minimal effect on e a modeling 4 physical interpretability of dl hydrological models this section further explores the physical interpretability of cnn and lstm models by using the lr model section 2 2 to look into potential hydrological and meteorological information cnn and lstm may capture fig 7 4 1 experiment design according to the above discussions we design two experiments to test two hypotheses as follows 1 the cnn of trained cnn lstm models can capture spatially averaged meteorological data within basin t basin p basin from gridded meteorological data cnn input fig 7a b to test this hypothesis we construct lr models to map the cnn output of three cnn lstm q e a and mt models fig 7a to spatially averaged precipitation and temperature data within basins p basin and t basin and then use the correlation coefficient r between lr model output and spatially averaged meteorological data within basins namely r cnn as indicator to examine their correlation fig 7a in addition we calculate the r of spatial averages of meteorological data within the basin and those of the original gridded data r ref as the reference indicator fig 7b by comparing r cnn and r ref we can thus infer if the cnn can extract basin scale characteristics of meteorological input data or not 2 e a q process information can be reconstructed from internal states of trained lstm q e a models without the aforementioned complicated training procedures fig 7c similar as lees et al 2022 lr models are constructed to map the cell states vector the memory of lstm e a q models to the untrained q e a processes and examine the resultant nse s to justify if lstm is capable of inferring untrained hydrological information for this we obtain 6 sets of nse s values 2 relations e a q and e a 3 basins yellow yangtze and lancang 4 2 the physical interpretability results 4 2 1 the physical interpretability of cnn outputs as the meteorological data within a studied basin is essentially a subset of the original gridded dataset fig 7b it is expected the spatial average of the former datasets i e p basin and t basin can be highly correlated to those of the latter i e p ref and t ref in particular when their spatial extents are comparable e g the yangtze river basin in fig 2c and our estimation does suggest high p and t correlation for all three basins r ref 0 97 except the lower p correlation for the lancang r ref 0 80 table 5 thus we select the lancang basin as the study area to examine the capacity of cnn in inferring basin specific information from the original gridded dataset our results indicate that the spatial averages of p and t within the lancang can be extracted from the cnn outputs in high fidelity r cnn of all configurations are much larger than r ref for p cf 0 94 vs 0 79 table 5 and close to 1 for t which supports our first hypothesis furthermore it is also interesting to see the difference in r cnn between different configurations for p a lower r cnn is produced by the evapotranspiration targeted model suggesting those runoff targeted models perform better in extracting precipitation related information while a reverse pattern is found for t such results are in line with the common hydrological understanding that p has a more significant impact on q while t is a strong control of e a 4 2 2 the physical interpretability of lstm cell states high correlation is found between the lstm inferred and observed q nses of 0 72 0 84 and 0 86 in the yellow yangtze and lancang fig 8 suggesting the remarkable capacity of lstm in inferring the q related processes solely from ea likewise the inferred e a processes also agree favorably with gleam e a data with nses more than 0 93 in all three study basins fig 9 such results support our second hypothesis that lstm q e a models contain information about untrained e a q processes without prior training procedures 5 conclusion and limitation in this study we develop an integrated spatiotemporal dl based model by coupling cnn and lstm for hydrological simulation and evaluate it in the source regions of the yellow river the yangtze river and the lancang river besides we employ a simple linear regression method to explore the physical interpretability of cnn and lstm in dl based hydrological models to improve our understanding of dlm inferred hydrological processes our main findings are as follows 1 both lstm and cnn lstm models perform favorably with n s e s more than 0 87 q and 0 97 e a in all three study basins the cnn lstm q models achieve better performance than lstm ones in modeling q therefore we recommend the cnn lstm models for hydrological modeling and flooding forecasts in large mountainous basins 2 both lstm and cnn lstm multi task models work well for q n s e s 0 82 and e a n s e s 0 95 simulation and lstm multi task models outperform lstm q models in all three study basins this finding demonstrates that introducing e a as an additional training target in the lstm q model can enhance the model performance and further research can be conducted to evaluate the potential of lstm models for more and even whole hydrological modeling in the future 3 the internal cells of cnn and lstm contain the hydrological and meteorological information consistent with our knowledge cnn outputs in cnn lstm models can capture the basin specific characteristics from 2 d gridded meteorological data of larger domains while the internal cells of lstm q e a models may infer the e a q processes these findings advance the understanding of the physical interpretability of dl based hydrological models being promising in predicting hydrological processes this model has several limitations first unlike the observed runoff data the gleam dataset as the e a training target is of high accuracy but subject to some biases in the tibetan plateau li et al 2019a it might lead trained e a models to a slight deviation from the true e a process besides this model is only evaluated in the three large mountainous basins on the tibetan plateau due to the limitation of computational resources future research will be carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed cnn lstm model in more basins develop cnn lstm regional hydrological models using more underlying surface data and explore more physical information hidden in the internal cells of dl based hydrological models credit

100083 china graphical abstract net primary productivity npp is an important component of the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems and plays an important role in the evaluation of vegetation growth among all the factors wind also plays a vital role in modeling vegetation productivity however none of the current models have considered the impact of wind on the process of productivity estimation an in depth study was conducted on the temporal and spatial distribution and internal relations between wind speed and npp by introducing the influence factor wind the carnegie ames stanford model casa based on the land surface water index was modified and named as wcasa model the estimation and prediction results of wcasa model considering the influence factor wind were better than that of the casa model the modified wcasa model was applied in xinjiang china the simulation results were improved with the coefficient of determination r2 increased by 9 59 the root mean square error rmse decreased by 13 78 and the residual of prediction deviation rpd improved by 12 08 as compared to casa model the optimal model was used to simulate and predict the npp of cropland and grassland for 2022 2050 under three climate scenarios ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 respectively based on the cmip6 dataset the wcasa model can accurately estimate and predict npp which provides scientific basis for efficient agricultural water use and food production keywords wind influence factor net primary productivity light use efficiency casa model wcasa model xinjiang data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction net primary productivity npp refers to the net accumulation of organic matter by plants in a certain period field et al 1998 as a key component of the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems haberl et al 2007 npp is sensitive to ecosystem health and ecological balance gao et al 2009 therefore quantitatively estimating npp is of great importance for assessing carbon sequestration and ecological behavior and for further understanding changes in ecosystem function as well as structure yu et al 2009 ying et al 2016 after the concept of npp was proposed its calculation methods have gone through three stages site based empirical statistical models allen et al 2010 lieth 1972 lieth and whittaker 1975 osmond et al 2010 sisay et al 2017 uchijima and seino 1985 mechanistic models running et al 2000 parton et al 1993 mcguire et al 1995 running and hunt 1993 and the light use efficiency models potter et al 1993 potter and klooster 1997 cramer et al 1999 among them light use efficiency models are more widely used because they can combine satellite remote sensing data with productivity estimates at large scales using fewer input data roughgarden et al 1991 monteith 1972 1977 developed a model based on absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar and light use efficiency lue observations to estimate plant productivity lue is the ratio of the energy contained in organic matter produced by photosynthesis per unit area to the solar energy received large scale npp studies require accurate estimates of apar and lue however lue exhibits both spatial differences among vegetation types gower et al 1999 turner et al 2002 and temporal differences at individual sites campbell et al 2001 nouvellon et al 2000 therefore generating valid lue representations is particularly difficult in areas with a large vegetation cover which creates spatial heterogeneity that is not easily captured by remotely sensed reflectance observations environmental factors such as temperature soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit regulate vegetation npp by affecting plant photosynthesis in the models using remote sensing data these factors regulate npp by modulating light use efficiency the calculation of water stress factors in the widely used photosynthetic utilized carnegie ames stanford casa model potter et al 1993 field et al 1995 zhu et al 2007 luo et al 2018 fang et al 2021 is complex and requires a large number of soil parameters which are usually difficult to obtain in larger areas at higher altitudes thus limiting the application of the casa model bao et al 2016 changed the water stress factor in the original casa model to the land surface water index lswi for an accurate estimation of npp in arid zones and obtained better simulation results the wind is an important power source of energy and material exchange in the vegetation atmosphere soil system and one of the basic elements affecting the rate of vegetation assimilation which cannot be ignored in vegetation growth and development cao and zhang 2013 zhang and zhou 2005 under conditions of intense light wind equilibrates the temperature within the vegetation community with the external ambient temperature and accelerates the transpiration of the plants guan 2017 reducing the temperature of the plant surface and avoiding sunburn the wind keeps the air inside the plant community fresh and plays an important role in the regulation of temperature water vapor and co2 among plants cleugh et al 1998 van and grace 1991 it is the driving force of passive water uptake by vegetation which enables the transport of minerals from the soil with water from the roots to the upper part under low wind speed conditions wind thins the sheet flow layer of leaves reduces diffusion resistance and enhances the transport of co2 thus increasing the intensity of photosynthesis zhao et al 2017 however when the wind speed exceeds a certain limit the leaf transpires vigorously the water condition deteriorates and the stomatal opening decreases resulting in a decrease in photosynthesis intensity yu et al 2003 in addition the leaves that are often exposed to wind are shorter and fewer and respiration is enhanced yang 2006 conducted a study on the distribution pattern and influencing factors of natural ventilation wind speed in a daylight greenhouse and found that the airflow movement rate in the greenhouse had a significant effect on the growth and development as well as yield quality of thick skinned melon and at an airflow movement rate of 1 0 m s the stomatal conductance of thick skinned melon increased by 120 3 the leaf area index increased by 63 1 both transpiration rate and the photosynthetic rate increased significantly and the yield increased by 24 4 however the increasing wind speed can also adversely affect the crop which in turn affects the crop yield tang et al 2011 found that the net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of seedlings decreased significantly with the increasing wind speed and longer blowing time while the transpiration increased zhang et al 2017 found that wind speed was critical to crop growth and there was a strong linear relationship between wind speed and crop yield with a 1 m s increase in the average wind speed during the reproductive period the output of rice and wheat decreased by 14 5 and 13 9 respectively the dry hot wind is a kind of agricultural catastrophic weather with high temperature and low humidity accompanied by wind which usually occurs during the peak crop growth period april to october where high temperature and low humidity lead to physiological drought in crops and wind aggravates the degree of drought huo et al 2019 cgwhwnc 1988 it can cause an imbalance in crop water metabolism and seriously affect various physiological functions of crops leading to significant yield reduction with yield reductions of 5 to 10 in monior disaster year and with yield reductions of 20 to 30 or even more in heavy disaster year it has been shown that at lower wind speeds wind motion changes the light distribution within the canopy increasing canopy productivity by alleviating photosynthetic limitations dupont et al 2018 alexandra et al 2018 kromdijk et al 2016 and improving crop yields yang et al 2014 however increasing wind speed can also adversely affect the photosynthesis of vegetation ennos 1997 tang et al 2011 which in turn reduces productivity wind speed has certain influence on crop productivity zhang et al 2017 but it has not been considered as an influencing factor in the model estimating productivity sun et al 2019 yuan et al 2014 xinjiang has abundant wind energy resources due to its special geographical characteristics wu et al 2020 the effect of wind speed cannot be ignored when estimating vegetation npp wind speed will gradually increase with global warming zhang et al 2017 therefore the wind will also become progressively important in future studies therefore in this study based on the casa model we introduce the wind factor to simulate npp in the xinjiang region and provide a scientific basis for efficient water use and grain production for agriculture in the xinjiang region the main objective of this study is to improve net primary productivity modeling by incorporating the wind and the improved model is then used for climate change assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at xinjiang see fig 1 which is located in the northwest of china with a total area of 1 66 million km2 between latitude 34 22 49 33 n and longitude 73 41 96 18 e xinjiang is far from the sea deep inland and surrounded by high mountains forming a distinct temperate continental climate the sunshine hours in the region are sufficient 2500 3500 h per year but the temperature varies a lot with the characteristic that the southern border is higher than the northern border the average annual precipitation in xinjiang is about 150 mm the annual precipitation in the mountainous areas of northern xinjiang reaches 500 600 mm while the average annual precipitation in southern xinjiang is only about 10 mm in qiemo and ruoqiang with the least precipitation in china zhang et al 2018 many rivers are formed by the melting snow of the mountain ranges in the region oases are distributed on the edges of the basins accounting for about 5 of the total area gunigimu 2020 xinjiang is extremely rich in wind energy resources accounting for about 20 4 of the total reserves in china wu et al 2020 and the quality of wind energy is quite high the annual average wind speed in northern and eastern xinjiang can exceed 6 m s and the number of hours of effective wind speed can reach 5000 6000 h per year national energy administration 2015 to further study the relationship between wind speed and npp in xinjiang we randomly selected 40 grassland sample grids and 20 cropland sample grids distributed in different latitudes and longitudes as well as different altitudes shown in fig 1 2 2 dataset and data preprocessing precipitation surface temperature surface incident shortwave radiation and wind speed were obtained from china meteorological forcing dataset https data tpdc ac cn en data 8028b944 daaa 4511 8769 965612652c49 the data of sunshine hours were from china meteorological information network https data cma gov cn we selected 64 meteorological stations in xinjiang for the present study by using the ordinary kriging method sunshine hour in xinjiang was spatially interpolated and the mod09a1 dataset from nasa was used to calculate the surface wetness index the land use data mcd12q1 is also from nasa the time period of all the above datasets is 2000 2018 and the spatial resolution is 500 m this study uses the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification system mark 2015 we first evaluated the original casa model in the study area by using the npp data set obtained from chen 2019 which was calculated by the normal casa model then the simulation results of the wcasa model we proposed were further validated by gosif gpp with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 05 and 8 d provided by li and xiao 2019 different from the common used modis gpp data which involves the calculation procedure of light use efficiency the gosif gpp li et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 li and xiao 2019 li and xiao 2022 is developed based on the global orbiting carbon observatory 2 based sif product gosif and linear relationships between sif solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence and gpp data from eddy covariance ec flux towers all eight sif gpp relationships performed well in estimating gpp globally the ensemble means 8 day gpp was generally highly correlated with flux tower gpp for 91 eddy covariance flux sites across the globe r2 0 74 rmse 1 92 g c m 2 d 1 li et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 li and xiao 2019 li and xiao 2022 based on the annual from 2000 to 2018 and monthly scales of gosif gpp data and the annual scale npp data from 2000 to 2018 provided by national cryosphere desert data center https www ncdc ac cn we obtained the npp data at the monthly scale was used for evaluation in our study zhang et al 2009 collalti and prentice 2019 the future climate data comes from the cmip6 climate model data set the monthly precipitation surface temperature surface incident shortwave radiation and surface wind speed data of the following three climate scenarios ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 were selected for future simulation 2 3 methods 2 3 1 model modification with the wind influence factor the influence of wind on vegetation productivity can be divided into the following two aspects on the one hand wind affects both the physiological and ecological processes of vegetation by changing the temperature water vapor co2 and other factors in the area where the vegetation is located leading to changes in lue thereby changing productivity on the other hand the wind will affect the distribution and gesture of vegetation canopy in lue changes for example exposing previously shaded leaves to sunlight which in turn changes productivity based on the 30 year county level agricultural data in china there is a strong linear relationship between wind and vegetation productivity zhang et al 2017 experiments with the effects of wind speed on crops in a transparent wind tunnel and solar greenhouse in northwest china have shown that wind can promote or inhibit the actual lue of vegetation which depends on the wind speed in the surroundings tang et al 2011 yang 2006 statistically when the wind speed exceeds a certain critical value the lue of vegetation will change from promotion to inhibition the vegetation types in xinjiang include grassland cropland shrubland and woods among others with a relatively large proportion of the area for grassland and cropland therefore this study focuses on grassland and cropland in xinjiang for studying the effect of wind speed on npp this study will introduce the influence factor of wind based on casa to revise the estimation of the actual lue and then calculate npp under the influence of wind speed in xinjiang fig 2 the piecewise fitting model was used to fit the variation of npp with wind speed as shown in lines ab and bc in fig 3 it shows the joint probability distribution of npp and wind speed for grassland and farmland the detailed derivation is shown in the supplementary data in this study the vegetation not affected by wind speed that is the wind speed is 0 m s is set as the reference benchmark and is not affected by wind stress at the same time as the wind speed increases the lue of the vegetation will increase thereby promoting npp when the wind speed increases to a certain value the lue of the vegetation will reduce thereby inhibiting its npp we consider although the wind continues to increase the vegetation may have reached the growth limit the worst case is that the vegetation itself no longer grows and npp no longer changes with the wind speed 1 wind g 0 25 wind g 1 0 wind g 1 0 15 wind g 1 4 1 wind g 6 0 5 else where windg refers to the wind influence factor for grassland which reflects the influence of wind on lue the windg m s is the monthly average wind speed of grassland in each grid during the growth period 2 wind c 0 25 wind c 1 0 wind c 0 8

cropland in each grid during the growth period by combining formula s 2 of the supplementary data and formula 1 and 2 the formula for calculating lue based on casa considering the wind influence factor is obtained as follows 3 Œµ w x t t Œµ 1 x t t Œµ 2 x t w Œµ x t w i n d x t Œµ max using formula s 1 of the supplementary data and formula 3 the formula for calculating npp based on the casa model with the wind influence factor can be obtained as follows 4 n p p x t a p a r x t Œµ w x t from june to july dry hot wind resulting in the physiological drought of crops and significant yield reduction often occurs in xinjiang therefore it is necessary to multiply by a reduction factor of 0 8 when calculating the npp of cropland huo et al 2019 affected by ground friction wind speed may increase with height according to previous studies the wind speed at the height of 2 m is adopted for cropland and the wind speed at the height of 0 15 m is adopted for grassland feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 the following formula were used to calculate the wind speed at different heights 10 v 1 v 2 h 1 h 2 Œ± where v1 is the wind speed at the height of h1 v2 is the wind speed at the height of h2 and Œ± is the wind shear index which varies with the height and generally takes 1 7 in the absence of measured wind speed at different heights erik et al 1997 2 3 2 performance evaluation the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and residual prediction deviation rpd are used to evaluate the accuracy of the model eqs 11 14 janssen and heuberger 1995 the higher the r2 and rpd values the more stable the model the lower the rmse value the higher the accuracy of the model rpd 1 indicates that the model prediction is very poor which is not recommended when 1 rpd 1 4 the model prediction is not good only the highest value can be distinguished 1 4 rpd 1 8 indicates a general model that can be used to evaluate related analysis and 1 8 rpd 2 0 indicates a good model for quantitative estimation in addition 2 0 rpd 2 5 indicates a very good quantitative estimation model and as for rpd 2 5 the model estimation reaches quite excellent gaston et al 2010 11 r 2 i 1 n y

the mann kendall m k method kendall 1975 mann 1945 is employed for investigating the trend of npp this method presents a monotonous trend and does not require independence and normality neeti and eastman 2011 in addition when the sample size is greater than 8 neeti and eastman 2011 the test statistics z meets an approximately normal distribution a negative z value indicates a downward trend and vice versa in addition when Œ± 0 05 the significance of the trend of npp and wind speed was tested in addition the magnitude of change in npp is estimated based on the theil sen median slope which is more suitable for evaluating variable changes in short and noisy time series zhou et al 2016 the calculation of the median slope of m k and theil sen is as follows see gocic and trajkovic 2013 for details 15 s m 1 p 1 n m 1 p s g n x n x m where p is the number of data points xm and xn are the data values of time m and n n m respectively and sgn xn xm is the symbolic function 16 s g n x n x m 1

Œ± 0 05 18 z s 1 var s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 var s i f s 0 in addition the thiel sen median slope is calculated according to formula 19 19 Œ≤ s m e d i a x k x m k m f o r s 1 n where xk and xm are the values of time k and m k m respectively 2 3 4 ndvi and lswi fitting for future projection to predict the changes of npp by wcasa in different future climate scenarios ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 this study establishes a statistical model in each 0 05 0 05 grid unit based on the previous prediction in the studies of fu et al 2018 and roerink et al 2003 with precipitation temperature and radiation data the multiple linear regression model is used to fit ndvi and lswi of grassland and cropland in xinjiang to predict future ndvi and lswi the multiple linear regression model is first established with climate data ndvi and lswi during 2000 2018 and the future projection is then performed with the future climate input the general form of the multiple linear regression model is as follows 20 y i Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x i 1 Œ≤ 2 x i 2 Œ≤ 3 x i 3 Œº i i 1 2 where yi is the dependent variable xi1 xi2 xi3 are independent variables Œ≤0 Œ≤1 Œ≤2 Œ≤3 refer to regression coefficients Œºi is a random variable 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal patterns of npp and wind speed 3 1 1 spatial distribution of npp and wind speed the spatial distribution and coefficient of variation of npp and wind speed in xinjiang during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 are shown in fig 4 the average npp is higher in the northwest part and lowers in the southeast the kunlun mountain in southern xinjiang has the lowest npp which is 4 23 gc m2 7 month and the highest npp is up to 725 65 gc m2 7 month in the altay region of northern xinjiang fig 4a the wind speed presents a high speed band from northeast to southwest fig 4b the highest value of 3 92 m s appears at the junction of urumqi hami and turpan and the lowest value of 0 37 m s appears in the kashgar area of southern xinjiang the coefficient of variation is larger where the average npp is larger in most areas the coefficient of variation of npp is less than 1 fig 4c the spatial pattern of the wind speed coefficient of variation fig 4d is opposite to the spatial pattern of its mean value the mean value of wind speed is higher and the coefficient of variation is lower the coefficient of variation in xinjiang is less than 0 33 the coefficient of variation of npp is greater than that of variation of wind speed during the growing period april to october it is also larger where its mean npp value is larger however the coefficient of variation of npp is small when the mean wind speed is large the reason may be related to the large variability of npp and the small variability in wind speed during the growing period 3 1 2 trend of npp and wind speed the trend of npp and wind speed in xinjiang is shown in fig 5 during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 npp showed an upward trend for 47 26 area fig 5a mainly distributed in changji autonomous prefecture urumqi and southern karamay geographically 11 79 of all npp showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 and 12 16 showed a significant decreasing trend the wind speed has an upward trend for 53 49 area fig 5b which is mainly distributed in the altay area tacheng area eastern hami and western tarim basin 5 06 of the wind data have a significant upward trend p 0 05 and 3 79 of the wind data show a significant downward trend p 0 05 3 1 3 spatial distribution of wind influence factor as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b the mean values of the two wind influence factors differ slightly the regions with low wind influence factors almost coincide with the regions with high mean wind speed distribution this is consistent with our research hypothesis it is shown that the wind speed in the northwest of xinjiang is more conducive to npp growth from fig 6c and fig 6d the variation range of windc is smaller than that of windg which may be related to the selection of inflection points of wind influence factors the inflection point of windc 0 8 m s is smaller than that of windg 1 0 m s this means that the maximum wind impact factor of windg is higher than that of windc the coefficient of variation of windg was generally greater than that of windc 3 2 simulation of npp by wcasa model to examine the model performance of the casa model and wcasa model the gosif gpp li and xiao 2019 is employed to validate the simulation results the ratio of annual npp data from 2000 to 2018 to annual gosif gpp data from 2000 to 2018 zhang et al 2009 collalti and prentice 2019 was then multiplied by monthly gosif gpp data to calculate monthly npp data the generated data based on the gosif gpp li and xiao 2019 is used for evaluation in our study as shown in fig 7 the distribution of the annual averaged ratio of net primary productivity to gross primary productivity npp gpp from 2000 to 2018 in xinjiang shows that the high value mainly concentrates in the north xinjiang and low in the south xinjiang about 53 of npp gpp is between 0 4 and 0 5 17 is between 0 3 and 0 4 and only 11 is between 0 5 and 0 6 for different vegetation types for the studied area different sets of wind speed parameter values are used in wcasa windg is used for npp of grassland and windc is used for cropland the maximum light use efficiency Œµmax in casa and wcasa models were calibrated from 2000 to 2009 and validated from 2001 to 2018 using actual npp the precipitation radiation sunshine hours temperature lswi and ndvi data were the basic forcing data for the casa model calculating the npp as for the wcasa model in addition to the above data wind speed data is also required as a key factor to improve the accuracy of simulated npp the grassland and cropland in xinjiang were selected for the calculation of the npp value the model evaluation results are shown in table s1 in addition we made cross validation between npp calculated by the casa model in this study and that calculated by chen 2019 and the results show that the two sets of data are highly consistent with an average absolute error of 6 13 model calibration and validation on net primary productivity npp simulation for grassland cropland are listed in table s1 of the supplementary data it can be observed that for grassland r2 rmse and rpd of the wcasa model were better compared with the casa model in both calibration and validation periods the wcasa model has better fitting effects accuracy and prediction accuracy for the cropland r2 rmse and rpd of the wcasa model were better than the casa model during the calibration period during the validation period the r2 and rpd of the wcasa model improved the fitting effect of cropland is better than that of grassland which helps to predict agricultural production for the same period r2 has increased by 9 59 rmse has decreased by 13 78 and rpd has increased by 12 08 the wcasa model has a better simulation result on npp for cropland compared to that of grassland this can be attributed to the fact that xinjiang has a wide variety of grassland covering a large area with a wide distribution range as xinjiang is more prone to extreme climates which makes it difficult to simulate accurately during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 the absolute difference between the actual npp and the simulated npp of grassland fig 8 a and cropland fig 8b for casa and wcasa models showed variations in the following the absolute difference between the actual npp and the simulated npp is referred to as Œ¥npp fig 8 shows the difference between the casa and wcasa models for the simulated npp and the actual npp in grassland and cropland during the study period the npp of casa and wcasa models varied greatly from july to august as for grassland fig 8a the multi annual average Œ¥npp of the casa model from may to september 9 67 gc m2 month was larger than that of the wcasa model 8 20 gc m2 month the maximum Œ¥npp of the casa model 19 66 gc m2 month was also higher than that of the wcasa model 16 85 gc m2 month as for cropland according to fig 8b the average Œ¥npp of the casa model from june to september 17 13 gc m2 month is larger than that of the wcasa model 14 72 gc m2 month the maximum value of Œ¥npp of the casa model 34 52 gc m2 month was also higher than that of the wcasa model 31 34 gc m2 month the Œ¥npp of the wcasa model is small and the simulation effect is good in both grassland and arable land the Œ¥npp changes less in april and october which may be due to the smaller npp values in these two months we refer to the value of npp minus the actual npp simulated by the wcasa model as Œ¥nppwcasa and the value of npp minus the actual npp simulated by the casa model as Œ¥nppcasa Œ¥nppwcasa is more uniformly distributed in space fig 9 a this indicates that the npp simulated by the wcasa model is closer to the distribution of the real npp in the spatial simulation the casa model overestimates npp near yining and underestimates npp near altai changji and hami fig 9b 3 3 changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of npp under future climate change scenarios in xinjiang the improved wcasa model is used for the effective npp projection during future time the future ndvi lswi is required for running the model to this end the period of 2000 2009 is selected as the calibration period and the period of 2010 2018 as the validation period to fit the ndvi lswi of grassland and cropland in xinjiang fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 that for both calibration and validation period r2 of ndvi for grassland is 0 93 and rmse is 0 019 r2 reaches 0 54 and the rmse is limited to 0 023 for grassland lswi fitting during the validation period the r2 of lswi for grassland is 0 53 and rmse is 0 021 the fitting effect of ndvi and lswi for cropland is as followed r2 is greater than 0 91 and rmse is no more than 0 033 in both the calibration period and the validation period therefore it is feasible to fit and predict ndvi and lswi based on precipitation temperature and radiation data as shown in figs s2 and s3 of the supplementary data under the three future climate change scenarios the npp of grassland during the growing period april to october of 2022 2050 in xinjiang shows an upward trend compared with npp during the growing period from 2000 to 2018 while npp of cropland shows an obvious downward trend the rate of npp growth in grasslands gradually decreases as the future climate change scenario changes from ssp126 to ssp585 under the ssp126 scenario grassland grows at a rate of 0 79 gc m2 7 month whose npp can reach 240 306 gc m2 7 month during the growth period of 2022 2050 under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios the growth rate of grassland is 0 44 gc m2 7 month and 0 39 gc m2 7 month respectively of which npp can reach 230 294 gc m2 7 month and 229 286 gc m2 7 month during the growing period of 2022 2050 during the growing period of 2022 2050 the relationship between the rate of decrease in npp of cropland is as follows ssp126 ssp585 ssp245 under the ssp126 scenario the npp of cropland decreases at a rate of 3 01 gc m2 7 month which can reach 247 344 gc m2 7 month during the growing period of 2022 2050 under the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios the growth rate of npp in cropland is 2 40 gc m2 7 month and 2 64 gc m2 7 month respectively which can reach 256 355 gc m2 7 month and 262 344 gc m2 7 month during the growing period of 2022 2050 4 discussion while using the model to estimate npp all input data needs to be resampled to the same scale in the process of resampling points with different values and different vegetation types may be mixed at the same point for example a pixel may include several types of vegetation with complex surface reflectivity at a special resolution of 500 m 500 m which will reduce the simulation accuracy of the model to a certain extent relevant studies have also shown that the casa model has a good application effect in xinjiang zhang et al 2020 r2 of the improved casa model in the study is better than previous results bao et al 2016 yu et al 2009 indicating that the improved wcasa model is more suitable for a place like xinjiang the relationship between three influence factors was determined according to the distribution of wind speed and npp of grassland and cropland in xinjiang so that the wind speed for reaching the maximum npp can be determined and r2 of the wcasa model compared with the casa model was also improved the time lag of relevant meteorological factors was not considered luo et al 2018 and if the wind blows for a long time the vegetation leaves may be smaller than those without wind onoda and anten 2011 all of these need further study due to the limitations of experimental conditions measurements were not made in xinjiang for the impact of wind on npp and gpp the study is performed based on the statistical data through literature 30 year county level agricultural data in china and relevant experimental data effects of wind speed on crops in transparent wind tunnels and solar greenhouse in northwest china in the future we will experimentally divide the wind influence factor into more detailed components for example the changes in vegetation physiological and ecological processes temperature water vapor co2 and other factors caused by wind speed could be assigned into temperature stress and water stress quantitatively and the part of the effects from the changes in distribution and gesture of vegetation canopy caused by wind speed could be incorporated into apar fluctuation for the current stage we statistically access the possible effects in general also only grassland and cropland in xinjiang were considered at a large regional scale other vegetation types with a smaller area was not considered however the lue of different vegetation to the wind is different in the future the response of more types of vegetation to different wind speeds frequencies and durations is to be studied in a small area 5 conclusions after screening the spatiotemporal features of npp and wind speed in xinjiang the influence factor wind was introduced into the casa model thereby constructing the wcasa model based on remotely sensed meteorological data gosif npp and station measurements the casa model and wcasa model were used to estimate npp during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 the improved wcasa model make the simulation of npp accurately and the optimal model was applied for simulating and predicting npp of grassland and cropland during the growing period april to october of 2022 2050 during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 the overall npp in xinjiang showed a decreasing trend the lowest value of npp was 7 01 gc m2 7month while the highest value was 732 31 gc m2 7month the wind speed showed an overall increasing trend the highest value was 3 80 m s and the lowest value was 0 41 m s compared with the casa model the wcasa model introducing the influence factor wind had higher accuracy in estimating npp r2 rmse rpd and other indicators of the wcasa model were generally better than the corresponding indicators of the casa model under the three future climate change scenarios of ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 npp of grassland during the growth period april to october 2022 2050 in xinjiang shows an upward trend while npp of cropland displays an obvious downward trend credit authorship contribution statement shu song data curation visualization

among all the factors wind also plays a vital role in modeling vegetation productivity however none of the current models have considered the impact of wind on the process of productivity estimation an in depth study was conducted on the temporal and spatial distribution and internal relations between wind speed and npp by introducing the influence factor wind the carnegie ames stanford model casa based on the land surface water index was modified and named as wcasa model the estimation and prediction results of wcasa model considering the influence factor wind were better than that of the casa model the modified wcasa model was applied in xinjiang china the simulation results were improved with the coefficient of determination r2 increased by 9 59 the root mean square error rmse decreased by 13 78 and the residual of prediction deviation rpd improved by 12 08 as compared to casa model the optimal model was used to simulate and predict the npp of cropland and grassland for 2022 2050 under three climate scenarios ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 respectively based on the cmip6 dataset the wcasa model can accurately estimate and predict npp which provides scientific basis for efficient agricultural water use and food production keywords wind influence factor net primary productivity light use efficiency casa model wcasa model xinjiang data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction net primary productivity npp refers to the net accumulation of organic matter by plants in a certain period field et al 1998 as a key component of the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems haberl et al 2007 npp is sensitive to ecosystem health and ecological balance gao et al 2009 therefore quantitatively estimating npp is of great importance for assessing carbon sequestration and ecological behavior and for further understanding changes in ecosystem function as well as structure yu et al 2009 ying et al 2016 after the concept of npp was proposed its calculation methods have gone through three stages site based empirical statistical models allen et al 2010 lieth 1972 lieth and whittaker 1975 osmond et al 2010 sisay et al 2017 uchijima and seino 1985 mechanistic models running et al 2000 parton et al 1993 mcguire et al 1995 running and hunt 1993 and the light use efficiency models potter et al 1993 potter and klooster 1997 cramer et al 1999 among them light use efficiency models are more widely used because they can combine satellite remote sensing data with productivity estimates at large scales using fewer input data roughgarden et al 1991 monteith 1972 1977 developed a model based on absorbed photosynthetically active radiation apar and light use efficiency lue observations to estimate plant productivity lue is the ratio of the energy contained in organic matter produced by photosynthesis per unit area to the solar energy received large scale npp studies require accurate estimates of apar and lue however lue exhibits both spatial differences among vegetation types gower et al 1999 turner et al 2002 and temporal differences at individual sites campbell et al 2001 nouvellon et al 2000 therefore generating valid lue representations is particularly difficult in areas with a large vegetation cover which creates spatial heterogeneity that is not easily captured by remotely sensed reflectance observations environmental factors such as temperature soil moisture and vapor pressure deficit regulate vegetation npp by affecting plant photosynthesis in the models using remote sensing data these factors regulate npp by modulating light use efficiency the calculation of water stress factors in the widely used photosynthetic utilized carnegie ames stanford casa model potter et al 1993 field et al 1995 zhu et al 2007 luo et al 2018 fang et al 2021 is complex and requires a large number of soil parameters which are usually difficult to obtain in larger areas at higher altitudes thus limiting the application of the casa model bao et al 2016 changed the water stress factor in the original casa model to the land surface water index lswi for an accurate estimation of npp in arid zones and obtained better simulation results the wind is an important power source of energy and material exchange in the vegetation atmosphere soil system and one of the basic elements affecting the rate of vegetation assimilation which cannot be ignored in vegetation growth and development cao and zhang 2013 zhang and zhou 2005 under conditions of intense light wind equilibrates the temperature within the vegetation community with the external ambient temperature and accelerates the transpiration of the plants guan 2017 reducing the temperature of the plant surface and avoiding sunburn the wind keeps the air inside the plant community fresh and plays an important role in the regulation of temperature water vapor and co2 among plants cleugh et al 1998 van and grace 1991 it is the driving force of passive water uptake by vegetation which enables the transport of minerals from the soil with water from the roots to the upper part under low wind speed conditions wind thins the sheet flow layer of leaves reduces diffusion resistance and enhances the transport of co2 thus increasing the intensity of photosynthesis zhao et al 2017 however when the wind speed exceeds a certain limit the leaf transpires vigorously the water condition deteriorates and the stomatal opening decreases resulting in a decrease in photosynthesis intensity yu et al 2003 in addition the leaves that are often exposed to wind are shorter and fewer and respiration is enhanced yang 2006 conducted a study on the distribution pattern and influencing factors of natural ventilation wind speed in a daylight greenhouse and found that the airflow movement rate in the greenhouse had a significant effect on the growth and development as well as yield quality of thick skinned melon and at an airflow movement rate of 1 0 m s the stomatal conductance of thick skinned melon increased by 120 3 the leaf area index increased by 63 1 both transpiration rate and the photosynthetic rate increased significantly and the yield increased by 24 4 however the increasing wind speed can also adversely affect the crop which in turn affects the crop yield tang et al 2011 found that the net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance of seedlings decreased significantly with the increasing wind speed and longer blowing time while the transpiration increased zhang et al 2017 found that wind speed was critical to crop growth and there was a strong linear relationship between wind speed and crop yield with a 1 m s increase in the average wind speed during the reproductive period the output of rice and wheat decreased by 14 5 and 13 9 respectively the dry hot wind is a kind of agricultural catastrophic weather with high temperature and low humidity accompanied by wind which usually occurs during the peak crop growth period april to october where high temperature and low humidity lead to physiological drought in crops and wind aggravates the degree of drought huo et al 2019 cgwhwnc 1988 it can cause an imbalance in crop water metabolism and seriously affect various physiological functions of crops leading to significant yield reduction with yield reductions of 5 to 10 in monior disaster year and with yield reductions of 20 to 30 or even more in heavy disaster year it has been shown that at lower wind speeds wind motion changes the light distribution within the canopy increasing canopy productivity by alleviating photosynthetic limitations dupont et al 2018 alexandra et al 2018 kromdijk et al 2016 and improving crop yields yang et al 2014 however increasing wind speed can also adversely affect the photosynthesis of vegetation ennos 1997 tang et al 2011 which in turn reduces productivity wind speed has certain influence on crop productivity zhang et al 2017 but it has not been considered as an influencing factor in the model estimating productivity sun et al 2019 yuan et al 2014 xinjiang has abundant wind energy resources due to its special geographical characteristics wu et al 2020 the effect of wind speed cannot be ignored when estimating vegetation npp wind speed will gradually increase with global warming zhang et al 2017 therefore the wind will also become progressively important in future studies therefore in this study based on the casa model we introduce the wind factor to simulate npp in the xinjiang region and provide a scientific basis for efficient water use and grain production for agriculture in the xinjiang region the main objective of this study is to improve net primary productivity modeling by incorporating the wind and the improved model is then used for climate change assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was carried out at xinjiang see fig 1 which is located in the northwest of china with a total area of 1 66 million km2 between latitude 34 22 49 33 n and longitude 73 41 96 18 e xinjiang is far from the sea deep inland and surrounded by high mountains forming a distinct temperate continental climate the sunshine hours in the region are sufficient 2500 3500 h per year but the temperature varies a lot with the characteristic that the southern border is higher than the northern border the average annual precipitation in xinjiang is about 150 mm the annual precipitation in the mountainous areas of northern xinjiang reaches 500 600 mm while the average annual precipitation in southern xinjiang is only about 10 mm in qiemo and ruoqiang with the least precipitation in china zhang et al 2018 many rivers are formed by the melting snow of the mountain ranges in the region oases are distributed on the edges of the basins accounting for about 5 of the total area gunigimu 2020 xinjiang is extremely rich in wind energy resources accounting for about 20 4 of the total reserves in china wu et al 2020 and the quality of wind energy is quite high the annual average wind speed in northern and eastern xinjiang can exceed 6 m s and the number of hours of effective wind speed can reach 5000 6000 h per year national energy administration 2015 to further study the relationship between wind speed and npp in xinjiang we randomly selected 40 grassland sample grids and 20 cropland sample grids distributed in different latitudes and longitudes as well as different altitudes shown in fig 1 2 2 dataset and data preprocessing precipitation surface temperature surface incident shortwave radiation and wind speed were obtained from china meteorological forcing dataset https data tpdc ac cn en data 8028b944 daaa 4511 8769 965612652c49 the data of sunshine hours were from china meteorological information network https data cma gov cn we selected 64 meteorological stations in xinjiang for the present study by using the ordinary kriging method sunshine hour in xinjiang was spatially interpolated and the mod09a1 dataset from nasa was used to calculate the surface wetness index the land use data mcd12q1 is also from nasa the time period of all the above datasets is 2000 2018 and the spatial resolution is 500 m this study uses the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification system mark 2015 we first evaluated the original casa model in the study area by using the npp data set obtained from chen 2019 which was calculated by the normal casa model then the simulation results of the wcasa model we proposed were further validated by gosif gpp with a spatiotemporal resolution of 0 05 and 8 d provided by li and xiao 2019 different from the common used modis gpp data which involves the calculation procedure of light use efficiency the gosif gpp li et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 li and xiao 2019 li and xiao 2022 is developed based on the global orbiting carbon observatory 2 based sif product gosif and linear relationships between sif solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence and gpp data from eddy covariance ec flux towers all eight sif gpp relationships performed well in estimating gpp globally the ensemble means 8 day gpp was generally highly correlated with flux tower gpp for 91 eddy covariance flux sites across the globe r2 0 74 rmse 1 92 g c m 2 d 1 li et al 2018 xiao et al 2019 li and xiao 2019 li and xiao 2022 based on the annual from 2000 to 2018 and monthly scales of gosif gpp data and the annual scale npp data from 2000 to 2018 provided by national cryosphere desert data center https www ncdc ac cn we obtained the npp data at the monthly scale was used for evaluation in our study zhang et al 2009 collalti and prentice 2019 the future climate data comes from the cmip6 climate model data set the monthly precipitation surface temperature surface incident shortwave radiation and surface wind speed data of the following three climate scenarios ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 were selected for future simulation 2 3 methods 2 3 1 model modification with the wind influence factor the influence of wind on vegetation productivity can be divided into the following two aspects on the one hand wind affects both the physiological and ecological processes of vegetation by changing the temperature water vapor co2 and other factors in the area where the vegetation is located leading to changes in lue thereby changing productivity on the other hand the wind will affect the distribution and gesture of vegetation canopy in lue changes for example exposing previously shaded leaves to sunlight which in turn changes productivity based on the 30 year county level agricultural data in china there is a strong linear relationship between wind and vegetation productivity zhang et al 2017 experiments with the effects of wind speed on crops in a transparent wind tunnel and solar greenhouse in northwest china have shown that wind can promote or inhibit the actual lue of vegetation which depends on the wind speed in the surroundings tang et al 2011 yang 2006 statistically when the wind speed exceeds a certain critical value the lue of vegetation will change from promotion to inhibition the vegetation types in xinjiang include grassland cropland shrubland and woods among others with a relatively large proportion of the area for grassland and cropland therefore this study focuses on grassland and cropland in xinjiang for studying the effect of wind speed on npp this study will introduce the influence factor of wind based on casa to revise the estimation of the actual lue and then calculate npp under the influence of wind speed in xinjiang fig 2 the piecewise fitting model was used to fit the variation of npp with wind speed as shown in lines ab and bc in fig 3 it shows the joint probability distribution of npp and wind speed for grassland and farmland the detailed derivation is shown in the supplementary data in this study the vegetation not affected by wind speed that is the wind speed is 0 m s is set as the reference benchmark and is not affected by wind stress at the same time as the wind speed increases the lue of the vegetation will increase thereby promoting npp when the wind speed increases to a certain value the lue of the vegetation will reduce thereby inhibiting its npp we consider although the wind continues to increase the vegetation may have reached the growth limit the worst case is that the vegetation itself no longer grows and npp no longer changes with the wind speed 1 wind g 0 25 wind g 1 0 wind g 1 0 15 wind g 1 4 1 wind g 6 0 5 else where windg refers to the wind influence factor for grassland which reflects the influence of wind on lue the windg m s is the monthly average wind speed of grassland in each grid during the growth period 2 wind c 0 25 wind c 1 0 wind c 0 8

cropland in each grid during the growth period by combining formula s 2 of the supplementary data and formula 1 and 2 the formula for calculating lue based on casa considering the wind influence factor is obtained as follows 3 Œµ w x t t Œµ 1 x t t Œµ 2 x t w Œµ x t w i n d x t Œµ max using formula s 1 of the supplementary data and formula 3 the formula for calculating npp based on the casa model with the wind influence factor can be obtained as follows 4 n p p x t a p a r x t Œµ w x t from june to july dry hot wind resulting in the physiological drought of crops and significant yield reduction often occurs in xinjiang therefore it is necessary to multiply by a reduction factor of 0 8 when calculating the npp of cropland huo et al 2019 affected by ground friction wind speed may increase with height according to previous studies the wind speed at the height of 2 m is adopted for cropland and the wind speed at the height of 0 15 m is adopted for grassland feng et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 the following formula were used to calculate the wind speed at different heights 10 v 1 v 2 h 1 h 2 Œ± where v1 is the wind speed at the height of h1 v2 is the wind speed at the height of h2 and Œ± is the wind shear index which varies with the height and generally takes 1 7 in the absence of measured wind speed at different heights erik et al 1997 2 3 2 performance evaluation the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse and residual prediction deviation rpd are used to evaluate the accuracy of the model eqs 11 14 janssen and heuberger 1995 the higher the r2 and rpd values the more stable the model the lower the rmse value the higher the accuracy of the model rpd 1 indicates that the model prediction is very poor which is not recommended when 1 rpd 1 4 the model prediction is not good only the highest value can be distinguished 1 4 rpd 1 8 indicates a general model that can be used to evaluate related analysis and 1 8 rpd 2 0 indicates a good model for quantitative estimation in addition 2 0 rpd 2 5 indicates a very good quantitative estimation model and as for rpd 2 5 the model estimation reaches quite excellent gaston et al 2010 11 r 2 i 1 n y

the mann kendall m k method kendall 1975 mann 1945 is employed for investigating the trend of npp this method presents a monotonous trend and does not require independence and normality neeti and eastman 2011 in addition when the sample size is greater than 8 neeti and eastman 2011 the test statistics z meets an approximately normal distribution a negative z value indicates a downward trend and vice versa in addition when Œ± 0 05 the significance of the trend of npp and wind speed was tested in addition the magnitude of change in npp is estimated based on the theil sen median slope which is more suitable for evaluating variable changes in short and noisy time series zhou et al 2016 the calculation of the median slope of m k and theil sen is as follows see gocic and trajkovic 2013 for details 15 s m 1 p 1 n m 1 p s g n x n x m where p is the number of data points xm and xn are the data values of time m and n n m respectively and sgn xn xm is the symbolic function 16 s g n x n x m 1

Œ± 0 05 18 z s 1 var s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 var s i f s 0 in addition the thiel sen median slope is calculated according to formula 19 19 Œ≤ s m e d i a x k x m k m f o r s 1 n where xk and xm are the values of time k and m k m respectively 2 3 4 ndvi and lswi fitting for future projection to predict the changes of npp by wcasa in different future climate scenarios ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 this study establishes a statistical model in each 0 05 0 05 grid unit based on the previous prediction in the studies of fu et al 2018 and roerink et al 2003 with precipitation temperature and radiation data the multiple linear regression model is used to fit ndvi and lswi of grassland and cropland in xinjiang to predict future ndvi and lswi the multiple linear regression model is first established with climate data ndvi and lswi during 2000 2018 and the future projection is then performed with the future climate input the general form of the multiple linear regression model is as follows 20 y i Œ≤ 0 Œ≤ 1 x i 1 Œ≤ 2 x i 2 Œ≤ 3 x i 3 Œº i i 1 2 where yi is the dependent variable xi1 xi2 xi3 are independent variables Œ≤0 Œ≤1 Œ≤2 Œ≤3 refer to regression coefficients Œºi is a random variable 3 results 3 1 spatio temporal patterns of npp and wind speed 3 1 1 spatial distribution of npp and wind speed the spatial distribution and coefficient of variation of npp and wind speed in xinjiang during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 are shown in fig 4 the average npp is higher in the northwest part and lowers in the southeast the kunlun mountain in southern xinjiang has the lowest npp which is 4 23 gc m2 7 month and the highest npp is up to 725 65 gc m2 7 month in the altay region of northern xinjiang fig 4a the wind speed presents a high speed band from northeast to southwest fig 4b the highest value of 3 92 m s appears at the junction of urumqi hami and turpan and the lowest value of 0 37 m s appears in the kashgar area of southern xinjiang the coefficient of variation is larger where the average npp is larger in most areas the coefficient of variation of npp is less than 1 fig 4c the spatial pattern of the wind speed coefficient of variation fig 4d is opposite to the spatial pattern of its mean value the mean value of wind speed is higher and the coefficient of variation is lower the coefficient of variation in xinjiang is less than 0 33 the coefficient of variation of npp is greater than that of variation of wind speed during the growing period april to october it is also larger where its mean npp value is larger however the coefficient of variation of npp is small when the mean wind speed is large the reason may be related to the large variability of npp and the small variability in wind speed during the growing period 3 1 2 trend of npp and wind speed the trend of npp and wind speed in xinjiang is shown in fig 5 during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 npp showed an upward trend for 47 26 area fig 5a mainly distributed in changji autonomous prefecture urumqi and southern karamay geographically 11 79 of all npp showed a significant increasing trend p 0 05 and 12 16 showed a significant decreasing trend the wind speed has an upward trend for 53 49 area fig 5b which is mainly distributed in the altay area tacheng area eastern hami and western tarim basin 5 06 of the wind data have a significant upward trend p 0 05 and 3 79 of the wind data show a significant downward trend p 0 05 3 1 3 spatial distribution of wind influence factor as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b the mean values of the two wind influence factors differ slightly the regions with low wind influence factors almost coincide with the regions with high mean wind speed distribution this is consistent with our research hypothesis it is shown that the wind speed in the northwest of xinjiang is more conducive to npp growth from fig 6c and fig 6d the variation range of windc is smaller than that of windg which may be related to the selection of inflection points of wind influence factors the inflection point of windc 0 8 m s is smaller than that of windg 1 0 m s this means that the maximum wind impact factor of windg is higher than that of windc the coefficient of variation of windg was generally greater than that of windc 3 2 simulation of npp by wcasa model to examine the model performance of the casa model and wcasa model the gosif gpp li and xiao 2019 is employed to validate the simulation results the ratio of annual npp data from 2000 to 2018 to annual gosif gpp data from 2000 to 2018 zhang et al 2009 collalti and prentice 2019 was then multiplied by monthly gosif gpp data to calculate monthly npp data the generated data based on the gosif gpp li and xiao 2019 is used for evaluation in our study as shown in fig 7 the distribution of the annual averaged ratio of net primary productivity to gross primary productivity npp gpp from 2000 to 2018 in xinjiang shows that the high value mainly concentrates in the north xinjiang and low in the south xinjiang about 53 of npp gpp is between 0 4 and 0 5 17 is between 0 3 and 0 4 and only 11 is between 0 5 and 0 6 for different vegetation types for the studied area different sets of wind speed parameter values are used in wcasa windg is used for npp of grassland and windc is used for cropland the maximum light use efficiency Œµmax in casa and wcasa models were calibrated from 2000 to 2009 and validated from 2001 to 2018 using actual npp the precipitation radiation sunshine hours temperature lswi and ndvi data were the basic forcing data for the casa model calculating the npp as for the wcasa model in addition to the above data wind speed data is also required as a key factor to improve the accuracy of simulated npp the grassland and cropland in xinjiang were selected for the calculation of the npp value the model evaluation results are shown in table s1 in addition we made cross validation between npp calculated by the casa model in this study and that calculated by chen 2019 and the results show that the two sets of data are highly consistent with an average absolute error of 6 13 model calibration and validation on net primary productivity npp simulation for grassland cropland are listed in table s1 of the supplementary data it can be observed that for grassland r2 rmse and rpd of the wcasa model were better compared with the casa model in both calibration and validation periods the wcasa model has better fitting effects accuracy and prediction accuracy for the cropland r2 rmse and rpd of the wcasa model were better than the casa model during the calibration period during the validation period the r2 and rpd of the wcasa model improved the fitting effect of cropland is better than that of grassland which helps to predict agricultural production for the same period r2 has increased by 9 59 rmse has decreased by 13 78 and rpd has increased by 12 08 the wcasa model has a better simulation result on npp for cropland compared to that of grassland this can be attributed to the fact that xinjiang has a wide variety of grassland covering a large area with a wide distribution range as xinjiang is more prone to extreme climates which makes it difficult to simulate accurately during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 the absolute difference between the actual npp and the simulated npp of grassland fig 8 a and cropland fig 8b for casa and wcasa models showed variations in the following the absolute difference between the actual npp and the simulated npp is referred to as Œ¥npp fig 8 shows the difference between the casa and wcasa models for the simulated npp and the actual npp in grassland and cropland during the study period the npp of casa and wcasa models varied greatly from july to august as for grassland fig 8a the multi annual average Œ¥npp of the casa model from may to september 9 67 gc m2 month was larger than that of the wcasa model 8 20 gc m2 month the maximum Œ¥npp of the casa model 19 66 gc m2 month was also higher than that of the wcasa model 16 85 gc m2 month as for cropland according to fig 8b the average Œ¥npp of the casa model from june to september 17 13 gc m2 month is larger than that of the wcasa model 14 72 gc m2 month the maximum value of Œ¥npp of the casa model 34 52 gc m2 month was also higher than that of the wcasa model 31 34 gc m2 month the Œ¥npp of the wcasa model is small and the simulation effect is good in both grassland and arable land the Œ¥npp changes less in april and october which may be due to the smaller npp values in these two months we refer to the value of npp minus the actual npp simulated by the wcasa model as Œ¥nppwcasa and the value of npp minus the actual npp simulated by the casa model as Œ¥nppcasa Œ¥nppwcasa is more uniformly distributed in space fig 9 a this indicates that the npp simulated by the wcasa model is closer to the distribution of the real npp in the spatial simulation the casa model overestimates npp near yining and underestimates npp near altai changji and hami fig 9b 3 3 changes in the spatial and temporal pattern of npp under future climate change scenarios in xinjiang the improved wcasa model is used for the effective npp projection during future time the future ndvi lswi is required for running the model to this end the period of 2000 2009 is selected as the calibration period and the period of 2010 2018 as the validation period to fit the ndvi lswi of grassland and cropland in xinjiang fig 10 it can be seen from fig 10 that for both calibration and validation period r2 of ndvi for grassland is 0 93 and rmse is 0 019 r2 reaches 0 54 and the rmse is limited to 0 023 for grassland lswi fitting during the validation period the r2 of lswi for grassland is 0 53 and rmse is 0 021 the fitting effect of ndvi and lswi for cropland is as followed r2 is greater than 0 91 and rmse is no more than 0 033 in both the calibration period and the validation period therefore it is feasible to fit and predict ndvi and lswi based on precipitation temperature and radiation data as shown in figs s2 and s3 of the supplementary data under the three future climate change scenarios the npp of grassland during the growing period april to october of 2022 2050 in xinjiang shows an upward trend compared with npp during the growing period from 2000 to 2018 while npp of cropland shows an obvious downward trend the rate of npp growth in grasslands gradually decreases as the future climate change scenario changes from ssp126 to ssp585 under the ssp126 scenario grassland grows at a rate of 0 79 gc m2 7 month whose npp can reach 240 306 gc m2 7 month during the growth period of 2022 2050 under ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios the growth rate of grassland is 0 44 gc m2 7 month and 0 39 gc m2 7 month respectively of which npp can reach 230 294 gc m2 7 month and 229 286 gc m2 7 month during the growing period of 2022 2050 during the growing period of 2022 2050 the relationship between the rate of decrease in npp of cropland is as follows ssp126 ssp585 ssp245 under the ssp126 scenario the npp of cropland decreases at a rate of 3 01 gc m2 7 month which can reach 247 344 gc m2 7 month during the growing period of 2022 2050 under the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios the growth rate of npp in cropland is 2 40 gc m2 7 month and 2 64 gc m2 7 month respectively which can reach 256 355 gc m2 7 month and 262 344 gc m2 7 month during the growing period of 2022 2050 4 discussion while using the model to estimate npp all input data needs to be resampled to the same scale in the process of resampling points with different values and different vegetation types may be mixed at the same point for example a pixel may include several types of vegetation with complex surface reflectivity at a special resolution of 500 m 500 m which will reduce the simulation accuracy of the model to a certain extent relevant studies have also shown that the casa model has a good application effect in xinjiang zhang et al 2020 r2 of the improved casa model in the study is better than previous results bao et al 2016 yu et al 2009 indicating that the improved wcasa model is more suitable for a place like xinjiang the relationship between three influence factors was determined according to the distribution of wind speed and npp of grassland and cropland in xinjiang so that the wind speed for reaching the maximum npp can be determined and r2 of the wcasa model compared with the casa model was also improved the time lag of relevant meteorological factors was not considered luo et al 2018 and if the wind blows for a long time the vegetation leaves may be smaller than those without wind onoda and anten 2011 all of these need further study due to the limitations of experimental conditions measurements were not made in xinjiang for the impact of wind on npp and gpp the study is performed based on the statistical data through literature 30 year county level agricultural data in china and relevant experimental data effects of wind speed on crops in transparent wind tunnels and solar greenhouse in northwest china in the future we will experimentally divide the wind influence factor into more detailed components for example the changes in vegetation physiological and ecological processes temperature water vapor co2 and other factors caused by wind speed could be assigned into temperature stress and water stress quantitatively and the part of the effects from the changes in distribution and gesture of vegetation canopy caused by wind speed could be incorporated into apar fluctuation for the current stage we statistically access the possible effects in general also only grassland and cropland in xinjiang were considered at a large regional scale other vegetation types with a smaller area was not considered however the lue of different vegetation to the wind is different in the future the response of more types of vegetation to different wind speeds frequencies and durations is to be studied in a small area 5 conclusions after screening the spatiotemporal features of npp and wind speed in xinjiang the influence factor wind was introduced into the casa model thereby constructing the wcasa model based on remotely sensed meteorological data gosif npp and station measurements the casa model and wcasa model were used to estimate npp during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 the improved wcasa model make the simulation of npp accurately and the optimal model was applied for simulating and predicting npp of grassland and cropland during the growing period april to october of 2022 2050 during the growing period april to october of 2000 2018 the overall npp in xinjiang showed a decreasing trend the lowest value of npp was 7 01 gc m2 7month while the highest value was 732 31 gc m2 7month the wind speed showed an overall increasing trend the highest value was 3 80 m s and the lowest value was 0 41 m s compared with the casa model the wcasa model introducing the influence factor wind had higher accuracy in estimating npp r2 rmse rpd and other indicators of the wcasa model were generally better than the corresponding indicators of the casa model under the three future climate change scenarios of ssp126 ssp245 and ssp585 npp of grassland during the growth period april to october 2022 2050 in xinjiang shows an upward trend while npp of cropland displays an obvious downward trend credit authorship contribution statement shu song data curation visualization
