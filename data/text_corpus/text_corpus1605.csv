8025,study region the el kharga oasis in the western desert of egypt is selected as the study area due to its hyberarid climate condition and water scarcity in this region the fossil groundwater is the main water source therefore preserving groundwater quality and quantity is mandatory study focus this study evaluated groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes and assessed the water requirements of cultivated crops to optimize the water supply in hyperarid climate regions in total 79 deep groundwater samples were hydrochemically tested to determine the suitability for irrigation by assessing the key water quality parameters spatial distribution maps of all chemical parameters such as ph ec sar rsc ssp tds total hardness na k ca mg fe mn cl and so4 were developed the fao cropwat 8 0 model based on the penman monteith equation was used to forecast agricultural water requirements for three years 2010 2011 and 2012 new hydrological insights for the region the groundwater had medium salinity and low sodium in 84 of the cases in comparison high salinity was found in 16 of the samples indicating that groundwater can be used for many soil types with a low risk of exchangeable sodium except for 15 of the 79 wells all groundwater samples had chloride concentrations less than 100 mg l the sulfate ion distribution map showed a low sulfate ion content in the extreme western south the total annual irrigation water requirements of all crops for 2010 2011 and 2012 were 199 4 215 1 and 231 7 million m3 year respectively reflecting a gradual increase of approximately 16 57 million m3 total area year due to the expansion of the cultivated area the analysis showed that modern irrigation systems reduced the amount of irrigation water by 32 and increased the cultivated area by 45 compared to conventional irrigation methods severe groundwater depletion occurred during the dry season from march to july which exacerbated the water stress in the study region the results confirmed that the region is under water stress accordingly water conservation is urgently recommended graphical abstract ga1 keywords crop water requirement water quality cultivated crops fao cropwat spatial distribution maps el kharga oasis 1 introduction concerns about combining water saving technologies and the hydrochemical features of groundwater quality and quantity have arisen because of growing water demand and global scarcity issues owing to the lack of freshwater resources in egypt s el kharga oasis there is a significant demand for the use of advanced and innovative water resource management techniques and technologies in the agricultural sector which is egypt s largest water user the agricultural sector accounts for more than 86 8 of the total water use in egypt fao 2005 and more than 90 of the total water use in the study area el kharga is one of egypt s most important oases it is a hyperarid location with hot dry weather in the western desert and it is part of the saharan nubian aquifer jahin and gaber 2011 with increasing acreage of crop growth and low water use efficiency there is a high demand for new and advanced water resource management techniques as the agricultural sector develops al amoud et al 2012 this demand may be met by calculating the region s agricultural irrigation water demand and evaluating the temporal features of irrigation water demand and cultivated areas under other irrigation water management scenarios this research is critical to enhance water management for sustainable and long term use there is a crucial need for groundwater quantity quality and sustainability studies for irrigation and drinking purposes gameh et al 2014 especially in developing countries which suffer from inconsistent information on irrigation water use a few analyses have been carried out in el kharga to determine water quantity quality and sustainability for irrigation drinking purposes and water requirements for only a few individual crops which is a barrier for assessing the whole water management system groundwater assessment for drinking and irrigation has become necessary for present and future groundwater quality management gabr et al 2021 mehrazar et al 2020 sobeih et al 2017 the quality of groundwater is nearly as important as its quantity groundwater quality must be evaluated before it can be exploited appropriately and sustained todd and mays 2004 chemical analysis of water samples from different locations in a study area will provide a clear vision of the chemistry of irrigation water sadashivaiah et al 2008 the chemical composition of groundwater is influenced by various factors including rainfall quality and quantity rock type permeability leakage or recharge and land use groundwater hydrochemistry is influenced by a variety of hydrochemical processes to maintain equilibrium between rock and water interactions as well as the mixing of various fluids hydrochemistry research comprises a description of the components of groundwater and their interactions all types of groundwater include some dissolved ions and are never totally pure more than 90 of the dissolved solids in groundwater are accounted for by seven ions mainly cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl and so4 2 the lithology velocity and volume of groundwater flow type of geochemical processes salt solubility and human activities are all variables that impact the concentration of dissolved ions in groundwater bhatt and saklani 1996 karanth 1987 numerous studies have been conducted in different parts of the world to examine the suitability of groundwater for various uses using a variety of methodologies e g berhe 2020 gauns et al 2020 singh et al 2020 many researchers have evaluated groundwater in different regions in egypt for example ismail et al 2017 ismaila et al 2020 ismail and el rawy 2018 el rawy et al 2019 geriesh et al 2019 gabr et al 2021 the overuse of groundwater for agricultural purposes has resulted in a considerable drop in the water table during the previous two decades necessitating an immediate and effective management plan moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 due to high consumption rates and overexploitation the groundwater level in the northern half of the kharga oasis declined from 60 to 80 m below the earth and from 40 to 60 m in the southern part between 1967 and 2007 mekkawi et al 2017 additionally the number of deep wells increased to 350 during the ten year period from 2003 to 2013 and the reservoir water level dropped by more than 90 m dept of water resources in kharga personal communication it is challenging to meet crops full water requirements to sustain optimum growth and yield in dry and semiarid locations consequently determining ways to preserve optimal agricultural yields during water shortages is important this challenge has prompted researchers to seek novel irrigation technologies methods and strategies to increase water efficiency hamdy et al 2003 one of the most promising approaches for improving irrigation efficiency is controlled deficit irrigation systems a second technique involves using modern irrigation systems which enhance plant water application efficiency determining the water consumption of field crops in egypt s dry environment under various irrigation systems may aid in the irrigation management of vital crops phene et al 1993 moreover irrigation systems are a critical component in reducing water losses and increasing agricultural output productivity to satisfy future increases in food demand however to realize its full potential the irrigation sector must be revived by implementing novel management practices and changing its control kawy and abou el magd 2013 kawy and darwish 2014 the fao recommends the penman monteith equation for estimating crop water requirements because it is a simple equation with a reliable physical basis ground observation data of the cropping pattern area crop coefficient approach and irrigation efficiency were integrated using the penman monteith equation to predict irrigation water demand and crop water requirements for three consecutive years 2010 2011 and 2012 cropwat 8 0 is a decision support tool developed by the fao s land and water development division and all calculation procedures are based on two fao publications doorenbos and kassam 1979 allen et al 1998 it is a software tool that calculates agricultural water needs this research will establish the validity of available irrigation water and how much irrigation water management may assist in maintaining such a target region s limited water resources enabling the future expansion of agricultural regions this research was conducted to determine the suitability of water for irrigation purposes temporal distributions of agricultural water requirements in the target area the amount of annual irrigation and monthly variation in irrigation water requirements based on three years of data our investigation also determined the efficiency of other scenarios for water conservation and addressed the future increase in food demand kawy and abou el magd 2013 to fulfill the demand of an increasing population allen et al 2005 the present study attempted to obtain a comprehensive understanding of groundwater hydrochemical development and assess the water quality conditions for irrigation based on detailed groundwater monitoring wells in addition it aimed to evaluate the spatiotemporal variation in reference and crop evapotranspiration of all cropping patterns and the trend of cultivation areas for both the applied and proposed irrigation systems during the study period our study marks the first time that an integrated study combining hydrochemical evaluation for water quality and crop water requirements of cultivated crops was conducted in this region to conserve precious water resources and assess the groundwater s quality and or appropriateness for irrigation this research is critical in helping to enhance water management for long term use 2 the study area el kharga is located in the new valley governate in the western desert of egypt between latitudes 24 00 and 26 00 n and longitudes 30 15 and 30 45 e fig 1 it consists of a depression approximately 2000 km long that spans 20 885 km wide its area is approximately 12 250 km2 it is one of the significant oases in egypt a hyperarid region with hot dry weather it is the driest spot in the western desert and is arguably the driest spot on the planet salman et al 2010 the new valley governate receives less than 2 mm year of rainfall therefore agriculture depends mainly on groundwater kuper and kröpelin 2006 locally the el kharga oasis receives less than 0 1 mm year of precipitation and lacks naturally occurring surface water so groundwater is the only water resource younis et al 2016 despite high temperatures and significant evaporation rates agriculture is essential for growth and accounts for a portion of the main saharan nubian aquifer it is fully contained inside the nubian sandstone aquifer system and covers the northern part of the eastern sahara this oasis known to ancient egyptians as the southern oasis is the current capital of the new valley government and is the largest of egypt s oases in the western desert as shown in fig 1 due to water availability the kharga oases have been a magnet for humans since prehistoric times as evidenced by the presence of hundreds of natural artesian springs as well as the fertile soil represented by the deposits of the springs and the playa sediments dry paleolake deposits bravard et al 2016 however since the beginning of the new valley project for agricultural reclamation in the 1950s the nubian sandstone aquifer has become depleted as many wells were drilled and water was extracted industrially therefore for the present study we focused on the area located in the northern part of the kharga depression between 25 00 and 25 45 n where most agricultural lands are located fig 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis water samples from 79 wells were collected from 2010 to 2012 with 500 ml polyethylene bottles before sampling the bottles were carefully cleaned two to three times with the groundwater obtained after being cleaned with deionized water and distilled water the samples were collected only from continuously exploited wells chemical analyses of groundwater samples were performed to calculate the power of hydrogen ph conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and total hardness th a ph meter was used to determine the ph and the ec was measured in ds m 1 using an ec meter at 25 c the gravimetric technique was used to determine tds concentration hussein and magram 2012 spectrophotometric methods were used to quantify the content of sulfate so4 2 american public health association 1998 whereas volumetric titration methods were used to estimate the concentrations of bicarbonate hco3 calcium ca and magnesium mg and chloride cl concentrations maiti 2004 a flame photometer was used to evaluate the soluble na and k concentrations and atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to assess the concentrations of trace elements such as fe and mn hasanien et al 2010 sayed 2013 the locations of the groundwater samples are shown in fig 1 surfer 12 golden software llc https www goldensoftware com was used to produce a geographical distribution map of groundwater quality the spatial interpolation scheme and visualization of the results were performed with surfer using the kriging interpolation scheme piper trilinear diagrams piper 1944 were used to compare the findings of chemical tests of groundwater using aquachem v 2014 1 software waterloo hydrogeologic https www waterloohydrogeologic com to understand the hydrochemical facies 3 2 groundwater origin and classification piper trilinear diagrams piper 1944 are made up of three distinct fields with two triangles on the lower right and the left sides of a diamond shaped field in the middle the major cations na k ca2 and mg2 are displayed in the bottom left triangle while the major anions so4 2 co3 2 hco3 and cl are represented in the lower right triangle jahin and gaber 2011 the final water type is determined by plotting the two points indicating the diamond shaped portion s principal cation and anion compositions based on the ionic composition of distinct water samples piper diagrams provide a straightforward way to identify water types obtained from various groundwater resources al omran et al 2013 aly et al 2015 3 3 suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes the following are the key characteristics of groundwater that influence its suitability for irrigation 3 3 1 salinity hazard in general the total soluble salt content of irrigation water is determined by measuring its ec based on the flow of an electrical current through the sample 3 3 2 alkali hazard the sodium adsorption ratio sar indicates the alkali hazard sar is a metric used to calculate the sodium toxicity of irrigation water a high sar value implies that salt in water can replace calcium and magnesium ions in the soil causing structural damage lloyd and heathcote 1985 eq 1 defines the sar metric richards 1969 1 sar na ca mg 2 where all concentrations of na ca and mg are in meq l 3 3 3 sodium percentage the sodium content in irrigation water is also reported as a percentage of sodium or as a percentage of soluble sodium apart from directly impacting plant development salts also affect soil structure permeability and aeration all of which indirectly impact plant growth singh et al 2008 na is calculated using equation eq 2 2 na na k ca mg na k where all concentrations of na k ca and mg are in meq l 3 3 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc the rsc was computed to assess the effects of carbonate and bicarbonate on water quality for agricultural use aghazadeh and mogaddam 2010 in irrigated agriculture rsc is employed as a measure of the anticipated residual carbonate in irrigation water it is computed by subtracting the soluble calcium and magnesium values from the values of soluble carbonate and bicarbonate in milliliters it can be computed using equation eq 3 eaton 1950 3 rsc hco 3 co 3 ca mg where all concentrations of na ca and mg are in meq l 3 4 crop water requirements even though there are numerous techniques for calculating crop and irrigation water requirements the fao recommends the penman monteith approach it is a simple equation coupled with ground observation data on the cropping pattern area crop coefficient approach and irrigation efficiency to predict irrigation water demand and crop water requirements for three consecutive years 2010 2011 and 2012 which offer the most recent available data the required data were collected and processed as follows a climatological and effective rainfall data were obtained from the egyptian meteorological authority egyptian ministry of agriculture 2012 for the el kharga oasis which include monthly minimum and maximum temperatures humidity wind speed average sunshine duration and effective rainfall per month b crop data and cropping patterns were provided by the egyptian ministry of agriculture 2012 for three successive years 2010 2011 and 2012 the tables include detailed data about each crop s cultivated areas in fadden for each year the data are classified into two seasons winter and summer with subtotals of three categories crops vegetables and trees perennial c the cropping calendar contains the dates of planting sow transplanting and harvesting end growth which differed significantly among areas the calendar was initially established based on egyptian ministry of agriculture 2012 for the district of upper egypt to which el kharga meteorologically belonged and was based on a field survey conducted by agricultural research center staff members and public farmers in el kharga d the length of the growth stages and single crop coefficient were reviewed using many sources to set the actual length of the growth stages of each crop the primary source was doorenbos 1977 based on allen et al 1994 however nonexistent crop coefficients such as that for okra were recorded according to doorenbos j 1977 the crop coefficient for date palm was calculated according to an actual field study by kassem 2007 which provided monthly crop coefficient kc values for 2004 from which the average kc during the three stages was calculated table 1 shows the average kc of date palm for different growth stages kassem 2007 e fao cropwat 8 0 was used to process data on water amounts utilized for agricultural reasons to compute crop evapotranspiration crop water needs and irrigation water requirements from existing or new climatic and crop data based on irrigation efficiency all calculation procedures used in cropwat 8 0 are based on the fao guidelines established in allen et al 1998 f reference evapotranspiration eto was estimated from meteorological data aerodynamic and surface resistance according to fao penman

evapotranspiration etc to account for the influence of crop features on crop requirements crop coefficients generated from crop phenomenology phases may be successfully coupled to estimate crop water requirements cwr combining crop coefficients with the crop pattern of the target region provides an individual calculation of each crop s water requirements the efficiency of numerous irrigation techniques is then calculated to offer a realistic evaluation of overall agricultural water use on an annual time scale the crop coefficient kc value is related to the evapotranspiration of a disease

etc eto kc b the irrigation water requirement iwr was calculated from eq 6 where iwr irrigation water requirement etc crop evapotranspiration and ie field irrigation efficiency of the irrigation system according to jensen 1980 irrigation efficiencies for sprinkler and drip irrigation systems are 75 and 90 respectively however the irrigation efficiency of submerged crops such as rice is approximately 50 dastane 1972 doorenbos 1977 and the surface irrigation efficiency is approximately 55 according to egyptian ministry of irrigation and water resources standards khedr et al 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogen ion concentration ph the ph values of the analyzed samples in the investigated area varied from 6 05 to 8 84 consistent with the findings of gameh et al 2014 jahin and gaber 2011 revealing that the groundwater samples were slightly acidic to alkaline and that no apparent setup could control these values fig 2a in most cases samples that exceed the maximum permitted level for irrigation purposes have no direct effect who 2008 4 2 electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds the ec values ranged between 310 μs cm and 1400 μs cm in the study region the ec distribution map of the study area fig 2b shows that ec increases eastward of kharga and to the west of both genah and bulaq relatively low salinity contents ranging from 200 mg l to 500 mg l were recorded in the majority of production wells a few samples located in the eastern part of sherka and in the western part of bulaq had evaluated salinity contents ranging from 500 to 896 mg l this result agrees with that presented by jahin and gaber 2011 however some groundwater samples high conductivity from 1060 to 1400 μs cm matched the highest concentrations of dominant ions due to the deterioration in water quality higher ec fluctuations might be linked to the research region s human activities and geochemical processes generally our data show no problems resulting from salinity total dissolved solids indicate the general state of groundwater quality and pollution levels munro and travis 1986 robinove et al 1958 the tds value ranged from 198 4 mg l to 896 mg l the tds levels increased east of sherka and west of bulaq according to the distribution map in fig 2c increased dissolved solids in irrigation water impact soil efficiency plant growth and yield salinization occurs when the amount of salts in the soil increases as the salinity of the water rises the quantity of salts that plants absorb is governed mostly by the soil and plant types and the ease with which water can be drained the tds content of the groundwater samples in the study region showed that groundwater may be used for irrigation without problems as the tds levels in all samples were less than 1000 mg l 4 3 total hardness th total hardness is an essential characteristic that indicates the quality of groundwater and is defined as the sum of calcium and magnesium cation concentrations reported in mg l who 1996 the total hardness of the water samples collected in the research region ranged from 57 mg caco3 l to 406 mg caco3 l th was high only in the western portion of bulaq as shown in fig 2d the high value for th may be due to the presence of alkaline soil such as calcium and magnesium 4 4 spatial distribution of major ions 4 4 1 analysis of cations calcium is found naturally in water and most rocks and it is easily dissolved in various forms in water it is the most prevalent alkaline earth metal and may be found in a wide variety of common rock minerals the calcium concentration ranged between 10 25 mg l and 61 47 mg l as indicated on the distribution map of the calcium ions fig 3a with the lowest values found in the southwestern part of the study area this result generally agrees with the finding of jahin and gaber 2011 calcium rich minerals include calcite aragonite dolomite gypsum anhydrite fluorite plagioclase pyroxene and amphibole skinner and porter 2006 magnesium is also one of the common elements in rocks water becomes harder as a result of magnesium the magnesium concentration ranged between 4 86 mg l and 60 76 mg l the magnesium ion distribution map fig 3b shows that the lowest levels were observed in the middle of the study area this result differed from the finding of jahin and gaber 2011 the higher levels discovered may be due to the collapse of the limestone plateau which contains magnesium bearing rocks such as dolomite ca mg co3 2 sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the earth s crust the source of sodium in groundwater depends on the type of rock that the water passes through the sodium concentrations in the groundwater of the investigated area ranged from 14 25 mg l to 163 45 mg l the majority of the wells surveyed had modest levels of soluble sodium fig 3c with significant quantities in the east notably in el kharga high concentrations of sodium 170 mg l may affect people with heart problems hypertension and certain other medical disorders in addition sodium may be detrimental to certain irrigated crops but our findings indicate that sodium is not a concern the potassium concentration in the research region was low in all sampled wells except in the extreme southwestern region where it ranged from 13 29 mg l to 46 92 mg l fig 3d in groundwater ionic potassium is found in relatively low quantities as potassium minerals resist weathering and dissolution sravanthi and sudarshan 1998 4 4 2 analysis of anions chloride is the most common major anion and is found in all types of water it is a useful indicator of groundwater quality chloride is a key criterion for irrigation water since it is essential for plants and animals its concentration in natural groundwater is commonly less than 100 mg l unless the water is brackish or saline fetter et al 1999 the chloride content of groundwater samples in the study region ranged from 31 91 mg l to 167 5 mg l fig 3e except for 15 of the 79 samples wells all groundwater samples had chloride concentrations less than 100 mg l a high chloride content has a negative impact on taste and can cause corrosion a considerable quantity of chloride can accumulate in leaves causing the leaves to dry up jahin and gaber 2011 chloride levels are low in ancient agricultural fields where surface water infiltration and dilution occur and on the other hand chloride in soil irrigated for a long time by water with higher chloride contents in areas with extreme evaporation and no precipitation the majority of chloride in groundwater comes from four different sources ancient sea water trapped in sediments solutions of halite and related minerals in evaporated deposits concentration by the evaporation of chlorides contributed by precipitation and solutions of dry fallout from the atmosphere particularly in arid regions daviest and dewiest 1966 the decomposition of carbonate minerals such as calcite caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 produces the bulk of bicarbonate ions in groundwater the bicarbonate content ranged between 12 2 mg l and 308 15 mg l in the study area this composition diverged from the findings presented by jahin and gaber 2011 who showed that bicarbonate levels ranged from 78 mg l in boulaq to 282 3 mg l in ei mounira the minimum value was recorded in the western and southern parts of the study area but the maximum value especially in the eastern zone was found to result from the dissolution of carbonate rocks fig 3f bicarbonate ions in groundwater are generated by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere soils and the breakdown of carbonate rock daviest and dewiest 1966 the high concentration of hco3 in this aquifer suggests active chemical weathering processes natural activities such as the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the release of co2 gas from the soil might be a source of hco3 in quaternary aquifer groundwater the major sources of sulfate in natural groundwater are gypsum and anhydrite the sulfate content in ordinary groundwater is generally less than 300 mg l the sulfate levels in the study area ranged from 19 21 mg l to 992 3 mg l contradicting the conclusions of jahin and gaber 2011 the sulfate ion distribution map fig 3g shows that the area s low sulfate ion content was found in the extreme southwest higher sulfate levels in wells on newly reclaimed land could be due to gypsum and potassium sulfates being transferred into the soil as fertilizers dissolved 4 5 distribution of minor elements 4 5 1 iron the amount of iron in the groundwater in the study area ranged between 0 42 and 3 98 mg l the results show a steady rise in iron content in the western parts of the research area as shown in fig 4a a high concentration of iron is produced by the dissolution of iron bearing deposits rich in minerals the ph of groundwater is important because it influences the solubility and biological availability of iron once it has dissolved the ph levels of groundwater samples are plotted in fig 2a which shows that the ph ranged from 6 05 to 8 84 these findings are similar to those of sayed 2013 who utilized 34 groundwater samples in the same research region to create a kriged 3d surface and contour map of iron distribution the iron and ph value relationship shows that the iron concentration increases as the ph value decreases a ph below 6 05 encourages the formation of iron deposits in solution which can lead to corrosion when the ph is higher than 8 5 scaling and encrustation are more likely to develop if other ions such as calcium or carbonate are present they produce a variety of precipitates that mix with the iron hydroxide precipitates forming a crusty gnarled layer that is difficult to remove the ph values ranged from 6 5 to 8 84 creating a suitable environment for the growth of iron bacteria in a well or water system during drilling repair or maintenance gad et al 2016 once a well is highly infected the removal of iron bacteria may be exceedingly difficult wilson et al 1999 bacteria convert soluble ferrous iron into insoluble ferric iron the formation of ochre and bacterial slimes which can clog well intake screens as well as drip irrigation system filters laterals and emitters 4 5 2 manganese manganese is similar to iron in terms of chemical behavior and natural water occurrence as shown in fig 4b the manganese concentration of the groundwater in the investigated region ranged from 0 to 0 46 mg l with higher concentrations in the south and west minor element levels f cu mn zn cd and pb in the groundwater samples were all within permissible limits 4 6 ion dominance and water types ions in the groundwater samples are ranked in appendix table a1 according to schoeller s 1962 semilogarithmic graphs the following ranking was found in the majority of the water samples na ca mg hco3 so4 cl na ca mg so4 hco3 cl and na ca mg hco3 cl so4 in the majority of the samples higher sodium levels relative to calcium and magnesium as cations and higher bicarbonate levels relative to sulfate and chloride as anions reflect the dominance of sodium bicarbonate in sodium sulfate and sodium chloride water types this outcome is not the same as that reported in abdelhafez et al 2021 whose research areas included el kharga baris and el dakhla in their study sulfate was the primary anion whereas ca was the main cation the highest concentrations of ca were found in el dakhla while the lowest concentrations were found in el kharga this distribution indicates that carbonate sulfate and chloride minerals in aquifer media are actively leached and dissolved however our results are comparable to the findings presented by gad et al 2016 4 7 groundwater origin and classification piper diagrams were used to illustrate the findings of the examined samples fig 5 in the majority of samples alkali ions na and k predominated over alkaline earth ions ca2 and mg2 while strong acids cl and so4 2 predominated over weak acids co3 2 hco3 as demonstrated in appendix table a2 only a few samples exhibited the opposite behavior with alkaline earth ca2 and mg2 exceeding alkali na and k ions and weak acids co3 2 hco3 exceeding strong acids cl and so4 2 according to the chemical data the water type in the region fluctuated mostly between na hc03 and na cl piper diagram according to the cation distribution the samples ranged in composition from sodium potassium to mostly mixed cations jahin and gaber 2011 magnesium cations were present in a small fraction of the groundwater samples 4 8 quality assessment for irrigation purposes 4 8 1 salinity hazard the conductivity levels ranged between 310 and 1400 s cm water with an ec of less than 750 s cm is appropriate for irrigation in terms of the salt content staff 1954 ec is a good predictor of crop salinity hazards excessive salinity reduces osmotic activity in plants preventing them from absorbing water and nutrients from the soil saleh et al 1999 under normal conditions 15 of the 79 samples had a high salt content making them unsuitable for irrigation as shown in appendix table a3 the leaching and dissolution of marine sediments with fresh water either from irrigation rain or vertical upward flows from the underlying aquifers dictated salinity changes 4 8 2 alkali hazard the frequency of elevated sar in 79 groundwater samples as well as the appropriateness of the groundwater for irrigation was examined as seen in fig 6 the lowest sar value was 0 40 and the highest was 8 50 according to fao recommendations the sampled groundwater wells posed no sodium risk to irrigated land and can be used to irrigate any crop including those that are sodium sensitive such as citrus the distribution map of sar meq l for groundwater wells in the study area is shown in fig 7 staff 1954 developed a technique for categorizing irrigation water to demonstrate the link between sar and ec as indicated in appendix table a4 the el kharga oasis water samples were classified as medium high or extremely high salinity hazards the majority of the groundwater samples had salinity hazards ranging from medium c2 to high c3 sar was classified into four categories low less than 10 medium 10 18 meq l high 18 26 meq l and very high more than 26 meq l all of the samples were in the 1 1 5 29 range therefore the estimated sar values in the study region were classified as low these findings are in line with those presented by yousefi et al 2018 consequently 64 out of 79 samples 81 were classified as the c2s1 group suggesting a medium salinity low sodium groundwater type the remaining 15 samples were classified as c3s1 high salinity low sodium accounting for 19 of the total in most situations groundwater with a medium salinity hazard rating c2 may be used without additional salinity management procedures water samples that fall into the high salinity hazard class c3 on the other hand may have negative impacts on sensitive crops and numerous plants such regions require cautious management shown in fig 7a under normal conditions very high salinity water c4 is unsuitable for irrigation if the salts are not leached from the root zone they will accumulate in quantities that prevent most crops from growing however salt accumulation may be utilized occasionally under very specific management methods for example soils must be permeable drainage must be adequate to good and irrigation water must be provided in excess to allow for significant leaching it might also be utilized for salt tolerant plants growing in permeable soils salt accumulation on the exchange complex as in sodic soils can be reduced by applying appropriate amounts of amendments such as gypsum the localities of the c3s1 categories highlight the hazard of groundwater in these areas as illustrated in fig 7b 4 8 3 sodium percentage appendix table a5 shows that the sodium percentage in the study region ranged from 39 to 76 twenty percent of the groundwater was determined to be unsuitable for irrigation or required special management practices such as salt resistant plantations as sodium increases the hardness of the soil while decreasing its permeability the sodium content is an important factor determining the quality of irrigation groundwater tijani 1994 4 8 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc according to staff 1954 water with an rsc value less than 1 25 meq l is appropriate for irrigation and is considered safe a value of 1 25 2 5 meq l is considered marginal while a value higher than 2 5 meq l is considered unsuitable for irrigation the rsc values for the groundwater samples in this research are shown in appendix table a6 based on these rsc values 82 of the sampled groundwater wells were categorized as class one rsc 1 25 meq l which is regarded as safe and acceptable for all forms of soil irrigation approximately 11 4 of the groundwater wells were classified as class two 1 25 2 5 meq l which is considered marginal and can be used in well drained soils approximately 6 3 of the sampled wells were classified as class three 2 5 meq l which is considered unsuitable especially in soil with low calcium and poor drainage according to the fao limits shown in appendix table a6 when the soil solution concentrates under drying circumstances bicarbonate and carbonate ions coupled with calcium or magnesium precipitate as calcium carbonate caco3 or magnesium carbonate mgco3 when ca2 and mg2 concentrations fall below those of na the sar index rises resulting in an alkalizing action and a rise in ph which reduce water permeability and have a detrimental impact on the soil structure zaman et al 2018 low quality water was present in the eastern parts of the el moneera shareka and kharga villages consequently as part of the water management system only crops that can withstand high salt should be assigned to these areas staff 1954 which are influenced by geochemical processes salt solubility and human activities narsimha and sudarshan 2013 4 9 reference evapotranspiration eto eto was calculated using cropwat as shown in fig 8 there was a large gap between the high reference values of evapotranspiration during summer months i e jun 12 04 mm day jul 10 61 mm day may 10 60 mm day aug 9 93 mm day and sep 9 36 mm day which were more than three times higher than the low values during winter months i e jan 3 74 mm day dec 3 92 mm day feb 4 85 mm day and nov 5 47 mm day causing an extreme variation in reference evapotranspiration during the year 4 10 crop evapotranspiration and crop water requirements cwr crop evapotranspiration was estimated for all crops in the el kharga cropping pattern by providing cropwat with the three data modules climate rain and crop data the effective rainfall was approximately zero during the previous five years therefore the cwr was equal to the crop evapotranspiration some crops particularly forages with several cutting cycles were split into two or more modules for each growing stage fig 9 demonstrates an accurate assessment of the cwr of all crops included in the el kharga cropping pattern with a limited time resolution 10 days this figure shows that crops with the highest water consumption were alfalfa perennial napier grass and rice with annual cwrs of 1926 1836 and 1720 mm respectively while the crop with the lowest water consumption was peas with an annual cwr of 384 mm however this analysis may be misleading because growing duration and growing season play an important role in the total annual cwr another scale based on the average daily cwr was created fig 10 this scale appears to be the most dependable and equitable rice sweet maize and ground nut had the greatest water consumption i e 60 207 37 811 and 34 614 m3 fed day respectively these findings pose an important consideration for administrative authorities when implementing a water conservation policy 4 11 calculation and temporal variation of iwr under the applied irrigation methods the irrigation water requirement iwr was calculated for all crops from 2010 to 2012 under the applied irrigation method surface irrigation per period to generate an accurate configuration of the total iwr of el kharga as shown in appendix a7 fig 11 the calculations of the yearly crop water requirements for the three years showed a generally comparable configuration and a gradual difference in terms of the water consumption trend during crucial water demanding months such as february march may june and july the average monthly iwr was 16 735 17 716 and 19 154 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively this seasonal water scarcity exacerbated the water stress in the research area the iwr results over the three years 2010 2011 and 2012 showed that the highest demand was in march june and july and the lowest demand was in september november and december for instance the iwr in march was 25 854 26 154 and 28 037 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively this finding could be explained by the fact that march is one of the four highest months in terms of cultivated area with 20123 20502 and 21886 fed month in 2010 2011 and 2012 the eto reported in march increased by 1 77 points from the previous month i e 4 32 6 09 this increase was the greatest increase of the year march is a transitional month between the winter and summer seasons thus certain summer crops may be planted sooner to escape the hot weather of the following months it is also the planting date for a large number of summer crops such as napier grass tomato pepper eggplant and cucumber the iwr in june was approximately 19 902 23 837 and 25 460 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively consequently the highest eto during the year was approximately 10 3 mm even though the cultivated area in this month was slightly greater by approximately 87 fed on average than that in the previous month may the iwr in july was approximately 19 700 23 294 and 25 617 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively showing results similar to that in june with a slight decrease in the average cultivated area of approximately 88 fed and of eto from 10 3 mm to 9 38 mm in september 2010 2011 and 2012 the iwr was estimated to be 10 948 11 566 and 12 740 million m3 total area month respectively the reason for these estimates could be that september marks the end of the summer season when rather than perennial crops only napier grass and maize fodder are grown which resulted in the lowest cultivated areas per month of 9697 10211 and 10947 fed month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively despite the highest rainfall during this month the iwr in december was approximately 11 754 11 734 and 12 789 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively this result may have occurred because december represents a middle stage in the winter season but all winter crops are cultivated in this month for example wheat which occupied the highest amount of the cultivated area an average of 26 of the total cultivated area in el kharga and barley which was cultivated in the second half of november were cropped throughout the entire month of december during which eto was 3 51 mm the iwr in november was approximately 12 249 12 386 and 13 365 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively the cropping of wheat and barley in the second half of this month caused a large difference in the cultivated areas between the first and third periods of approximately 963 593 and 805 fed this month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively which decreased the average iwr in this month and the eto value was low i e 4 85 mm 4 12 calculation and temporal variation of iwr under the suggested irrigation methods the most appropriate irrigation systems for conserving irrigation water for all farming patterns in el kharga were identified for all crops in the target region as shown in table 2 in an earlier stage and according to brouwer et al 2014 1996 1988 it is feasible to recalculate iwr by substituting the increased irrigation efficiency for the entire cropping pattern for the irrigation efficiency of the employed irrigation technology this approach might offer an estimate of the iwr and the changes that would occur if these proposed irrigation strategies were used the obtained findings for the years 2010 2011 and 2012 showed that the iwr for the entire area fig 12 with improved irrigation was approximately 135 5 146 6 and 158 5 million m3 total area year respectively whereas it was approximately 199 4 215 1 and 231 7 using real irrigation techniques an improvement in the irrigation system over the three years would save 63 9 32 04 68 5 31 85 and 73 2 31 59 million m3 year or an average of 32 4 13 cultivated areas and their trends the cultivated areas were computed for a short time series 10 days using el kharga s calendar and cropping pattern as shown in appendix table a8 in general according to average monthly estimates the winter months january december and february had the greatest cultivated areas because the lowest eto during these months allowed the available water resources to cover such large regions the 2nd and 3rd periods of november i e 22023 22018 and 23916 feds in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively covered most of the area ever recorded this increase marked the highest increase in cultivated land with the wheat cropping area accounting for approximately 26 of the total cultivated fields according to this scale the increase in the rate of cultivated areas during the 2010 2011 season was approximately zero while it was approximately 1890 fed during the 2011 2012 season a difference that could be attributed to a change in the cropping structure furthermore the iwr was approximately the same during the 2010 2011 season but exhibited an increase of approximately 0 5 million m3 of water in 2011 2012 on the other hand calculations according to the average monthly cultivated areas indicated an average annual increase of 766 fed in the 2010 2011 season and 1246 fed in the 2011 2012 season furthermore the lowest cultivated area was recorded during the three periods of september which represented the end of the summer season based on the previously indicated calculation the amount of irrigation water that might be saved by using the recommended irrigation methods is 32 this savings might result in 45 cultivated area the cultivated areas under the suggested irrigation techniques are illustrated in fig 13 under the enhanced irrigation methods the configuration of the new iwr was estimated to be 196 5 212 6 and 229 8 million m3 year in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively as shown in appendix table a9 5 discussion the el kharga oasis has a serious water imbalance problem due to unmanaged groundwater exploitation little annual rainfall quick evaporation and transpiration and severe insolation the current study focused on evaluating groundwater quality and quantity in the new valley governorate which is willing to reclaim the western desert and develop new urban areas including reservoir water and its environment which has recently been explored as a potential groundwater resource in the desert to classify the fitness of groundwater for irrigation the values of tds sar rsc ec and sodium percentage were used and it was discovered that groundwater was suitable for irrigation in the majority of the study area the ec and sar values of groundwater samples indicate that the majority of samples 84 had medium salinity and low sodium which could be used in most scenarios without special salinity management techniques furthermore approximately 16 of the water samples had high salinity and low sodium which can be used for almost any type of soil with little risk of sodium exchange groundwater salinization increased in 16 of samples from the eastern part of sherka and the western part of bulaq due to a decrease in sand content an increase in shale with gypsum and evaporate bands in the aquifer and a decrease in aquifer transmissivity all of which increase salt leaching by slowing groundwater flow the lithology velocity and volume of groundwater flow type of geochemical processes salt solubility and human activities are all factors that influence dissolved ion concentrations in groundwater bhatt and saklani 1996 karanth 1987 rao et al 2017 narsimha and sudarshan 2013 the majority of samples had more sodium than calcium and magnesium as cations and more bicarbonate than sulphate and chloride as anions suggesting that sodium bicarbonate flows by means of sodium sulphate and sodium chloride water types the lowest calcium values were found in the western and southwestern parts of the study area the potassium concentration in the research region was low and the majority of the studied wells contained low amounts of soluble sodium the magnesium ion distribution map fig 3b showed that the lowest levels occurred in the center of the study area the spatial distribution changes of magnesium ions in the groundwater wells showed an increase east of kharga and west of both genah and bulaq relatively low salinity contents ranging from 200 mg l to 500 mg l were recorded in the majority of production wells with only a few samples having relatively high salinity content in general this groundwater is a suitable source of irrigation water the general growing trend in irrigation demand in the studied region is attributable partly to changes in the cropping structure and partly to the growth of the farmed area during 2010 2012 the annual water resource didn t meet the irrigation demand and there was a significant shortage during some critical water demanding months such as march june july and may when the average monthly iwr in 2010 2011 and 2012 was 16 618 17 929 and 19 310 million m3 month respectively the average monthly water consumption rate was exceeded during these months these analyses are necessary for groundwater conservation using optimized irrigation systems this type of seasonal water scarcity exacerbated the water stress in the research area this study can serve as an authoritative reference that provides an accurate evaluation of the groundwater in the el kharga oasis from a hydrochemical perspective to determine its suitability for irrigation 2 estimate water consumption and 3 assess the efficiency of water conservation under two main water management system scenarios in addition the findings can help decision makers evaluate the current water management system using their authority to preserve water based on the present study these strategies can be applied to better manage water resources at a regional scale and in areas with similar conditions the continuous monitoring of groundwater quality quantity aids in detecting any degradation in water quality and will allow decision makers to take the required steps to safeguard groundwater quality and regulate crop patterns and irrigation methods in accordance with the available water supply it is strongly advised that a geographical survey be conducted to integrate these findings with remote sensing data to highlight problems and identify solutions as well as to determine the optimum water management and irrigation strategies the results of this study can contribute to the management of groundwater well extraction in response to spatiotemporal changes in quantity and quality under high demand for irrigation activities in hyperarid environments sensible water management measures such as water price control crop planting pattern adjustment legal and financial implementation incentives and water conservation technology are urgently needed additionally the study recommends the time series analysis of groundwater quality for future research with a longer time plan to assess groundwater temporal variations 6 conclusions the el kharga oasis is largely an agricultural area with limited groundwater resources with agricultural water use accounting for more than 90 of total water use the most significant element impacting water resources in the region is the distribution of water resources into socioeconomic sectors and ecosystems seventy nine deep groundwater samples were chemically analyzed to evaluate their chemical composition and compatibility as an irrigation water source according to our findings 82 of the sampled groundwater wells were regarded as safe and acceptable for all forms of soil irrigation e g rsc 1 25 meq l special management measures such as salt resistant planting were necessary for high salt samples according to an old study chebotarev 1955 all water samples in the study area were freshwater i e 20 samples the results revealed that the total annual irrigation water needs of all crops increased in 2010 2011 and 2012 reaching 199 4 215 1 and 231 7 million m3 year respectively indicating a steady increase in the irrigation water requirements of approximately 16 57 million m3 total area year on the other hand the largest cultivated areas ever recorded were 22023 22018 and 23916 fed in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively indicating an average annual expansion of 946 fed year this finding indicates decent growth in the crop growing area leading to a rapid increase in the demand for irrigation water improving irrigation methods as part of effective water management such as through the development of new irrigation technology e g sprinkler and drip irrigation systems would reduce costs and effort increase benefits and save irrigation water by approximately 32 compared to current irrigation methods if irrigation efficiency improved in 2010 2011 and 2012 the estimated irrigation water requirement for the entire target area could have been reduced to 135 5 146 6 and 158 5 million m3 total area year from 199 4 215 1 and 231 7 million m3 total area year under actual irrigation methods allowing for an expansion of the cultivated area in other words an improved irrigation water management system could have used available irrigation water to increase the maximum cultivation areas from 22020 22013 and 23916 fed to 31929 31919 and 34677 fed in december 2010 2011 and 2012 alternatively optimized irrigation systems could have conserved groundwater using the excess water made available by conservation irrigation practices and thus possibly eliminating the significant shortage during the high demand months and expanding agricultural land credit

8025,study region the el kharga oasis in the western desert of egypt is selected as the study area due to its hyberarid climate condition and water scarcity in this region the fossil groundwater is the main water source therefore preserving groundwater quality and quantity is mandatory study focus this study evaluated groundwater suitability for irrigation purposes and assessed the water requirements of cultivated crops to optimize the water supply in hyperarid climate regions in total 79 deep groundwater samples were hydrochemically tested to determine the suitability for irrigation by assessing the key water quality parameters spatial distribution maps of all chemical parameters such as ph ec sar rsc ssp tds total hardness na k ca mg fe mn cl and so4 were developed the fao cropwat 8 0 model based on the penman monteith equation was used to forecast agricultural water requirements for three years 2010 2011 and 2012 new hydrological insights for the region the groundwater had medium salinity and low sodium in 84 of the cases in comparison high salinity was found in 16 of the samples indicating that groundwater can be used for many soil types with a low risk of exchangeable sodium except for 15 of the 79 wells all groundwater samples had chloride concentrations less than 100 mg l the sulfate ion distribution map showed a low sulfate ion content in the extreme western south the total annual irrigation water requirements of all crops for 2010 2011 and 2012 were 199 4 215 1 and 231 7 million m3 year respectively reflecting a gradual increase of approximately 16 57 million m3 total area year due to the expansion of the cultivated area the analysis showed that modern irrigation systems reduced the amount of irrigation water by 32 and increased the cultivated area by 45 compared to conventional irrigation methods severe groundwater depletion occurred during the dry season from march to july which exacerbated the water stress in the study

cultivated crops fao cropwat spatial distribution maps el kharga oasis 1 introduction concerns about combining water saving technologies and the hydrochemical features of groundwater quality and quantity have arisen because of growing water demand and global scarcity issues owing to the lack of freshwater resources in egypt s el kharga oasis there is a significant demand for the use of advanced and innovative water resource management techniques and technologies in the agricultural sector which is egypt s largest water user the agricultural sector accounts for more than 86 8 of the total water use in egypt fao 2005 and more than 90 of the total water use in the study area el kharga is one of egypt s most important oases it is a hyperarid location with hot dry weather in the western desert and it is part of the saharan nubian aquifer jahin and gaber 2011 with increasing acreage of crop growth and low water use efficiency there is a high demand for new and advanced water resource management techniques as the agricultural sector develops al amoud et al 2012 this demand may be met by calculating the region s agricultural irrigation water demand and evaluating the temporal features of irrigation water demand and cultivated areas under other irrigation water management scenarios this research is critical to enhance water management for sustainable and long term use there is a crucial need for groundwater quantity quality and sustainability studies for irrigation and drinking purposes gameh et al 2014 especially in developing countries which suffer from inconsistent information on irrigation water use a few analyses have been carried out in el kharga to determine water quantity quality and sustainability for irrigation drinking purposes and water requirements for only a few individual crops which is a barrier for assessing the whole water management system groundwater assessment for drinking and irrigation has become necessary for present and future groundwater quality management gabr et al 2021 mehrazar et al 2020 sobeih et al 2017 the quality of groundwater is nearly as important as its quantity groundwater quality must be evaluated before it can be exploited appropriately and sustained todd and mays 2004 chemical analysis of water samples from different locations in a study area will provide a clear vision of the chemistry of irrigation water sadashivaiah et al 2008 the chemical composition of groundwater is influenced by various factors including rainfall quality and quantity rock type permeability leakage or recharge and land use groundwater hydrochemistry is influenced by a variety of hydrochemical processes to maintain equilibrium between rock and water interactions as well as the mixing of various fluids hydrochemistry research comprises a description of the components of groundwater and their interactions all types of groundwater include some dissolved ions and are never totally pure more than 90 of the dissolved solids in groundwater are accounted for by seven ions mainly cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl and so4 2 the lithology velocity and volume of groundwater flow type of geochemical processes salt solubility and human activities are all variables that impact the concentration of dissolved ions in groundwater bhatt and saklani 1996 karanth 1987 numerous studies have been conducted in different parts of the world to examine the suitability of groundwater for various uses using a variety of methodologies e g berhe 2020 gauns et al 2020 singh et al 2020 many researchers have evaluated groundwater in different regions in egypt for example ismail et al 2017 ismaila et al 2020 ismail and el rawy 2018 el rawy et al 2019 geriesh et al 2019 gabr et al 2021 the overuse of groundwater for agricultural purposes has resulted in a considerable drop in the water table during the previous two decades necessitating an immediate and effective management plan moghazy and kaluarachchi 2020 due to high consumption rates and overexploitation the groundwater level in the northern half of the kharga oasis declined from 60 to 80 m below the earth and from 40 to 60 m in the southern part between 1967 and 2007 mekkawi et al 2017 additionally the number of deep wells increased to 350 during the ten year period from 2003 to 2013 and the reservoir water level dropped by more than 90 m dept of water resources in kharga personal communication it is challenging to meet crops full water requirements to sustain optimum growth and yield in dry and semiarid locations consequently determining ways to preserve optimal agricultural yields during water shortages is important this challenge has prompted researchers to seek novel irrigation technologies methods and strategies to increase water efficiency hamdy et al 2003 one of the most promising approaches for improving irrigation efficiency is controlled deficit irrigation systems a second technique involves using modern irrigation systems which enhance plant water application efficiency determining the water consumption of field crops in egypt s dry environment under various irrigation systems may aid in the irrigation management of vital crops phene et al 1993 moreover irrigation systems are a critical component in reducing water losses and increasing agricultural output productivity to satisfy future increases in food demand however to realize its full potential the irrigation sector must be revived by implementing novel management practices and changing its control kawy and abou el magd 2013 kawy and darwish 2014 the fao recommends the penman monteith equation for estimating crop water requirements because it is a simple equation with a reliable physical basis ground observation data of the cropping pattern area crop coefficient approach and irrigation efficiency were integrated using the penman monteith equation to predict irrigation water demand and crop water requirements for three consecutive years 2010 2011 and 2012 cropwat 8 0 is a decision support tool developed by the fao s land and water development division and all calculation procedures are based on two fao publications doorenbos and kassam 1979 allen et al 1998 it is a software tool that calculates agricultural water needs this research will establish the validity of available irrigation water and how much irrigation water management may assist in maintaining such a target region s limited water resources enabling the future expansion of agricultural regions this research was conducted to determine the suitability of water for irrigation purposes temporal distributions of agricultural water requirements in the target area the amount of annual irrigation and monthly variation in irrigation water requirements based on three years of data our investigation also determined the efficiency of other scenarios for water conservation and addressed the future increase in food demand kawy and abou el magd 2013 to fulfill the demand of an increasing population allen et al 2005 the present study attempted to obtain a comprehensive understanding of groundwater hydrochemical development and assess the water quality conditions for irrigation based on detailed groundwater monitoring wells in addition it aimed to evaluate the spatiotemporal variation in reference and crop evapotranspiration of all cropping patterns and the trend of cultivation areas for both the applied and proposed irrigation systems during the study period our study marks the first time that an integrated study combining hydrochemical evaluation for water quality and crop water requirements of cultivated crops was conducted in this region to conserve precious water resources and assess the groundwater s quality and or appropriateness for irrigation this research is critical in helping to enhance water management for long term use 2 the study area el kharga is located in the new valley governate in the western desert of egypt between latitudes 24 00 and 26 00 n and longitudes 30 15 and 30 45 e fig 1 it consists of a depression approximately 2000 km long that spans 20 885 km wide its area is approximately 12 250 km2 it is one of the significant oases in egypt a hyperarid region with hot dry weather it is the driest spot in the western desert and is arguably the driest spot on the planet salman et al 2010 the new valley governate receives less than 2 mm year of rainfall therefore agriculture depends mainly on groundwater kuper and kröpelin 2006 locally the el kharga oasis receives less than 0 1 mm year of precipitation and lacks naturally occurring surface water so groundwater is the only water resource younis et al 2016 despite high temperatures and significant evaporation rates agriculture is essential for growth and accounts for a portion of the main saharan nubian aquifer it is fully contained inside the nubian sandstone aquifer system and covers the northern part of the eastern sahara this oasis known to ancient egyptians as the southern oasis is the current capital of the new valley government and is the largest of egypt s oases in the western desert as shown in fig 1 due to water availability the kharga oases have been a magnet for humans since prehistoric times as evidenced by the presence of hundreds of natural artesian springs as well as the fertile soil represented by the deposits of the springs and the playa sediments dry paleolake deposits bravard et al 2016 however since the beginning of the new valley project for agricultural reclamation in the 1950s the nubian sandstone aquifer has become depleted as many wells were drilled and water was extracted industrially therefore for the present study we focused on the area located in the northern part of the kharga depression between 25 00 and 25 45 n where most agricultural lands are located fig 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling and chemical analysis water samples from 79 wells were collected from 2010 to 2012 with 500 ml polyethylene bottles before sampling the bottles were carefully cleaned two to three times with the groundwater obtained after being cleaned with deionized water and distilled water the samples were collected only from continuously exploited wells chemical analyses of groundwater samples were performed to calculate the power of hydrogen ph conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and total hardness th a ph meter was used to determine the ph and the ec was measured in ds m 1 using an ec meter at 25 c the gravimetric technique was used to determine tds concentration hussein and magram 2012 spectrophotometric methods were used to quantify the content of sulfate so4 2 american public health association 1998 whereas volumetric titration methods were used to estimate the concentrations of bicarbonate hco3 calcium ca and magnesium mg and chloride cl concentrations maiti 2004 a flame photometer was used to evaluate the soluble na and k concentrations and atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to assess the concentrations of trace elements such as fe and mn hasanien et al 2010 sayed 2013 the locations of the groundwater samples are shown in fig 1 surfer 12

performed with surfer using the kriging interpolation scheme piper trilinear diagrams piper 1944 were used to compare the findings of chemical tests of groundwater using aquachem v 2014 1 software waterloo hydrogeologic https www waterloohydrogeologic com to understand the hydrochemical facies 3 2 groundwater origin and classification piper trilinear diagrams piper 1944 are made up of three

portion s principal cation and anion compositions based on the ionic composition of distinct water samples piper diagrams provide a straightforward way to identify water types obtained from various groundwater resources al omran et al 2013 aly et al 2015 3 3 suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes the following are the key characteristics of groundwater that influence its suitability for irrigation 3 3 1 salinity hazard in general the total soluble salt content of irrigation water is determined by measuring its ec based on the flow of an electrical current through the sample 3 3 2 alkali hazard the sodium adsorption ratio sar indicates the alkali hazard sar is a metric used to calculate the sodium toxicity of irrigation water a high sar value implies that salt in water can replace calcium and magnesium ions in the soil causing structural damage lloyd and heathcote 1985 eq 1 defines the sar metric richards 1969 1 sar na ca mg 2 where all concentrations of na ca and mg are in meq l 3 3 3 sodium percentage the sodium content in irrigation water is also reported as a percentage of sodium or as a percentage of soluble sodium apart from directly impacting plant development salts also affect soil structure permeability and aeration all of which indirectly impact plant growth singh et al 2008 na is calculated using equation eq 2 2 na na k ca mg na k where all concentrations of na k ca and mg are in meq l 3 3 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc the rsc was computed to assess the effects of carbonate and bicarbonate on water quality for agricultural use aghazadeh and mogaddam 2010 in irrigated agriculture rsc is employed as a measure of the anticipated residual carbonate in irrigation water it is computed by subtracting the soluble calcium and magnesium values from the values of soluble carbonate and bicarbonate in milliliters it can be computed using equation eq 3 eaton 1950 3 rsc hco 3 co 3 ca mg where all concentrations of na ca and mg are in meq l 3 4 crop water requirements even though there are numerous techniques for calculating crop and irrigation water requirements the fao recommends the penman monteith approach it is a simple equation coupled with ground observation data on the cropping pattern area crop coefficient approach and irrigation efficiency to predict irrigation water demand and crop water requirements for three consecutive years 2010 2011 and 2012 which offer the most recent available data the required data were collected and processed as follows a climatological and effective rainfall data were obtained from the egyptian meteorological authority egyptian ministry of agriculture 2012 for the el kharga oasis which include monthly minimum and maximum temperatures humidity wind speed average sunshine duration and effective rainfall per month b crop data and cropping patterns were provided by the egyptian ministry of agriculture 2012 for three successive years 2010 2011 and 2012 the tables include detailed data about each crop s cultivated areas in fadden for each year the data are classified into two seasons winter and summer with subtotals of three categories crops vegetables and trees perennial c the cropping calendar contains the dates of planting sow transplanting and harvesting end growth which differed significantly among areas the calendar was initially established based on egyptian ministry of agriculture 2012 for the district of upper egypt to which el kharga meteorologically belonged and was based on a field survey conducted by agricultural research center staff members and public farmers in el kharga d the length of the growth stages and single crop coefficient were reviewed using many sources to set the actual length of the growth stages of each crop the primary source was doorenbos 1977 based on allen et al 1994 however nonexistent crop coefficients such as that for okra were recorded according to doorenbos j 1977 the crop coefficient for date palm was calculated according to an actual field study by kassem 2007 which provided monthly crop coefficient kc values for 2004 from which the average kc during the three stages was calculated table 1

approximately 50 dastane 1972 doorenbos 1977 and the surface irrigation efficiency is approximately 55 according to egyptian ministry of irrigation and water resources standards khedr et al 2009 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogen ion concentration ph the ph values of the analyzed samples in the investigated area varied from 6 05 to 8 84 consistent with the findings of gameh et al 2014 jahin and gaber 2011 revealing that the groundwater samples were slightly acidic to alkaline and that no apparent setup could control these values fig 2a in most cases samples that exceed the maximum permitted level for irrigation purposes have no direct effect who 2008 4 2 electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds the ec values ranged between 310 μs cm and 1400 μs cm in the study region the ec distribution map of the study area fig 2b shows that ec increases eastward of kharga and to the west of both genah and bulaq relatively low salinity contents ranging from 200 mg l to 500 mg l were recorded in the majority of production wells a few samples located in the eastern part of sherka and in the western part of bulaq had evaluated salinity contents ranging from 500 to 896 mg l this result agrees with that presented by jahin and gaber 2011 however some groundwater samples high conductivity from 1060 to 1400 μs cm matched the highest concentrations of dominant ions due to the deterioration in water quality higher ec fluctuations might be linked to the research region s human activities and geochemical processes generally our data show no problems resulting from salinity total dissolved solids indicate the general state of groundwater quality and pollution levels munro and travis 1986 robinove et al 1958 the tds value ranged from 198 4 mg l to 896 mg l the tds levels increased east of sherka and west of bulaq according to the distribution map in fig 2c increased dissolved solids in irrigation water impact soil efficiency plant growth and yield salinization occurs when the amount of salts in the soil increases as the salinity of the water rises the quantity of salts that plants absorb is governed mostly by the soil and plant types and the ease with which water can be drained the tds content of the groundwater samples in the study region showed that groundwater may be used for irrigation without problems as the tds levels in all samples were less than 1000 mg l 4 3 total hardness th total hardness is an essential characteristic that indicates the quality of groundwater and is defined as the sum of calcium and magnesium cation concentrations reported in mg l who 1996 the total hardness of the water samples collected in the research region ranged from 57 mg caco3 l to 406 mg caco3 l th was high only in the western portion of bulaq as shown in fig 2d the high value for th may be due to the presence of alkaline soil such as calcium and magnesium 4 4 spatial distribution of major ions 4 4 1 analysis of cations calcium is found naturally in water and most rocks and it is easily dissolved in various forms in water it is the most prevalent alkaline earth metal and may be found in a wide variety of common rock minerals the calcium concentration ranged between 10 25 mg l and 61 47 mg l as indicated on the distribution map of the calcium ions fig 3a with the lowest values found in the southwestern part of the study area this result generally agrees with the finding of jahin and gaber 2011 calcium rich minerals include calcite aragonite dolomite gypsum anhydrite fluorite plagioclase pyroxene and amphibole skinner and porter 2006 magnesium is also one of the common elements in rocks water becomes harder as a result of magnesium the magnesium concentration ranged between 4 86 mg l and 60 76 mg l the magnesium ion distribution map fig 3b shows that the lowest levels were observed in the middle of the study area this result differed from the finding of jahin and gaber 2011 the higher levels discovered may be due to the collapse of the limestone plateau which contains magnesium bearing rocks such as dolomite ca mg co3 2 sodium is the sixth most abundant element in the earth s crust the source of sodium in groundwater depends on the type of rock that the water passes through the sodium concentrations in the groundwater of the investigated area ranged from 14 25 mg l to 163 45 mg l the majority of the wells surveyed had modest levels of soluble sodium fig 3c with significant quantities in the east notably in el kharga high concentrations of sodium 170 mg l may affect people with heart problems hypertension and certain other medical disorders in addition sodium may be detrimental to certain irrigated crops but our findings indicate that sodium is not a concern the potassium concentration in the research region was low in all sampled wells except in the extreme southwestern region where it ranged from 13 29 mg l to 46 92 mg l fig 3d in groundwater ionic potassium is found in relatively low quantities as potassium minerals resist weathering and dissolution sravanthi and sudarshan 1998 4 4 2 analysis of anions chloride is the most common major anion and is found in all types of water it is a useful indicator of groundwater quality chloride is a key criterion for irrigation water since it is essential for plants and animals its concentration in natural groundwater is commonly less than 100 mg l unless the water is brackish or saline fetter et al 1999 the chloride content of groundwater samples in the study region ranged from 31 91 mg l to 167 5 mg l fig 3e except for 15 of the 79 samples wells all groundwater samples had chloride concentrations less than 100 mg l a high chloride content has a negative impact on taste and can cause corrosion a considerable quantity of chloride can accumulate in leaves causing the leaves to dry up jahin and gaber 2011 chloride levels are low in ancient agricultural fields where surface water infiltration and dilution occur and on the other hand chloride in soil irrigated for a long time by water with higher chloride contents in areas with extreme evaporation and no precipitation the majority of chloride in groundwater comes from four different sources ancient sea water trapped in sediments solutions of halite and related minerals in evaporated deposits concentration by the evaporation of chlorides contributed by precipitation and solutions of dry fallout from the atmosphere particularly in arid regions daviest and dewiest 1966 the decomposition of carbonate minerals such as calcite caco3 and dolomite camg co3 2 produces the bulk of bicarbonate ions in groundwater the bicarbonate content ranged between 12 2 mg l and 308 15 mg l in the study area this composition diverged from the findings presented by jahin and gaber 2011 who showed that bicarbonate levels ranged from 78 mg l in boulaq to 282 3 mg l in ei mounira the minimum value was recorded in the western and southern parts of the study area but the maximum value especially in the eastern zone was found to result from the dissolution of carbonate rocks fig 3f bicarbonate ions in groundwater are generated by carbon dioxide in the atmosphere soils and the breakdown of carbonate rock daviest and dewiest 1966 the high concentration of hco3 in this aquifer suggests active chemical weathering processes natural activities such as the dissolution of carbonate minerals and the release of co2 gas from the soil might be a source of hco3 in quaternary aquifer groundwater the major sources of sulfate in natural groundwater are gypsum and anhydrite the sulfate content in ordinary groundwater is generally less than 300 mg l the sulfate levels in the study area ranged from 19 21 mg l to 992 3 mg l contradicting the conclusions of jahin and gaber 2011 the sulfate ion distribution map fig 3g shows that the area s low sulfate ion content was found in the extreme southwest higher sulfate levels in wells on newly reclaimed land could be due to gypsum and potassium sulfates being transferred into the soil as fertilizers dissolved 4 5 distribution of minor elements 4 5 1 iron the amount of iron in the groundwater in the study area ranged between 0 42 and 3 98 mg l the results show a steady rise in iron content in the western parts of the research area as shown in fig 4a a high concentration of iron is produced by the dissolution of iron bearing deposits rich in minerals the ph of groundwater is important because it influences the solubility and biological availability of iron once it has dissolved the ph levels of groundwater samples are plotted in fig 2a which shows that the ph ranged from 6 05 to 8 84 these findings are similar to those of sayed 2013 who utilized 34 groundwater samples in the same research region to create a kriged 3d surface and contour map of iron distribution the iron and ph value relationship shows that the iron concentration increases as the ph value decreases a ph below 6 05 encourages the formation of iron deposits in solution which can lead to corrosion when the ph is higher than 8 5 scaling and encrustation are more likely to develop if other ions such as calcium or carbonate are present they produce a variety of precipitates that mix with the iron hydroxide precipitates forming a crusty gnarled layer that is difficult to remove the ph values ranged from 6 5 to 8 84 creating a suitable environment for the growth of iron bacteria in a well or water system during drilling repair or maintenance gad et al 2016 once a well is highly infected the removal of iron bacteria may be exceedingly difficult wilson et al 1999 bacteria convert soluble ferrous iron into insoluble ferric iron the formation of ochre and bacterial slimes which can clog well intake screens as well as drip irrigation system filters laterals and emitters 4 5 2 manganese manganese is similar to iron in terms of chemical behavior and natural water occurrence as shown in fig 4b the manganese concentration of the groundwater in the investigated region ranged from 0 to 0 46 mg l with higher concentrations in the south and west minor element levels f cu mn zn cd and pb in the groundwater samples were all within permissible limits 4 6 ion dominance and water types ions in the groundwater samples are ranked in appendix table a1 according to schoeller s 1962 semilogarithmic graphs the following ranking was found in the majority of the water samples na ca mg hco3 so4 cl na ca mg so4 hco3 cl and na ca mg hco3 cl so4 in the majority of the samples higher sodium levels relative to calcium and magnesium as cations and higher bicarbonate levels relative to sulfate and chloride as anions reflect the dominance of sodium bicarbonate in sodium sulfate and sodium chloride water types this outcome is not the same as that reported in abdelhafez et al 2021 whose research areas included el kharga baris and el dakhla in their study sulfate was the primary anion whereas ca was the main cation the highest concentrations of ca were found in el dakhla while the lowest concentrations were found in el kharga this distribution indicates that carbonate sulfate and chloride minerals in aquifer media are actively leached and dissolved however our results are comparable to the findings presented by gad et al 2016 4 7 groundwater origin and classification piper diagrams were used to illustrate the findings of the examined samples fig 5 in the majority of samples alkali ions na and k predominated over alkaline earth ions ca2 and mg2 while strong acids cl and so4 2 predominated over weak acids co3 2 hco3 as demonstrated in appendix table a2 only a few samples exhibited the opposite behavior with alkaline earth ca2 and mg2 exceeding alkali na and k ions and weak acids co3 2 hco3 exceeding strong acids cl and so4 2 according to the chemical data the water type in the region fluctuated mostly between na hc03 and na cl piper diagram according to the cation distribution the samples ranged in composition from sodium potassium to mostly mixed cations jahin and gaber 2011 magnesium cations were present in a small fraction of the groundwater samples 4 8 quality assessment for irrigation purposes 4 8 1 salinity hazard the conductivity levels ranged between 310 and 1400 s cm water with an ec of less than 750 s cm is appropriate for irrigation in terms of the salt content staff 1954 ec is a good predictor of crop salinity hazards excessive salinity reduces osmotic activity in plants preventing them from absorbing water and nutrients from the soil saleh et al 1999 under normal conditions 15 of the 79 samples had a high salt content making them unsuitable for irrigation as shown in appendix table a3 the leaching and dissolution of marine sediments with fresh water either from irrigation rain or vertical upward flows from the underlying aquifers dictated salinity changes 4 8 2 alkali hazard the frequency of elevated sar in 79 groundwater samples as well as the appropriateness of the groundwater for irrigation was examined as seen in fig 6 the lowest sar value was 0 40 and the highest was 8 50 according to fao recommendations the sampled groundwater wells posed no sodium risk to irrigated land and can be used to irrigate any crop including those that are sodium sensitive such as citrus the distribution map of sar meq l for groundwater wells in the study area is shown in fig 7 staff 1954 developed a technique for categorizing irrigation water to demonstrate the link between sar and ec as indicated in appendix table a4 the el kharga oasis water samples were classified as medium high or extremely high salinity hazards the majority of the groundwater samples had salinity hazards ranging from medium c2 to high c3 sar was classified into four categories low less than 10 medium 10 18 meq l high 18 26 meq l and very high more than 26 meq l all of the samples were in the 1 1 5 29 range therefore the estimated sar values in the study region were classified as low these findings are in line with those presented by yousefi et al 2018 consequently 64 out of 79 samples 81 were classified as the c2s1 group suggesting a medium salinity low sodium groundwater type the remaining 15 samples were classified as c3s1 high salinity low sodium accounting for 19 of the total in most situations groundwater with a medium salinity hazard rating c2 may be used without additional salinity management procedures water samples that fall into the high salinity hazard class c3 on the other hand may have negative impacts on sensitive crops and numerous plants such regions require cautious management shown in fig 7a under normal conditions very high salinity water c4 is unsuitable for irrigation if the salts are not leached from the root zone they will accumulate in quantities that prevent most crops from growing however salt accumulation may be utilized occasionally under very specific management methods for example soils must be permeable drainage must be adequate to good and irrigation water must be provided in excess to allow for significant leaching it might also be utilized for salt tolerant plants growing in permeable soils salt accumulation on the exchange complex as in sodic soils can be reduced by applying appropriate amounts of amendments such as gypsum the localities of the c3s1 categories highlight the hazard of groundwater in these areas as illustrated in fig 7b 4 8 3 sodium percentage appendix table a5 shows that the sodium percentage in the study region ranged from 39 to 76 twenty percent of the groundwater was determined to be unsuitable for irrigation or required special management practices such as salt resistant plantations as sodium increases the hardness of the soil while decreasing its permeability the sodium content is an important factor determining the quality of irrigation groundwater tijani 1994 4 8 4 residual sodium carbonate rsc according to staff 1954 water with an rsc value less than 1 25 meq l is appropriate for irrigation and is considered safe a value of 1 25 2 5 meq l is considered marginal while a value higher than 2 5 meq l is considered unsuitable for irrigation the rsc values for the groundwater samples in this research are shown in appendix table a6 based on these rsc values 82 of the sampled groundwater wells were categorized as class one rsc 1 25 meq l which is regarded as safe and acceptable for all forms of soil irrigation approximately 11 4 of the groundwater wells were classified as class two 1 25 2 5 meq l which is considered marginal and can be used in well drained soils approximately 6 3 of the sampled wells were classified as class three 2 5 meq l which is considered unsuitable especially in soil with low calcium and poor drainage according to the fao limits shown in appendix table a6 when the soil solution concentrates under drying circumstances bicarbonate and carbonate ions coupled with calcium or magnesium precipitate as calcium carbonate caco3 or magnesium carbonate mgco3 when ca2 and mg2 concentrations fall below those of na the sar index rises resulting in an alkalizing action and a rise in ph which reduce water permeability and have a detrimental impact on the soil structure zaman et al 2018 low quality water was present in the eastern parts of the el moneera shareka and kharga villages consequently as part of the water management system only crops that can withstand high salt should be assigned to these areas staff 1954 which are influenced by geochemical processes salt solubility and human activities narsimha and sudarshan 2013 4 9 reference evapotranspiration eto eto was calculated using cropwat as shown in fig 8 there was a large gap between the high reference values of evapotranspiration during summer months i e jun 12 04 mm day jul 10 61 mm day may 10 60 mm day aug 9 93 mm day and sep 9 36 mm day which were more than three times higher than the low values during winter months i e jan 3 74 mm day dec 3 92 mm day feb 4 85 mm day and nov 5 47 mm day causing an extreme variation in reference evapotranspiration during the year 4 10 crop evapotranspiration and crop water requirements cwr crop evapotranspiration was estimated for all crops in the el kharga cropping pattern by providing cropwat with the three data modules climate rain and crop data the effective rainfall was approximately zero during the previous five years therefore the cwr was equal to the crop evapotranspiration some crops particularly forages with several cutting cycles were split into two or more modules for each growing stage fig 9 demonstrates an accurate assessment of the cwr of all crops included in the el kharga cropping pattern with a limited time resolution 10 days this figure shows that crops with the highest water consumption were alfalfa perennial napier grass and rice with annual cwrs of 1926 1836 and 1720 mm respectively while the crop with the lowest water consumption was peas with an annual cwr of 384 mm however this analysis may be misleading because growing duration and growing season play an important role in the total annual cwr another scale based on the average daily cwr was created fig 10 this scale appears to be the most dependable and equitable rice sweet maize and ground nut had the greatest water consumption i e 60 207 37 811 and 34 614 m3 fed day respectively these findings pose an important consideration for administrative authorities when implementing a water conservation policy 4 11 calculation and temporal variation of iwr under the applied irrigation methods the irrigation water requirement iwr was calculated for all crops from 2010 to 2012 under the applied irrigation method surface irrigation per period to generate an accurate configuration of the total iwr of el kharga as shown in appendix a7 fig 11 the calculations of the yearly crop water requirements for the three years showed a generally comparable configuration and a gradual difference in terms of the water consumption trend during crucial water demanding months such as february march may june and july the average monthly iwr was 16 735 17 716 and 19 154 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively this seasonal water scarcity exacerbated the water stress in the research area the iwr results over the three years 2010 2011 and 2012 showed that the highest demand was in march june and july and the lowest demand was in september november and december for instance the iwr in march was 25 854 26 154 and 28 037 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively this finding could be explained by the fact that march is one of the four highest months in terms of cultivated area with 20123 20502 and 21886 fed month in 2010 2011 and 2012 the eto reported in march increased by 1 77 points from the previous month i e 4 32 6 09 this increase was the greatest increase of the year march is a transitional month between the winter and summer seasons thus certain summer crops may be planted sooner to escape the hot weather of the following months it is also the planting date for a large number of summer crops such as napier grass tomato pepper eggplant and cucumber the iwr in june was approximately 19 902 23 837 and 25 460 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively consequently the highest eto during the year was approximately 10 3 mm even though the cultivated area in this month was slightly greater by approximately 87 fed on average than that in the previous month may the iwr in july was approximately 19 700 23 294 and 25 617 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively showing results similar to that in june with a slight decrease in the average cultivated area of approximately 88 fed and of eto from 10 3 mm to 9 38 mm in september 2010 2011 and 2012 the iwr was estimated to be 10 948 11 566 and 12 740 million m3 total area month respectively the reason for these estimates could be that september marks the end of the summer season when rather than perennial crops only napier grass and maize fodder are grown which resulted in the lowest cultivated areas per month of 9697 10211 and 10947 fed month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively despite the highest rainfall during this month the iwr in december was approximately 11 754 11 734 and 12 789 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively this result may have occurred because december represents a middle stage in the winter season but all winter crops are cultivated in this month for example wheat which occupied the highest amount of the cultivated area an average of 26 of the total cultivated area in el kharga and barley which was cultivated in the second half of november were cropped throughout the entire month of december during which eto was 3 51 mm the iwr in november was approximately 12 249 12 386 and 13 365 million m3 total area month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively the cropping of wheat and barley in the second half of this month caused a large difference in the cultivated areas between the first and third periods of approximately 963 593 and 805 fed this month in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively which decreased the average iwr in this month and the eto value was low i e 4 85 mm 4 12 calculation and temporal variation of iwr under the suggested irrigation methods the most appropriate irrigation systems for conserving irrigation water for all farming patterns in el kharga were identified for all crops in the target region as shown in table 2 in an earlier stage and according to brouwer et al 2014 1996 1988 it is feasible to recalculate iwr by substituting the increased irrigation efficiency for the entire cropping pattern for the irrigation efficiency of the employed irrigation technology this approach might offer an estimate of the iwr and the changes that would occur if these proposed irrigation strategies were used the obtained findings for the years 2010 2011 and 2012 showed that the iwr for the entire area fig 12 with improved irrigation was approximately 135 5 146 6 and 158 5 million m3 total area year respectively whereas it was approximately 199 4 215 1 and 231 7 using real irrigation techniques an improvement in the irrigation system over the three years would save 63 9 32 04 68 5 31 85 and 73 2 31 59 million m3 year or an average of 32 4 13 cultivated areas and their trends the cultivated areas were computed for a short time series 10 days using el kharga s calendar and cropping pattern as shown in appendix table a8 in general according to average monthly estimates the winter months january december and february had the greatest cultivated areas because the lowest eto during these months allowed the available water resources to cover such large regions the 2nd and 3rd periods of november i e 22023 22018 and 23916 feds in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively covered most of the area ever recorded this increase marked the highest increase in cultivated land with the wheat cropping area accounting for approximately 26 of the total cultivated fields according to this scale the increase in the rate of cultivated areas during the 2010 2011 season was approximately zero while it was approximately 1890 fed during the 2011 2012 season a difference that could be attributed to a change in the cropping structure furthermore the iwr was approximately the same during the 2010 2011 season but exhibited an increase of approximately 0 5 million m3 of water in 2011 2012 on the other hand calculations according to the average monthly cultivated areas indicated an average annual increase of 766 fed in the 2010 2011 season and 1246 fed in the 2011 2012 season furthermore the lowest cultivated area was recorded during the three periods of september which represented the end of the summer season based on the previously indicated calculation the amount of irrigation water that might be saved by using the recommended irrigation methods is 32 this savings might result in 45 cultivated area the cultivated areas under the suggested irrigation techniques are illustrated in fig 13 under the enhanced irrigation methods the configuration of the new iwr was estimated to be 196 5 212 6 and 229 8 million m3 year in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively as shown in appendix table a9 5 discussion the el kharga oasis has a serious water imbalance problem due to unmanaged groundwater exploitation little annual rainfall quick evaporation and transpiration and severe insolation the current study focused on evaluating groundwater quality and quantity in the new valley governorate which is willing to reclaim the western desert and develop new urban areas including reservoir water and its environment which has recently been explored as a potential groundwater resource in the desert to classify the fitness of groundwater for irrigation the values of tds sar rsc ec and sodium percentage were used and it was discovered that groundwater was suitable for irrigation in the majority of the study area the ec and sar values of groundwater samples indicate that the majority of samples 84 had medium salinity and low sodium which could be used in most scenarios without special salinity management techniques furthermore approximately 16 of the water samples had high salinity and low sodium which can be used for almost any type of soil with little risk of sodium exchange groundwater salinization increased in 16 of samples from the eastern part of sherka and the western part of bulaq due to a decrease in sand content an increase in shale with gypsum and evaporate bands in the aquifer and a decrease in aquifer transmissivity all of which increase salt leaching by slowing groundwater flow the lithology velocity and volume of groundwater flow type of geochemical processes salt solubility and human activities are all factors that influence dissolved ion concentrations in groundwater bhatt and saklani 1996 karanth 1987 rao et al 2017 narsimha and sudarshan 2013 the majority of samples had more sodium than calcium and magnesium as cations and more bicarbonate than sulphate and chloride as anions suggesting that sodium bicarbonate flows by means of sodium sulphate and sodium chloride water types the lowest calcium values were found in the western and southwestern parts of the study area the potassium concentration in the research region was low and the majority of the studied wells contained low amounts of soluble sodium the magnesium ion distribution map fig 3b showed that the lowest levels occurred in the center of the study area the spatial distribution changes of magnesium ions in the groundwater wells showed an increase east of kharga and west of both genah and bulaq relatively low salinity contents ranging from 200 mg l to 500 mg l were recorded in the majority of production wells with only a few samples having relatively high salinity content in general this groundwater is a suitable source of irrigation water the general growing trend in irrigation demand in the studied region is attributable partly to changes in the cropping structure and partly to the growth of the farmed area during 2010 2012 the annual water resource didn t meet the irrigation demand and there was a significant shortage during some critical water demanding months such as march june july and may when the average monthly iwr in 2010 2011 and 2012 was 16 618 17 929 and 19 310 million m3 month respectively the average monthly water consumption rate was exceeded during these months these analyses are necessary for groundwater conservation using optimized irrigation systems this type of seasonal water scarcity exacerbated the water stress in the research area this study can serve as an authoritative reference that provides an accurate evaluation of the groundwater in the el kharga oasis from a hydrochemical perspective to determine its suitability for irrigation 2 estimate water consumption and 3 assess the efficiency of water conservation under two main water management system scenarios in addition the findings can help decision makers evaluate the current water management system using their authority to preserve water based on the present study these strategies can be applied to better manage water resources at a regional scale and in areas with similar conditions the continuous monitoring of groundwater quality quantity aids in detecting any degradation in water quality and will allow decision makers to take the required steps to safeguard groundwater quality and regulate crop patterns and irrigation methods in accordance with the available water supply it is strongly advised that a geographical survey be conducted to integrate these findings with remote sensing data to highlight problems and identify solutions as well as to determine the optimum water management and irrigation strategies the results of this study can contribute to the management of groundwater well extraction in response to spatiotemporal changes in quantity and quality under high demand for irrigation activities in hyperarid environments sensible water management measures such as water price control crop planting pattern adjustment legal and financial implementation incentives and water conservation technology are urgently needed additionally the study recommends the time series analysis of groundwater quality for future research with a longer time plan to assess groundwater temporal variations 6 conclusions the el kharga oasis is largely an agricultural area with limited groundwater resources with agricultural water use accounting for more than 90 of total water use the most significant element impacting water resources in the region is the distribution of water resources into socioeconomic sectors and ecosystems seventy nine deep groundwater samples were chemically analyzed to evaluate their chemical composition and compatibility as an irrigation water source according to our findings 82 of the sampled groundwater wells were regarded as safe and acceptable for all forms of soil irrigation e g rsc 1 25 meq l special management measures such as salt resistant planting were necessary for high salt samples according to an old study chebotarev 1955 all water samples in the study area were freshwater i e 20 samples the results revealed that the total annual irrigation water needs of all crops increased in 2010 2011 and 2012 reaching 199 4 215 1 and 231 7 million m3 year respectively indicating a steady increase in the irrigation water requirements of approximately 16 57 million m3 total area year on the other hand the largest cultivated areas ever recorded were 22023 22018 and 23916 fed in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively indicating an average annual expansion of 946 fed year this finding indicates decent growth in the crop growing area leading to a rapid increase in the demand for irrigation water improving irrigation methods as part of effective water management such as through the development of new irrigation technology e g sprinkler and drip irrigation systems would reduce costs and effort increase benefits and save irrigation water by approximately 32 compared to current irrigation methods if irrigation efficiency improved in 2010 2011 and 2012 the

under actual irrigation methods allowing for an expansion of the cultivated area in other words an improved irrigation water management system could have used available irrigation water to increase

8026,study region halland county located on the swedish west coast with a special focus on the area around ramsjö canal falkenberg municipality study focus this study contributes to the understanding of the development of active acid sulfate soils and environmental consequences of leaching from these soils in an area without previous investigations samples taken from different soil profiles in an agricultural area and water samples from the agricultural drainage system were analysed in ph electrical conductivity and metal concentrations to evaluate the on site situation the results of the soils sample analysis were compared to the national soil classification system and the water samples to areas in northern europe affected by acid sulfate soils new hydrological insights for the region the results prove the existence of active acid sulfate soils in a coastal area in halland in the study region acid sulfate soils were discovered in an agricultural area of drained wetland and peatland water samples taken from the drainage system and a man made canal flowing into kattegat sea have low ph combined with high electrical conductivity and increased metal concentrations this is a direct consequence of intensive leaching from the discovered acid sulfate soils in that area therefore this is the first case study proving the existence of acid sulfate soils and highlighting their environmental impact on surface water quality on the swedish west coast i e outside the baltic sea basin keywords acid sulfate soil agricultural drainage system contamination water quality sweden 1 introduction acid sulfate soil as soil is a well known natural phenomenon around the globe e g moormann 1963 minh et al 1997 cook et al 2000 barbiéro et al 2005 in literature these soils have been described as the nastiest soils in the world dent and pons 1995 due to their potential negative impact on the environment this is closely connected to their ability to lower the soil ph drastically into an ultra acidic range in this state these soils allow toxic metals to mobilize which potentially leak out of the soil matrix and pose a threat to surrounding ecosystems and freshwater bodies dent and pons 1995 as soils are in general divided into three different states e g fanning et al 2017 a potential as soils b active as soils and c post active as soils as soils originate from the process of bacterial deposition of organic matter in waterlogged but organic rich environments such as lagoons wetlands tidal swamps or eventually lake sediments dent and pons 1995 boman et al 2010 reaching the state of oxygen depletion anaerobic decomposition oxygen is substituted by other elements in the sediment accordingly sulfate so4 2 a species of high abundance in marine water is reduced into sulfide s2 while iron is reduced from the oxidized state of fe3 to fe2 the final product is iron sulfide fes2 or metastable iron sulfide fes which is common along the coastline of the baltic sea boman et al 2008 kept under reducing conditions the parent material remains chemically stable and is referred to as potential as soil through oxidation potential as soil turns into active as soil e g ritsema et al 1992 iron sulfide oxidizes by fast and slow kinetics to sulfuric acid h2so4 which severely increases the acidity of the soil boman et al 2010 an additional consequence of the low ph is that fe3 remains soluble and therefore reactive further acidifying the soil cook et al 2000 the acid environment created by the formation of sulfuric acid enables the dissolution and mobilization of other harmful metals which consequently increase their concentrations in recipient water bodies e g åström and åström 1997 åström 2001 commonly potentially harmful metals leached out from as soils are aluminium al cadmium cd cobalt co copper cu lithium li manganese mn nickel ni strontium sr and zinc zn due to the specific properties of the effluents saarinen et al 2013 suggested a combined analysis of both water acidity and electrical conductivity ec to investigate surface water in potentially affected areas leaching is generally increased during wet periods åström and björklund 1995 åström and corin 2000 åström 2001 for example in seasons with increased rainfall or during snow melt in winter leakage can be inhibited due to the low temperatures causing ground frost toivonen et al 2013 however based on the results of a field study in finland toivonen et al 2019 stated that leakage in autumn has been prolonged in the last decades due to changing climatic conditions periodicity and timing of acid leaching plays an important role in assessing the environmental risks related to as soils e g hudd and kjellman 2002 the list of harmful substances in the effluents is long and leads to various short term and long term e g urho et al 1990 sammut et al 1995 fältmarsch et al 2008 consequences one of the most environmentally significant metals is al being able to comprehensively reduce fish and invertebrates at concentrations above 0 5 mg l 1 nystrand and österholm 2013 in combination with low ph values this can lead to one of the most obvious direct impacts of effluents from as soils on aquatic ecosystems fish kill e g åström and björklund 1995 erixon 2009 in finland river kyrönjoki fish kills related to as soils were reported as early as in 1834 åström et al 2005 today records of as soils in fennoscandia mainly exist for the coastal regions around the gulf of bothnia in sweden e g lax 2005 becher et al 2019 and finland e g åström and björklund 1995 boman et al 2010 fältmarsch et al 2009 joukainen and yli halla 2003 mattbäck et al 2017 saarinen and kløve 2012 and the central swedish lowlands around lake mälaren and hjälmaren öborn 1989 these regions have been strongly influenced by the glacial history of the region previous studies e g by öborn 1989 sohlenius et al 1996 stated that the as soils found on the swedish east coast and the central swedish lowlands were primarily deposited during the littorina stage ca 7500 4000 bp during this period of mild temperatures the sea level strongly fluctuated in the southwestern parts of sweden due to the impact of sea level rise and isostatic rebound resulting into a period of recurring transgressions and regressions e g bjørnsen et al 2008 on the swedish west coast this period is known as tapes transgression as one consequence of the transgressions the sound öresund and great belt opened leading to the formation of the littorina sea further the increased main temperature davis et al 2003 enabled algae and other organism to flourish and the decomposition of the organic matter changed the environment at the sea bottom to an anoxic state since then continuing isostatic rebound has been elevating new areas of sulfidic sediments above the current sea level growing population and increased demand on agricultural and forestry land intensified the drainage of these areas needelman et al 2007 enabling the formation of active as soils for example in sediments of paleo lakes åbjörnsson et al 2018 or wetlands beucher et al 2017 it thus becomes clear that as soils are a considerable environmental concern in the nordic countries especially around the baltic sea in finland the diffuse runoff of certain metals from as soils equals or even exceeds the present day industrial discharges sundström et al 2002 and accounts for the largest sulfate flux in the country ekholm et al 2020 in view of the global climate change with expected changes in precipitation pattern shifting seasonality of groundwater recharge nygren et al 2020 and increased groundwater level dynamics the mobilization of metals might increase significantly in the future jarsjö et al 2020 in this scenario undetected as soils might contribute to the increased metal load as hidden contamination sources the highest shoreline of the littorina sea fig 1a is often used to define the upper limit of as soils around the baltic sea e g virtanen et al 2014 even though the geomorphological processes after the last glaciation on the swedish west coast differ from the one in the baltic sea basin in terms of salinity there are indications that these soils might occur on the more densely populated swedish west coast for example larsen 1978 suggested that sulfuric gyttja clays found in the course of reclamation on the danish east coast were deposited during tapes transgression and sjöström 1994 reported the presence of acid groundwater in combination with the occurrence of sulfate rich soils on the swedish west coast halland county therefore this study aims to 1 identify locations of potential and active as soils based on their physicochemical properties and 2 explore the potential physicochemical connection between as soils and the distribution of acidity and metals in the adjacent water bodies in an agricultural area on the swedish west coast 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the region around ramsjö canal north of the city of falkenberg on the swedish west coast ramsjö canal crosses an area of postglacial silt gyttja clay anaerobic decay of peat and peat the area around ramsjö canal presents a good example of the anthropogenic influence in this part of sweden large parts of the county are still composed of forested land 52 but the creation of farmland today accounting for 44 of the land use has changed the environment drastically scb 2019 especially ditching as a common practice in developing good arable land has a huge impact on the local hydrology in the study area the former lake ramsjö and the adjoining marsh land were drained by a canal ramsjö canal fig 2a dug by hand between 1852 and 1858 with the intention of increasing the area of cultivated land in 1909 the remains of lake ramsjö were drained and ramsjö canal extended today ramsjö canal is 12 km long draining an area of approximately 60 km2 directly into the kattegat sea in the study area fig 2b several smaller ditches with varying depth ranging from approximately 0 4 m d4 to 1 0 m d5 drain into ramsjö canal the estuary of ramsjö canal is classified as a natura2000 habitat and therefore has a special national protection status for both aquatic and terrestrial species länsstyrelsen hallands län 2017 the study area had been submerged ca 50 m below the sea level highest coastline following deglaciation almost 16 000 bp the interaction between the isostatic rebound and the eustacy lifted the area above sea level around 11 000 bp during the following period of transgressions the maximum of approximately 13 m above present sea level was reached around 7500 bp påsse and daniels 2015 the surficial deposits in the area are dominated by post glacial sediments fine sand peat gravel and clay påsse 1988 the soil depth varies between 10 m and 20 m towards the coast and 5 m to 10 m inland underlain by bedrock which mainly consist of granite and gneiss sgu 2019 sgu 2020 both the soil and the bedrock have low buffer capacity allowing it to be highly susceptible to increased acid loads sjöström 1994 according to the köppen geiger climate classification halland is located in a zone of temperate climate with evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year kottek et al 2006 the average temperature in january is between 1 c and 3 c and around 15 16 c in july smhi 2021a the annual mean precipitation is 850 mm a 1 at the meteorological station of varberg fig 1b located ca 20 km northwest of the study area for the climate normal of 1991 2020 smhi 2021b the records of monthly precipitation between 2010 and 2020 show the highest amount of precipitation during the second half of the year july december with august and october as the wettest months according to the records the last years were exceptional in terms of dry and wet conditions in 2019 june was the driest month with only 18 mm of recorded precipitation the first intensive precipitation events after the dry summer were recorded in august with 128 mm of precipitation being the wettest month of the years during the following winter monthly mean precipitation was in line with the climate normal within this period temperatures varied between 20 c august and 3 c november however only 10 days were reported with a mean temperature below 0 c between november and march the weather condition between the dry summer 2019 and the end of winter 2020 sampling period can therefore be described as average wet with rare frost nights 2 2 soil sampling and analyses as soils have certain characteristics which can be observed or measured in situ e g soil ph colour iron precipitates or the typical rotten egg smell coming from hydrogen sulfide serving as first indicators of occurrence typically the soil profile of as soil consists of three zones easiest detectable by the soil ph åström 2001 1 the permanently unsaturated zone of low ph unless liming occurs 2 a zone of low ph ultra acidic conditions with intermittent reducing and oxidizing conditions depending on the groundwater level fluctuations and 3 a fully saturated zone of permanently reducing conditions and neutral ph these zones normally differ in metal concentration measured along the as soil profile mobilized metals from the permanently unsaturated zone leak into lower zones and eventually accumulate in the transition zone around the groundwater level sohlenius and öborn 2004 in addition sohlenius et al 2015 reported sulfur leakage from the permanently unsaturated zone into deeper soil layers therefore low metal and sulfur concentration in active as soils can indicate ripe soils slowly turning into post active as soils soil sampling was conducted at four different locations of the former lake ramsjö fig 2 in the period of september to november 2019 soil type and soil ph were determined each 0 1 m along the vertical soil profiles down to maximum 3 m depth mainly based on soil ph several different classification systems for as soil exist worldwide for this study the swedish finnish classification system boman et al 2018 is used which is summarized together with the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2015 in table 1 for aerobic incubation metal and sulfur analysis soil samples were collected from relevant and interesting depths following the sampling protocol described in becher et al 2019 briefly samples were taken from soil layers with i high organic content e g gyttja clay ii a low in situ ph ph 4 5 and iii from the fully saturated zone ph 6 the soil samples for the aerobic incubation were stored in chip trays appendix a1 and frequently moisturized with deionized water during incubation due to the different time span of the chemical processes turning potential as soils to active as soils second ph measurements of the soil samples were taken roughly 2 months after the field campaign the ph measurements were frequently continued until the decrease in ph was less than 0 1 ph units in 14 days which can be defined as a stabilized ph boman et al 2018 replications of the incubation test were not done for the metal and sulfur analysis the samples were dried at 50 c and afterwards homogenised to determine the concentrations in the soil samples in accordance with ss en iso 17294 2 the samples were digested using 7 m nitric acid in a hotblock before analysing them using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy icp sfms concentrations of the following metals were analysed arsenic as cadmium cd cobalt co chromium cr copper cu iron fe manganese mn nickel ni lead pb vanadium v and zinc zn in addition concentrations of barium ba beryllium be mercury hg sulfur s and strontium sr were analysed in the soil 2 3 surface water sampling the study area was divided into two smaller sections fig 2 1 ramsjö canal r and 2 the seven ditches d draining into ramsjö canal initial surface water samples were collected along ramsjö canal r1 r10 and each of the ditches d1 d7 during two separate events in late october and early november 2019 the water samples from the ditches d3 d7 were collected near the outlet point towards ramsjö canal in addition three samples from d3 d5 and d6 were taken at the opposite end of the ditches named d3 d5 and d6 these samples were taken with the purpose of investigating internal differences in metal concentrations along the ditches since al and fe mn complexes in the ditches were observed during in situ sampling appendix a2 the sampling points d1 and d2 represent different points of the same ditch entering the study site from the south sampling point d1 is located closest to the former lakefront of lake ramsjö in the vicinity of a small forest area and d2 in the centre of the study area surrounded by farmland measurements of ph water temperature and ec were taken in situ at every sampling point using a hannah multimeter hi 98194 water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm filters prior to the lab analysis for the icp ms measurement 0 1 ml of 65 nitric acid hno3 was added to the test tubes after filtration resulting in a hno3 concentration of 1 0 a volume of 8 ml of all water samples were analysed using a thermo scientific icap q icp ms considering the severe environmental impact of aluminium al its concentration was analysed additional to the eleven metals mention above to distinguish seasonal distribution of acid and metal leakage additional samples were taken from ditch d1 d3 d4 d5 d6 and d7 in january and march 2020 during these field campaigns no additional samples were collected from ramsjö canal d2 d3 d5 and d6 after filtration the metal concentrations of these samples were analysed in the same accredited laboratory as the soil samples from all water samples 20 ml were used to analyse dissolved organic carbon doc in a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph due to the lack of sufficient reference values for streams along the swedish west coast the metal concentrations were compared to literature values table 2 taken from naturvårdsverket 2008 and edén and björklund 1993 3 results 3 1 soil profiles the main outcome of the field investigation was summarised in the four soil profiles including soil type and ph values measured every 0 1 m fig 3 a general classification of the different soil layers and oxidised ph values at the end of aerobic incubation were added to fig 3 in addition metal concentrations of the analysed soil layers can be found in appendix a3 despite a spatial proximity of the sampling points the soil profiles differed from each other regarding general characteristics such as the composition of soil layers or the ph profile at each sampling sites a cultivated topsoil layer with a thickness of approximately 0 3 m was found the rest of the soil profiles consisted mainly of material with fine grain sizes taking the variable groundwater level into consideration the ph profiles followed in general the characteristic profile of as soil only the ph values of the permanently unsaturated zone appeared elevated but indication of liming were found in the study region during field work one of the fine grained materials found in three out of four soil profiles is gyttja clay at sampling site s1 greenish grey gyttja clay was found at a depth of 2 2 m below the surface whereas in profile s2 and s3 layers of grey gyttja clay with red and yellow mottles were found closer to the surface at 0 75 1 55 m and 1 1 2 0 m below the surface respectively in profile s3 the gyttja clay was interbedded by thin sand layers from all three gyttja clay layers samples for the aerobic incubation were taken fig 3 while the samples taken from s3 did not show any decrease in ph the samples taken from s1 dropped from almost neutral ph to ph 3 0 at s2 two samples were taken from the gyttja clay layer which was above the groundwater level at the time of sampling and therefore unsaturated after oxidation in the lab the ph of the samples closer to the surface decreased slightly from an already low ph of 4 1 to ph 3 9 and in the second sample from ph 7 0 to ph 3 1 from s3 one additional sample was taken from a light grey sandy clay with bright yellow and yellowish red mottles at a depth of 0 7 m below the surface the ph of this sample decreased from ph 4 3 to ph 4 0 additional samples for the aerobic incubation were also taken from site s4 where no gyttja clay was found two samples were taken from the bottom of the profile from two different layers of greyish loamy sand and two samples from a layer of light greyish brownish fine sand with dark red purple to black mottles 0 5 m below the surface and one of black peat 0 6 m below the surface these two layers were above or at the depths of the groundwater level at the time of sampling the ph of the latter decreased from already low ph to ph 4 3 and ph 3 3 respectively the highest drop in ph ph 4 7 to ph 2 8 was measured at a depth of 1 2 m below surface another important observation was the existence of shell remnants in the gyttja clay layers at site s2 1 2 1 5 m below the surface as well as s3 1 4 1 6 m and 1 9 m below the surface at site s2 the shell containing gyttja layer was underlaid by a thin peat layer a thin peat layer was also found at s4 at a depth of 0 6 m below the surface other observations worth mentioning were the existence of larger wood fragments at site s1 approx 1 0 m below the surface and s4 0 7 0 8 m and 1 0 m below the surface large differences were measured in the sulfur concentration of the soil profiles these differences occurred in the maximum concentration of the layers as well as the relative distribution along the profile at site s1 and s2 the sulfur concentration reached maxima of 12 300 mg kg 1 dm and 29 000 mg kg 1 dm respectively both maximum concentrations were measured in the lower part of the soil profile at site s1 both samples were taken from below the groundwater level at time of sampling at site s4 the maximum sulfur concentration of 4980 mg kg 1 dm was measured in the lower part of the profile whereas the highest sulfur concentration at site s3 2390 mg kg 1 dm was measured closer to the surface just below the groundwater level summarizing the metal concentrations along the profiles appendix a3 it can be stated that with a few exceptions the concentrations increased with depth in profile s1 and s3 whereas in profile s4 most metals had a higher concentration closer to the surface with few exceptions the metal concentrations in s4 and s3 were lower compared to the other two profiles 3 2 surface water 3 2 1 drainage system the ph values of the water in the drainage system ranged between acid conditions at d1 ph 3 8 and almost neutral conditions at d4 with ph 6 6 in october and november 2019 fig 4a the doc concentration showed an opposing pattern with the highest measured doc concentration of 10 1 mg l 1 at d1 and the lowest concentration at d4 1 7 mg l 1 it should be mentioned that no doc analysis was done for the samples taken at d2 and d6 the ec values ranged between 50 9 ms m 1 at site d4 and 129 4 ms m 1 at site d3 with little variation within the remaining sampling points the metal concentrations were elevated for al as cd co cr cu mn ni v and zn all exceeding the designated reference values of surface water of southern sweden fig 4 the largest exceedance was measured for al co mn and ni where the average values in the ditches exceeded the reference values by several magnitudes fe and pb concentrations exceeded the reference values at sites d1 d5 and d6 whereas at site d1 the measured fe concentrations were 10 times higher than the remaining sites increased metal concentrations were also measured at site d3 cd co mn and ni concentrations at site d5 as co cu and zn concentrations and at site d1 cr and fe concentrations on the contrary low metal concentrations were detected at site d4 most evident in al cd and mn the differences in metal concentrations and ph measured along ditch d3 d5 and d6 show a tendency of decreasing fe al zn cu and ni concentrations with increased ph measured in ditch d3 as ph increased from 4 9 d3 to 5 6 d3 deviation from this pattern were observed in mn and v concentrations which slightly increased with higher ph between d5 and d5 as well as d6 and d6 no obvious changes in ph were measured the mild temperatures during the sampling winter gave the opportunity to analyse potential impact of changing climate on the leaching seasonality of as soils in the nordic countries in order to investigate the influence of an absent ground frost period on leaching sampling of area d was conducted during three different sampling periods 1 autumn october november 2 winter january and 3 early spring march the seasonal distribution of ph ec and metal concentrations for the sampling winter 2019 2020 is presented in fig 5 the seasonal variation during the sampling winter followed a common pattern of lower ph and higher ec values in the autumn compared to the spring most prominent for ditch d5 d6 and d7 several of the metals al cd co mn ni and zn followed a trend of decreasing concentrations from autumn to the spring however the measured concentration exceeded the reference values even at the end of the winter deviations are noticeable in the concentrations of as and v where the results are similar between winter and spring while cr cu and pb concentrations had less distinctive seasonal patterns 3 2 2 ramsjö canal in october and november 2019 ph values at the sampling sites r1 to r10 fig 6a ranged between ph 6 5 r6 and ph 7 1 r10 hence indicating slightly acidic to neutral conditions the ph distribution along ramsjö canal had two general trends one of decreasing ph values between site r10 to r6 and one of slightly increasing ph values further downstream of r6 the ec values showed a slight increase from r10 to r7 and are rather stable between r6 and r1 the average ec value was 47 7 ms m 1 at all sample sites most metal concentrations exceeded the designated reference values most evidently in the concentrations of as cd co cu ni and v the highest exceedance was measured in co ni and mn concentrations exceptions were fe and pb with measured concentrations below the reference values however metal concentrations were not constant along ramsjö canal fig 5 around the location of the inlet of the drainage system r6 r7 and r8 concentrations of cd co cu mn zn and to some degree ni diverged from the rest of the canal concentrations of mn co ni and cd were highest at r7 whereas the concentrations of the same metals were low at r6 and r8 at site r7 the highest mn concentration was measured along ramsjö canal and at site r6 the concentration was lower than the reference value hence being the only site where the surface water of the canal did not exceed the reference value this excludes pb and fe concentrations which were not exceeded at any of the measurement points along ramsjö canal 4 discussion 4 1 as soils in halland continuous measurements of groundwater level were not available for the area and therefore no information about the state of the different soil layers however the situation can be assessed by analysing the ph values and sulfur concentrations based on the results of the in situ measurements and the aerobic incubation of the soil samples three of the soil profiles were classified as active as soils following the swedish finnish classification system table 1 at site s1 active as soil material was found at a depth of 1 3 1 6 m below surface and potential as soil material at a depth of 2 6 m below surface the sulfur concentration in the active as soil material was higher compared to the other profiles in combination with the ph drop during incubation it can be concluded that the activation of the active as soil layer happened more recently in soil profile s2 active as soil material was found at 0 8 m below surface and potential as soil material at 1 5 m below surface the relatively high sulfur concentration in the potential as material of soil profile s2 might be caused by on going leakage from the active layer in the profile the high ph value of the potential as soil material even though the layer was unsaturated at the time of measurement indicates an exceptionally low groundwater level in autumn 2019 at site s4 active as soil material was found at a depth of 0 5 0 6 m below surface and potential as soil material was found at 1 2 m below surface the sulfur concentrations was lower compared to the other two soil profiles with as soil material based on the available data no conclusive explanation can be done but two different possibilities can be named 1 the higher sand fraction in the soil profile s4 enhances the leaching of sulfur and likely metals and therefore causing an enrichment in the surrounding surface and especially groundwater or 2 the sample site s4 is located closer to the former shoreline of lake ramsjö than s2 and might therefore be more ripe due to an earlier oxidation none of the analysed layers of soil profile s3 did fulfil the requirements for a classification as as soil summarized as soil material had been discovered in layers of gyttja clay and loamy sand all the sampled soil profiles had in common that the soil was rich in silt with a varying content of organic matter and clay based on their proximity and the similarities in stratigraphy it can be concluded that the origin and genesis is the same for all sites the encountered differences between the profiles can help to understand the origin and genesis of the as soils in the region at site s2 and s3 shell fragments were found at similar depths in soil determined as gyttja clay in the soil profile s2 the depth of the shell fragments corresponded to a layer characterized as potential as soil material at site s3 all three samples were taken from a horizon just above the layer containing shell fragments a previous analysis on the regional geology of the area reported the finding of shell fragments of common cockles cerastoderma edule common periwinkles littorina littorea and needle whelks bittium reticulatum in gyttja clay layers påsse 1988 all three species require relatively high water temperatures and salt concentration påsse 1988 and therefore warm marine conditions which occurred during the postglacial transgression further the occurrence of peat layers both below and on top of the gyttja clay trace the alternating history of the region the fact that peat underlays gyttja clay with marine molluscs in s2 allows the conclusion that a terrestrial episode was followed by a marine transgression the second soil profile with an identified peat layer is s4 where the peat layer is enclosed by two layers of as soil material based on these characteristics it can be concluded that the formation of discovered as soil in the study region took place in shallow protected lagoons this also explains the high content of silt with varying organic fractions in the soil profiles the genesis in the study area hence resembles the one of as soils in mälardalen and skåne sohlenius et al 2015 åbjörnsson et al 2018 4 2 as soil impact on the water quality the surface water in the study area had elevated metal concentrations and ec along with decreased ph values since ec and ph of the water are commonly used parameters when evaluating potential influence of as soils on water bodies it can be concluded that the surface water in both the ditches and ramsjö canal are impacted by the adjacent as soil drainage however spatial differences in physicochemical properties were detected between the ditches most prominently between site d1 and d4 at site d1 the lowest ph combined with a high doc concentration was measured this might partly be explained by its location close to the small forest patch fig 2b which can favour the presence of organic acids additionally lowering the ph of the water in the ditch åström and corin 2000 åström 2001 but other possibilities such as the existence of as soils outside of the investigated area should also be considered compared to the surrounding ditches d4 had relatively high ph values and low metal concentrations unlike the other ditches of the area d4 is shallow and its maximum depth above the depth of the layers containing as soil material therefore d4 is not permanently in hydraulic contact to the source of contamination and can therefore act as an internal reference site for the area the only metal concentrations measured in d4 comparable to the other ditches is cu in a study by österholm and åström 2002 cu was found enriched in the plough layer of the soil 0 0 35 m likely due to the high organic content of this layer allowing it to form stable metal organic complexes the cu concentration at site d4 could hence be a result of the farming activities in the area additional internal differences were the generally elevated concentrations of cd co mn and ni at sites d3 and d5 compared to d7 all of which are associated with as soil drainage åström and björklund 1995 åström and åström 1997 åström and corin 2000 due to the proximity of d7 to the soil profile s4 the low metal concentrations in d7 might be explained by the maturity of the adjacent as soil combined with a higher sand fraction and hence a higher permeability of the soil the fe and pb concentrations measured in ramsjö canal do not exceed the designated reference values in general neither fe nor pb are commonly leached out from acid sulphate soils åström and corin 2000 lax 2005 åström 2001 this is due to a generally low mobilization capacity of pb and the dependency of mobilization determined by additional factors such as redox potential and organic content in case of fe nystrand and österholm 2013 andersson et al 2014 increased levels of fe in sulfuric water have however been observed by cook et al 2000 who further connected increased concentrations to a longer period of acid sulphate soil drainage the peak in fe observed at site d1 could therefore indicate prolonged leaching from a potentially not explored as soil outside of the investigated area enhanced v and as concentrations were measured in all samples retrieved from the ditches as well as ramsjö canal according to åström and björklund 1995 and åström 2001 the leachability of as and v is not related to the existence of as soils therefore the results suggests that the high abundance of these metals may be explained by natural occurrence of the metal in soils in halland and may not necessarily be a consequence of the occurrence of as soils in the region further the water samples did not show any clear accumulative pattern from the reference point of r10 towards the outlet at site r1 a feature previously observed by åström 2001 for a catchment in western finland the author explained the increased metal concentration downstream by an increasing amount of as soils towards the coast the lack of increased metal concentrations downstream of ramsjö canal could be another evidence of an irregular spatial patchy distribution of as soil in halland the most obvious alteration in metal concentrations along the canal can be detected around r7 for example in case of co cu mn and ni concentration given that site r7 is located just downstream of the inflow from d5 the increased metal concentrations at site r7 are explained by the high metal load from the ditch the sampling point r6 located downstream of r7 shows a depletion in metal concentrations it is likely that certain metals flocculate between site r7 to r6 due to the ph difference of water from the ditch and ramsjö canal and are thus not available in the water column downstream of site r7 furthermore the high metal load downstream of r6 suggests the presence of additional as soils or the remobilization of metals along the flow path 4 3 comparison to other as soil affected regions in fennoscandia since this is the first study related to as soil on the swedish west coast regional reference values were missing therefore other study sites from nordic countries were used as comparison table 3 these areas were selected based on the size of the stream and the corresponding catchment area d representative for all the small ditches was compared to studies conducted in small water streams åström and corin 2000 wennström 2017 ramsjö canal was instead compared to two finnish rivers 1 river petalax åström and åström 1997 with a catchment area of 96 km2 and therefore roughly 50 larger than ramsjö canal and 2 river munsala with a catchment area of 107 km2 åström 2001 given the differences in stream sizes the comparison should be considered as a first indication of the differences in soil leaching between the different areas since additional factors such as different pre processing of the samples e g filtration likely contributed to differences in metal concentrations future studies should analyse similarities and differences more qualitatively on this aspect åström and björklund 1995 and åström 2001 revealed a high ratio between unfiltered and filtered samples and conclude that acidic conditions allow for most elements to be associated with smaller sized particles 0 45 µm however åström and björklund 1995 stated an increased concentration by a factor of 50 for the environmentally significant metal al in unfiltered water samples implying that the potential removal of metal composition through filtration should be taken into consideration additionally differences in the buffer capacity of the soils contribute to differences in measured metal concentrations the results show that ph and ec measured in the surface water of area d are in accordance with the other affected catchments in finland and northern sweden for area r the ph values are slightly higher compared to the other studies while ec is in line with both the swedish and finnish studies ec values should however be used with caution given that they are controlled by the total ionic composition in the water rather than only reflecting the amount of so4 2 the fact that the surface water in the study areas has a slightly elevated ec compared to the samples reported by åström and corin 2000 is not certainly connected to as soil drainage but could also be influenced by the near shore location of the study site the influence of so4 2 ions on ec cannot be fully determined without an ionic analysis of the water comparing the metal concentrations of area d to those retrieved by åström and corin 2000 and wennström 2017 the concentrations of al as cd co mn ni and zn in area d are exceeding the metal concentrations of bläckträskbäcken in finland while falling short of the one in northern sweden norrbotten however cr cu fe and v concentrations in area d are lower compared to both study sites in finland and sweden this pattern is not seen when comparing area r with two studies from river petalax and river munsala in finland åström and åström 1997 åström 2001 as the values of area r are commonly lower in addition to differences in soil properties e g buffer capacity differences in metal concentrations are likely explained by as soil coverage in the areas the catchment of river petalax has an as soil coverage of 25 and the catchment of river munsala of 31 due to the presumed genesis of as soils in shallow lagoons and protected bays in halland the coverage might be lower compared to as soil affected areas around the baltic basin even though the sampling only covered a period of several months and results based on these few measurements might not be conclusive they are in line with the findings of toivonen et al 2019 stating a prolonged leakage from as soils in autumn related to changing climatic conditions the mild winter temperatures in halland during this period prohibited episodes of consecutive ground frost days in combination with persistent precipitation this resulted in continuous leaching during winter similar trends of increasing temperatures and precipitation in winter were observed for the study region as well as for large parts of sweden and finland nygren et al 2021 therefore the results emphasize the importance of considering climate change in the evaluation of current and future environmental risks related to as soils in fennoscandia 5 conclusion many previous studies have proven or summarized the ecological problematic arising from as soil drainage in sweden previous studies of as soil have been conducted around the baltic sea basin and primarily in the northern part of the country this study investigates the existence of as soils on the swedish west coast and evaluates its impact on adjacent surface water bodies the main findings of the study are the first determined active as soils reported from the more densely populated swedish west coast active and or potential as soils occur in organic rich postglacial sediments as soils are mainly discovered in the soil type described as gyttja clay but also in loamy sand therefore a thorough investigation of areas with similar conditions in halland is needed to evaluate the spatial distribution of as soils as soils in the study area were likely formed in shallow protected coastal lagoons during the postglacial transgression based on the concluded genesis a patchy occurrence of as soils can be expected this might complicate the detection of potential and or active as soils on the swedish west coast the occurrence of as soils has a negative impact on the water quality in the study area surface water in the areas has partially a low ph and elevated concentrations in metals associated with as soil drainage the concentrations of as and v which are also elevated in the surface water in the area might be explained by natural abundance connected to the specific soil properties rather than as soil leakage furthermore the results of the winter sampling indicate the importance of considering changing climatic conditions in management scenarios of discovered as soils in other parts of fennoscandia since other regions of halland and along the swedish west coast were inundated during the postglacial transgressions it is highly likely that as soils occur in other coastal areas as well this has already been proven by the latest discoveries of potential as soil during construction work close to the river ätran approximately 10 km south southeast of the study site unpublished credit authorship

8026,study region halland county located on the swedish west coast with a special focus on the area around ramsjö canal falkenberg municipality study focus this study contributes to the understanding of the development of active acid sulfate soils and environmental consequences of leaching from these soils in an area without previous investigations samples taken from different soil profiles in an agricultural area and water samples from the agricultural drainage system were analysed in ph electrical conductivity and metal concentrations to evaluate the on site situation the results of the soils sample analysis were compared to the national soil classification system and the water samples to areas in northern europe affected by acid sulfate soils new hydrological insights for the region the results prove the existence of active acid sulfate soils in a coastal area in halland in the study region acid sulfate soils were discovered in an agricultural area of drained wetland and peatland water samples taken from the drainage system and a man made canal flowing into kattegat sea have low ph combined with high electrical conductivity and increased metal concentrations this is a direct consequence of intensive leaching from the discovered acid sulfate soils in that area therefore this is the first case study proving the existence of acid sulfate soils and highlighting their environmental impact on surface water quality on the swedish west coast i e outside the baltic sea basin keywords acid sulfate soil agricultural drainage system contamination water quality sweden 1 introduction acid sulfate soil as soil is a well known natural phenomenon around the globe e g moormann 1963 minh et al 1997 cook et al 2000 barbiéro et al 2005 in literature these soils have been described as the nastiest soils in the world dent and pons 1995 due to their potential negative impact on the environment this is closely connected to their ability to lower the soil ph drastically into an ultra acidic range in this state these soils allow toxic metals to mobilize which potentially leak out of the soil matrix and pose a threat to surrounding ecosystems and freshwater bodies dent and pons 1995 as soils are in general divided into three different states e g fanning et al 2017 a potential as soils b active as soils and c post active as soils as soils originate from the process of bacterial deposition of organic matter in waterlogged but organic rich environments such as lagoons wetlands tidal swamps or eventually lake sediments dent and pons 1995 boman et al 2010 reaching the state of oxygen depletion anaerobic decomposition oxygen is substituted by other elements in the sediment accordingly sulfate so4 2 a species of high abundance in marine water is reduced into sulfide s2 while iron is reduced from the oxidized state of fe3 to fe2 the final product is iron sulfide fes2 or metastable iron sulfide fes which is common along the coastline of the baltic sea boman et al 2008 kept under reducing conditions the parent material remains chemically stable and is referred to as potential as soil through oxidation potential as soil turns into active as soil e g ritsema et al 1992 iron sulfide oxidizes by fast and slow kinetics to sulfuric acid h2so4 which severely increases the acidity of the soil boman et al 2010 an additional consequence of the low ph is that fe3 remains soluble and therefore reactive further acidifying the soil cook et al 2000 the acid environment created by the formation of sulfuric acid enables the dissolution and mobilization of other harmful metals which consequently increase their concentrations in recipient water bodies e g åström and åström 1997 åström 2001 commonly potentially harmful metals leached out from as soils are aluminium al cadmium cd cobalt co copper cu lithium li manganese mn nickel ni strontium sr and zinc zn due to the specific properties of the effluents saarinen et al 2013 suggested a combined analysis of both water acidity and electrical conductivity ec to investigate surface water in potentially affected areas leaching is generally increased during wet periods åström and björklund 1995 åström and corin 2000 åström 2001 for example in seasons with increased rainfall or during snow melt in winter leakage can be inhibited due to the low temperatures causing ground frost toivonen et al 2013 however based on the results of a field study in finland toivonen et al 2019 stated that leakage in autumn has been prolonged in the last decades due to changing climatic conditions periodicity and timing of acid leaching plays an important role in assessing the environmental risks related to as soils e g hudd and kjellman 2002 the list of harmful substances in the effluents is long and leads to various short term and long term e g urho et al 1990 sammut et al 1995 fältmarsch et al 2008 consequences one of the most environmentally significant metals is al being able to comprehensively reduce fish and invertebrates at concentrations above 0 5 mg l 1 nystrand and österholm 2013 in combination with low ph values this can lead to one of the most obvious direct impacts of effluents from as soils on aquatic ecosystems fish kill e g åström and björklund 1995 erixon 2009 in finland river kyrönjoki fish kills related to as soils were reported as early as in 1834 åström et al 2005 today records of as soils in fennoscandia mainly exist for the coastal regions around the gulf of bothnia in sweden e g lax 2005 becher et al 2019 and finland e g åström and björklund 1995 boman et al 2010 fältmarsch et al 2009 joukainen and yli halla 2003 mattbäck et al 2017 saarinen and kløve 2012 and the central swedish lowlands around lake mälaren and hjälmaren öborn 1989 these regions have been strongly influenced by the glacial history of the region previous studies e g by öborn 1989 sohlenius et al 1996 stated that the as soils found on the swedish east coast and the central swedish lowlands were primarily deposited during the littorina stage ca 7500 4000 bp during this period of mild temperatures the sea level strongly fluctuated in the southwestern parts of sweden due to the impact of sea level rise and isostatic rebound resulting into a period of recurring transgressions and regressions e g bjørnsen et al 2008 on the swedish west coast this period is known as tapes transgression as one consequence of the transgressions the sound öresund and great belt opened leading to the formation of the littorina sea further the increased main temperature davis et al 2003 enabled algae and other organism to flourish and the decomposition of the organic matter changed the environment at the sea bottom to an anoxic state since then continuing isostatic rebound has been elevating new areas of sulfidic sediments above the current sea level growing population and increased demand on agricultural and forestry land intensified the drainage of these areas needelman et al 2007 enabling the formation of active as soils for example in sediments of paleo lakes åbjörnsson et al 2018 or wetlands beucher et al 2017 it thus becomes clear that as soils are a considerable environmental concern in the nordic countries especially around the baltic sea in finland the diffuse runoff of certain metals from as soils equals or even exceeds the present day industrial discharges sundström et al 2002 and accounts for the largest sulfate flux in the country ekholm et al 2020 in view of the global climate change with expected changes in precipitation pattern shifting seasonality of groundwater recharge nygren et al 2020 and increased groundwater level dynamics the mobilization of metals might increase significantly in the future jarsjö et al 2020 in this scenario undetected as soils might contribute to the increased metal load as hidden contamination sources the highest shoreline of the littorina sea fig 1a is often used to define the upper limit of as soils around the baltic sea e g virtanen et al 2014 even though the geomorphological processes after the last glaciation on the swedish west coast differ from the one in the baltic sea basin in terms of salinity there are indications that these soils might occur on the more densely populated swedish west coast for example larsen 1978 suggested that sulfuric gyttja clays found in the course of reclamation on the danish east coast were deposited during tapes transgression and sjöström 1994 reported the presence of acid groundwater in combination with the occurrence of sulfate rich soils on the swedish west coast halland county therefore this study aims to 1 identify locations of potential and active as soils based on their physicochemical properties and 2 explore the potential physicochemical connection between as soils and the distribution of acidity and metals in the adjacent water bodies in an agricultural area on the swedish west coast 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study focuses on the region around ramsjö canal north of the city of falkenberg on the swedish west coast ramsjö canal crosses an area of postglacial silt gyttja clay anaerobic decay of peat and peat the area around ramsjö canal presents a good example of the anthropogenic influence in this part of sweden large parts of the county are still composed of forested land 52 but the creation of farmland today accounting for 44 of the land use has changed the environment drastically scb 2019 especially ditching as a common practice in developing good arable land has a huge impact on the local hydrology in the study area the former lake ramsjö and the adjoining marsh land were drained by a canal ramsjö canal fig 2a dug by hand between 1852 and 1858 with the intention of increasing the area of cultivated land in 1909 the remains of lake ramsjö were drained and ramsjö canal extended today ramsjö canal is 12 km long draining an area of approximately 60 km2 directly into the kattegat sea in the study area fig 2b several smaller ditches with varying depth ranging from approximately 0 4 m d4 to 1 0 m d5 drain into ramsjö canal the estuary of ramsjö canal is classified as a natura2000 habitat and therefore has a special national protection status for both aquatic and terrestrial species länsstyrelsen hallands län 2017 the study area had been submerged ca 50 m below the sea level highest coastline following deglaciation almost 16 000 bp the interaction between the isostatic rebound and the eustacy lifted the area above sea level around 11 000 bp during the following period of transgressions the maximum of approximately 13 m above present sea level was reached around 7500 bp påsse and daniels 2015 the surficial deposits in the area are dominated by post glacial sediments fine sand peat gravel and clay påsse 1988 the soil depth varies between 10 m and 20 m towards the coast and 5 m to 10 m inland underlain by bedrock which mainly consist of granite and gneiss sgu 2019 sgu 2020 both the soil and the bedrock have low buffer capacity allowing it to be highly susceptible to increased acid loads sjöström 1994 according to the köppen geiger climate classification halland is located in a zone of temperate climate with evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year kottek et al 2006 the average temperature in january is between 1 c and 3 c and around 15 16 c in july smhi 2021a the annual mean precipitation is 850 mm a 1 at the meteorological station of varberg fig 1b located ca 20 km northwest of the study area for the climate normal of 1991 2020 smhi 2021b the records of monthly precipitation between 2010 and 2020 show the highest amount of precipitation during the second half of the year july december with august and october as the wettest months according to the records the last years were exceptional in terms of dry and wet conditions in 2019 june was the driest month with only 18 mm of recorded precipitation the first intensive precipitation events after the dry summer were recorded in august with 128 mm of precipitation being the wettest month of the years during the following winter monthly mean precipitation was in line with the climate normal within this period temperatures varied between 20 c august and 3 c november however only 10 days were reported with a mean temperature below 0 c between november and march the weather condition between the dry summer 2019 and the end of winter 2020 sampling period can therefore be described as average wet with rare frost nights 2 2 soil sampling and analyses as soils have certain characteristics which can be observed or measured in situ e g soil ph colour iron precipitates or the typical rotten egg smell coming from hydrogen sulfide serving as first indicators of occurrence typically the soil profile of as soil consists of three zones easiest detectable by the soil ph åström 2001 1 the permanently unsaturated zone of low ph unless liming occurs 2 a zone of low ph ultra acidic conditions with intermittent reducing and oxidizing conditions depending on the groundwater level fluctuations and 3 a fully saturated zone of permanently reducing conditions and neutral ph these zones normally differ in metal concentration measured along the as soil profile mobilized metals from the permanently unsaturated zone leak into lower zones and eventually accumulate in the transition zone around the groundwater level sohlenius and öborn 2004 in addition sohlenius et al 2015 reported sulfur leakage from the permanently unsaturated zone into deeper soil layers therefore low metal and sulfur concentration in active as soils can indicate ripe soils slowly turning into post active as soils soil sampling was conducted at four different locations of the former lake ramsjö fig 2 in the period of september to november 2019 soil type and soil ph were determined each 0 1 m along the vertical soil profiles down to maximum 3 m depth mainly based on soil ph several different classification systems for as soil exist worldwide for this study the swedish finnish classification system boman et al 2018 is used which is summarized together with the world reference base for soil resources iuss working group wrb 2015 in table 1 for aerobic incubation metal and sulfur analysis soil samples were collected from relevant and interesting depths following the sampling protocol described in becher et al 2019 briefly samples were taken from soil layers with i high organic content e g gyttja clay ii a low in situ ph ph 4 5 and iii from the fully saturated zone ph 6 the soil samples for the aerobic incubation were stored in chip trays appendix a1 and frequently moisturized with deionized water during incubation due to the different time span of the chemical processes turning potential as soils to active as soils second ph measurements of the soil samples were taken roughly 2 months after the field campaign the ph measurements were frequently continued until the decrease in ph was less than 0 1 ph units in 14 days which can be defined as a stabilized ph boman et al 2018 replications of the incubation test were not done for the metal and sulfur analysis the samples were dried at 50 c and afterwards homogenised to determine the concentrations in the soil samples in accordance with ss en iso 17294 2 the samples were digested using 7 m nitric acid in a hotblock before analysing them using inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy icp sfms concentrations of the following metals were analysed arsenic as cadmium cd cobalt co chromium cr copper cu iron fe manganese mn nickel ni lead pb vanadium v and zinc zn in addition concentrations of barium ba beryllium be mercury hg sulfur s and strontium sr were analysed in the soil 2 3 surface water sampling the study area was divided into two smaller sections fig 2 1 ramsjö canal r and 2 the seven ditches d draining into ramsjö canal initial surface water samples were collected along ramsjö canal r1 r10 and each of the ditches d1 d7 during two separate events in late october and early november 2019 the water samples from the ditches d3 d7 were collected near the outlet point towards ramsjö canal in addition three samples from d3 d5 and d6 were taken at the opposite end of the ditches named d3 d5 and d6 these samples were taken with the purpose of investigating internal differences in metal concentrations along the ditches since al and fe mn complexes in the ditches were observed during in situ sampling appendix a2 the sampling points d1 and d2 represent different points of the same ditch entering the study site from the south sampling point d1 is located closest to the former lakefront of lake ramsjö in the vicinity of a small forest area and d2 in the centre of the study area surrounded by farmland measurements of ph water temperature and ec were taken in situ at every sampling point using a hannah multimeter hi 98194 water samples were filtered through 0 45 µm filters prior to the lab analysis for the icp ms measurement 0 1 ml of 65 nitric acid hno3 was added to the test tubes after filtration resulting in a hno3 concentration of 1 0 a volume of 8 ml of all water samples were analysed using a thermo scientific icap q icp ms considering the severe environmental impact of aluminium al its concentration was analysed additional to the eleven metals mention above to distinguish seasonal distribution of acid and metal leakage additional samples were taken from ditch d1 d3 d4 d5 d6 and d7 in january and march 2020 during these field campaigns no additional samples were collected from ramsjö canal d2 d3 d5 and d6 after filtration the metal concentrations of these samples were analysed in the same accredited laboratory as the soil samples from all water samples 20 ml were used to analyse dissolved organic carbon doc in a total organic carbon analyzer toc l cph due to the lack of sufficient reference values for streams along the swedish west coast the metal concentrations were compared to literature values table 2 taken from naturvårdsverket 2008 and edén and björklund 1993 3 results 3 1 soil profiles the main outcome of the field investigation was summarised in the four soil profiles including soil type and ph values measured every 0 1 m fig 3 a general classification of the different soil layers and oxidised ph values at the end of aerobic incubation were added to fig 3 in addition metal concentrations of the analysed soil layers can be found in appendix a3 despite a spatial proximity of the sampling points the soil profiles differed from each other regarding general characteristics such as the composition of soil layers or the ph profile at each sampling sites a cultivated topsoil layer with a thickness of approximately 0 3 m was found the rest of the soil profiles consisted mainly of material with fine grain sizes taking the variable groundwater level into consideration the ph profiles followed in general the characteristic profile of as soil only the ph values of the permanently unsaturated zone appeared elevated but indication of liming were found in the study region during field work one of the fine grained materials found in three out of four soil profiles is gyttja clay at sampling site s1 greenish grey gyttja clay was found at a depth of 2 2 m below the surface whereas in profile s2 and s3 layers of grey gyttja clay with red and yellow mottles were found closer to the surface at 0 75 1 55 m and 1 1 2 0 m below the surface respectively in profile s3 the gyttja clay was interbedded by thin sand layers from all three gyttja clay layers samples for the aerobic incubation were taken fig 3 while the samples taken from s3 did not show any decrease in ph the samples taken from s1 dropped from almost neutral ph to ph 3 0 at s2 two samples were taken from the gyttja clay layer which was above the groundwater level at the time of sampling and therefore unsaturated after oxidation in the lab the ph of the samples closer to the surface decreased slightly from an already low ph of 4 1 to ph 3 9 and in the second sample from ph 7 0 to ph 3 1 from s3 one additional sample was taken from a light grey sandy clay with bright yellow and yellowish red mottles at a depth of 0 7 m below the surface the ph of this sample decreased from ph 4 3 to ph 4 0 additional samples for the aerobic incubation were also taken from site s4 where no gyttja clay was found two samples were taken from the bottom of the profile from two different layers of greyish loamy sand and two samples from a layer of light greyish brownish fine sand with dark red purple to black mottles 0 5 m below the surface and one of black peat 0 6 m below the surface these two layers were above or at the depths of the groundwater level at the time of sampling the ph of the latter decreased from already low ph to ph 4 3 and ph 3 3 respectively the highest drop in ph ph 4 7 to ph 2 8 was measured at a depth of 1 2 m below surface another important observation was the existence of shell remnants in the gyttja clay layers at site s2 1 2 1 5 m below the surface as well as s3 1 4 1 6 m and 1 9 m below the surface at site s2 the shell containing gyttja layer was underlaid by a thin peat layer a thin peat layer was also found at s4 at a depth of 0 6 m below the surface other observations worth mentioning were the existence of larger wood fragments at site s1 approx 1 0 m below the surface and s4 0 7 0 8 m and 1 0 m below the surface large differences were measured in the sulfur concentration of the soil profiles these differences occurred in the maximum concentration of the layers as well as the relative distribution along the profile at site s1 and s2 the sulfur concentration reached maxima of 12 300 mg kg 1 dm and 29 000 mg kg 1 dm respectively both maximum concentrations were measured in the lower part of the soil profile at site s1 both samples were taken from below the groundwater level at time of sampling at site s4 the maximum sulfur concentration of 4980 mg kg 1 dm was measured in the lower part of the profile whereas the highest sulfur concentration at site s3 2390 mg kg 1 dm was measured closer to the surface just below the groundwater level summarizing the metal concentrations along the profiles appendix a3 it can be stated that with a few exceptions the concentrations increased with depth in profile s1 and s3 whereas in profile s4 most metals had a higher concentration closer to the surface with few exceptions the metal concentrations in s4 and s3 were lower compared to the other two profiles 3 2 surface water 3 2 1 drainage system the ph values of the water in the drainage system ranged between acid conditions at d1 ph 3 8 and almost neutral conditions at d4 with ph 6 6 in october and november 2019 fig 4a the doc concentration showed an opposing pattern with the highest measured doc concentration of 10 1 mg l 1 at d1 and the lowest concentration at d4 1 7 mg l 1 it should be mentioned that no doc analysis was done for the samples taken at d2 and d6 the ec values ranged between 50 9 ms m 1 at site d4 and 129 4 ms m 1 at site d3 with little variation within the remaining sampling points the metal concentrations were elevated for al as cd co cr cu mn ni v and zn all exceeding the designated reference values of surface water of southern sweden fig 4 the largest exceedance was measured for al co mn and ni where the average values in the ditches exceeded the reference values by several magnitudes fe and pb concentrations exceeded the reference values at sites d1 d5 and d6 whereas at site d1 the measured fe concentrations were 10 times higher than the remaining sites increased metal concentrations were also measured at site d3 cd co mn and ni concentrations at site d5 as co cu and zn concentrations and at site d1 cr and fe concentrations on the contrary low metal concentrations were detected at site d4 most evident in al cd and mn the differences in metal concentrations and ph measured along ditch d3 d5 and d6 show a tendency of decreasing fe al zn cu and ni concentrations with increased ph measured in ditch d3 as ph increased from 4 9 d3 to 5 6 d3 deviation from this pattern were observed in mn and v concentrations which slightly increased with higher ph between d5 and d5 as well as d6 and d6 no obvious changes in ph were measured the mild temperatures during the sampling winter gave the opportunity to analyse potential impact of changing climate on the leaching seasonality of as soils in the nordic countries in order to investigate the influence of an absent ground frost period on leaching sampling of area d was conducted during three different sampling periods 1 autumn october november 2 winter january and 3 early spring march the seasonal distribution of ph ec and metal concentrations for the sampling winter 2019 2020 is presented in fig 5 the seasonal variation during the sampling winter followed a common pattern of lower ph and higher ec values in the autumn compared to the spring most prominent for ditch d5 d6 and d7 several of the metals al cd co mn ni and zn followed a trend of decreasing concentrations from autumn to the spring however the measured concentration exceeded the reference values even at the end of the winter deviations are noticeable in the concentrations of as and v where the results are similar between winter and spring while cr cu and pb concentrations had less distinctive seasonal patterns 3 2 2 ramsjö canal in october and november 2019 ph values at the sampling sites r1 to r10 fig 6a ranged between ph 6 5 r6 and ph 7 1 r10 hence indicating slightly acidic to neutral conditions the ph distribution along ramsjö canal had two general trends one of decreasing ph values between site r10 to r6 and one of slightly increasing ph values further downstream of r6 the ec values showed a slight increase from r10 to r7 and are rather stable between r6 and r1 the average ec value was 47 7 ms m 1 at all sample sites most metal concentrations exceeded the designated reference values most evidently in the concentrations of as cd co cu ni and v the highest exceedance was measured in co ni and mn concentrations exceptions were fe and pb with measured concentrations below the reference values however metal concentrations were not constant along ramsjö canal fig 5 around the location of the inlet of the drainage system r6 r7 and r8 concentrations of cd co cu mn zn and to some degree ni diverged from the rest of the canal concentrations of mn co ni and cd were highest at r7 whereas the concentrations of the same metals were low at r6 and r8 at site r7 the highest mn concentration was measured along ramsjö canal and at site r6 the concentration was lower than the reference value hence being the only site where the surface water of the canal did not exceed the reference value this excludes pb and fe concentrations which were not exceeded at any of the measurement points along ramsjö canal 4 discussion 4 1 as soils in halland continuous measurements of groundwater level were not available for the area and therefore no information about the state of the different soil layers however the situation can be assessed by analysing the ph values and sulfur concentrations based on the results of the in situ measurements and the aerobic incubation of the soil samples three of the soil profiles were classified as active as soils following the swedish finnish classification system table 1 at site s1 active as soil material was found at a depth of 1 3 1 6 m below surface and potential as soil material at a depth of 2 6 m below surface the sulfur concentration in the active as soil material was higher compared to the other profiles in combination with the ph drop during incubation it can be concluded that the activation of the active as soil layer happened more recently in soil profile s2 active as soil material was found at 0 8 m below surface and potential as soil material at 1 5 m below surface the relatively high sulfur concentration in the potential as material of soil profile s2 might be caused by on going leakage from the active layer in the profile the high ph value of the potential as soil material even though the layer was unsaturated at the time of measurement indicates an exceptionally low groundwater level in autumn 2019 at site s4 active as soil material was found at a depth of 0 5 0 6 m below surface and potential as soil material was found at 1 2 m below surface the sulfur concentrations was lower compared to the other two soil profiles with as soil material based on the available data no conclusive explanation can be done but two different possibilities can be named 1 the higher sand fraction in the soil profile s4 enhances the leaching of sulfur and likely metals and therefore causing an enrichment in the surrounding surface and especially groundwater or 2 the sample site s4 is located closer to the former shoreline of lake ramsjö than s2 and might therefore be more ripe due to an earlier oxidation none of the analysed layers of soil profile s3 did fulfil the requirements for a classification as as soil summarized as soil material had been discovered in layers of gyttja clay and loamy sand all the sampled soil profiles had in common that the soil was rich in silt with a varying content of organic matter and clay based on their proximity and the similarities in stratigraphy it can be concluded that the origin and genesis is the same for all sites the encountered differences between the profiles can help to understand the origin and genesis of the as soils in the region at site s2 and s3 shell fragments were found at similar depths in soil determined as gyttja clay in the soil profile s2 the depth of the shell fragments corresponded to a layer characterized as potential as soil material at site s3 all three samples were taken from a horizon just above the layer containing shell fragments a previous analysis on the regional geology of the area reported the finding of shell fragments of common cockles cerastoderma edule common periwinkles littorina littorea and needle whelks bittium reticulatum in gyttja clay layers påsse 1988 all three species require relatively high water temperatures and salt concentration påsse 1988 and therefore warm marine conditions which occurred during the postglacial transgression further the occurrence of peat layers both below and on top of the gyttja clay trace the alternating history of the region the fact that peat underlays gyttja clay with marine molluscs in s2 allows the conclusion that a terrestrial episode was followed by a marine transgression the second soil profile with an identified peat layer is s4 where the peat layer is enclosed by two layers of as soil material based on these characteristics it can be concluded that the formation of discovered as soil in the study region took place in shallow protected lagoons this also explains the high content of silt with varying organic fractions in the soil profiles the genesis in the study area hence resembles the one of as soils in mälardalen and skåne sohlenius et al 2015 åbjörnsson et al 2018 4 2 as soil impact on the water quality the surface water in the study area had elevated metal concentrations and ec along with decreased ph values since ec and ph of the water are commonly used parameters when evaluating potential influence of as soils on water bodies it can be concluded that the surface water in both the ditches and ramsjö canal are impacted by the adjacent as soil drainage however spatial differences in physicochemical properties were detected between the ditches most prominently between site d1 and d4 at site d1 the lowest ph combined with a high doc concentration was measured this might partly be explained by its location close to the small forest patch fig 2b which can favour the presence of organic acids additionally lowering the ph of the water in the ditch åström and corin 2000 åström 2001 but other possibilities such as the existence of as soils outside of the investigated area should also be considered compared to the surrounding ditches d4 had relatively high ph values and low metal concentrations unlike the other ditches of the area d4 is shallow and its maximum depth above the depth of the layers containing as soil material therefore d4 is not permanently in hydraulic contact to the source of contamination and can therefore act as an internal reference site for the area the only metal concentrations measured in d4 comparable to the other ditches is cu in a study by österholm and åström 2002 cu was found enriched in the plough layer of the soil 0 0 35 m likely due to the high organic content of this layer allowing it to form stable metal organic complexes the cu concentration at site d4 could hence be a result of the farming activities in the area additional internal differences were the generally elevated concentrations of cd co mn and ni at sites d3 and d5 compared to d7 all of which are associated with as soil drainage åström and björklund 1995 åström and åström 1997 åström and corin 2000 due to the proximity of d7 to the soil profile s4 the low metal concentrations in d7 might be explained by the maturity of the adjacent as soil combined with a higher sand fraction and hence a higher permeability of the soil the fe and pb concentrations measured in ramsjö canal do not exceed the designated reference values in general neither fe nor pb are commonly leached out from acid sulphate soils åström and corin 2000 lax 2005 åström 2001 this is due to a generally low mobilization capacity of pb and the dependency of mobilization determined by additional factors such as redox potential and organic content in case of fe nystrand and österholm 2013 andersson et al 2014 increased levels of fe in sulfuric water have however been observed by cook et al 2000 who further connected increased concentrations to a longer period of acid sulphate soil drainage the peak in fe observed at site d1 could therefore indicate prolonged leaching from a potentially not explored as soil outside of the investigated area enhanced v and as concentrations were measured in all samples retrieved from the ditches as well as ramsjö canal according to åström and björklund 1995 and åström 2001 the leachability of as and v is not related to the existence of as soils therefore the results suggests that the high abundance of these metals may be explained by natural occurrence of the metal in soils in halland and may not necessarily be a consequence of the occurrence of as soils in the region further the water samples did not show any clear accumulative pattern from the reference point of r10 towards the outlet at site r1 a feature previously observed by åström 2001 for a catchment in western finland the author explained the increased metal concentration downstream by an increasing amount of as soils towards the coast the lack of increased metal concentrations downstream of ramsjö canal could be another evidence of an irregular spatial patchy distribution of as soil in halland the most obvious alteration in metal concentrations along the canal can be detected around r7 for example in case of co cu mn and ni concentration given that site r7 is located just downstream of the inflow from d5 the increased metal concentrations at site r7 are explained by the high metal load from the ditch the sampling point r6 located downstream of r7 shows a depletion in metal concentrations it is likely that certain metals flocculate between site r7 to r6 due to the ph difference of water from the ditch and ramsjö canal and are thus not available in the water column downstream of site r7 furthermore the high metal load downstream of r6 suggests the presence of additional as soils or the remobilization of metals along the flow path 4 3 comparison to other as soil affected regions in fennoscandia since this is the first study related to as soil on the swedish west coast regional reference values were missing therefore other study sites from nordic countries were used as comparison table 3 these areas were selected based on the size of the stream and the corresponding catchment area d representative for all the small ditches was compared to studies conducted in small water streams åström and corin 2000 wennström 2017 ramsjö canal was instead compared to two finnish rivers 1 river petalax åström and åström 1997 with a catchment area of 96 km2 and therefore roughly 50 larger than ramsjö canal and 2 river munsala with a catchment area of 107 km2 åström 2001 given the differences in stream sizes the comparison should be considered as a first indication of the differences in soil leaching between the different areas since additional factors such as different pre processing of the samples e g filtration likely contributed to differences in metal concentrations future studies should analyse similarities and differences more qualitatively on this aspect åström and björklund 1995 and åström 2001 revealed a high ratio between unfiltered and filtered samples and conclude that acidic conditions allow for most elements to be associated with smaller sized particles 0 45 µm however åström and björklund 1995 stated an increased concentration by a factor of 50 for the environmentally significant metal al in unfiltered water samples implying that the potential removal of metal composition through filtration should be taken into consideration additionally differences in the buffer capacity of the soils contribute to differences in measured metal concentrations the results show that ph and ec measured in the surface water of area d are in accordance with the other affected catchments in finland and northern sweden for area r the ph values are slightly higher compared to the other studies while ec is in line with both the swedish and finnish studies ec values should however be used with caution given that they are controlled by the total ionic composition in the water rather than only reflecting the amount of so4 2 the fact that the surface water in the study areas has a slightly elevated ec compared to the samples reported by åström and corin 2000 is not certainly connected to as soil drainage but could also be influenced by the near shore location of the study site the influence of so4 2 ions on ec cannot be fully determined without an ionic analysis of the water comparing the metal concentrations of area d to those retrieved by åström and corin 2000 and wennström 2017 the concentrations of al as cd co mn ni and zn in area d are exceeding the metal concentrations of bläckträskbäcken in finland while falling short of the one in northern sweden norrbotten however cr cu fe and v concentrations in area d are lower compared to both study sites in finland and sweden this pattern is not seen when comparing area r with two studies from river petalax and river munsala in finland åström and åström 1997 åström 2001 as the values of area r are commonly lower in addition to differences in soil properties e g buffer capacity differences in metal concentrations are likely explained by as soil coverage in the areas the catchment of river petalax has an as soil coverage of 25 and the catchment of river munsala of 31 due to the presumed genesis of as soils in shallow lagoons and protected bays in halland the coverage might be lower compared to as soil affected areas around the baltic basin even though the sampling only covered a period of several months and results based on these few measurements might not be conclusive they are in line with the findings of toivonen et al 2019 stating a prolonged leakage from as soils in autumn related to changing climatic conditions the mild winter temperatures in halland during this period prohibited episodes of consecutive ground frost days in combination with persistent precipitation this resulted in continuous leaching during winter similar trends of increasing temperatures and precipitation in winter were observed for the study region as well as for large parts of sweden and finland nygren et al 2021 therefore the results emphasize the importance of considering climate change in the evaluation of current and future environmental risks related to as soils in fennoscandia 5 conclusion many previous studies have proven or summarized the ecological problematic arising from as soil drainage in sweden previous studies of as soil have been conducted around the baltic sea basin and primarily in the northern part of the country this study investigates the existence of as soils on the swedish west coast and evaluates its impact on adjacent surface water bodies the main findings of the study are the first determined active as soils reported from the more densely populated swedish west coast active and or potential as soils occur in organic rich postglacial sediments as soils are mainly discovered in the soil type described as gyttja clay but also in loamy sand therefore a thorough investigation of areas with similar conditions in halland is needed to evaluate the spatial distribution of as soils as soils in the study area were likely formed in shallow protected coastal lagoons during the postglacial transgression based on the concluded genesis a patchy occurrence of as soils can be expected this might complicate the detection of potential and or active as soils on the swedish west coast the occurrence of as soils has a negative impact on the water quality in the study area surface water in the areas has partially a low ph and elevated concentrations in metals associated with as soil drainage the concentrations of as and v which are also elevated in the surface water in the area might be explained by natural abundance connected to the specific soil properties rather than as soil leakage furthermore the results of the winter sampling indicate the importance of considering changing climatic conditions in management scenarios of discovered as soils in other parts of fennoscandia since other regions of halland and along the swedish west coast were inundated during the postglacial transgressions it is highly likely that as soils occur in other coastal areas as well this has already been proven by the latest discoveries of potential as soil during construction work close to the river ätran approximately 10 km south southeast of the study site unpublished credit authorship

8027,study region jingdian irrigation district northwest china study focus in arid regions there is a significant lag in groundwater recharge due to the large thickness of vadose zone for areas with insufficient hydrogeological data it is quite difficult to calculate the delayed recharge of groundwater an improved transfer function itf is established based on the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone for areas lacking hydro geological data and is then used for calculation of the delayed recharge of groundwater new hydrological insights for the region the thickness of the vadose zone is an important factor affecting the delayed recharge of groundwater when the depth of groundwater is less than 50 m there is a linear positive correlation between the thickness of the vadose zone and the lag time for itf parameters n and k the number of linear reservoirs n increases as the thickness of the vadose zone increases and the 1 m thickness of the vadose zone is equivalent to 0 47 linear reservoirs the storage ability parameter k increases as groundwater depth increases with an increased rate of 8 89 and 0 62 day m when the water table depth is less than 8 m or greater than 8 m in this paper a simple improvement to the calculation method for groundwater recharge is of great reference significance for calculating groundwater resources for irrigation regions in similar areas keywords arid area irrigation regions groundwater recharge vadose zone lag 1 introduction groundwater resources are essential for arid and semi arid regions yao et al 2015 as they guarantee water for agricultural domestic and industrial use while maintaining a healthy ecosystem hayashi and rosenberry 2002 there are several water diversion and irrigation projects in northwest china s arid areas and they ensure the development of local agriculture while also improving the ecological environment of both the irrigation area and the surrounding areas zhang 2015 intense human activity has altered the natural water cycle process in these irrigation areas and the water cycle process of diversion irrigation return has played an important part there wang et al 2006 the groundwater source in the water diversion irrigation area is mostly effective infiltration which is caused by rainfall and irrigation simons et al 2015 groundwater recharge generally has a significant lag in certain areas with large groundwater depth wang et al 2021 su 2018 when using models such as modflow for groundwater numerical simulation infiltration coefficient method misstear et al 2009 saghravani 2013 is often used to estimate groundwater recharge in some simple groundwater models the amount of recharge to groundwater from rainfall and irrigation return is simplified by the product of the sum of precipitation and irrigation and an infiltration coefficient yao et al 2015 however because the water movement in the unsaturated zone was restricted mostly in arid regions the lag time will continue to increase with the increase of groundwater depth lu et al 2011a 2011b therefore the lag effect caused by unsaturated flow cannot be ignored in groundwater models hydrus numerical simulation method can well deal with the problem of groundwater recharge skaggs et al 2004 jiménez martínez et al 2009 and poch massegú et al 2014 using hydraus 1d to calculate groundwater recharge good results are obtained the numerical simulation model can predict the impact of different factors such as lithology of vadose zone meteorological conditions and land use type on groundwater recharge but the measured data are needed to identify and verify the model there are not enough vadose zone data for the establishment of hydrus model in some irrigation areas in underdeveloped areas of northwest china so it is difficult to calculate groundwater recharge by numerical simulation method the transfer function can calculate the delayed recharge of groundwater without enough soil data in the vadose zone which makes up for the disadvantage of more data requirement in numerical simulation the transfer function method treats the vadose zone as a system and effective surface infiltration and groundwater recharge are the system s input and output the relationship between effective surface infiltration and groundwater recharge is linked by the transfer function o reilly 2004 the transfer function method treats the vadose zone as a system and effective surface infiltration and groundwater recharge are the system s input and output the relationship between effective surface infiltration and groundwater recharge is linked by the transfer function there are two types of transfer function method analytical model and empirical model chen 1998 proposed an empirical weight function ewf after conducting several experiments and noted that the transfer function of groundwater recharge can be expressed using the probability density function of the poisson distribution li et al 2005 used ewf for dealing with the infiltration of rainfall rivers reservoirs canal systems and irrigation in the modflow model which produced excellent simulation results hu and chen 2006 used ewf in examining river and rainfall induced infiltration recharge in groundwater numerical simulation the results proving that the ewf method can effectively solve the delayed groundwater recharge issues wang and zhou 2009 noted that an advantage of using ewf for treating the delayed recharge of groundwater is that it only requires knowledge of the groundwater depth and the characteristic parameters of the vadose zone however the results of the numerical simulation performed by qian et al 2013 showed ewf to not be applicable when the vadose zone particles are finer and groundwater depth is deep in addition as ewf is an empirical method that lacks reliable theoretical support these shortcomings hinder the development and application of the ewf method due to some limitations the ewf method is only used in the numerical simulation of groundwater in some areas of china in addition allison et al 1990 achieved good results using a log normally distributed probability density function to describe groundwater recharge for different land units an instantaneous unit hydrograph is generally used for flood forecasting moura et al 2021 monajemi et al 2021 li et al 2020 a method which is suitable for rainfall events with high intensity short duration and small timescale minutes and hours besbes and marsily 1984 proposed the instantaneous unit hydrograph for the vadose zone based on the nash linear reservoir model nash 1957 believing the groundwater recharge process that is caused by the impulse infiltration event could be calculated using the gamma distribution s density function the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone is applied in certain cases of groundwater recharge calculation wu et al 1997 o reilly 2004 cao et al 2016 however these studies do not take the impact of infiltration events on groundwater recharge on a large timescale into account compared to surface runoff groundwater recharge displays relatively smooth fluctuations which are generally calculated on a daily and monthly scale the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone that is established based on impulse infiltration event has some limitations on a large timescale therefore in order to accurately calculate the delayed recharge of groundwater in arid areas a transfer function that is suitable for a large timescale must be developed jid is a typical water diversion irrigation area in an arid area of northwest china the development of groundwater resources in this irrigation area is relatively limited and has great potential the accurate calculation of groundwater replenishment rate will guarantee efficient water resource usage in the irrigation area since jid was established the diverted yellow river has been the main water source in the irrigation area and relatively little groundwater research has been conducted particularly regarding the delayed recharge of groundwater this paper uses the sies and 14 field profiles of jid as examples and employs a simply improved transfer function and hydrus 1d model for calculation of the groundwater recharge that is caused by effective infiltration this paper s main objectives are 1 from the sies analyze the impact mechanism of varying groundwater depths and soil textures on the delayed recharge of groundwater and analyze the physical meaning and influencing factors of itf parameters 2 reveal the changes and influencing factors effective infiltration has from the 14 jid profiles at yearly and monthly scales 3 reveal the lag law of groundwater recharge and quantitatively analyze the influence vadose zone thickness has on the lag time of groundwater recharge and itf parameters in jid this study provides a simple and improved transfer function for groundwater recharge calculation little quantitative analysis of the effect of vadose zone thickness on the hysteresis of groundwater recharge has been conducted and this paper s research results can provide references for other irrigation areas in arid areas 2 method 2 1 research program the main research content of this paper fig 1 is to improve the accuracy of groundwater recharge calculation through the improved conversion function and then reveal the law of groundwater lag recharge through the example analysis of jingdian irrigation district the purpose of hydrus theoretical modeling is to analyze the variation law of parameters in itf and the influence of individual factors such as groundwater depth and soil texture on each parameter can be judged by the control variable method the situation at the site is relatively complex with the depth of groundwater soil texture and soil layer structure being relatively complex it is also necessary to verify the availability of the itf in complex environments through field modeling which makes this study more complete 2 2 transfer function of groundwater recharge for calculation of the delayed recharge of groundwater an ewf was proposed by chen 1998 the weight function is defined as the function of the weight of groundwater recharge that is caused by an sie changing with the number of the lag timestep the weight function satisfies the sum of the weight for all lag timesteps as being 1 that is 1 τ 0 f τ 1 where f τ is the weight function of groundwater recharge that is caused by an sie and τ is the number of lag timesteps of the groundwater recharge chen 1998 obtained the ewf model which satisfies eq 1 following a great deal of research and this can be expressed using the probability density function of the poisson distribution 2 f τ d b τ τ e d b where d is groundwater depth or vadose zone thickness m b is the characteristic parameter of the vadose zone and m e is the base of the natural logarithm o reilly 2004 noted that when calculating groundwater recharge using the transfer function movement of water in the vadose zone is a linear process therefore the groundwater recharge at any timestep can be calculated using linear superposition 3 r i i 1 i e i τ f τ where r i is the groundwater recharge at the timestep i cm and i e i τ is an effective infiltration at the timestep i τ cm besbes and marsily 1984 established an instantaneous unit hydrograph model for the vadose zone that was based on the linear reservoir model nash 1957 for calculation of groundwater recharge that is caused by an impulse infiltration event the instantaneous unit hydrograph model treats the vadose zone as a series of linear reservoirs and groundwater recharge is the result of regulation of the impulse infiltration event by the linear reservoir assuming that to be a linear relationship between the storage w n and the outflow q n of the reservoir the equations of the linear reservoir are established based on the principle of water balance 4 q n 1 q n d w n d t w n k n q n where k n is the storage ability parameters of the n th linear reservoir if the regulation and storage effects of n linear reservoirs are identical then k k 1 k 2 k 3 k n eq 4 is solved and the outflow of the n th linear reservoir is expressed as 5 q n 1 1 k d d t n q 0 where q 0 is the inflow of the first linear reservoir when the inflow of the first linear reservoir is an impulse infiltration event q 0 δ t laplace integral transformation is used to solve eq 5 and obtain the instantaneous unit hydrograph for the vadose zone 6 f δ t 1 k γ n t k n 1 e t k where f δ t is the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone and γ n is the gamma function eq 6 represents the groundwater recharge that is caused by an impulse infiltration event the impulse infiltration event refers to an event of infinite intensity with a total infiltration of 1 in an infinitely small time there is obviously generally no impulse infiltration in rainfall or irrigation additionally regardless of the values of parameters n and k eq 6 is a curve that passes through the origin and is also inconsistent with the actual situation when groundwater depth is low the infiltration is able to produce groundwater in a short time period in this situation eq 6 can no longer be applied in order to solve this problem the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone can be slightly improved using an s curve method s curve refers to the groundwater recharge that is caused by continuous impulse infiltration events and this is expressed as the integration of the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone 7 s t 0 t f δ x d x γ n t k γ n where γ is the lower incomplete gamma function which is calculated using the following equation 8 γ n t k 0 t k x n 1 e x d x the s curve is a monotonically increasing curve that has a value range of between 0 and 1 the s t curve can be shifted to the right by a unit timestep in order to obtain a delay curve s t 1 in each timestep the area between the two s curves is the weight of groundwater recharge therefore the weight of groundwater recharge for any timestep is obtained by integration 9 f τ τ i τ 1 s t s t 1 d t it is notable that the domain of the s t 1 curve is t 1 so therefore when t 1 s t 1 0 eq 7 can be incorporated into eq 9 in order to obtain the integral expression of the weight 10 f τ τ τ 1 γ n i t k γ n t 1 k γ n d t eq 10 is a complex integral and the approximate solution is solved using the difference method 11 f τ γ n τ 1 k γ n τ 1 k 2 γ n eq 11 is the improved transfer function itf the parameters n and k represent the number of linear reservoirs and one reservoir s storage ability respectively fig 2 is the curve of itf when n and k have different values and itf shape is quite flexible when the values of k and n are lower the number of lag timesteps for the itf is smaller and the peak value of the itf is greater as when k and n are small the vadose zone s storage ability is poor the infiltration event has more impact on groundwater recharge and the lag time is short as k and n continuously increase the itf curve gradually becomes flat and the vadose zone s storage ability gradually increases this results in the peak value of itf decreasing and lag time increasing compared to the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone itf is suitable for calculating both groundwater recharge on the minute and hour scales and groundwater recharge on the daily and monthly scales eq 3 and eq 11 can be combined to obtain the itf model for calculating groundwater recharge 12 r i τ 0 i i e i τ γ n τ 1 k γ n τ 1 k 2 γ n 2 3 calculation of effective infiltration effective infiltration can be calculated using a simple bucket model guswa et al 2002 walker et al 2002 the bucket model regards the root zone as a bucket for the storage of water when the total storage of the root zone exceeds its maximum capacity effective infiltration is generated effective infiltration is expressed as 13 i e i t i t max for t i t max 0 for t i t max where i e i is the effective infiltration at timestep i mm and t i and t max are the total storage at timestep i and the maximum capacity of the root zone which are calculated using the following equations 14 t max d rz θ fc θ wp different situations must be considered in the calculation of t i when i e i 1 0 15 t i t max i n i p e i e t c i for t max i n i p

4 determination of lag time interval cross correlation is used for the evaluation of the lag time of two series of statistical data l j e lee et al 2006 this method is used for determining the lag time interval between groundwater recharge and effective infiltration the cross correlation coefficient is calculated using the following formula 20 ρ τ e x t μ x y t k μ y σ x σ y where ρ τ is the cross correlation with the number of lag timestep τ x t and y t are the effective infiltration series and groundwater recharge series and σ x and σ y are the standard deviation of the effective infiltration series and groundwater recharge series the lag time with a cross correlation of more than 2 n is in the 95 confidence interval diggle 1990 where n is the number of the data series based on the cross correlation the lag time interval between groundwater recharge and effective infiltration is then determined 2 5 determination of improved transfer function parameters the least squares method is employed for determining the itf parameters 21 φ i 1 r tf i n k r ns i 2 where φ is the sum of the squared differences between two series of data and r tf and r ns are groundwater recharge calculated using itf and hydrus 1d when φ is smallest n and k are optimal parameters 3 model setup 3 1 simulation for single infiltration event 3 1 1 experimental design the hydrus 1d model is used for simulating the impact of sie on groundwater recharge the simulation time interval is one day and the infiltration events with 50 mm day flux on the first day three different soil texture types sandy loam loam and silt loam under the conditions of five different groundwater depths 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 m are simulated the simulation plan and the soil parameters are displayed in table 1 3 1 2 mathematical model the groundwater recharge that is caused by an sie can be generalized as being a one dimensional vertical infiltration process the differential equation of the hydrus 1d model is expressed as simunek et al 1999 22 θ t z k h h z 1 where z is the depth with the ground as the reference surface in cm t is time in days θ is the volumetric water content of the soil in cm3 cm3 h is the pressure head in cm and k θ is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in cm day the curves of soil water retention are obtained based on the van genuchten 1980 model and mualem 1976 model 23 θ h θ

are the shape parameters of the curves of soil water retention where m 1 1 n and s e is the soil saturation which is expressed as 25 s e θ θ r θ s θ r the upper boundary of the model is the surface which receives infiltration recharge and can be generalized as a variable flux boundary 26 k h h z 1 i 0 t where i 0 t is the given infiltration flux at the upper boundary in mm day the lower boundary is the groundwater table and the pressure head is zero therefore it can be generalized as a constant pressure head boundary 27 h 0 the initial pressure head of the model adopts the lower boundary as 0 the upper boundary is the negative value of the thickness of the vadose zone and the middle is assigned according to linear interpolation 3 2 field simulation 3 2 1 study area and field profiles jid is in jingtai and gulang counties in the central area of gansu province china fig 3 it is bordered by the yellow river in the east the tengger desert in the north and the changling mountains in the south the irrigation method in jid is electric irrigation and the primary water source is the yellow river the average yearly rainfall is 186 mm and average water surface evaporation is 2123 mm there is a scarcity of surface water sources in jid in addition to there being fewer drainage rivers in the southwest of jid the rivers are generally dry and without water the groundwater depth in jid is about 1 55 m and groundwater runs from southwest to northeast the main groundwater recharge sources are irrigation and rainfall infiltration while the main drainage methods are groundwater runoff in the north and river drainage in the east the main crop types in jid are spring wheat barley corn soybeans flax artichokes melons wolfberries and forest fruits a total of 14 profiles hydrogeological boreholes were chosen for the field simulation as can be seen in fig 4 based on the soil texture types of the vadose zone that were exposed by the 14 hydrogeological boreholes the profile soil texture can be divided into fine grained soil which is dominated by silt loam medium grained soil which is dominated by sandy loam and coarse grained soil which is dominated by sand based on the distribution characteristics of the soil texture in the jid soil samples with different soil textures were taken from three typical sampling points in the jid in order to determine the soil parameters 3 2 2 mathematical model different from sie modeling the field simulation first uses the bucket model to calculate the effective infiltration at the bottom of the root zone and then uses the hydrus model to simulate the water transport process in the unsaturated zone between the bottom of the root zone and the groundwater surface fig 5 field simulations have varying initial and boundary conditions the effective infiltration at the bottom of the root zone is calculated using eq 13 therefore the bottom of the root zone is taken as the upper boundary of the numerical model for field simulations and this is generalized as the variable flux boundary 28 k h h z 1 i e t the lower boundary of the model is the groundwater surface and this is generalized as the constant pressure head boundary 29 h 0 the initial pressure head of the numerical model is affected by previous infiltration events and therefore the initial water head distribution is pre simulated using the infiltration event from the previous year or years and the pressure head at the end of the pre simulation result is taken as the initial condition of the current model 30 h h 0 z where h 0 z is the initial pressure head the hydrus 1d model uses the following equation for automatic calculation of the groundwater recharge at the lower boundary during the simulation process 31 r t k h h z 3 2 3 data source and soil parameters the meteorological data used in this study was obtained from jingtai county national meteorological station the data required for calculating crop water requirements was provided by jingdian administration including crop planting area type planting structure growth period and crop coefficient irrigation data was provided by the jingdian administration the groundwater level data was measured using 14 monitoring wells in jid the soil parameters were measured using laboratory tests on typical soil samples that were conducted in the jid the soil textures were determined using the classification system of the international society for soil science isss and the volume percentage of clay silt and sand were measured by a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 the planting types in the jid are complex and the root depths of crops during different growth periods are different this article combines the actual situation of the jid and takes the weighted average value of the root zone thickness as 0 3 m soil water retention curves were measured using a high speed centrifuge for soil kokusan h 1400pf and the parameters θ r θ s α and n were fitted using retc software van et al 1992 saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured using the constant head method based on darcy s law field capacity θ fc was measured using the ring knife method wilting point θ wp was taken as the water content value on the soil water retention curve where the pressure head was equal to 155 m the soil parameters for the jid are shown in table 2 4 results 4 1 simulation results for single infiltration events fig 6a illustrates the groundwater recharge that is caused by an sie when the groundwater depth is 1 5 m the recharge flux for all three soil textures initially increases and then decreases but the peak values and lag times are different silt loam has the largest peak value and the shortest lag time which indicates that silt loam possesses poor storage ability making it difficult for infiltration water to remain in the soil fig 6b shows that silt loam produced groundwater recharge on the fourth day following the infiltration event and its cumulative infiltration was the greatest further indicating silt loam to be most affected by the infiltration event the permeability of silt loam is worse than that of loam and sandy loam but the soil water content during the infiltration process affects the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and also the infiltration flux as fig 7 shows during the infiltration process the water content and hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile of silt loam are greater than those of sandy loam and loam this is due to the fact that the soil particles of silt loam are small and the capillary action is strong prior to the occurrence of the infiltration event the soil water content is high and hydraulic conductivity is high therefore under the same infiltration flux the groundwater recharge that is caused by the silt loam is greater and the lag time is shorter the groundwater recharge flux that is produced by different water depths has a significant difference fig 8 illustrates that as groundwater depth increases the peak value of recharge flux gradually decreases and lag time gradually increases when the groundwater depth is low the average soil water content is high which results in greater unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and stronger permeability in addition the seepage path is short in areas with smaller groundwater depth enabling surface infiltration to quickly get to the groundwater in a relatively short period of time fig 9a illustrates how soil profile water content has significant variations under the conditions of different groundwater depths the smaller the groundwater depth the greater the soil water content thereby leading to a difference in hydraulic conductivity fig 9b shows that no matter the depth of the groundwater the hydraulic conductivity close to the groundwater table is always high and the rest of the soil has less hydraulic conductivity when there is greater groundwater depth the infiltration path is longer and lower hydraulic conductivity in the upper soil hinders groundwater recharge fig 10 and table 3 show the results of transfer function using itf and ewf for 15 sies table 3 demonstrates that the coefficient of determination r2 of itf is between 0 81 and 0 99 with an average value of 0 91 the r2 of ewf is between 0 16 and 1 with an average of 0 65 and this is much smaller than the average with itf in addition the mean value of the sum of the squared differences of ewf is 0 025 which is also greater than 0 012 of itf proving that the fitting effect of itf is generally better than ewf when the groundwater depth is no more than 1 m the r2 of ewf is greater than 0 8 as the buried depth of groundwater increases r2 gradually decreases and the fitting error gradually increases which indicates that ewf is only suitable in areas with low groundwater depth fig 10 shows that as groundwater depth changes the shape of the weight function curve changes significantly and all r2s of itf are greater than 0 8 meaning that the fitting effect is significantly better than that of ewm this is due to itf using the parameters n and k for the joint determination of the shape of the curve and the flexibility being much greater than with the ewf adjusting the shape of the curve using a single parameter b fig 11a shows n to have an obvious linear positive correlation with the groundwater depth this is due to n in the itf representing the number of linear reservoirs as groundwater depth and vadose zone thickness increase the number of linear reservoirs also increases with three different soil textures the slopes of the fitting curve of the parameter n are different sandy loam has the largest slope then loam and silt loam has the smallest slope this is because different soil textures have different storage capacities sandy loam has a strong storage ability and with the same thickness it represents more linear reservoirs so the slope of the curve is the greatest similarly loam and silt loam have relatively weak storage abilities so the slopes of their fitting curves are smaller fig 11b shows that with the three different soil textures the slope and intercept of the fitting curve for parameter k are not particularly dissimilar which indicates the correlation between k and soil texture to not be strong k represents the storage ability of one linear reservoir the difference in storage abilities for different soil textures is reflected using n rather than k so the change to k has no correlation with the soil texture the reason k increases as groundwater depth increases is that groundwater depth alters the soil water content when the groundwater depth is greater the soil water content and hydraulic conductivity are smaller fig 11 meaning that the stronger the soil storage ability is the larger the k value becomes it is assumed that the relationship between n and groundwater depth d is expressed by the function n d and that the relationship between the k and d is expressed by the function k d incorporating n d and k d into eq 11 helps establish a direct relationship between itf and groundwater depth 32 f τ γ n d τ 1 k d γ n d τ 1 k d 2 γ n d once the itf for a particular area has been determined the calculation of groundwater recharge under different groundwater depths is much easier and this is of great significance for arid regions where large differences in groundwater depth are evident 4 2 analysis of effective infiltration for field profiles fig 12 shows the relationship between the effective infiltration and in pe for 14 field profiles between 2000 and 2020 the effective infiltration of all profiles has a linear positive correlation with in pe and the intercept of the trend line and the x axis is 388 mm which indicates that the average in pe threshold for effective infiltration in the jid is 388 mm the slope of the trend line is 0 56 which indicates that when in pe exceeds the threshold as in pe continues to increase approximately 56 of in pe is converted into effective infiltration and the rest is consumed by crops and retained in the root zone fig 13 demonstrates the relationship between the monthly effective infiltration and in pe at the profiles in the jid the monthly effective infiltration shows significant variations during the year and the effective infiltration in november accounts for 52 9 of the total fig 13a shows that the monthly effective infiltration is mainly distributed in the autumn irrigation july to august and winter irrigation october to november and the effective infiltration produced during other periods is incredibly small fig 13b divides the effective infiltration into four categories represented by orange gray green and blue dots between october and november blue dots the effective infiltration rate increases significantly this is due to there being almost no crop consumption during winter irrigation so therefore a large amount of irrigation water is leaked the reason for effective infiltration between july and august green dots is that the water consumption of crops in this period is lower than in pe part of the water which is not consumed by crops fills in the root zone and the remaining amount is leaked the r2 for blue dots and green dots are 0 86 and 0 29 which indicates the effective infiltration for october to november to be less affected by other factors whereas for july to august the situation is complicated due to the impact of crop water consumption the orange dots january to march and december are distributed near the origin of the coordinates which indicates effective infiltration and in pe to both be close to 0 the reason for this is that there is no irrigation and very little effective rainfall the effective infiltration for april to june and september gray dots is relatively small due to the crop water requirement in this period being relatively large and the in pe being almost entirely consumed by crops which leads to less effective infiltration most of the gray points are distributed close to the x axis which indicates that the effective infiltration is close to 0 during the crop growth period but an exceptional gray point deviating from the x axis is caused by heavy rain in june 2019 pe 92 mm leading to large effective infiltration during that month 4 3 groundwater recharge and lag time for field profiles considering the lag of groundwater recharge the use of itf for calculating groundwater recharge requires early data in order to avoid errors caused by lag the groundwater recharge calculation results for the last 10 years 2011 2020 are chosen for analysis 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 are used for parameter calibration and verification and the fitting results can be seen in table 4 with the exception of haizicun correlations between the groundwater recharge that were calculated by itf and hydrus 1d have passed the significance test r2 is between 0 70 and 0 88 indicating that itf is able to accurately calculate the delayed recharge of groundwater fig 14 demonstrates that the variation trend of groundwater recharge that is calculated by the itf and hydrus 1d is consistent and the fitting is good lag time and significance are determined through the calculation of the cross correlation between daily groundwater recharge and effective infiltration in each profile the results are presented in table 4 maximum cross correlation ρ max reflects the strength of the lag signal as groundwater depth increases the ρ max decreases and its corresponding lag time increases indicating that vadose zone storage ability is enhanced the fluctuation of effective infiltration is smoothed and the lag signal gradually weakens when groundwater depth reaches 50 m hazicun s ρ max is just 0 01 and outside of the confidence interval the lower limit of lag time interval τ 0 reflects the response speed of groundwater recharge to effective infiltration increasing as groundwater depth also increases the greater the thickness of the vadose zone the more obvious the hysteresis becomes lag time interval width τ 1 τ 0 reflects the duration of effective infiltration on groundwater recharge the larger the τ 1 τ 0 the longer the duration of recharge as groundwater depth increases τ 1 τ 0 initially increases before decreasing the reason for this is that as the vadose zone s storage ability increases so does the duration of groundwater recharge when vadose zone thickness reaches a certain value approximately 13 m the lagging signal is attenuated which leads to a narrowing of the lag time interval and then τ 1 τ 0 gradually decreases the lag time remains outside the confidence interval until groundwater depth reaches approximately 50 m fig 15 illustrates the relationship between ρ max and groundwater depth as a power function the nearer to 0 the groundwater depth is the greater the ρ max and when water depth exceeds 50 m the ρ max is close to 0 the upper and lower limits of the lag time interval have a linear positive correlation with groundwater depth and τ peak is distributed between the two trend lines when groundwater depth is lower than 50 m the area enclosed by the two trend lines the green area in fig 15 is the lag time in the 95 confidence interval the points in this area can then fully reflect the relationship between groundwater recharge lag time and groundwater depth for the jid which is expressed as 33 40 2 d 175 6 τ d 42 6 d 14 1 where the value range of groundwater depth d is 0 d 50 m τ d represents the lag time τ which corresponds to different groundwater depths and τ 0 days as fig 16 shows parameter n has a significant linear positive correlation with groundwater depth which indicates that the number of linear reservoirs gradually increases along with vadose zone thickness the slope of the trend line is 0 47 which indicates that vadose zone thickness per meter in the jid is equivalent to 0 47 linear reservoirs parameter k reflects the vadose zone s storage ability k has a significant positive correlation with groundwater depth the reason for this is that as groundwater depth increases the vadose zone s average water content decreases the permeability weakens and the storage ability becomes enhanced as groundwater depth increases k has a sudden change at the water depth of approximately 8 m when groundwater depth is lower than 8 m k increases rapidly as water depth increases and the slope of the trend line is 8 89 indicating that k increases by 8 99 days with a 1 m increase to vadose zone thickness when groundwater depth is greater than 8 m the slope of the trend line is 0 62 which indicates that k increases by 0 62 days with a 1 m increase to vadose zone thickness the reason for this significant difference between k in the small and the large groundwater depth is that groundwater depth is relatively high the process of groundwater recharge is slow and the regular irrigation and rainfall remain in the vadose zone for a long period forming a stable and slow infiltration the vadose zone s average water content is relatively stable and does not change much therefore as vadose zone thickness continues to increase its storage ability does not change much and k increases at a relatively small rate by incorporating the trend line equations for n and k into eq 32 the relationship between itf and groundwater depth for the jid is expressed as 34 f τ γ 0 47 d 0 81 τ 1 8 89 d 8 γ 0 47 d 0 81 τ 1 8 89 d 8 2 γ 0 47 d 0 81 for d 8 γ 0 47 d 0 81 τ 1 0 62 d 58 38 γ 0 47 d 0 81 τ 1 0 62 d 58 38 2 γ 0 47 d 0 81 for d 8 from eq 34 the itf curves of different groundwater depths in the jid can be drawn fig 17 the transfer function at any point in the jid can be determined and the groundwater recharge at different water depths can be calculated as groundwater depth increases the curve of the itf gradually slows down and the peak value decreases when groundwater depth is no greater than 8 m the peak value is above 0 003 and the maximum lag time is approximately 500 days when the buried depth is greater than 8 m the peak value of the itf is less than 0 003 and the maximum lag time reaches more than 3000 days this proves that as groundwater depth increases the groundwater recharge that is caused by effective infiltration has an obvious smoothing and hysteresis effect the process of groundwater recharge is extremely complicated in arid areas to facilitate the accurate calculation of groundwater recharge lag effect cannot be ignored 5 discussion the vadose zone s instantaneous unit hydrograph the probability density function of the gamma distribution assumes the inflow of the first linear reservoir to be a delta function besbes 1984 only when there is high intensity with the infiltration event and the duration is short can the vadose zone s instantaneous unit hydrograph be used for calculating the groundwater recharge and ensure that the error is small in this paper the vadose zone s instantaneous unit hydrograph is improved slightly to itf which is used for calculating groundwater recharge that is caused by long duration and small strength infiltration events water diversion irrigation areas in arid regions have the characteristics of small rainfall high irrigation and long duration infiltration itf is more suitable than the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone for calculating groundwater recharge in this area in addition compared to the traditional ewf the itf fitting results are better fig 10 this is due to ewf only having parameter b for adjusting the shape of the curve when vadose zone thickness is large a larger error can be caused by this method qian 2013 the curve shape of the itf is quite flexible under different groundwater depths and vadose zone lithological conditions the curve can be adjusted to a more ideal shape through adjustments to n and k in addition the parameters in the itf have clear physical meanings n and k are the number of linear reservoirs and the storage ability parameters when using itf for the calculation of groundwater recharge the rationality of the itf parameters can be judged based on the vadose zone s actual conditions thereby enabling the more accurate calculation of groundwater recharge o reilly s study o reilly 2004 demonstrated that parameters n and k of the vadose zone s instantaneous unit hydrograph under a single infiltration event increased as vadose zone thickness increased which is the same as the result of itf research in this paper the simulation results for a single infiltration event fig 11 and field profiles in the jid fig 16 in this paper both demonstrate that when groundwater depth does not exceed 50 m parameters n and k have a significant linear relationship with groundwater depth however in contrast to previous research in the jid parameter k increasing with the depth of groundwater can be divided into two stages when groundwater depth is less than 8 m the growth rate is greater and when it is 8 50 m the growth rate is small this article reveals the physical meaning of each parameter from a linear reservoir theory perspective while also quantitatively analyzing the relationship between itf parameters and groundwater depth these factors have not been previously studied irrigation and rainfall infiltration are important groundwater recharge sources simons et al 2015 fig 12 indicates that the yearly effective infiltration in the jid increases as in pe increases which is similar to previous research results in addition this paper s analysis results demonstrate that the in pe threshold for effective infiltration in the jid is 388 mm year which has guiding significance for the optimization of agricultural water resource management and irrigation systems in the jid and can be used as a reference for further research in similar areas fisher and healy 2008 discovered that almost all effective infiltration occurs during irrigation season which is the same as the findings of this paper however there is a difference in that the monthly effective infiltration in the jid is greatly affected by the growth period of the crops leading to an incredibly uneven distribution of effective infiltration in the period of winter irrigation october to november this feature may be identical to many other water diversion irrigation districts in northwest china as they all have similar crop types and irrigation systems there is a significant lag to groundwater recharge in arid areas wang et al 2021 in coastal plains where groundwater depth is low groundwater recharge lag time does not generally exceed one to two days when groundwater depth exceeds 10 m lag time is significant and reaches 18 35 d lu et al 2011a 2011b in areas with greater groundwater depth lag time can even reach several years rossman et al 2014 the studies of walker et al 2020a 2020b and currie et al 2020 show that the lag time is proportional to the depth of groundwater and different soil properties also affect the lag time which is similar to the results of this study in contrast to the treatment method which regards lag time as being a fixed value this article suggests that delayed groundwater recharge is a continuous process and lag time is an interval range which is determined by cross correlation fig 15 there is a significant correlation between lag time and groundwater depth in the confidence interval of lag time but it is not significant outside of the interval the use of an interval for describing the relationship between lag time and groundwater depth is more in line with the actual situation and a quantitative study of lag time and groundwater depth has not been previously considered in addition this paper establishes a direct connection between itf and groundwater depth in the jid eq 13 and fig 17 which is of great significance in the calculation of groundwater recharge for all of the jid as parameters n and k can be avoided in order to simplify the calculation process in the underdeveloped areas of northwest china the economy is relatively backward and the hydrogeological data are imperfect which is a widespread problem in many irrigation areas for these areas due to the shortage of data it is very difficult to accurately calculate groundwater recharge by analyzing the relationship between groundwater lag recharge and groundwater depth in jid this paper explains the law of groundwater lag recharge in this area which provides a reference for the calculation of groundwater lag recharge in other similar areas however because the groundwater recharge in the area with insufficient data is difficult to be verified by the measured data further research on the groundwater cycle through models such as modflow should be considered in the follow up study which will be of positive significance to the optimal management of regional water resources 6 conclusion this paper has reached the following conclusions by studying single infiltration events and the jid profile simulations 1 based on simple improvement to the vadose zone s unit hydrograph itf was established for the calculation of groundwater recharge that is caused by long duration and small intensity infiltration events the research results of single infiltration events demonstrate that the fitting result of groundwater recharge for itf is better than for ewf and soil texture and groundwater depth are important factors affecting delayed groundwater recharge 2 the yearly effective infiltration in the jid is mostly affected by in pe and the in pe threshold for effective infiltration is 388 mm year monthly effective infiltration is significantly affected by the crop growth period and effective infiltration is distributed in winter irrigation between october and november 3 groundwater recharge lag time in the jid has a confidence interval when groundwater depth is less than 50 m as groundwater depth increases lag time also increases and lag signal decreases itf parameters n and k have significant linear positive correlations with groundwater depth when groundwater depth is less than 8 m the growth rate of k is 8 89 day m and when groundwater depth is greater than 8 m the growth rate of k is 0 62 day m respectively the lag effect of groundwater recharge in arid regions is an issue that cannot be ignored credit authorship

insufficient hydrogeological data it is quite difficult to calculate the delayed recharge of groundwater an improved transfer function itf is established based on the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone for areas lacking hydro geological data and is then used for calculation of the delayed recharge of groundwater new hydrological insights for the region the thickness of the vadose zone is an important factor affecting the delayed recharge of groundwater when the depth of groundwater is less than 50 m there is a linear positive correlation between the thickness of the vadose zone and the lag time for itf parameters n and k the number of linear reservoirs n increases as the thickness of the vadose zone increases and the 1 m thickness of the vadose zone is equivalent to 0 47 linear reservoirs the storage ability parameter k increases as groundwater depth increases with an increased rate of 8 89 and 0 62 day m when the water table depth is less than 8 m or greater than 8 m in this paper a simple improvement to the calculation method for groundwater recharge is of great reference significance for calculating groundwater resources for irrigation regions in similar areas keywords arid area irrigation regions groundwater recharge vadose zone lag 1 introduction groundwater resources are essential for arid and semi arid regions yao et al 2015 as they guarantee water for agricultural domestic and industrial use while maintaining a healthy ecosystem hayashi and rosenberry 2002 there are several water diversion and irrigation projects in northwest china s arid areas and they ensure the development of local agriculture while also improving the ecological environment of both the irrigation area and the surrounding areas zhang 2015 intense human activity has altered the natural water cycle process in these irrigation areas and the water cycle process of diversion irrigation return has played an important part there wang et al 2006 the groundwater source in the water diversion irrigation area is mostly effective infiltration which is caused by rainfall and irrigation simons et al 2015 groundwater recharge generally has a significant lag in certain areas with large groundwater depth wang et al 2021 su 2018 when using models such as modflow for groundwater numerical simulation infiltration coefficient method misstear et al 2009 saghravani 2013 is often used to estimate groundwater recharge in some simple groundwater models the amount of recharge to groundwater from rainfall and irrigation return is simplified by the product of the sum of precipitation and irrigation and an infiltration coefficient yao et al 2015 however because the water movement in the unsaturated zone was restricted mostly in arid regions the lag time will continue to increase with the increase of groundwater depth lu et al 2011a 2011b therefore the lag effect caused by unsaturated flow cannot be ignored in groundwater models hydrus numerical simulation method can well deal with the problem of groundwater recharge skaggs et al 2004 jiménez martínez et al 2009 and poch massegú et al 2014 using hydraus 1d to calculate groundwater recharge good results are obtained the numerical simulation model can predict the impact of different factors such as lithology of vadose zone meteorological conditions and land use type on groundwater recharge but the measured data are needed to identify and verify the model there are not enough vadose zone data for the establishment of hydrus model in some irrigation areas in underdeveloped areas of northwest china so it is difficult to calculate groundwater recharge by numerical simulation method the transfer function can calculate the delayed recharge of groundwater without enough soil data in the vadose zone which makes up for the disadvantage of more data requirement in numerical simulation the transfer function method treats the vadose zone as a system and effective surface infiltration and groundwater recharge are the system s input and output the relationship between effective surface infiltration and groundwater recharge is linked by the transfer function o reilly 2004 the transfer function method treats the vadose zone as a system and effective surface infiltration and groundwater recharge are the system s input and output the relationship between effective surface infiltration and groundwater recharge is linked by the transfer function there are two types of transfer function method analytical model and empirical model chen 1998 proposed an empirical weight function ewf after conducting several experiments and noted that the transfer function of groundwater recharge can be expressed using the probability density function of the poisson distribution li et al 2005 used ewf for dealing with the infiltration of rainfall rivers reservoirs canal systems and irrigation in the modflow model which produced excellent simulation results hu and chen 2006 used ewf in examining river and rainfall induced infiltration recharge in groundwater numerical simulation the results proving that the ewf method can effectively solve the delayed groundwater recharge issues wang and zhou 2009 noted that an advantage of using ewf for treating the delayed recharge of groundwater is that it only requires knowledge of the groundwater depth and the characteristic parameters of the vadose zone however the results of the numerical simulation performed by qian et al 2013 showed ewf to not be applicable when the vadose zone particles are finer and groundwater depth is deep in addition as ewf is an empirical method that lacks reliable theoretical support these shortcomings hinder the development and application of the ewf method due to some limitations the ewf method is only used in the numerical simulation of groundwater in some areas of china in addition allison et al 1990 achieved good results using a log normally distributed probability density function to describe groundwater recharge for different land units an instantaneous unit hydrograph is generally used for flood forecasting moura et al 2021 monajemi et al 2021 li et al 2020 a method which is suitable for rainfall events with high intensity short duration and small timescale minutes and hours besbes and marsily 1984 proposed the instantaneous unit hydrograph for the vadose zone based on the nash linear reservoir model nash 1957 believing the groundwater recharge process that is caused by the impulse infiltration event could be calculated using the gamma distribution s density function the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone is applied in certain cases of groundwater recharge calculation wu et al 1997 o reilly 2004 cao et al 2016 however these studies do not take the impact of infiltration events on groundwater recharge on a large timescale into account compared to surface runoff groundwater recharge displays relatively smooth fluctuations which are generally calculated on a daily and monthly scale the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone that is established based on impulse infiltration event has some limitations on a large timescale therefore in order to accurately calculate the delayed recharge of groundwater in arid areas a transfer function that is suitable for a large timescale must be developed jid is a typical water diversion irrigation area in an arid area of northwest china the development of groundwater resources in this irrigation area is relatively limited and has great potential the accurate calculation of groundwater replenishment rate will guarantee efficient water resource usage in the irrigation area since jid was established the diverted yellow river has been the main water source in the irrigation area and relatively little groundwater research has been conducted particularly regarding the delayed recharge of groundwater this paper uses the sies and 14 field profiles of jid as examples and employs a simply improved transfer function and hydrus 1d model for calculation of the groundwater recharge that is caused by effective infiltration this paper s main objectives are 1 from the sies analyze the impact mechanism of varying groundwater depths and soil textures on the delayed recharge of groundwater and analyze the physical meaning and influencing factors of itf parameters 2 reveal the changes and influencing factors effective infiltration has from the 14 jid profiles at yearly and monthly scales 3 reveal the lag law of groundwater recharge and quantitatively analyze the influence vadose zone thickness has on the lag time of groundwater recharge and itf parameters in jid this study provides a simple and improved transfer function for groundwater recharge calculation little quantitative analysis of the effect of vadose zone thickness on the hysteresis of groundwater recharge has been conducted and this paper s research results can provide references for other irrigation areas in arid areas 2 method 2 1 research program the main research content of this paper fig 1 is to improve the accuracy of groundwater recharge calculation through the improved conversion function and then reveal the law of groundwater lag recharge through the example analysis of jingdian irrigation district the purpose of hydrus theoretical modeling is to analyze the variation law of parameters in itf and the influence of individual factors such as groundwater depth and soil texture on each parameter can be judged by the control variable method the situation at the site is relatively complex with the depth of groundwater soil texture and soil layer structure being relatively complex it is also necessary to verify the availability of the itf in complex environments through field modeling which makes this study more complete 2 2 transfer function of groundwater recharge for calculation of the delayed recharge of groundwater an ewf was proposed by chen 1998 the weight function is defined as the function of the weight of groundwater recharge that is caused by an sie changing with the number of the lag timestep the weight function satisfies the sum of the weight for all lag timesteps as being 1 that is 1 τ 0 f τ 1 where f τ is the weight function of groundwater recharge that is caused by an sie and τ is the number of lag timesteps of the groundwater recharge chen 1998 obtained the ewf model which satisfies eq 1 following a great deal of research and this can be expressed using the probability density function of the poisson distribution 2 f τ d b τ τ e d b where d is groundwater depth or vadose zone thickness m b is the characteristic parameter of the vadose zone and m e is the base of the natural logarithm o reilly 2004 noted that when calculating groundwater recharge using the transfer function movement of water in the vadose zone is a linear process therefore the groundwater recharge at any timestep can be calculated using linear superposition 3 r i i 1 i e i τ f τ where r i is the groundwater recharge at the timestep i cm and i e i τ is an effective infiltration at the timestep i τ cm besbes and marsily 1984 established an instantaneous unit hydrograph model for the vadose zone that was based on the linear reservoir model nash 1957 for calculation of groundwater recharge that is caused by an impulse infiltration event the instantaneous unit hydrograph model treats the vadose zone as a series of linear reservoirs and groundwater recharge is the result of regulation of the impulse infiltration event by the linear reservoir assuming that to be a linear relationship between the storage w n and the outflow q n of the reservoir the equations of the linear reservoir are established based on the principle of water balance 4 q n 1 q n d w n d t w n k n q n where k n is the storage ability parameters of the n th linear reservoir if the regulation and storage effects of n linear reservoirs are identical then k k 1 k 2 k 3 k n eq 4 is solved and the outflow of the n th linear reservoir is expressed as 5 q n 1 1 k d d t n q 0 where q 0 is the inflow of the first linear reservoir when the inflow of the first linear reservoir is an impulse infiltration event q 0 δ t laplace integral transformation is used to solve eq 5 and obtain the instantaneous unit hydrograph for the vadose zone 6 f δ t 1 k γ n t k n 1 e t k where f δ t is the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone and γ n is the gamma function eq 6 represents the groundwater recharge that is caused by an impulse infiltration event the impulse infiltration event refers to an event of infinite intensity with a total infiltration of 1 in an infinitely small time there is obviously generally no impulse infiltration in rainfall or irrigation additionally regardless of the values of parameters n and k eq 6 is a curve that passes through the origin and is also inconsistent with the actual situation when groundwater depth is low the infiltration is able to produce groundwater in a short time period in this situation eq 6 can no longer be applied in order to solve this problem the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone can be slightly improved using an s curve method s curve refers to the groundwater recharge that is caused by continuous impulse infiltration events and this is expressed as the integration of the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone 7 s t 0 t f δ x d x γ n t k γ n where γ is the lower incomplete gamma function which is calculated using the following equation 8 γ n t k 0 t k x n 1 e x d x the s curve is a monotonically increasing curve that has a value range of between 0 and 1 the s t curve can be shifted to the right by a unit timestep in order to obtain a delay curve s t 1 in each timestep the area between the two s curves is the weight of groundwater recharge therefore the weight of groundwater recharge for any timestep is obtained by integration 9 f τ τ i τ 1 s t s t 1 d t it is notable that the domain of the s t 1 curve is t 1 so therefore when t 1 s t 1 0 eq 7 can be incorporated into eq 9 in order to obtain the integral expression of the weight 10 f τ τ τ 1 γ n i t k γ n t 1 k γ n d t eq 10 is a complex integral and the approximate solution is solved using the difference method 11 f τ γ n τ 1 k γ n τ 1 k 2 γ n eq 11 is the improved transfer function itf the parameters n and k represent the number of linear reservoirs and one reservoir s storage ability respectively fig 2 is the curve of itf when n and k have different values and itf shape is quite flexible when the values of k and n are lower the number of lag timesteps for the itf is smaller and the peak value of the itf is greater as when k and n are small the vadose zone s storage ability is poor the infiltration event has more impact on groundwater recharge and the lag time is short as k and n continuously increase the itf curve gradually becomes flat and the vadose zone s storage ability gradually increases this results in the peak value of itf decreasing and lag time increasing compared to the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone itf is suitable for calculating both groundwater recharge on the minute and hour scales and groundwater recharge on the daily and monthly scales eq 3 and eq 11 can be combined to obtain the itf model for calculating groundwater recharge 12 r i τ 0 i i e i τ γ n τ 1 k γ n τ 1 k 2 γ n 2 3 calculation of effective infiltration effective infiltration can be calculated using a simple bucket model guswa et al 2002 walker et al 2002 the bucket model regards the root zone as a bucket for the storage of water when the total storage of the root zone exceeds its maximum capacity effective infiltration is generated effective infiltration is expressed as 13 i e i t i t max for t i t max 0 for t i t max where i e i is the effective infiltration at timestep i mm and t i and t max are the total storage at timestep i and the maximum capacity of the root zone which are calculated using the following equations 14 t max d rz θ fc θ wp different situations must be considered in the calculation of t i when i e i 1 0 15 t i t max i n i p e i e t c i for t max i n i p e i e t c i 0 for t max i n i p e i e t c i when i e i 1 0 16 t i t i 1 i n i p e i e t c i for t i 1 i n i p e i e t c i 0 for t i 1 i n i p e i e t c i where d rz is the depth of the root zone in mm and θ fc is average field capacity of the root zone which refers to the volumetric water content when there is almost zero drainage under the gravity healy 2010 cm3 cm3 θ wp is the average permanent wilting point of the root zone which refers to the maximum volumetric water content when the crop has withered and is unable to be recovered this is generally considered to be the volumetric water content when the pressure head is 155 m cheng and zhang 2012 i n is net irrigation the product of irrigation water diversion and canal system utilization coefficient in mm and p e is effective rainfall which is determined using empirical equations wang 2009 17 p e i 0 for p i 5 mm p i for 5 mm p i 50 mm 0 8 p i for p i 50 mm where et c is the crop water requirement which is calculated using the single crop coefficient method allen et al 1998 18 e t c k c e t 0 where k c is the crop coefficient which is calculated using the penman monteith equation 19 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g λ 900 c 273 u 2 e

4 determination of lag time interval cross correlation is used for the evaluation of the lag time of two series of statistical data l j e lee et al 2006 this method is used for determining the lag time interval between groundwater recharge and effective infiltration the cross correlation coefficient is calculated using the following formula 20 ρ τ e x t μ x y t k μ y σ x σ y where ρ τ is the cross correlation with the number of lag timestep τ x t and y t are the effective infiltration series and groundwater recharge series and σ x and σ y are the standard deviation of the effective infiltration series and groundwater recharge series the lag time with a cross correlation of more than 2 n is in the 95 confidence interval diggle 1990 where n is the number of the data series based on the cross correlation the lag time interval between groundwater recharge and effective infiltration is then determined 2 5 determination of improved transfer function parameters the least squares method is employed for determining the itf parameters 21 φ i 1 r tf i n k r ns i 2 where φ is the sum of the squared differences between two series of data and r tf and r ns are groundwater recharge calculated using itf and hydrus 1d when φ is smallest n and k are optimal parameters 3 model setup 3 1 simulation for single infiltration event 3 1 1 experimental design the hydrus 1d model is used for simulating the impact of sie on groundwater recharge the simulation time interval is one day and the infiltration events with 50 mm day flux on the first day three different soil texture types sandy loam loam and silt loam under the conditions of five different groundwater depths 0 5 1 1 5 2 and 2 5 m are simulated the simulation plan and the soil parameters are displayed in table 1 3 1 2 mathematical model the groundwater recharge that is caused by an sie can be generalized as being a one dimensional vertical infiltration process the differential equation of the hydrus 1d model is expressed as simunek et al 1999 22 θ t z k h h z 1 where z is the depth with the ground as the reference surface in cm t is time in days θ is the volumetric water content of the soil in cm3 cm3 h is the pressure head in cm and k θ is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in cm day the curves of soil water retention are obtained based on the van genuchten 1980 model and mualem 1976 model 23 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n m h 0 θ s h 0 24 k θ k s s e 1 2 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where θ s and θ r are saturated and residual water content in cm3 cm3 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity in cm day α m and n are the shape parameters of the curves of soil water retention where m 1 1 n and s e is the soil saturation which is expressed as 25 s e θ θ r θ s θ r the upper boundary of the model is the surface which receives infiltration recharge and can be generalized as a variable flux boundary 26 k h h z 1 i 0 t where i 0 t is the given infiltration flux at the upper boundary in mm day the lower boundary is the groundwater table and the pressure head is zero therefore it can be generalized as a constant pressure head boundary 27 h 0 the initial pressure head of the model adopts the lower boundary as 0 the upper boundary is the negative value of the thickness of the vadose zone and the middle is assigned according to linear interpolation 3 2 field simulation 3 2 1 study area and field profiles jid is in jingtai and gulang counties in the central area of gansu province china fig 3 it is bordered by the yellow river in the east the tengger desert in the north and the changling mountains in the south the irrigation method in jid is electric irrigation and the primary water source is the yellow river the average yearly rainfall is 186 mm and average water surface evaporation is 2123 mm there is a scarcity of surface water sources in jid in addition to there being fewer drainage rivers in the southwest of jid the rivers are generally dry and without water the groundwater depth in jid is about 1 55 m and groundwater runs from southwest to northeast the main groundwater recharge sources are irrigation and rainfall infiltration while the main drainage methods are groundwater runoff in the north and river drainage in the east the main crop types in jid are spring wheat barley corn soybeans flax artichokes melons wolfberries and forest fruits a total of 14 profiles hydrogeological boreholes were chosen for the field simulation as can be seen in fig 4 based on the soil texture types of the vadose zone that were exposed by the 14 hydrogeological boreholes the profile soil texture can be divided into fine grained soil which is dominated by silt loam medium grained soil which is dominated by sandy loam and coarse grained soil which is dominated by sand based on the distribution characteristics of the soil texture in the jid soil samples with different soil textures were taken from three typical sampling points in the jid in order to determine the soil parameters 3 2 2 mathematical model different from sie modeling the field simulation first uses the bucket model to calculate the effective infiltration at the bottom of the root zone and then uses the hydrus model to simulate the water transport process in the unsaturated zone between the bottom of the root zone and the groundwater surface fig 5 field simulations have varying initial and boundary conditions the effective infiltration at the bottom of the root zone is calculated using eq 13 therefore the bottom of the root zone is taken as the upper boundary of the numerical model for field simulations and this is generalized as the variable flux boundary 28 k h h z 1 i e t the lower boundary of the model is the groundwater surface and this is generalized as the constant pressure head boundary 29 h 0 the initial pressure head of the numerical model is affected by previous infiltration events and therefore the initial water head distribution is pre simulated using the infiltration event from the previous year or years and the pressure head at the end of the pre simulation result is taken as the initial condition of the current model 30 h h 0 z where h 0 z is the initial pressure head the hydrus 1d model uses the following equation for automatic calculation of the groundwater recharge at the lower boundary during the simulation process 31 r t k h h z 3 2 3 data source and soil parameters the meteorological data used in this study was obtained from jingtai county national meteorological station the data required for calculating crop water requirements was provided by jingdian administration including crop planting area type planting structure growth period and crop coefficient irrigation data was provided by the jingdian administration the groundwater level data was measured using 14 monitoring wells in jid the soil parameters were measured using laboratory tests on typical soil samples that were conducted in the jid the soil textures were determined using the classification system of the international society for soil science isss and the volume percentage of clay silt and sand were measured by a particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer 2000 the planting types in the jid are complex and the root depths of crops during different growth periods are different this article combines the actual situation of the jid and takes the weighted average value of the root zone thickness as 0 3 m soil water retention curves were measured using a high speed centrifuge for soil kokusan h 1400pf and the parameters θ r θ s α and n were fitted using retc software van et al 1992 saturated hydraulic conductivity k s was measured using the constant head method based on darcy s law field capacity θ fc was measured using the ring knife method wilting point θ wp was taken as the water content value on the soil water retention curve where the pressure head was equal to 155 m the soil parameters for the jid are shown in table 2 4 results 4 1 simulation results for single infiltration events fig 6a illustrates the groundwater recharge that is caused by an sie when the groundwater depth is 1 5 m the recharge flux for all three soil textures initially increases and then decreases but the peak values and lag times are different silt loam has the largest peak value and the shortest lag time which indicates that silt loam possesses poor storage ability making it difficult for infiltration water to remain in the soil fig 6b shows that silt loam produced groundwater recharge on the fourth day following the infiltration event and its cumulative infiltration was the greatest further indicating silt loam to be most affected by the infiltration event the permeability of silt loam is worse than that of loam and sandy loam but the soil water content during the infiltration process affects the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and also the infiltration flux as fig 7 shows during the infiltration process the water content and hydraulic conductivity of the soil profile of silt loam are greater than those of sandy loam and loam this is due to the fact that the soil particles of silt loam are small and the capillary action is strong prior to the occurrence of the infiltration event the soil water content is high and hydraulic conductivity is high therefore under the same infiltration flux the groundwater recharge that is caused by the silt loam is greater and the lag time is shorter the groundwater recharge flux that is produced by different water depths has a significant difference fig 8 illustrates that as groundwater depth increases the peak value of recharge flux gradually decreases and lag time gradually increases when the groundwater depth is low the average soil water content is high which results in greater unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and stronger permeability in addition the seepage path is short in areas with smaller groundwater depth enabling surface infiltration to quickly get to the groundwater in a relatively short period of time fig 9a illustrates how soil profile water content has significant variations under the conditions of different groundwater depths the smaller the groundwater depth the greater the soil water content thereby leading to a difference in hydraulic conductivity fig 9b shows that no matter the depth of the groundwater the hydraulic conductivity close to the groundwater table is always high and the rest of the soil has less hydraulic conductivity when there is greater groundwater depth the infiltration path is longer and lower hydraulic conductivity in the upper soil hinders groundwater recharge fig 10 and table 3 show the results of transfer function using itf and ewf for 15 sies table 3 demonstrates that the coefficient of determination r2 of itf is between 0 81 and 0 99 with an average value of 0 91 the r2 of ewf is between 0 16 and 1 with an average of 0 65 and this is much smaller than the average with itf in addition the mean value of the sum of the squared differences of ewf is 0 025 which is also greater than 0 012 of itf proving that the fitting effect of itf is generally better than ewf when the groundwater depth is no more than 1 m the r2 of ewf is greater than 0 8 as the buried depth of groundwater increases r2 gradually decreases and the fitting error gradually increases which indicates that ewf is only suitable in areas with low groundwater depth fig 10 shows that as groundwater depth changes the shape of the weight function curve changes significantly and all r2s of itf are greater than 0 8 meaning that the fitting effect is significantly better than that of ewm this is due to itf using the parameters n and k for the joint determination of the shape of the curve and the flexibility being much greater than with the ewf adjusting the shape of the curve using a single parameter b fig 11a shows n to have an obvious linear positive correlation with the groundwater depth this is due to n in the itf representing the number of linear reservoirs as groundwater depth and vadose zone thickness increase the number of linear reservoirs also increases with three different soil textures the slopes of the fitting curve of the parameter n are different sandy loam has the largest slope then loam and silt loam has the smallest slope this is because different soil textures have different storage capacities sandy loam has a strong storage ability and with the same thickness it represents more linear reservoirs so the slope of the curve is the greatest similarly loam and silt loam have relatively weak storage abilities so the slopes of their fitting curves are smaller fig 11b shows that with the three different soil textures the slope and intercept of the fitting curve for parameter k are not particularly dissimilar which indicates the correlation between k and soil texture to not be strong k represents the storage ability of one linear reservoir the difference in storage abilities for different soil textures is reflected using n rather than k so the change to k has no correlation with the soil texture the reason k increases as groundwater depth increases is that groundwater depth alters the soil water content when the groundwater depth is greater the soil water content and hydraulic conductivity are smaller fig 11 meaning that the stronger the soil storage ability is the larger the k value becomes it is assumed that the relationship between n and groundwater depth d is expressed by the function n d and that the relationship between the k and d is expressed by the function k d incorporating n d and k d into eq 11 helps establish a direct relationship between itf and groundwater depth 32 f τ γ n d τ 1 k d γ n d τ 1 k d 2 γ n d once the itf for a particular area has been determined the calculation of groundwater recharge under different groundwater depths is much easier and this is of great significance for arid regions where large differences in groundwater depth are evident 4 2 analysis of effective infiltration for field profiles fig 12 shows the relationship between the effective infiltration and in pe for 14 field profiles between 2000 and 2020 the effective infiltration of all profiles has a linear positive correlation with in pe and the intercept of the trend line and the x axis is 388 mm which indicates that the average in pe threshold for effective infiltration in the jid is 388 mm the slope of the trend line is 0 56 which indicates that when in pe exceeds the threshold as in pe continues to increase approximately 56 of in pe is converted into effective infiltration and the rest is consumed by crops and retained in the root zone fig 13 demonstrates the relationship between the monthly effective infiltration and in pe at the profiles in the jid the monthly effective infiltration shows significant variations during the year and the effective infiltration in november accounts for 52 9 of the total fig 13a shows that the monthly effective infiltration is mainly distributed in the autumn irrigation july to august and winter irrigation october to november and the effective infiltration produced during other periods is incredibly small fig 13b divides the effective infiltration into four categories represented by orange gray green and blue dots between october and november blue dots the effective infiltration rate increases significantly this is due to there being almost no crop consumption during winter irrigation so therefore a large amount of irrigation water is leaked the reason for effective infiltration between july and august green dots is that the water consumption of crops in this period is lower than in pe part of the water which is not consumed by crops fills in the root zone and the remaining amount is leaked the r2 for blue dots and green dots are 0 86 and 0 29 which indicates the effective infiltration for october to november to be less affected by other factors whereas for july to august the situation is complicated due to the impact of crop water consumption the orange dots january to march and december are distributed near the origin of the coordinates which indicates effective infiltration and in pe to both be close to 0 the reason for this is that there is no irrigation and very little effective rainfall the effective infiltration for april to june and september gray dots is relatively small due to the crop water requirement in this period being relatively large and the in pe being almost entirely consumed by crops which leads to less effective infiltration most of the gray points are distributed close to the x axis which indicates that the effective infiltration is close to 0 during the crop growth period but an exceptional gray point deviating from the x axis is caused by heavy rain in june 2019 pe 92 mm leading to large effective infiltration during that month 4 3 groundwater recharge and lag time for field profiles considering the lag of groundwater recharge the use of itf for calculating groundwater recharge requires early data in order to avoid errors caused by lag the groundwater recharge calculation results for the last 10 years 2011 2020 are chosen for analysis 2011 2015 and 2016 2020 are used for parameter calibration and verification and the fitting results can be seen in table 4 with the exception of haizicun correlations between the groundwater recharge that were calculated by itf and hydrus 1d have passed the significance test r2 is between 0 70 and 0 88 indicating that itf is able to accurately calculate the delayed recharge of groundwater fig 14 demonstrates that the variation trend of groundwater recharge that is calculated by the itf and hydrus 1d is consistent and the fitting is good lag time and significance are determined through the calculation of the cross correlation between daily groundwater recharge and effective infiltration in each profile the results are presented in table 4 maximum cross correlation ρ max reflects the strength of the lag signal as groundwater depth increases the ρ max decreases and its corresponding lag time increases indicating that vadose zone storage ability is enhanced the fluctuation of effective infiltration is smoothed and the lag signal gradually weakens when groundwater depth reaches 50 m hazicun s ρ max is just 0 01 and outside of the confidence interval the lower limit of lag time interval τ 0 reflects the response speed of groundwater recharge to effective infiltration increasing as groundwater depth also increases the greater the thickness of the vadose zone the more obvious the hysteresis becomes lag time interval width τ 1 τ 0 reflects the duration of effective infiltration on groundwater recharge the larger the τ 1 τ 0 the longer the duration of recharge as groundwater depth increases τ 1 τ 0 initially increases before decreasing the reason for this is that as the vadose zone s storage ability increases so does the duration of groundwater recharge when vadose zone thickness reaches a certain value approximately 13 m the lagging signal is attenuated which leads to a narrowing of the lag time interval and then τ 1 τ 0 gradually decreases the lag time remains outside the confidence interval until groundwater depth reaches approximately 50 m fig 15 illustrates the relationship between ρ max and groundwater depth as a power function the nearer to 0 the groundwater depth is the greater the ρ max and when water depth exceeds 50 m the ρ max is close to 0 the upper and lower limits of the lag time interval have a linear positive correlation with groundwater depth and τ peak is distributed between the two trend lines when groundwater depth is lower than 50 m the area enclosed by the two trend lines the green area in fig 15 is the lag time in the 95 confidence interval the points in this area can then fully reflect the relationship between groundwater recharge lag time and groundwater depth for the jid which is expressed as 33 40 2 d 175 6 τ d 42 6 d 14 1 where the value range of groundwater depth d is 0 d 50 m τ d represents the lag time τ which corresponds to different groundwater depths and τ 0 days as fig 16 shows parameter n has a significant linear positive correlation with groundwater depth which indicates that the number of linear reservoirs gradually increases along with vadose zone thickness the slope of the trend line is 0 47 which indicates that vadose zone thickness per meter in the jid is equivalent to 0 47 linear reservoirs parameter k reflects the vadose zone s storage ability k has a significant positive correlation with groundwater depth the reason for this is that as groundwater depth increases the vadose zone s average water content decreases the permeability weakens and the storage ability becomes enhanced as groundwater depth increases k has a sudden change at the water depth of approximately 8 m when groundwater depth is lower than 8 m k increases rapidly as water depth increases and the slope of the trend line is 8 89 indicating that k increases by 8 99 days with a 1 m increase to vadose zone thickness when groundwater depth is greater than 8 m the slope of the trend line is 0 62 which indicates that k increases by 0 62 days with a 1 m increase to vadose zone thickness the reason for this significant difference between k in the small and the large groundwater depth is that groundwater depth is relatively high the process of groundwater recharge is slow and the regular irrigation and rainfall remain in the vadose zone for a long period forming a stable and slow infiltration the vadose zone s average water content is relatively stable and does not change much therefore as vadose zone thickness continues to increase its storage ability does not change much and k increases at a relatively small rate by incorporating the trend line equations for n and k into eq 32 the relationship between itf and groundwater depth for the jid is expressed as 34 f τ γ 0 47 d 0 81 τ 1 8 89 d 8 γ 0 47 d 0 81 τ 1 8 89 d 8 2 γ 0 47 d 0 81 for d 8 γ 0 47 d 0 81 τ 1 0 62 d 58 38 γ 0 47 d 0 81 τ 1 0 62 d 58 38 2 γ 0 47 d 0 81 for d 8 from eq 34 the itf curves of different groundwater depths in the jid can be drawn fig 17 the transfer function at any point in the jid can be determined and the groundwater recharge at different water depths can be calculated as groundwater depth increases the curve of the itf gradually slows down and the peak value decreases when groundwater depth is no greater than 8 m the peak value is above 0 003 and the maximum lag time is approximately 500 days when the buried depth is greater than 8 m the peak value of the itf is less than 0 003 and the maximum lag time reaches more than 3000 days this proves that as groundwater depth increases the groundwater recharge that is caused by effective infiltration has an obvious smoothing and hysteresis effect the process of groundwater recharge is extremely complicated in arid areas to facilitate the accurate calculation of groundwater recharge lag effect cannot be ignored 5 discussion the vadose zone s instantaneous unit hydrograph the probability density function of the gamma distribution assumes the inflow of the first linear reservoir to be a delta function besbes 1984 only when there is high intensity with the infiltration event and the duration is short can the vadose zone s instantaneous unit hydrograph be used for calculating the groundwater recharge and ensure that the error is small in this paper the vadose zone s instantaneous unit hydrograph is improved slightly to itf which is used for calculating groundwater recharge that is caused by long duration and small strength infiltration events water diversion irrigation areas in arid regions have the characteristics of small rainfall high irrigation and long duration infiltration itf is more suitable than the instantaneous unit hydrograph of the vadose zone for calculating groundwater recharge in this area in addition compared to the traditional ewf the itf fitting results are better fig 10 this is due to ewf only having parameter b for adjusting the shape of the curve when vadose zone thickness is large a larger error can be caused by this method qian 2013 the curve shape of the itf is quite flexible under different groundwater depths and vadose zone lithological conditions the curve can be adjusted to a more ideal shape through adjustments to n and k in addition the parameters in the itf have clear physical meanings n and k are the number of linear reservoirs and the storage ability parameters when using itf for the calculation of groundwater recharge the rationality of the itf parameters can be judged based on the vadose zone s actual conditions thereby enabling the more accurate calculation of groundwater recharge o reilly s study o reilly 2004 demonstrated that parameters n and k of the vadose zone s instantaneous unit hydrograph under a single infiltration event increased as vadose zone thickness increased which is the same as the result of itf research in this paper the simulation results for a single infiltration event fig 11 and field profiles in the jid fig 16 in this paper both demonstrate that when groundwater depth does not exceed 50 m parameters n and k have a significant linear relationship with groundwater depth however in contrast to previous research in the jid parameter k increasing with the depth of groundwater can be divided into two stages when groundwater depth is less than 8 m the growth rate is greater and when it is 8 50 m the growth rate is small this article reveals the physical meaning of each parameter from a linear reservoir theory perspective while also quantitatively analyzing the relationship between itf parameters and groundwater depth these factors have not been previously studied irrigation and rainfall infiltration are important groundwater recharge sources simons et al 2015 fig 12 indicates that the yearly effective infiltration in the jid increases as in pe increases which is similar to previous research results in addition this paper s analysis results demonstrate that the in pe threshold for effective infiltration in the jid is 388 mm year which has guiding significance for the optimization of agricultural water resource management and irrigation systems in the jid and can be used as a reference for further research in similar areas fisher and healy 2008 discovered that almost all effective infiltration occurs during irrigation season which is the same as the findings of this paper however there is a difference in that the monthly effective infiltration in the jid is greatly affected by the growth period of the crops leading to an incredibly uneven distribution of effective infiltration in the period of winter irrigation october to november this feature may be identical to many other water diversion irrigation districts in northwest china as they all have similar crop types and irrigation systems there is a significant lag to groundwater recharge in arid areas wang et al 2021 in coastal plains where groundwater depth is low groundwater recharge lag time does not generally exceed one to two days when groundwater depth exceeds 10 m lag time is significant and reaches 18 35 d lu et al 2011a 2011b in areas with greater groundwater depth lag time can even reach several years rossman et al 2014 the studies of walker et al 2020a 2020b and currie et al 2020 show that the lag time is proportional to the depth of groundwater and different soil properties also affect the lag time which is similar to the results of this study in contrast to the treatment method which regards lag time as being a fixed value this article suggests that delayed groundwater recharge is a continuous process and lag time is an interval range which is determined by cross correlation fig 15 there is a significant correlation between lag time and groundwater depth in the confidence interval of lag time but it is not significant outside of the interval the use of an interval for describing the relationship between lag time and groundwater depth is more in line with the actual situation and a quantitative study of lag time and groundwater depth has not been previously considered in addition this paper establishes a direct connection between itf and groundwater depth in the jid eq 13 and fig 17 which is of great significance in the calculation of groundwater recharge for all of the jid as parameters n and k can be avoided in order to simplify the calculation process in the underdeveloped areas of northwest china the economy is relatively backward and the hydrogeological data are imperfect which is a widespread problem in many irrigation areas for these areas due to the shortage of data it is very difficult to accurately calculate groundwater recharge by analyzing the relationship between groundwater lag recharge and groundwater depth in jid this paper explains the law of groundwater lag recharge in this area which provides a reference for the calculation of groundwater lag recharge in other similar areas however because the groundwater recharge in the area with insufficient data is difficult to be verified by the measured data further research on the groundwater cycle through models such as modflow should be considered in the follow up study which will be of positive significance to the optimal management of regional water resources 6 conclusion this paper has reached the following conclusions by studying single infiltration events and the jid profile simulations 1 based on simple improvement to the vadose zone s unit hydrograph itf was established for the calculation of groundwater recharge that is caused by long duration and small intensity infiltration events the research results of single infiltration events demonstrate that the fitting result of groundwater recharge for itf is better than for ewf and soil texture and groundwater depth are important factors affecting delayed groundwater recharge 2 the yearly effective infiltration in the jid is mostly affected by in pe and the in pe threshold for effective infiltration is 388 mm year monthly effective infiltration is significantly affected by the crop growth period and effective infiltration is distributed in winter irrigation between october and november 3 groundwater recharge lag time in the jid has a confidence interval when groundwater depth is less than 50 m as groundwater depth increases lag time also increases and lag signal decreases itf parameters n and k have significant linear positive correlations with groundwater depth when groundwater depth is less than 8 m the growth rate of k is 8 89 day m and when groundwater depth is greater than 8 m the growth rate of k is 0 62 day m respectively the lag effect of groundwater recharge in arid regions is an issue that cannot be ignored credit authorship

8028,study region toowoomba queensland australia study focus in this study we derive loss model parameters suitable for use in the dynamic loss australian representative basin model arbm through the calibration of a continuous simulation hydrologic model we compare the derived parameters to those published in the literature and our results highlight the need to develop a database of calibrated loss parameters for urban catchments new hydrological insights the development of design storms for flood modelling commonly uses the initial loss continuous loss model to estimate the conversion of rainfall to runoff this loss model when applied to pervious areas uses parameters that have been calibrated for gauged rural catchments these same parameters are often applied to the pervious component of ungauged urban catchments with minimal understanding of the resulting impact on runoff this research uses a continuous simulation modelling approach to calibrate parameters suitable for use in the arbm loss model built into the hydrological modelling software xprafts through a two stage calibration approach the model offered a satisfactory fit nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 5 for 9 of the 11 selected storm events with seven events exceeding a nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 75 events used in the calibration validation included peak flows as low as 9 m3 s and as high as 600 m3 s developing these loss model parameters offers new insights into the suitability of a dynamic loss model approach in an urban catchment in regional australia and provides an alternative to the parameters already available in the literature which were found to overestimate the peak flow in frequent events keywords continuous simulation loss calibration 1 introduction understanding the hydrologic response of urban catchments to extreme rainfall events is fundamental to making informed engineering and planning decisions around urban development flood mitigation and disaster management pathiraja et al 2012 the need for an accurate hydrologic model and an understanding of the uncertainty associated with the model s results cannot be overstated in january 2011 toowoomba a regional town in the state of queensland australia experienced its worst flood on record with gowrie creek breaking its banks in multiple locations in addition to inundation the floodwaters proved hazardous with high velocities resulting in dangerous conditions for pedestrians and motorists at major road crossings resulting in the death of at least four people following this major flooding a design event hydrologic model was developed as part of the gowrie creek flood risk management study undertaken for the toowoomba regional council a subsequent peer review panel highlighted the need to understand the uncertainty in flood hydrographs being produced by the hydrologic modelling a critical hydrologic parameter that leads to a high level of uncertainty in hydrologic modelling is rainfall loss ball et al 2019 rainfall loss can be defined as the amount of rainfall that does not appear as immediate runoff hill et al 1998 rainfall losses are often accounted for by separating the losses into two categories the initial loss interception and infiltration prior to saturation or antecedent moisture conditions and the continuing loss infiltration post saturation phillips et al 2014 most initial loss continuing loss models greatly simplify the condition of the catchment prior to the event cameron et al 1999 rainfall losses in the catchment can vary as a result of geography antecedent moisture conditions and the intensity of the rainfall event ball et al 2019 the most commonly used approach for simulating a catchment s runoff response to rainfall in australia is the design event method ball et al 2019 this method uses the widely adopted initial loss continuing loss model while it is simple to implement in practice it assumes that the transformation of rainfall to runoff is probability neutral i e the annual exceedance probability of the design rainfall data will always result in a flood of the same annual exceedance probability kavetski et al 2006 the literature offers minimal guidance on the adoption of appropriate loss values rahman et al 2002 tularam and ilahee 2007 therefore rural catchment based initial loss continuing loss parameter assumptions continue to be used for urban pervious areas even though the suitability of the parameters for use in urban catchments is not well understood ball et al 2019 dynamic loss models differ from initial loss continuing loss models as they account for the interaction between periods of wetting and drying through direct simulation of the physical processes occurring in the catchment cameron et al 1999 kavetski et al 2006 muncaster et al 1999 the impact each loss model has on the estimated rainfall excess is demonstrated in the hyetographs in fig 1 increased computational capacity and the availability of or ability to generate sub daily rainfall data has allowed for more complex modelling with improved representation of the complex physical processes within a catchment boughton and droop 2003 continuous simulation models seek to overcome the issue of assumed antecedent moisture conditions by modelling a complete sequence of rainfall data over a much longer duration than that of a typical design temporal pattern blazkova and beven 2009 boughton 2005 calver et al 2009 camici et al 2011 thereby rejecting the concept of probability neutral conversion of rainfall to runoff continuous simulation modelling removes the need for assumptions of the antecedent moisture conditions of the catchment and allows for a more accurate accounting of the hydrologic losses boughton and droop 2003 muncaster et al 1999 while continuous simulation modelling is no less complex than design event methods it provides a more realistic design hydrograph in terms of volume and duration that has a variety of applications grimaldi et al 2021 linsley and crawford 1974 were one of the early adopters of continuous simulation modelling in an urban catchment with their discussion on a computer based continuous simulation model the stanford watershed model they developed in the 1960 s and later modified for other applications more recently rangari et al 2015 described a number of urban stormwater models available to undertake continuous simulation however there still appears to be limited published applications or case studies in urban catchments ling et al 2015 compared various design flood estimation methods for both urban and rural catchments however excluded continuous simulation modelling from the urban catchment case study grimaldi et al 2021 proposed a step forward and testing for the practical use of their continuous simulation approach in an ungauged catchment however the catchment used in the assessment was less than 25 urban several continuous simulation models of rural catchments have been documented in literature the study of the moore river catchment in western australia completed by newton and walton 2000 using continuous simulation modelling achieved good agreement with both a flood frequency analysis of the stream gauge and design event modelling boughton and hill 1997 compared the results of a continuous simulation model for the boggy creek catchment in victoria australia against the available stream gauge and found good agreement for rare and extreme events boughton et al 2002 followed up this study with an assessment of the avon river and spring creek catchments in victoria australia and found that limited rainfall and stream gauge data offered minimal opportunity for calibration the availability of a sufficient length of continuous rainfall data with a small enough time step to accurately model the catchment of interest is a key limitation of continuous simulation modelling viviroli et al 2009 however if data is available continuous simulation modelling is seen as the most rigorous modelling approach for understanding the interaction between variables with joint probability as it directly simulates a long period of climatic conditions kavetski et al 2006 while there is agreement that continuous simulation models should be used where data permits there is a disconnect between the modelling software used in the literature and the modelling used by practitioners the abovementioned studies all adopted the rainfall excess model the australian water balance model boughton 2004 and routed the rainfall excess through the this model boyd et al 1996 however industry practitioners generally use software models that have a graphical user interface including xprafts xpsolution 2008 swmm epa 2015 or urbs carroll 1994 xprafts is a non linear runoff routing model used extensively throughout australia and the asia pacific region and is recommended by australian modelling guidelines i e australian rainfall and runoff ball et al 2019 for use in catchment hydrologic modelling despite its widespread use the documentation of suitable loss parameters for the arbm dynamic loss model is limited to a set of parameters presented by goyen 1981 and another documented in the australian capital territory stormwater design guidelines department of urban services 2021 herein referred to as the act guidelines this is a significant gap in research given australia s tropical temperate arid and alpine habitats and climate regimes all of which have high variability head et al 2014 limiting practitioners to either the initial loss continuing loss model or the arbm model with parameters based on goyen s research leads to increased uncertainty especially in ungauged catchments where calibration is not possible using continuous simulation models in urban catchments presents several challenges in addition to the lack of documented input loss parameters the spatial distribution of available rainfall data as well as the connection of impervious area and hydraulic controls all influence the timing and volume of runoff at the catchment outlet for example dayaratne and perera 2004 modelled the urban giralang catchment in canberra and found variations in time to peak with a lag of up to one hour between the modelled and observed event as a result of adopting a single representative rain gauge despite a catchment area of only 94 ha while there is uncertainty in all hydrologic modelling approaches the level of uncertainty declines with model calibration the development of a catalogue of suitable arbm loss parameters would be a significant achievement for the hydrologic community and would be of particular importance to applied hydrologists working with similar simulation models the new contribution being offer by this paper is the development of loss parameters for a regional urban catchment and highlight the need for a catalogue of parameters that can be used more broadly by applied hydrologists across other catchments this research aims to 1 develop a continuous simulation hydrologic model for an urban catchment 2 calibrate the arbm parameters for the gowrie creek catchment and 3 compare these model results to existing documented model parameters to assess the need for further cataloguing of region specific parameters both within australia and internationally materials and methods used to develop the model are described in section 2 section 3 presents the calibration results which are then compared to other documented parameters in section 4 finally our conclusions are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the gowrie creek catchment is a heavily urbanised catchment in the city of toowoomba in the state of queensland australia toowoomba is considered to be sub tropical with an average annual rainfall of 700 mm the majority of which falls over the wet season from november to march the 51 km2 catchment shown in fig 2 is twice as long as it is wide and has a well defined heavily modified creek line elevations within the catchment range from 750 m australian height datum ahd at the southern and eastern extents to 550 m ahd at the catchment outlet to the north this significant height difference across the catchment results in sub catchment areas varying in slope from 3 near the valley to 9 at higher elevations the tributaries within the catchment contain a series of detention basins installed to help reduce flood risk after the major flooding in 2011 additional flood mitigation measures and monitoring stations were installed fig 2 shows the gauge locations and table 1 provides additional details for each gauge fifteen rain gauges and one stream gauge currently monitor the catchment however only six of these were in operation during the 2011 flood event since 2016 11 gauges have been found to provide reliable measurements 2 2 xprafts model description an xprafts semi distributed hydrological model was used to represent the gowrie creek system the software outputs runoff hydrographs at defined points throughout a catchment based on a user defined set of catchment characteristics and rainfall data key user defined catchment characteristics include sub catchment area impervious area and loss the pervious area loss within this software is represented by the arbm dynamic loss approach adapted from the research of chapman 1968 1970 and is summarised in fig 3 this loss approach can be visualised as a series of interconnected buckets of varying sizes rainfall that isn t intercepted by trees or plants interception storage capacity isc may be captured in minor surface depressions depression storage capacity dsc if the rainfall is intense enough runoff may result from the dsc otherwise infiltration to the upper soil capacity usc occurs water is redistributed between the usc and the lower storage capacity lsc depending on the capacity available within the bucket water from the lsc can then be drained into the groundwater storage capacity gsc which contributes to baseflow the arbm allows for the simulation of soil moisture depletion through evaporation between rainfall events fleming 1974 with evapotranspiration depleting the isc dsc usc and lsc any excess rainfall is routed to the catchment outlet based on the non linear runoff routing method developed by laurenson 1964 the arbm has 15 input parameters goyen 1981 found that nine of these are consistent across all land use types four have a negligible impact on runoff during extreme rainfall events and two parameters within the infiltration function are highly sensitive sorptivity s0 and hydraulic conductivity k0 as sorptivity is a component of hydraulic conductivity the two parameters are degenerate meaning they cannot be solved in isolation and therefore one of the two parameters has to be fixed to allow the infiltration function to be optimised for this reason we fixed sorptivity at 10 mm min0 5 in line with the results of goyen 1981 in addition to the infiltration function s sensitivity it is logical that the dsc would be sensitive given that it directly controls the initial conversion of rainfall to runoff an increasing dsc allows more rainfall to transfer to the usc direct measurement of the arbm parameters is difficult uncertain costly and impractical mein and mcmahon 1982 and as a result was not attempted as part of this research 2 3 sub catchment delineation the total gowrie creek catchment was delineated into 23 sub catchments as shown in fig 2 based on a 1 m digital elevation model derived from an aerial survey captured in 2010 this data drainage infrastructure data and overland flow mapping completed in 2018 were supplied by the toowoomba regional council the urban nature of the catchment required manual catchment delineation as automatic methods could not accommodate the hydraulic impact of roads and underground drainage infrastructure while further delineation to increase the number of sub catchments could have been undertaken boyd 1985 showed that for natural catchments of this size the number of sub catchments should be at the lower end of the 9 45 range as the catchment being assessed is urban a number closer to the middle of the range was targeted in addition rezaei sadr 2020 showed that delineating sub catchments to a size less than 3 of overall catchment offered no improvement in modelling accuracy the area of the gowrie creek sub catchments is approximately 5 of the overall catchment size 2 4 rainfall data and spatial distribution the hydrologic model requires rainfall data to be applied to each of the delineated sub catchments the rainfall data for all 11 rain gauges shown in fig 2 was supplied by the toowoomba regional council as a cumulative rainfall total in five minute increments with the accumulation resetting at the end of each day there were some clear errors in the rainfall data including increments of rainfall significantly higher than would be expected such as rainfall intensities greater than 500 mm hr with no corresponding stream gauge record in addition one of the gauges showed an annual period of no rainfall suggesting that it had malfunctioned periods of erroneous data were removed from the datasets to allow the data to be used the rain gauge data needs to be spatially distributed via interpolation to the sub catchment centroid many schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed for the spatial interpolation of rainfall thiessen 1911 shepard 1968 delhomme 1978 statistical approaches such as kriging have been found to perform better than interpolation methods such as thiessen or inverse distance weighted idw to estimate monthly and annual totals tabios iii and salas 1985 bussières and hogg 1989 creutin and obled 1982 however these previous studies or reviews have focussed on sites with an order of magnitude lower spatial density of rain gauges 0 01 0 001 per km2 than the gowrie creek catchment 0 12 0 22 per km2 dirks et al 1998 conducted a comparison study of three interpolation methods thiessen idw and areal mean and a statistical method kriging for norfolk island a small catchment with high gauging density similar to the gowrie creek catchment all methods were performed in a comparable manner and dirks et al 1998 concluded that the idw method was the most appropriate choice for practical use due to its minimal computational effort the idw interpolation method proposed by shepard 1968 and represented in eq 1 assumes that the rainfall observations closer to a position at which rainfall is to be estimated will have a greater influence on the value 1 z p i 1 n z i d i p i 1 n 1 d i p where zp interpolated rainfall value at location of interest mm zi known rainfall value at i rainfall station di distance to i rainfall station from location of interest p power parameter the adopted power parameter compounds the influence of the nearest observation and as the power parameter approaches infinity the idw interpolation approaches that proposed by thiessen or nearest neighbour interpolation the optimum power parameter was determined using the leave one out or fictitious point method where a known observation point we used gauge number 11 drayton is left out and the surrounding gauges are used to estimate its rainfall series the interpolated and observed rainfall series for drayton were evaluated for their root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae with a lower error identifying a better fit fig 4 shows that the error decreases with a reduction in the power parameter the magnitude of the error however is not significant enough to suggest that the estimated series is sensitive to the power parameter adopted and the difference in annual rainfall between a power parameter of one and a power parameter of six is only 60 mm dirks et al 1998 reached a similar conclusion and suggested that the default power parameter of two would be suitable due to the high density of rainfall gauges and the known rainfall variability in the catchment only the nearest three gauges were used for the interpolation in this research 2 5 impervious area runoff in a hydrologic model is highly sensitive to the impervious fraction of the catchment alley and veenhuis 1983 as a greater impervious fraction results in a higher conversion of rainfall to runoff the total impervious area tia is generally determined using land use mapping and the use of impervious fractions to convert the total area of different land uses to impervious areas only the fraction of the tia that is directly connected to stormwater infrastructure including urban roads and rooves is known as the effective impervious area eia hartcher and chowdhury 2017 and it is well established that the eia is of greater importance than the tia cherkaver 1975 beard and chang 1979 in this research the eia was determined using both a regression analysis and land use mapping 2 5 1 determining eia via regression analysis the eia of the gowrie creek catchment was estimated through the analysis of rainfall and streamflow records using the method described by miller 1978 this estimation method has been used extensively in research boyd et al 1993 chiew and mcmahon 1999 the assessment involves calculating the gradient of the regression between runoff and rainfall excluding events with runoff from pervious areas as rainfall is linearly proportional to impervious runoff rainfall events suitable for the regression analysis were chosen by adopting an inter event time as proposed by lloyd 1990 aryal et al 2007 and rodríguez blanco et al 2012 of two hours to separate individual storms and were then further filtered to consider a minimum rainfall depth of 2 mm and a maximum rainfall duration of 10 h a regression analysis of the remaining events is shown in fig 5 the gradient of the line indicates an eia fraction of 0 18 or 18 2 5 2 determining eia via land use mapping catchment planning mapping was used to estimate the total area ta of different land uses including urban areas ua commercial roads other development types and open space with the ta of each land use known ratios of ta to tia and tia to eia for each land use as detailed in the queensland urban drainage manual ipweaq 2016 and presented in table 2 were used to determine the overall catchment eia of 41 this is significantly higher than the regression based eia 18 and is likely due to the relatively unknown eia to tia ratio of differing road types as well as a likely overestimation of the eia to tia ratio of uas due to the age of catchment development the land use mapping method also found the eia to be 87 of the ua which doesn t reflect the findings of phillips et al 2014 who found that across eight catchments it was consistently around 35 of the ua this compares well to the regression based method which was 38 of the ua the land use mapping method is therefore overestimating the eia for the catchment and the regression analysis best represents the effective impervious area of the catchment while the land use mapping method overestimated the eia it did allow disaggregation to a sub catchment level we therefore adopted the impervious area ratios for each sub catchment from the land use mapping method while achieving an overall eia equivalent to the regression analysis 18 the results of this analysis for each sub catchment was used as the impervious component of the hydrologic model and is shown in fig 6 2 6 calibration and validation 2 6 1 principles a two stage calibration approach as performed by dayaratne 2000 and broekhuizen et al 2020 was utilised stage 1 calibrated small historic storm events resulting in runoff from impervious areas only this was followed by stage 2 in which larger historic storm events that included pervious area runoff were calibrated for the stage 1 calibration hydraulic conductivity ko and storage capacities dsc usc and lsc were adjusted until there was no runoff from the pervious area this effectively set a lower limit for these parameters for the stage 2 calibration ko and dsc were adjusted with the aim of making the model s output hydrograph match the observed the parameters determined via calibration were then used to run the model for several validation events to ensure that parameter performance was consistent across a range of observed events to determine calibration appropriateness the performance statistics detailed by moriasi et al 2007 and summarised in table 3 were used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a coefficient commonly used to determine the predictive power of a hydrologic model mccuen et al 2006 with a coefficient of 1 0 representing a perfect fit the rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr is a measure of the spread of model results relative to the observed results rmse values less than half the standard deviation are generally considered to indicate good model prediction singh et al 2005 therefore the lower values of both rmse and in turn rsr represented a good model fit the percentage of bias pbias is a measure of the tendency of the modelled result to be above or below the observed result of et al 1999 with a pbias of 0 representing a perfect fit peak flow and volume difference were also assessed peak flow is an important hydrologic criterion and a key input for hydraulic design 2 6 2 historic storm events the continuous simulation model was run for the complete series of available and reliable historic rainfall data and individual storm events were selected for calibration validation the selected storm events included 13 events during the 2010 11 wet season as well as the wet seasons between 2016 and 2019 as summarised in table 4 there was a distinct lack of large stage 2 calibration validation flood events for the study catchment inspection of the stream gauge data at the outlet of the catchment highlighted that the 2010 11 wet season was the last significant wet season for the catchment there were no subsequent wet seasons with events exceeding the peak flow of event 13 no reliable rainfall data prior to the 2010 11 wet season was available for use 3 calibration validation results and discussion 3 1 stage 1 calibration eleven events were assessed as part of the stage 1 calibration validation process ranging in observed peak flow from 9 m3 s to 79 m3 s the calibration process confirmed that the dsc was a key calibration parameter as the volume of runoff was sensitive to this parameter this is evident in fig 7 which shows the difference between the volume of modelled runoff to the volume of observed runoff with an increasing dsc the results also show that events 3 and 4 were suitable for use in the calibration process due to the notable change with increasing dsc comparing the performance statistics of nse pbias peak flow difference and rsr for events 3 and 4 fig 8 a dsc of 7 mm clearly resulted in the best fit visual inspection of the model discharge against the observed discharge at the catchment outlet fig 10 also suggests the model is representing the observed flows well the dsc of 5 mm performed best for event 4 in terms of pbias and rsr but performed very poorly in nse and peak flow difference for event 3 suggesting that it is not suitable for other events when calibrating the dsc a ko of 0 3 mm min was adopted the sensitivity of the model to ko was also investigated with the results presented in fig 9 showing that 0 3 mm min is optimum when adopting a dsc of 7 mm and ko of 0 3 mm min for the nine validation events six performed satisfactorily with nse values ranging from 0 50 to 0 92 nse results for all events are presented in fig 13 while nse is considered a key performance indicator peak flow and volume were also critical to further justify the impervious fraction and spatial distribution of rainfall of the three stage 1 events that performed unsatisfactorily all produced peak flows within 20 of the observed and two produced volumes within approximately 30 of the observed these results suggest that the adopted impervious fraction is representative of the catchment as a higher impervious fraction would result in a higher peak flow and increased volume in addition visual inspection of the stage 1 calibration results showed that the shape of the modelled hydrograph matched the observed suggesting the interpolated rainfall is representing the ungauged rainfall it was expected that given the relatively small magnitude of observed flow used in the stage 1 events some results would be unsatisfactory smaller flow events often correspond to localised storms that may only fall over some sub catchments but are intense enough to produce runoff from those sub catchments distributing the recorded rainfall if it did in fact fall over the rain gauge over the entire sub catchment may therefore not reflect the nature of the event despite this the relatively small number of unsatisfactory validation results suggests that the model represents the hydrologic response of the catchment well 3 2 stage 2 calibration as expected the stage 2 calibration was sensitive to both dsc and k0 however through the stage 2 calibration it was found that the impact of dsc and k0 on the calibration process was similar a decreasing dsc or k0 value resulted in an increase in peak flow the k0 value of 0 3 mm min adopted as part of the stage 1 calibration to limit pervious area runoff provided the lower limit for calibration as part of stage 2 the dsc parameters assessed as part of stage 1 were also assessed in stage 2 the results in fig 12 show that the nse and peak flow generally increased with decreasing dsc however event 12 appeared to reach a maximum nse when dsc was near 7 mm and the peak flow increase plateaued when dsc approached 5 mm in addition the stage 1 calibration highlighted that a dsc less than 6 mm resulted in a very poor calibration for event 3 suggesting that the relatively improved performance of event 12 with decreasing dsc may be overstated given that the results presented in fig 11 show that the model generally underestimated the recorded peak flow increasing the k0 value above 0 3 mm min would only serve to reduce the peak flow further comparing the modelled hydrographs to the observed flows fig 12 further highlights how both events while visually achieving the hydrograph shape underestimated both volume and peak flow event 13 seems to show an observed second smaller peak approximately one hour after the initial peak that wasn t apparent in the model while the model did show a second peak it was much closer to the first peak resulting in a broadening out of the hydrograph it is known that during this event the stream gauge malfunctioned and the results were interpolated from field observations after the event it is likely that this interpolation overestimated the nature of the event and was the cause of the discrepancies shown 3 3 other arbm parameter sensitivity the arbm parameters of dsc and ko were identified by both the literature and this research as the most sensitive in estimating the pervious area loss a sensitivity analysis of the other arbm parameters as defined in fig 3 was undertaken to ensure that they were also optimised as part of the two stage calibration approach the sensitivity analysis reduced the other arbm parameters by 20 while keeping the dsc and ko at their calibrated values with the results presented in fig 13 stage 1 calibration events and fig 14 stage 2 calibration event the sensitivity analysis confirmed that the other arbm parameters were optimised as one of the stage 1 calibration events event 4 produced pervious area runoff in addition there was an insignificant increase in the peak flow volume in the stage 2 calibration event it is also worth noting that increasing the sensitivity of the other arbm parameters was not needed as the parameters had already been reduced to ensure no pervious area runoff from the stage 1 events increasing the other arbm parameters by 20 would produce the same result as the calibrated parameters for the stage 1 events while potentially reducing the peak flow volume in the stage 2 events fig 15 4 discussion on loss parameters and calibration challenges 4 1 loss model parameter comparison to literature the calibrated arbm parameters determined from this study are presented in table 5 the parameters recommended by goyen 1981 for residential lawns determined through calibration of a number of catchments in canberra along with parameters documented in the act guidelines department of urban services 2021 are also shown while the infiltration parameters s0 and k0 are somewhat comparable the storage capacities are significantly different most notably the dsc this result is surprising as goyen s parameters are based solely on pervious area whereas our study has some impervious areas included in the pervious area component of the model due to the impervious area component reflecting eia only this is a key contribution of this research and illustrates the need to develop a catalogue of arbm parameters that can be used by applied hydrologists when investigating catchments with similar geographical or climatic conditions adopting values in line with goyen 1981 or the act guidelines resulted in runoff from the pervious areas in the stage 1 events and given the high proportion of pervious area within the catchment the discharge flow rate and volume at the outlet of the catchment were significantly higher as highlighted in fig 16 4 2 overcoming calibration challenges currently continuous simulation modelling in urban catchments is rarely undertaken in practice or reported in the literature the challenges faced in the development of our continuous simulation model for the gowrie creek catchment demonstrate the reasons for its limited use rainfall data provided for the catchment seemed reasonable on paper however the rainfall isohyets provided in fig 4 show the significant spatial variation across what would be considered a relatively small catchment the use of the idw method of interpolation seemed to overcome this issue as the shape and magnitude of the hydrographs presented generally reflected the observed however to achieve the results presented a lag of 30 min had to be applied to the modelled output it is believed that this lag is not uncommon given the previously mentioned issues faced by dayaratne and perera 2004 inspection of the input data highlighted that the lag is likely to be a combination of rainfall being recorded regularly five minutes while stream gauge records can have timesteps of up to 30 min in addition the hydrologic model s response to rainfall on impervious areas in particular may not represent real conditions especially for small events the amount of impervious area in particular eia is a vital input to an urban hydrological model while it is difficult to directly source this data the methods detailed in the study seem to have produced a value that represents the catchment well given that 10 of the 11 stage 1 calibration events produced peak flows within 20 of the observed the lack of significant rainfall events in the catchment within the period of data available suggests that smaller impervious runoff only events may form a critical part of a flood frequency analysis it is recognised that the lack of rainfall events does impact the validity of the stage 2 calibration investigation of the stream gauge data shows that a peak flow above that of calibration event 12 has only been recorded seven times with all but two of these occurring prior to 2010 and one being validation event 13 there was an event recorded early in january 2011 unfortunately the rain gauge data provided did not cover the full extent of the event and was therefore not used in the calibration however this does not detract however from the findings of this research and highlights the need for further cataloguing of arbm parameters for wider adoption of continuous simulation modelling by applied hydrologists 5 conclusions predicting the hydrologic response of urban catchments to extreme rainfall events is fundamental to making informed engineering and planning decisions associated with urban development flood mitigation and disaster management improving the uncertainty in all hydrologic modelling requires careful model calibration including the utilisation of appropriate model parameters for the specific catchment this paper focussed on determining catchment specific loss parameters for the gowrie creek catchment in toowoomba australia as part of the model calibration it developed and calibrated a continuous simulation hydrologic model for an urban catchment and then determined the arbm parameters suitable for the gowrie creek catchment these parameters have been documented within this paper and offer new values for the possible use by applied hydrologists dealing with similar catchment and climatic conditions we then simulated other documented arbm parameters to highlight the need for further cataloguing of suitable parameters both within australia and internationally despite the challenges discussed this research effectively calibrated an urban continuous simulation model using modelling software widely used in industry the performance of the model in particular the nse and peak flow showed that the model could produce suitable design hydrographs for the catchment if a sufficient length of rainfall data was available it also showed that loss model parameters available in the literature in particular those provided by goyen 1981 may significantly overestimate peak flows for small events this research has provided industry with an additional set of loss parameters that may be applicable to other urban catchments whilst highlighting the gap that is preventing widespread industry adoption of continuous simulation models like xprafts by documenting a new set of parameters this research may help improve confidence in the modelling of similar ungauged catchments or at least highlight the variability likely to be experienced in urban catchments throughout australia this research also highlights that assumptions around impervious fractions and catchment losses may be overestimating urban catchment runoff credit authorship contribution statement i w brown conceptualization methodology software

8028,study region toowoomba queensland australia study focus in this study we derive loss model parameters suitable for use in the dynamic loss australian representative basin model arbm through the calibration of a continuous simulation hydrologic model we compare the derived parameters to those published in the literature and our results highlight the need to develop a database of calibrated loss parameters for urban catchments new hydrological insights the development of design storms for flood modelling commonly uses the initial loss continuous loss model to estimate the conversion of rainfall to runoff this loss model when applied to pervious areas uses parameters that have been calibrated for gauged rural catchments these same parameters are often applied to the pervious component of ungauged urban catchments with minimal understanding of the resulting impact on runoff this research uses a continuous simulation modelling approach to calibrate parameters suitable for use in the arbm loss model built into the hydrological modelling software xprafts through a two stage calibration approach the model offered a satisfactory fit nash sutcliffe efficiency 0 5 for 9 of the 11 selected storm events with seven events exceeding a nash sutcliffe efficiency of 0 75 events used in the calibration validation included peak flows as low as 9 m3 s and as high as 600 m3 s developing these loss model parameters offers new insights into the suitability of a dynamic loss model approach in an urban catchment in regional australia and provides an alternative to the parameters already available in the literature which were found to overestimate the peak flow in frequent events keywords continuous simulation loss calibration 1 introduction understanding the hydrologic response of urban catchments to extreme rainfall events is fundamental to making informed engineering and planning decisions around urban development flood mitigation and disaster management pathiraja et al 2012 the need for an accurate hydrologic model and an understanding of the uncertainty associated with the model s results cannot be overstated in january 2011 toowoomba a regional town in the state of queensland australia experienced its worst flood on record with gowrie creek breaking its banks in multiple locations in addition to inundation the floodwaters proved hazardous with high velocities resulting in dangerous conditions for pedestrians and motorists at major road crossings resulting in the death of at least four people following this major flooding a design event hydrologic model was developed as part of the gowrie creek flood risk management study undertaken for the toowoomba regional council a subsequent peer review panel highlighted the need to understand the uncertainty in flood hydrographs being produced by the hydrologic modelling a critical hydrologic parameter that leads to a high level of uncertainty in hydrologic modelling is rainfall loss ball et al 2019 rainfall loss can be defined as the amount of rainfall that does not appear as immediate runoff hill et al 1998 rainfall losses are often accounted for by separating the losses into two categories the initial loss interception and infiltration prior to saturation or antecedent moisture conditions and the continuing loss infiltration post saturation phillips et al 2014 most initial loss continuing loss models greatly simplify the condition of the catchment prior to the event cameron et al 1999 rainfall losses in the catchment can vary as a result of geography antecedent moisture conditions and the intensity of the rainfall event ball et al 2019 the most commonly used approach for simulating a catchment s runoff response to rainfall in australia is the design event method ball et al 2019 this method uses the widely adopted initial loss continuing loss model while it is simple to implement in practice it assumes that the transformation of rainfall to runoff is probability neutral i e the annual exceedance probability of the design rainfall data will always result in a flood of the same annual exceedance probability kavetski et al 2006 the literature offers minimal guidance on the adoption of appropriate loss values rahman et al 2002 tularam and ilahee 2007 therefore rural catchment based initial loss continuing loss parameter assumptions continue to be used for urban pervious areas even though the suitability of the parameters for use in urban catchments is not well understood ball et al 2019 dynamic loss models differ from initial loss continuing loss models as they account for the interaction between periods of wetting and drying through direct simulation of the physical processes occurring in the catchment cameron et al 1999 kavetski et al 2006 muncaster et al 1999 the impact each loss model has on the estimated rainfall excess is demonstrated in the hyetographs in fig 1 increased computational capacity and the availability of or ability to generate sub daily rainfall data has allowed for more complex modelling with improved representation of the complex physical processes within a catchment boughton and droop 2003 continuous simulation models seek to overcome the issue of assumed antecedent moisture conditions by modelling a complete sequence of rainfall data over a much longer duration than that of a typical design temporal pattern blazkova and beven 2009 boughton 2005 calver et al 2009 camici et al 2011 thereby rejecting the concept of probability neutral conversion of rainfall to runoff continuous simulation modelling removes the need for assumptions of the antecedent moisture conditions of the catchment and allows for a more accurate accounting of the hydrologic losses boughton and droop 2003 muncaster et al 1999 while continuous simulation modelling is no less complex than design event methods it provides a more realistic design hydrograph in terms of volume and duration that has a variety of applications grimaldi et al 2021 linsley and crawford 1974 were one of the early adopters of continuous simulation modelling in an urban catchment with their discussion on a computer based continuous simulation model the stanford watershed model they developed in the 1960 s and later modified for other applications more recently rangari et al 2015 described a number of urban stormwater models available to undertake continuous simulation however there still appears to be limited published applications or case studies in urban catchments ling et al 2015 compared various design flood estimation methods for both urban and rural catchments however excluded continuous simulation modelling from the urban catchment case study grimaldi et al 2021 proposed a step forward and testing for the practical use of their continuous simulation approach in an ungauged catchment however the catchment used in the assessment was less than 25 urban several continuous simulation models of rural catchments have been documented in literature the study of the moore river catchment in western australia completed by newton and walton 2000 using continuous simulation modelling achieved good agreement with both a flood frequency analysis of the stream gauge and design event modelling boughton and hill 1997 compared the results of a continuous simulation model for the boggy creek catchment in victoria australia against the available stream gauge and found good agreement for rare and extreme events boughton et al 2002 followed up this study with an assessment of the avon river and spring creek catchments in victoria australia and found that limited rainfall and stream gauge data offered minimal opportunity for calibration the availability of a sufficient length of continuous rainfall data with a small enough time step to accurately model the catchment of interest is a key limitation of continuous simulation modelling viviroli et al 2009 however if data is available continuous simulation modelling is seen as the most rigorous modelling approach for understanding the interaction between variables with joint probability as it directly simulates a long period of climatic conditions kavetski et al 2006 while there is agreement that continuous simulation models should be used where data permits there is a disconnect between the modelling software used in the literature and the modelling used by practitioners the abovementioned studies all adopted the rainfall excess model the australian water balance model boughton 2004 and routed the rainfall excess through the this model boyd et al 1996 however industry practitioners generally use software models that have a graphical user interface including xprafts xpsolution 2008 swmm epa 2015 or urbs carroll 1994 xprafts is a non linear runoff routing model used extensively throughout australia and the asia pacific region and is recommended by australian modelling guidelines i e australian rainfall and runoff ball et al 2019 for use in catchment hydrologic modelling despite its widespread use the documentation of suitable loss parameters for the arbm dynamic loss model is limited to a set of parameters presented by goyen 1981 and another documented in the australian capital territory stormwater design guidelines department of urban services 2021 herein referred to as the act guidelines this is a significant gap in research given australia s tropical temperate arid and alpine habitats and climate regimes all of which have high variability head et al 2014 limiting practitioners to either the initial loss continuing loss model or the arbm model with parameters based on goyen s research leads to increased uncertainty especially in ungauged catchments where calibration is not possible using continuous simulation models in urban catchments presents several challenges in addition to the lack of documented input loss parameters the spatial distribution of available rainfall data as well as the connection of impervious area and hydraulic controls all influence the timing and volume of runoff at the catchment outlet for example dayaratne and perera 2004 modelled the urban giralang catchment in canberra and found variations in time to peak with a lag of up to one hour between the modelled and observed event as a result of adopting a single representative rain gauge despite a catchment area of only 94 ha while there is uncertainty in all hydrologic modelling approaches the level of uncertainty declines with model calibration the development of a catalogue of suitable arbm loss parameters would be a significant achievement for the hydrologic community and would be of particular importance to applied hydrologists working with similar simulation models the new contribution being offer by this paper is the development of loss parameters for a regional urban catchment and highlight the need for a catalogue of parameters that can be used more broadly by applied hydrologists across other catchments this research aims to 1 develop a continuous simulation hydrologic model for an urban catchment 2 calibrate the arbm parameters for the gowrie creek catchment and 3 compare these model results to existing documented model parameters to assess the need for further cataloguing of region specific parameters both within australia and internationally materials and methods used to develop the model are described in section 2 section 3 presents the calibration results which are then compared to other documented parameters in section 4 finally our conclusions are presented in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the gowrie creek catchment is a heavily urbanised catchment in the city of toowoomba in the state of queensland australia toowoomba is considered to be sub tropical with an average annual rainfall of 700 mm the majority of which falls over the wet season from november to march the 51 km2 catchment shown in fig 2 is twice as long as it is wide and has a well defined heavily modified creek line elevations within the catchment range from 750 m australian height datum ahd at the southern and eastern extents to 550 m ahd at the catchment outlet to the north this significant height difference across the catchment results in sub catchment areas varying in slope from 3 near the valley to 9 at higher elevations the tributaries within the catchment contain a series of detention basins installed to help reduce flood risk after the major flooding in 2011 additional flood mitigation measures and monitoring stations were installed fig 2 shows the gauge locations and table 1 provides additional details for each gauge fifteen rain gauges and one stream gauge currently monitor the catchment however only six of these were in operation during the 2011 flood event since 2016 11 gauges have been found to provide reliable measurements 2 2 xprafts model description an xprafts semi distributed hydrological model was used to represent the gowrie creek system the software outputs runoff hydrographs at defined points throughout a catchment based on a user defined set of catchment characteristics and rainfall data key user defined catchment characteristics include sub catchment area impervious area and loss the pervious area loss within this software is represented by the arbm dynamic loss approach adapted from the research of chapman 1968 1970 and is summarised in fig 3 this loss approach can be visualised as a series of interconnected buckets of varying sizes rainfall that isn t intercepted by trees or plants interception storage capacity isc may be captured in minor surface depressions depression storage capacity dsc if the rainfall is intense enough runoff may result from the dsc otherwise infiltration to the upper soil capacity usc occurs water is redistributed between the usc and the lower storage capacity lsc depending on the capacity available within the bucket water from the lsc can then be drained into the groundwater storage capacity gsc which contributes to baseflow the arbm allows for the simulation of soil moisture depletion through evaporation between rainfall events fleming 1974 with evapotranspiration depleting the isc dsc usc and lsc any excess rainfall is routed to the catchment outlet based on the non linear runoff routing method developed by laurenson 1964 the arbm has 15 input parameters goyen 1981 found that nine of these are consistent across all land use types four have a negligible impact on runoff during extreme rainfall events and two parameters within the infiltration function are highly sensitive sorptivity s0 and hydraulic conductivity k0 as sorptivity is a component of hydraulic conductivity the two parameters are degenerate meaning they cannot be solved in isolation and therefore one of the two parameters has to be fixed to allow the infiltration function to be optimised for this reason we fixed sorptivity at 10 mm min0 5 in line with the results of goyen 1981 in addition to the infiltration function s sensitivity it is logical that the dsc would be sensitive given that it directly controls the initial conversion of rainfall to runoff an increasing dsc allows more rainfall to transfer to the usc direct measurement of the arbm parameters is difficult uncertain costly and impractical mein and mcmahon 1982 and as a result was not attempted as part of this research 2 3 sub catchment delineation the total gowrie creek catchment was delineated into 23 sub catchments as shown in fig 2 based on a 1 m digital elevation model derived from an aerial survey captured in 2010 this data drainage infrastructure data and overland flow mapping completed in 2018 were supplied by the toowoomba regional council the urban nature of the catchment required manual catchment delineation as automatic methods could not accommodate the hydraulic impact of roads and underground drainage infrastructure while further delineation to increase the number of sub catchments could have been undertaken boyd 1985 showed that for natural catchments of this size the number of sub catchments should be at the lower end of the 9 45 range as the catchment being assessed is urban a number closer to the middle of the range was targeted in addition rezaei sadr 2020 showed that delineating sub catchments to a size less than 3 of overall catchment offered no improvement in modelling accuracy the area of the gowrie creek sub catchments is approximately 5 of the overall catchment size 2 4 rainfall data and spatial distribution the hydrologic model requires rainfall data to be applied to each of the delineated sub catchments the rainfall data for all 11 rain gauges shown in fig 2 was supplied by the toowoomba regional council as a cumulative rainfall total in five minute increments with the accumulation resetting at the end of each day there were some clear errors in the rainfall data including increments of rainfall significantly higher than would be expected such as rainfall intensities greater than 500 mm hr with no corresponding stream gauge record in addition one of the gauges showed an annual period of no rainfall suggesting that it had malfunctioned periods of erroneous data were removed from the datasets to allow the data to be used the rain gauge data needs to be spatially distributed via interpolation to the sub catchment centroid many schemes with varying degrees of complexity have been proposed for the spatial interpolation of rainfall thiessen 1911 shepard 1968 delhomme 1978 statistical approaches such as kriging have been found to perform better than interpolation methods such as thiessen or inverse distance weighted idw to estimate monthly and annual totals tabios iii and salas 1985 bussières and hogg 1989 creutin and obled 1982 however these previous studies or reviews have focussed on sites with an order of magnitude lower spatial density of rain gauges 0 01 0 001 per km2 than the gowrie creek catchment 0 12 0 22 per km2 dirks et al 1998 conducted a comparison study of three interpolation methods thiessen idw and areal mean and a statistical method kriging for norfolk island a small catchment with high gauging density similar to the gowrie creek catchment all methods were performed in a comparable manner and dirks et al 1998 concluded that the idw method was the most appropriate choice for practical use due to its minimal computational effort the idw interpolation method proposed by shepard 1968 and represented in eq 1 assumes that the rainfall observations closer to a position at which rainfall is to be estimated will have a greater influence on the value 1 z p i 1 n z i d i p i 1 n 1 d i p where zp interpolated rainfall value at location of interest mm zi known rainfall value at i rainfall station di distance to i rainfall station from location of interest p power parameter the adopted power parameter compounds the influence of the nearest observation and as the power parameter approaches infinity the idw interpolation approaches that proposed by thiessen or nearest neighbour interpolation the optimum power parameter was determined using the leave one out or fictitious point method where a known observation point we used gauge number 11 drayton is left out and the surrounding gauges are used to estimate its rainfall series the interpolated and observed rainfall series for drayton were evaluated for their root mean squared error rmse and the mean absolute error mae with a lower error identifying a better fit fig 4 shows that the error decreases with a reduction in the power parameter the magnitude of the error however is not significant enough to suggest that the estimated series is sensitive to the power parameter adopted and the difference in annual rainfall between a power parameter of one and a power parameter of six is only 60 mm dirks et al 1998 reached a similar conclusion and suggested that the default power parameter of two would be suitable due to the high density of rainfall gauges and the known rainfall variability in the catchment only the nearest three gauges were used for the interpolation in this research 2 5 impervious area runoff in a hydrologic model is highly sensitive to the impervious fraction of the catchment alley and veenhuis 1983 as a greater impervious fraction results in a higher conversion of rainfall to runoff the total impervious area tia is generally determined using land use mapping and the use of impervious fractions to convert the total area of different land uses to impervious areas only the fraction of the tia that is directly connected to stormwater infrastructure including urban roads and rooves is known as the effective impervious area eia hartcher and chowdhury 2017 and it is well established that the eia is of greater importance than the tia cherkaver 1975 beard and chang 1979 in this research the eia was determined using both a regression analysis and land use mapping 2 5 1 determining eia via regression analysis the eia of the gowrie creek catchment was estimated through the analysis of rainfall and streamflow records using the method described by miller 1978 this estimation method has been used extensively in research boyd et al 1993 chiew and mcmahon 1999 the assessment involves calculating the gradient of the regression between runoff and rainfall excluding events with runoff from pervious areas as rainfall is linearly proportional to impervious runoff rainfall events suitable for the regression analysis were chosen by adopting an inter event time as proposed by lloyd 1990 aryal et al 2007 and rodríguez blanco et al 2012 of two hours to separate individual storms and were then further filtered to consider a minimum rainfall depth of 2 mm and a maximum rainfall duration of 10 h a regression analysis of the remaining events is shown in fig 5 the gradient of the line indicates an eia fraction of 0 18 or 18 2 5 2 determining eia via land use mapping catchment planning mapping was used to estimate the total area ta of different land uses including urban areas ua commercial roads other development types and open space with the ta of each land use known ratios of ta to tia and tia to eia for each land use as detailed in the queensland urban drainage manual ipweaq 2016 and presented in table 2 were used to determine the overall catchment eia of 41 this is significantly higher than the regression based eia 18 and is likely due to the relatively unknown eia to tia ratio of differing road types as well as a likely overestimation of the eia to tia ratio of uas due to the age of catchment development the land use mapping method also found the eia to be 87 of the ua which doesn t reflect the findings of phillips et al 2014 who found that across eight catchments it was consistently around 35 of the ua this compares well to the regression based method which was 38 of the ua the land use mapping method is therefore overestimating the eia for the catchment and the regression analysis best represents the effective impervious area of the catchment while the land use mapping method overestimated the eia it did allow disaggregation to a sub catchment level we therefore adopted the impervious area ratios for each sub catchment from the land use mapping method while achieving an overall eia equivalent to the regression analysis 18 the results of this analysis for each sub catchment was used as the impervious component of the hydrologic model and is shown in fig 6 2 6 calibration and validation 2 6 1 principles a two stage calibration approach as performed by dayaratne 2000 and broekhuizen et al 2020 was utilised stage 1 calibrated small historic storm events resulting in runoff from impervious areas only this was followed by stage 2 in which larger historic storm events that included pervious area runoff were calibrated for the stage 1 calibration hydraulic conductivity ko and storage capacities dsc usc and lsc were adjusted until there was no runoff from the pervious area this effectively set a lower limit for these parameters for the stage 2 calibration ko and dsc were adjusted with the aim of making the model s output hydrograph match the observed the parameters determined via calibration were then used to run the model for several validation events to ensure that parameter performance was consistent across a range of observed events to determine calibration appropriateness the performance statistics detailed by moriasi et al 2007 and summarised in table 3 were used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is a coefficient commonly used to determine the predictive power of a hydrologic model mccuen et al 2006 with a coefficient of 1 0 representing a perfect fit the rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr is a measure of the spread of model results relative to the observed results rmse values less than half the standard deviation are generally considered to indicate good model prediction singh et al 2005 therefore the lower values of both rmse and in turn rsr represented a good model fit the percentage of bias pbias is a measure of the tendency of the modelled result to be above or below the observed result of et al 1999 with a pbias of 0 representing a perfect fit peak flow and volume difference were also assessed peak flow is an important hydrologic criterion and a key input for hydraulic design 2 6 2 historic storm events the continuous simulation model was run for the complete series of available and reliable historic rainfall data and individual storm events were selected for calibration validation the selected storm events included 13 events during the 2010 11 wet season as well as the wet seasons between 2016 and 2019 as summarised in table 4 there was a distinct lack of large stage 2 calibration validation flood events for the study catchment inspection of the stream gauge data at the outlet of the catchment highlighted that the 2010 11 wet season was the last significant wet season for the catchment there were no subsequent wet seasons with events exceeding the peak flow of event 13 no reliable rainfall data prior to the 2010 11 wet season was available for use 3 calibration validation results and discussion 3 1 stage 1 calibration eleven events were assessed as part of the stage 1 calibration validation process ranging in observed peak flow from 9 m3 s to 79 m3 s the calibration process confirmed that the dsc was a key calibration parameter as the volume of runoff was sensitive to this parameter this is evident in fig 7 which shows the difference between the volume of modelled runoff to the volume of observed runoff with an increasing dsc the results also show that events 3 and 4 were suitable for use in the calibration process due to the notable change with increasing dsc comparing the performance statistics of nse pbias peak flow difference and rsr for events 3 and 4 fig 8 a dsc of 7 mm clearly resulted in the best fit visual inspection of the model discharge against the observed discharge at the catchment outlet fig 10 also suggests the model is representing the observed flows well the dsc of 5 mm performed best for event 4 in terms of pbias and rsr but performed very poorly in nse and peak flow difference for event 3 suggesting that it is not suitable for other events when calibrating the dsc a ko of 0 3 mm min was adopted the sensitivity of the model to ko was also investigated with the results presented in fig 9 showing that 0 3 mm min is optimum when adopting a dsc of 7 mm and ko of 0 3 mm min for the nine validation events six performed satisfactorily with nse values ranging from 0 50 to 0 92 nse results for all events are presented in fig 13 while nse is considered a key performance indicator peak flow and volume were also critical to further justify the impervious fraction and spatial distribution of rainfall of the three stage 1 events that performed unsatisfactorily all produced peak flows within 20 of the observed and two produced volumes within approximately 30 of the observed these results suggest that the adopted impervious fraction is representative of the catchment as a higher impervious fraction would result in a higher peak flow and increased volume in addition visual inspection of the stage 1 calibration results showed that the shape of the modelled hydrograph matched the observed suggesting the interpolated rainfall is representing the ungauged rainfall it was expected that given the relatively small magnitude of observed flow used in the stage 1 events some results would be unsatisfactory smaller flow events often correspond to localised storms that may only fall over some sub catchments but are intense enough to produce runoff from those sub catchments distributing the recorded rainfall if it did in fact fall over the rain gauge over the entire sub catchment may therefore not reflect the nature of the event despite this the relatively small number of unsatisfactory validation results suggests that the model represents the hydrologic response of the catchment well 3 2 stage 2 calibration as expected the stage 2 calibration was sensitive to both dsc and k0 however through the stage 2 calibration it was found that the impact of dsc and k0 on the calibration process was similar a decreasing dsc or k0 value resulted in an increase in peak flow the k0 value of 0 3 mm min adopted as part of the stage 1 calibration to limit pervious area runoff provided the lower limit for calibration as part of stage 2 the dsc parameters assessed as part of stage 1 were also assessed in stage 2 the results in fig 12 show that the nse and peak flow generally increased with decreasing dsc however event 12 appeared to reach a maximum nse when dsc was near 7 mm and the peak flow increase plateaued when dsc approached 5 mm in addition the stage 1 calibration highlighted that a dsc less than 6 mm resulted in a very poor calibration for event 3 suggesting that the relatively improved performance of event 12 with decreasing dsc may be overstated given that the results presented in fig 11 show that the model generally underestimated the recorded peak flow increasing the k0 value above 0 3 mm min would only serve to reduce the peak flow further comparing the modelled hydrographs to the observed flows fig 12 further highlights how both events while visually achieving the hydrograph shape underestimated both volume and peak flow event 13 seems to show an observed second smaller peak approximately one hour after the initial peak that wasn t apparent in the model while the model did show a second peak it was much closer to the first peak resulting in a broadening out of the hydrograph it is known that during this event the stream gauge malfunctioned and the results were interpolated from field observations after the event it is likely that this interpolation overestimated the nature of the event and was the cause of the discrepancies shown 3 3 other arbm parameter sensitivity the arbm parameters of dsc and ko were identified by both the literature and this research as the most sensitive in estimating the pervious area loss a sensitivity analysis of the other arbm parameters as defined in fig 3 was undertaken to ensure that they were also optimised as part of the two stage calibration approach the sensitivity analysis reduced the other arbm parameters by 20 while keeping the dsc and ko at their calibrated values with the results presented in fig 13 stage 1 calibration events and fig 14 stage 2 calibration event the sensitivity analysis confirmed that the other arbm parameters were optimised as one of the stage 1 calibration events event 4 produced pervious area runoff in addition there was an insignificant increase in the peak flow volume in the stage 2 calibration event it is also worth noting that increasing the sensitivity of the other arbm parameters was not needed as the parameters had already been reduced to ensure no pervious area runoff from the stage 1 events increasing the other arbm parameters by 20 would produce the same result as the calibrated parameters for the stage 1 events while potentially reducing the peak flow volume in the stage 2 events fig 15 4 discussion on loss parameters and calibration challenges 4 1 loss model parameter comparison to literature the calibrated arbm parameters determined from this study are presented in table 5 the parameters recommended by goyen 1981 for residential lawns determined through calibration of a number of catchments in canberra along with parameters documented in the act guidelines department of urban services 2021 are also shown while the infiltration parameters s0 and k0 are somewhat comparable the storage capacities are significantly different most notably the dsc this result is surprising as goyen s parameters are based solely on pervious area whereas our study has some impervious areas included in the pervious area component of the model due to the impervious area component reflecting eia only this is a key contribution of this research and illustrates the need to develop a catalogue of arbm parameters that can be used by applied hydrologists when investigating catchments with similar geographical or climatic conditions adopting values in line with goyen 1981 or the act guidelines resulted in runoff from the pervious areas in the stage 1 events and given the high proportion of pervious area within the catchment the discharge flow rate and volume at the outlet of the catchment were significantly higher as highlighted in fig 16 4 2 overcoming calibration challenges currently continuous simulation modelling in urban catchments is rarely undertaken in practice or reported in the literature the challenges faced in the development of our continuous simulation model for the gowrie creek catchment demonstrate the reasons for its limited use rainfall data provided for the catchment seemed reasonable on paper however the rainfall isohyets provided in fig 4 show the significant spatial variation across what would be considered a relatively small catchment the use of the idw method of interpolation seemed to overcome this issue as the shape and magnitude of the hydrographs presented generally reflected the observed however to achieve the results presented a lag of 30 min had to be applied to the modelled output it is believed that this lag is not uncommon given the previously mentioned issues faced by dayaratne and perera 2004 inspection of the input data highlighted that the lag is likely to be a combination of rainfall being recorded regularly five minutes while stream gauge records can have timesteps of up to 30 min in addition the hydrologic model s response to rainfall on impervious areas in particular may not represent real conditions especially for small events the amount of impervious area in particular eia is a vital input to an urban hydrological model while it is difficult to directly source this data the methods detailed in the study seem to have produced a value that represents the catchment well given that 10 of the 11 stage 1 calibration events produced peak flows within 20 of the observed the lack of significant rainfall events in the catchment within the period of data available suggests that smaller impervious runoff only events may form a critical part of a flood frequency analysis it is recognised that the lack of rainfall events does impact the validity of the stage 2 calibration investigation of the stream gauge data shows that a peak flow above that of calibration event 12 has only been recorded seven times with all but two of these occurring prior to 2010 and one being validation event 13 there was an event recorded early in january 2011 unfortunately the rain gauge data provided did not cover the full extent of the event and was therefore not used in the calibration however this does not detract however from the findings of this research and highlights the need for further cataloguing of arbm parameters for wider adoption of continuous simulation modelling by applied hydrologists 5 conclusions predicting the hydrologic response of urban catchments to extreme rainfall events is fundamental to making informed engineering and planning decisions associated with urban development flood mitigation and disaster management improving the uncertainty in all hydrologic modelling requires careful model calibration including the utilisation of appropriate model parameters for the specific catchment this paper focussed on determining catchment specific loss parameters for the gowrie creek catchment in toowoomba australia as part of the model calibration it developed and calibrated a continuous simulation hydrologic model for an urban catchment and then determined the arbm parameters suitable for the gowrie creek catchment these parameters have been documented within this paper and offer new values for the possible use by applied hydrologists dealing with similar catchment and climatic conditions we then simulated other documented arbm parameters to highlight the need for further cataloguing of suitable parameters both within australia and internationally despite the challenges discussed this research effectively calibrated an urban continuous simulation model using modelling software widely used in industry the performance of the model in particular the nse and peak flow showed that the model could produce suitable design hydrographs for the catchment if a sufficient length of rainfall data was available it also showed that loss model parameters available in the literature in particular those provided by goyen 1981 may significantly overestimate peak flows for small events this research has provided industry with an additional set of loss parameters that may be applicable to other urban catchments whilst highlighting the gap that is preventing widespread industry adoption of continuous simulation models like xprafts by documenting a new set of parameters this research may help improve confidence in the modelling of similar ungauged catchments or at least highlight the variability likely to be experienced in urban catchments throughout australia this research also highlights that assumptions around impervious fractions and catchment losses may be overestimating urban catchment runoff credit authorship contribution statement i w brown conceptualization methodology software

8029,study region poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is connected to the yangtze river and has been undergoing shrinkage over the past decade study focus the poyang lake water control project plwcp was proposed to protect the lake against rapid shrinkage however the quantitative impact of the project on the floodplain inundation regime is not yet clear this study used a hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of the plwcp on the inundation regime of upstream floodplains in poyang lake new hydrological insights for the region poyang lake was characterised by high spatiotemporal heterogeneity in inundation patterns and that the northern lake areas were most affected followed by the central and eastern lake areas the western and southern lake areas were less affected the water levels of the northern channels increased by a maximum of 4 5 m during the first recession period 16 sep 31 oct and increased by 1 2 m during the impounding period 1 sep 15 sep most of the lake areas except the northern channels showed a water level increase of less than 0 5 m from november to march the increased inundation areas were mostly 100 400 km2 20 and reached greater than 800 km2 30 from september to october of which over 300 km2 10 lasted approximately 2 months potential suitable habitats in the northern central and eastern lakes might be impacted keywords poyang

systems townsend 2006 flooding controls the cycling of water and nutrients between large rivers and lakes within the floodplain and determines the productivity of aquatic and wetland ecosystems lesack and melack 1995 hence understanding the inundation regime water level inundation area and duration of floodplains is critical for water environment sustainability and floodplain ecosystem health the inundation regime depends on the floodplain s geomorphology and hydrology townsend 2006 and is drastically affected by water infrastructure arias et al 2018 large dams as an important source of

2016 river connected floodplains are especially vulnerable to the inundation regime produced by dams fantin cruz et al 2015 in australia more than 50 of floodplain wetlands on developed rivers may no longer flood due to upstream dams kingsford 2000 on american regulated rivers the active floodplain area decreased by 79 and the inactive floodplain area increased by 3 6 times graf 2006 damming has reduced flood pulses floodplain habitats and wetlands in the mekong basin hecht et al 2019 large floodplain lakes are commonly characterised by complex geomorphology and hydrology connected large rivers and sub basins spatially heterogeneous topography and highly dynamic variations in water level and inundation areas compared to homogeneous lakes floodplain lakes have more complex and heterogeneous responses to large dams reservoirs the construction of dams on floodplain lakes disrupts the normal patterns of water level fluctuation thereby altering inundation processes and forcing modifications to wetland biodiversity and ecosystems ecological implications include changes in habitats desynchronization of life cycles species loss and succession graf 2006 magilligan and nislow 2005 poff and zimmerman 2010 therefore understanding and predicting inundation patterns are essential for the sustainable management of floodplain lakes and their ecosystems considerable work has been carried out to understand the impacts of large dams or other water infrastructures on floodplains worldwide arias et al 2014 coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models to assess the dam induced hydrological alterations of the tonle sap floodplain on mekong tributaries and found that the 30 day minimum water level increased by 30 5 cm and annual water level fall rates decreased dang et al 2016 suggested that flood prevention systems have significantly changed the hydrological regime of the mekong floodplains with a remarkable increase in water level rise and fall rates in deltas pal and saha 2018 demonstrated that after the operation of the dam over the atreyee river the inundated wetland extent of the downstream floodplain was reduced by 20 50 chen et al 2021 conjunctly used hydrology and remote sensing data to investigate the influence of damming on floodplain wetlands of the nenjiang river in china they found that flood pulse decreases caused by damming resulted in reductions in both inundation frequency and floodplain wetland area other impact assessments include the change in the dry period duration zeilhofer and moura 2009 the sedimentation dynamics variation hupp et al 2015 the succession of aquatic vegetation van geest et al 2005 and the variation in the aquatic biota xu and li 2019 however the research on inundation regime is not sufficient due to the complexity of topographic and hydrologic constraints in addition most studies focus on the impact of dams on downstream floodplains less attention is paid to the impact on upstream floodplains the

li et al 2021 these models produced profound insights into the hydrology hydrodynamics and ecological environment of poyang lake however little is known about the quantitative impact of the plwcp on the inundation regime which is critical for the sustainability of floodplain ecosystems in this study we adopt a hydrodynamic model to simulate the inundation patterns in poyang lake under natural and time varying regulated conditions the main objectives are to characterise the natural and regulated inundation patterns and quantify the inundation regime alterations caused by plwcp operation the final target is to address the scientific question to what extent does the plwcp impact the water level inundation area and duration in the floodplain this study is expected to provide physical mechanism insight into understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneous response of complex floodplains to water control projects and to provide hydrological context for predicting ecological environmental changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake 28 24 29 46 n 115 49 116 46 e the largest river connected floodplain lake in china is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river fig 1 the lake area has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1654 mm the annual average temperature is 17 6 c and the annual potential evapotranspiration is 1049 mm year zhang et al 2014 the lake is approximately 74 km from east to west and 170 km from north to south poyang lake is shaped by a complex combination of narrow channels sublakes and expansive floodplains the lake bed is high in the south and west and low in the north and east of which the elevation difference between the south and north is approximately 6 5 m li et al 2014 the hydrological characteristics of poyang lake are particularly complex poyang lake receives runoff from seven main rivers in the catchment ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe xiushui xihe and boyanghe rivers and flows into the yangtze river via the northern hukou outlet fig 1 the annual average water volume accounts for approximately 15 of the yangtze river the yangtze river discharge influences lake outflow by blocking and emptying effects zhang et al 2012 there is a time lag between the peak discharge of the catchment inflow april june and the yangtze river july september yao et al 2016 affected by both the catchment and yangtze river poyang lake experiences four hydrological periods a rising period march june a high water level period july august a recession period september october and a low water level period november february the lake fluctuates from a large area of inundated floodplains at high water levels to approximately a line at low water levels the annual average water level is 11 5 m xingzi station with a fluctuation of approximately 8 m during the year the lake area varies from less than 1000 km2 to more than 3000 km2 2 2 hydrological data the daily measured water levels at 5 gauging stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan from downstream to upstream and discharges from 7 main rivers of the catchment from 2000 to 2016 were used in this study fig 1 the above hydrological data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china and the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province the hourly wind data for 2015 at the kangshan station representing the wind forcing on poyang lake are from the poyang lake laboratory for wetland ecosystem research based on the statistics of 2015 wind data the average wind speed was 2 2 m s and nne wind was the prevailing wind 2 3 hydrodynamic model the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc developed by hamrick 1996 was used to simulate the 2d hydrodynamics of poyang lake in this study the efdc model has been successfully applied to simulate many different water bodies such as lakes estuaries and coastal waters li et al 2010 jeong et al 2010 ji et al 2007 the model uses a structured orthogonal curvilinear grid in the horizontal direction the finite difference scheme is used based on hydrostatic hydrodynamic equations the wetting and drying conditions of the grid cells can also be simulated other model details are described in hamrick 1996 the momentum and continuity equations are 1 mhu t m y huu x m x hvu y mf v m y x u m x y hv m y gh ζ x q u 2 mhv t m y huv x m x hvv y mf v m y x u m x y hu m x gh ζ y q v 3 m ζ t m y hu x m x hv y 0 where h is the water depth ζ is the water surface elevation u and v are the horizontal velocities in the curvilinear orthogonal horizontal coordinates x and y m x and m y are square roots of the diagonal components of the metric tensor m m x m y f is the coriolis parameter g is the gravitational acceleration and q u and q v are momentum source sink terms the domain of the poyang lake hydrodynamic model extends from the estuaries of the seven rivers to the hukou outlet fig 1 the model grid contains 37 296 cells the cell sizes vary from 25 m deltas and channel regions to over 1000 m flat regions with an average of 280 m the upstream input boundary conditions included daily catchment inflows and runoff from the ungauged catchment area 11 inlets a simple linear extrapolation of the gauged runoff was used to calculate the runoff from the ungauged area zhang et al 2014 daily observed water levels at hukou were specified as the downstream open boundary conditions the time step was set to 5 s to ensure numerical stability based on the calibration and verification section 3 1 the bottom roughness height was determined to range from 0 02 m in the marshland region to 0 005 m in the channel region the hydrodynamic model was performed to simulate the water level inundation area and duration under natural and regulated conditions respectively the relative error re determination coefficient r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e ns were used to assess the goodness of fit for water levels applying the following equations 4 re i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 6 e ns 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the total number of time series of water level i is the corresponding ith water level o i is the observed water level s i is the simulated water level o is the averaged observed water level and s is the averaged simulated water level 2 4 simulation scenarios the plwcp approximately 3 km wide will be located 12 km north of xingzi and 27 km south of the yangtze river extensive floodplains are located upstream of the plwcp regulation of the plwcp controls the water level to gradually decrease from 14 5 m to 9 m yellow sea datum from september to march the regulation scheme is described as follows i sluices will remain open when the lake water level is high 1 april 31 august maintaining a natural connection with the yangtze river river lake connection period ii during 1 15 september when the water level at the plwcp is higher than 14 5 m all the sluice gates are open when the water level is lower than 14 5 m under the premise that the discharge meets the water flow needed for shipping aquatic ecology and the water environment the maximum level of water storage is 14 5 m impoundment period iii during 16 september 31 october the sluice will be controlled to ensure that the water level gradually drops to 12 m the first recession period iv from november to february the sluice will be controlled to gradually adjust the water level to 9 5 m the second recession period v during march the water level is maintained at no lower than 9 m by sluice adjustment to meet the shipping water ecology and water environmental demands ecological regulation period to understand the various hydrodynamic responses to the operation of the plwcp under different hydrological conditions a dry year a wet year and a normal year were simulated under natural conditions and regulated conditions by the plwcp respectively fig 2 highlights the water level variations in different years at the xingzi gauging station from 2000 to 2016 the water level in 2006 was significantly below the average water level during 2000 2016 the annual mean water level in 2006 was 11 6 m in contrast to 2006 2016 was a wet year with an annual mean water level of 13 9 m the annual mean water level in 2015 was 12 9 m which was between the values of 2006 and 2016 therefore 2006 2015 and 2016 were chosen as the typical dry normal and wet years respectively considering the natural and regulated conditions for each hydrological year a total of 6 scenarios were set up 3 results 3 1 model calibration and verification the hydrodynamic model was calibrated using water level observations at four stations in 2015 and those in 2006 and 2016 were used for model verification fig 3 the simulated values match the measured values most closely at xingzi station the error is slightly larger during the low water level period at duchang and tangyin the results of the statistical parameters at four water level stations are listed in table 1 the re between the simulated and measured water levels ranges from 1 3 to 2 4 in calibration and from 0 8 to 2 5 in verification and the r 2 and e ns vary from 0 95 to 1 00 in both calibration and verification furthermore the simulated inundation extents are in reasonably good agreement with the remote sensing images in spatiotemporal variation patterns in 2015 fig 4 these results show that the model has reasonable accuracy in reproducing the water level variations in poyang lake several velocity monitoring experiments were performed during 2010 2014 by the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province tan et al 2013 numerical simulations of velocity distribution were compared with field observations for velocity distribution the distributions of field measured velocity for the rising period 11 12 march in 2013 high water level period 30 31 august in 2014 recession period 9 12 october in 2010 and low water level period 19 20 december in 2010 were chosen to represent the velocity variations in different periods fig 5 the average error values of the current speed ranged from 0 04 m s to 0 2 m s the relative values of which were less than 20 the average error values of the current direction ranged from 5 to 10 which were higher during the high water level period and lower during the low water level period the good overall agreement suggests that the model can reproduce the hydrodynamics of poyang lake 3 2 natural spatiotemporal variabilities in water levels fig 6 shows simulated natural water level distributions on the 15th of every month from january to december 2015 in january and february low water level period the water body was mainly distributed in narrow channels and fractured sublakes the water level was high in the south and west and low in the north and east with a 6 7 m water level difference from march to may the water body rose from channels to nearby floodplains and spread from the lake centre to the lakeshore the spatial water level difference decreased to approximately 4 m and further decreased with increasing inundation areas in june and july high water level period all the sublakes were connected to the main lake and the whole lake was inundated without a significant water level gradient in space in august the water level began to recede the western lakeshore areas first emerged and the water level gradient increased gradually from november to december due to the sudden rise in the water level the water area was greater than that in spring in general poyang lake experienced significant spatiotemporal variations in water level increasing and receding processes with a large area of flooding and retreat 3 3 influence of the plwcp on water level fig 7 shows the water level variations at four stations under natural and regulated conditions the average increases in water levels during the four regulation periods are summarized in table 2 the seasonality of water levels was considerably altered by plwcp regulation the water level increase is largest during the first recession period followed by that during the impoundment period the water level variation was hardly affected during the ecological regulation period the xingzi station nearest to the plwcp is most affected the xingzi water level increased by 2 3 5 6 m during the first recession period and 1 3 2 6 m during the impoundment period compared with xingzi the water level increase at duchang is slightly less the increased water level at tangyin central lake is nearly half that at xingzi varying from 1 9 m to 3 2 m during the first recession period and from 1 0 m to 1 5 m during the impoundment period the water level at kangshan southern lake did not significantly change except during the first recession period with an increase of 1 1 2 3 m all stations had mostly less than a 0 2 m increase in water level during the ecological regulation period in addition the different hydrological years have various responses to the operation of the plwcp the impact of the project had a positive correlation with the extent of the low water level the dry year of 2006 was most affected by the project compared with the normal year of 2015 the wet year of 2016 was less affected in january february and more affected in september october due to the rapid autumn recession 3 4 influence of the plwcp on water level distribution the predicted water levels under plwcp regulation were compared with simulated water levels under natural conditions the changes in the water level distribution on 8 september 22 september 15 october 15 november 15 december 15 january 15 february and 15 march were calculated representing the change in each month during the regulation period fig 8 shows the distributions of water level changes triggered by the operation of the plwcp in 2006 2015 and 2016 in the impoundment period 8 sep the most impacted area was the northern channels in 2006 which expanded to the east bay in 2015 with a smaller magnitude in 2016 except for the southern and western shore areas most of the lakes were influenced by the project the water level in the northern channels increased by 3 m 1 m and 1 5 m in 2006 2015 and 2016 respectively however the impacted area was the smallest in 2006 and the largest in 2016 in the first recession period 22 sep and 15 oct the impacted area and magnitude further increased the water level increased by 4 5 m 1 2 m and 4 5 m in the northern channels 2 3 m 1 5 2 5 m and 2 5 3 m in the middle area and 1 2 m 1 2 m and 1 5 2 m in the east bay in 2006 2015 and 2016 respectively compared with other periods this period had the largest increase in water level and the largest impacted area in the second recession period 15 nov 15 dec 15 jan and 15 feb the impacted area was reduced compared with that in the first recession period and was mostly limited to the northern and middle channels for 2006 the water levels in the northern channels mostly increased by 3 4 m and the maximum increased water level was 1 m in the middle channels for 2015 the increased water levels reached up to 3 5 m with a maximum in january february and were lower than 1 m in november there was no significant increase in the water level in december for 2016 the increased water levels were 1 5 2 m in the northern channels and were mostly lower than 0 5 m in the middle and eastern parts of the lake in november december and were no more than 1 m in january february in the ecological regulation period 15 mar the increased water levels were all lower than 0 5 m for all three years suggesting a slight impact from the plwcp in general the northern part of the lake was the area most affected by the plwcp followed by the central and eastern parts the southern and western shore parts were hardly influenced the dry year 2006 was most impacted and the normal year 2015 was least impacted the wet year 2016 had a rapid water level decrease in autumn resulting in a more significant response than that in 2015 3 5 influence of the plwcp on inundation area and duration as a floodplain lake some originally exposed areas of poyang lake were inundated due to operation of the plwcp the increased inundation areas were mainly in the northern central and eastern parts of the lake fig 8 black legend table 3 shows the increased inundation areas during different periods of the plwcp s operation in 2006 2015 and 2016 during the first recession period the most impacted period the inundation areas increased by 802 513 and 689 km2 22 sep in 2006 2015 and 2016 respectively and the values were 417 283 and 259 km2 during the impoundment period respectively during the second recession period the increased inundation areas mostly varied from 100 to 350 km2 for the ecological period the increased inundation areas were all less than 160 km2 during the operation period of the plwcp 2006 had the greatest increase in inundation area and duration the inundation area in 2015 mostly increased by less than 350 km2 and no more than 550 km2 which was less than that in 2006 and 2016 based on the divided values of increased inundation areas from 100 km2 to 800 km2 the corresponding durations were calculated the durations had a negative logarithmic relationship with the increased inundation areas for three hydrological years fig 9a1 and b1 suggesting that the great increase in inundation area would last for a short time and that the small increase in inundation area would last for a long time according to the relationship there was an approximately 2 month duration 4 times hydraulic retention time for over 300 km2 of increased inundation area which was approximately 10 of the lake area for inundation areas that increased by over 600 km2 20 the duration decreased to approximately 1 month 2 times hydraulic retention time based on the statistics of each area interval fig 9a2 and b2 the increased inundation area of 100 200 km2 3 7 of the lake area has the longest duration 61 85 days and the increased inundation area of 500 600 km2 has the shortest durations of less than 10 days fig 10 shows the distributions of increased inundation duration the area with the greatest increased inundation duration was distributed in the northern lake near the plwcp in the northern lake the inundation duration maximally increased by more than 150 days in 2006 70 80 days in 2015 and more than 100 days in 2016 in the central floodplains around the channels and the eastern sublake the inundation duration also increased significantly with magnitudes of 50 80 days for 2006 and 2016 in the western lake the increased inundation duration was mostly less than 50 days for three years the southern lake was basically unaffected note that in the northern and central lakes there were some areas with no significant variation in the inundation duration fig 10 white area which correspond with the permanently inundated area calculated with satellite remote sensing wu and liu 2015 4 discussion for a floodplain system with complex bathymetry and hydrology the inundation response to the plwcp shows strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity the inundation regime alteration can be attributed to the hydrological conditions and the schemes of the regulation lai et al 2016 based on the efdc model quantified that the maximum increase in water level was 3 4 5 m caused by the plwcp regulation water level of 11 m in agreement with the results of the current study fig 7 in addition this study found that the northern waterway was most affected by the project and the western and southern parts of the lake were relatively less affected the influences on the inundation regime varied significantly under different hydrological conditions showing greater impacts of regulation under drier hydrological conditions this pattern is consistent with previous studies lai et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the mesh setting of the model from 25 m to over 1000 m adopts the advantages of locally refined mesh in previous models li et al 2014 yao et al 2018 considering both computational accuracy and efficiency compared with the previous models lai et al 2013 li et al 2014 this model depicts the topography of deltas and floodplains more finely with 37 296 grid cells and the minimum cell size of 25 m the calibration and verification results showed good agreement between the simulated and measured water levels e ns 0 95 and the ability to accurately reproduce the variations in inundation area and velocity therefore the model and mesh setting are suitable and accuracy in capturing the complex topography and hydrology of poyang lake floodplains uncertainties still exist with regard to the model and scenario limitations for example the 2010 dem is adopted in our model which is also the latest data however after the forbidden sand mining and 2020 flood wei et al 2020 the bathymetry of poyang lake might have undergone an ongoing change in addition the regulation scheme has been constantly optimized further works should be enhanced at field investigations and scheme comparison 4 1 upstream increasing inundation due to the dam this study attempts to quantify the inundation regime of the upstream floodplains caused by the operation of downstream dams the floodplain in this study is upstream and adjacent to the plwcp which only controls low water levels to specific values compared with the decreased water levels and inundation area in downstream floodplains of the dam arias et al 2014 chen et al 2021 graf 2006 the plwcp increased the water levels and inundation area of upstream floodplains suggesting opposite upstream and downstream effects of dams the water level variation across our studied dam maximum 4 5 m is higher than that 30 5 cm in arias et al 2014 and that 2 m in trung et al 2020 inundation area variations in our study mostly less than 20 are comparable to other studies arias et al 2014 pal and saha 2018 dam induced impacts vary widely depending on project size and operation as well as the distance from the dam which makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the impacts of different dams and upstream versus downstream impacts timpe and kaplan 2017 in general all the studies showed a highly spatiotemporal variation in the inundation pattern change suggesting the complex hydrological response of floodplains to water conservancy projects 4 2 impact on the river lake relationship the three gorges dam tgd located upstream of the yangtze river decreases the downstream discharge during the impoundment period in september leading to the decreased block effect of the yangtze river and increased drainage effect of downstream poyang lake zhang et al 2012 previous studies have noted that the tgd has resulted in a 1 2 m water level reduction in poyang lake hukou station from late summer to autumn lai et al 2014b zhang et al 2012 the impoundment of the plwcp coincides with the tgd impoundment period which will increase the autumn water level of poyang lake partly offsetting the decreased water level caused by tgd impoundment however the plwcp may alter the natural river lake connectivity between poyang lake and the yangtze river the forcing of the yangtze river on poyang lake is most significant in autumn guo et al 2012 yao et al 2016 this period is exactly the impoundment period of the plwcp in which the river lake connection will be disrupted meaning that the influence of the yangtze river on poyang lake might be substantially weakened and that the river lake relationship might undergo profound changes moreover due to the overlap in the impoundment period of the plwcp and tgd the discharge to the yangtze river downstream may further decrease in autumn influencing the water resources and environment downstream in addition numerous reservoirs have been implemented across the poyang lake basin xu et al 2020 the combined impacts from the various water conservancy projects make the hydrological regime more variable both the catchment and lake as well as the connected large river should be regulated overall as a system additionally a previous study showed that the bathymetry of the northern channels of poyang lake changed remarkably yao et al 2018 which is the site of the plwcp with the operation of the plwcp the sediment carrying capacity might be substantially reduced near the plwcp area resulting in sediment deposition and dramatic geomorphic adjustment of the northern lake area this occurrence might further induce changes in the river lake relationship 4 3 implications for wetland vegetation due to the change in the inundation pattern caused by the plwcp wetland ecosystems in floodplains might be affected changed inundation patterns determine vegetation species and distribution in floodplains kasprak et al 2021 the example of aquatic vegetation in floodplain lakes along the lower rhine showed that after regulation in lakes with higher water levels aquatic macrophyte vegetation was characterised by low species richness and frequent dominance by invasive species van geest et al 2005 the vegetation of poyang lake is mostly distributed on the western and eastern shores mu et al 2020 in which the inundation duration will increase by 0 50 days after the operation of the plwcp fig 10 given that different types of vegetation have various tolerances to inundation durations wan et al 2019 the plwcp might trigger vegetation succession in addition from 2000 to 2017 the areas of water and mudflats decreased and the total coverage of vegetation showed significantly increasing trends with vegetation expanding towards the lower centre of poyang lake han et al 2018 mu et al 2020 after the operation of the plwcp the water levels of the floodplains in the northern and central lakes will increase significantly fig 8 which might restrain the growth of vegetation in the northern and central floodplains and promote the vegetation to move up to higher elevations as a result the distribution pattern of vegetation might be changed 4 4 implications for habitat for wintering waterbirds changes in the water depth inundation duration and vegetation community as key habitat factors might further affect the abundance and distribution of wintering waterbirds liang et al 2021 teng et al 2021 xia et al 2021 the most suitable water depth for wintering waterbirds is less than 0 6 m teng et al 2021 the water areas with depths 0 6 m were extracted based on the results from november to february as potential suitable habitats for wintering waterbirds the durations and spatial distributions of potential suitable habitats were determined under natural and regulated conditions fig 11 for natural conditions in normal and wet years the potentially suitable habitats were distributed in most areas of the lake except for channel areas and permanent water areas after operation of the plwcp the spatial distributions of potential suitable habitats were enlarged in the dry year and mainly unchanged in normal and wet years while the duration in the northern central and eastern lake areas was significantly changed the duration in the areas adjacent to middle channels increased by 0 30 days and the maximum increase was 20 60 days in the northern area of central islands the duration in the central lake mainly decreased by 0 20 days the duration changes in the eastern areas varied from 10 to 10 days in the western and southern lake areas only some sporadic fragmentation areas were affected with duration changes of less than 10 days the results indicated that the duration of the suitable habitats in the northern central and eastern lake areas might be influenced by the plwcp with both positive and negative effects the study confirmed the conclusions of yao et al 2019 who indicated that the suitable habitat area might increase in dry years after operation of the plwcp the monthly average areas of potential suitable habitats from november to february are illustrated in fig 12 under natural conditions the areas of potential suitable habitats were 480 800 km2 compared to other years average areas of potential suitable habitats in november and december were minimum in the normal year of 2015 due to the sharp high water levels and maximum in the wet year of 2016 due to the suitable water level fig 2 after the operation of the plwcp the areas of potential suitable habitats decreased by 40 100 km2 in november and increased by less than 50 km2 in december january and february in addition to water depth suitable vegetation is also the primary factor influencing the choice of habitat for wintering waterbirds xia et al 2021 the degree of match between vegetation growth influenced by hydrological variations and the arrival timing of waterbirds should also be considered when assessing the influence of the plwcp on migratory birds 5 conclusions in floodplains the responses of ecosystems to water control projects are likely to be varied and complex assessment of the project s impact should be based on physical methods that can reflect spatiotemporal variations in floodplains given the importance of poyang lake servicing as an international wetland analyses of inundation pattern changes caused by the plwcp as the foundation for ecosystem research are urgently needed this study used a hydrodynamic model to reveal the quantitative influence of the plwcp on the water level inundation area and duration in poyang lake the results showed that the northern central and eastern lake areas were most affected by operation of the plwcp during impoundment and first recession periods september october the maximum increase in the water level reached 4 5 m in the northern channels most of the floodplains except those in the north showed a water level increase of less than 0 5 m from november to march the inundation area increased by less than 20 most of the time potential suitable habitats in the northern central and eastern lake areas might be impacted by the plwcp with both positive and negative effects the areas of suitable habitats decreased in november and slightly increased between december and february the results provide hydrological evidence to further explore the impact on vegetation waterbirds and the water environment the strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity responses result from the complex bathymetry and hydrology as well as the schemes of the regulation suggesting that space and temporality should be both considered when assessing ecological and environmental responses to the plwcp our study provided an example of how the hydrodynamic model could be used to quantify the spatial and temporal changes in inundation patterns in a highly dynamic floodplain the method used here is easily extendable to other floodplains worldwide to help understand inundation regime changes caused by water conservancy projects credit authorship contribution statement jing yao conceptualization

8029,study region poyang lake the largest freshwater lake in china is connected to the yangtze river and has been undergoing shrinkage over the past decade study focus the poyang lake water control project plwcp was proposed to protect the lake against rapid shrinkage however the quantitative impact of the project on the floodplain inundation regime is not yet clear this study used a hydrodynamic model to quantify the influence of the plwcp on the inundation regime of upstream floodplains in poyang lake new hydrological insights for the region poyang lake was characterised by high spatiotemporal heterogeneity in inundation patterns and that the northern lake areas were most affected followed by the central and eastern lake areas the western and southern lake areas were less affected the water levels of the northern channels increased by a maximum of 4 5 m during the first recession period 16 sep 31 oct and increased by 1 2 m during the impounding period 1 sep 15 sep most of the lake areas except the northern channels showed a water level increase of less than 0 5 m from november to march the increased inundation areas were mostly 100 400 km2 20 and reached greater than 800 km2 30 from september to october of which over 300 km2 10 lasted approximately 2 months potential suitable habitats in the northern central and eastern lakes might be impacted keywords poyang lake hydrodynamic model water control project water level inundation area 1 introduction floodplains are valuable and productive ecosystems that support biodiversity and provide goods and services to society arias et al 2018 opperman et al 2009 floodplains are strongly characterised by periodic flooding inundation flooding inundation is a primary driver of the environment and ecology of floodplain systems townsend 2006 flooding controls the cycling of water and nutrients between large rivers and lakes within the floodplain and determines the productivity of aquatic and wetland ecosystems lesack and melack 1995 hence understanding the inundation regime water level inundation area and duration of floodplains is critical for water environment sustainability and floodplain ecosystem health the inundation regime depends on the floodplain s geomorphology and hydrology townsend 2006 and is drastically affected by water infrastructure arias et al 2018 large dams as an important source of hydrological alteration alter the flow regime by changing the magnitude frequency duration timing and rate of change in flow fantin cruz et al 2015 dams have affected nearly half of the large rivers around the world lehner et al 2011 nilsson et al 2005 including the amazon river timpe and kaplan 2017 yangtze river wang et al 2013 mekong river hecht et al 2019 and saskatchewan river smith et al 2016 river connected floodplains are especially vulnerable to the inundation regime produced by dams fantin cruz et al 2015 in australia more than 50 of floodplain wetlands on developed rivers may no longer flood due to upstream dams kingsford 2000 on american regulated rivers the active floodplain area decreased by 79 and the inactive floodplain area increased by 3 6 times graf 2006 damming has reduced flood pulses floodplain habitats and wetlands in the mekong basin hecht et al 2019 large floodplain lakes are commonly characterised by complex geomorphology and hydrology connected large rivers and sub basins spatially heterogeneous topography and highly dynamic variations in water level and inundation areas compared to homogeneous lakes floodplain lakes have more complex and heterogeneous responses to large dams reservoirs the construction of dams on floodplain lakes disrupts the normal patterns of water level fluctuation thereby altering inundation processes and forcing modifications to wetland biodiversity and ecosystems ecological implications include changes in habitats desynchronization of life cycles species loss and succession graf 2006 magilligan and nislow 2005 poff and zimmerman 2010 therefore understanding and predicting inundation patterns are essential for the sustainable management of floodplain lakes and their ecosystems considerable work has been carried out to understand the impacts of large dams or other water infrastructures on floodplains worldwide arias et al 2014 coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models to assess the dam induced hydrological alterations of the tonle sap floodplain on mekong tributaries and found that the 30 day minimum water level increased by 30 5 cm and annual water level fall rates decreased dang et al 2016 suggested that flood prevention systems have significantly changed the hydrological regime of the mekong floodplains with a remarkable increase in water level rise and fall rates in deltas pal and saha 2018 demonstrated that after the operation of the dam over the atreyee river the inundated wetland extent of the downstream floodplain was reduced by 20 50 chen et al 2021 conjunctly used hydrology and remote sensing data to investigate the influence of damming on floodplain wetlands of the nenjiang river in china they found that flood pulse decreases caused by damming resulted in reductions in both inundation frequency and floodplain wetland area other impact assessments include the change in the dry period duration zeilhofer and moura 2009 the sedimentation dynamics variation hupp et al 2015 the succession of aquatic vegetation van geest et al 2005 and the variation in the aquatic biota xu and li 2019 however the research on inundation regime is not sufficient due to the complexity of topographic and hydrologic constraints in addition most studies focus on the impact of dams on downstream floodplains less attention is paid to the impact on upstream floodplains the middle yangtze river system supports extensive floodplains and lakes among which poyang lake is china s largest freshwater lake with unrestricted connections to the yangtze mainstream as the world s largest bird conservation area poyang lake has an internationally important wetland serving as habitat for migratory birds xia et al 2016 since 2000 due to climate variability liu and wu 2016 zhang et

shrinkage with a regime shift liu et al 2013 a dam water control project across poyang lake s northern end downstream was proposed to protect the lake against rapid shrinkage li 2009 the operation of the poyang lake water control project plwcp will change the inundation regime including the inundation area water depth and duration as a result this project might impact vegetation type and distribution as well as waterbird habitat and may increase eutrophication risk as a controversial issue plwcp has aroused the attention of many researchers numerical modeling as a robust tool is usually used to predict and quantify the impact of water conservancy projects on the hydrological regimes of rivers or lakes le et al 2007 logah et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 previous studies have developed poyang lake hydrodynamic models to depict unique hydrodynamic characteristics lai et al 2013 li et al 2014 2017 zhang et al 2015 quantify the causes of abnormally low water levels qi et al 2019 yao et al 2016 2018 and assess water quality variations du et al 2018 qi et al 2016 specific to the plwcp several hydrodynamic models were conducted to investigate the impact of the project on the hydrodynamics of poyang lake lai et al 2016 wang et al 2015 zhao and li 2021 and on the habitats for wintering waterbirds chen et al 2020 yao et al 2019 zhu et al 2021 and yangtze finless porpoise li et al 2021 these models produced profound insights into the hydrology hydrodynamics and ecological environment of poyang lake however little is known about the quantitative impact of the plwcp on the inundation regime which is critical for the sustainability of floodplain ecosystems in this study we adopt a hydrodynamic model to simulate the inundation patterns in poyang lake under natural and time varying regulated conditions the main objectives are to characterise the natural and regulated inundation patterns and quantify the inundation regime alterations caused by plwcp operation the final target is to address the scientific question to what extent does the plwcp impact the water level inundation area and duration in the floodplain this study is expected to provide physical mechanism insight into understanding the spatiotemporal heterogeneous response of complex floodplains to water control projects and to provide hydrological context for predicting ecological environmental changes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area poyang lake 28 24 29 46 n 115 49 116 46 e the largest river connected floodplain lake in china is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river fig 1 the lake area has a subtropical monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1654 mm the annual average temperature is 17 6 c and the annual potential evapotranspiration is 1049 mm year zhang et al 2014 the lake is approximately 74 km from east to west and 170 km from north to south poyang lake is shaped by a complex combination of narrow channels sublakes and expansive floodplains the lake bed is high in the south and west and low in the north and east of which the elevation difference between the south and north is approximately 6 5 m li et al 2014 the hydrological characteristics of poyang lake are particularly complex poyang lake receives runoff from seven main rivers in the catchment ganjiang fuhe xinjiang raohe xiushui xihe and boyanghe rivers and flows into the yangtze river via the northern hukou outlet fig 1 the annual average water volume accounts for approximately 15 of the yangtze river the yangtze river discharge influences lake outflow by blocking and emptying effects zhang et al 2012 there is a time lag between the peak discharge of the catchment inflow april june and the yangtze river july september yao et al 2016 affected by both the catchment and yangtze river poyang lake experiences four hydrological periods a rising period march june a high water level period july august a recession period september october and a low water level period november february the lake fluctuates from a large area of inundated floodplains at high water levels to approximately a line at low water levels the annual average water level is 11 5 m xingzi station with a fluctuation of approximately 8 m during the year the lake area varies from less than 1000 km2 to more than 3000 km2 2 2 hydrological data the daily measured water levels at 5 gauging stations hukou xingzi duchang tangyin and kangshan from downstream to upstream and discharges from 7 main rivers of the catchment from 2000 to 2016 were used in this study fig 1 the above hydrological data were obtained from the hydrological bureau of the yangtze river water resources commission of the ministry of water resources of china and the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province the hourly wind data for 2015 at the kangshan station representing the wind forcing on poyang lake are from the poyang lake laboratory for wetland ecosystem research based on the statistics of 2015 wind data the average wind speed was 2 2 m s and nne wind was the prevailing wind 2 3 hydrodynamic model the environmental fluid dynamics code efdc developed by hamrick 1996 was used to simulate the 2d hydrodynamics of poyang lake in this study the efdc model has been successfully applied to simulate many different water bodies such as lakes estuaries and coastal waters li et al 2010 jeong et al 2010 ji et al 2007 the model uses a structured orthogonal curvilinear grid in the horizontal direction the finite difference scheme is used based on hydrostatic hydrodynamic equations the wetting and drying conditions of the grid cells can also be simulated other model details are described in hamrick 1996 the momentum and continuity equations are 1 mhu t m y huu x m x hvu y mf v m y x u m x y hv m y gh ζ x q u 2 mhv t m y huv x m x hvv y mf v m y x u m x y hu m x gh ζ y q v 3 m ζ t m y hu x m x hv y 0 where h is the water depth ζ is the water surface elevation u and v are the horizontal velocities in the curvilinear orthogonal horizontal coordinates x and y m x and m y are square roots of the diagonal components of the metric tensor m m x m y f is the coriolis parameter g is the gravitational acceleration and q u and q v are momentum source sink terms the domain of the poyang lake hydrodynamic model extends from the estuaries of the seven rivers to the hukou outlet fig 1 the model grid contains 37 296 cells the cell sizes vary from 25 m deltas and channel regions to over 1000 m flat regions with an average of 280 m the upstream input boundary conditions included daily catchment inflows and runoff from the ungauged catchment area 11 inlets a simple linear extrapolation of the gauged runoff was used to calculate the runoff from the ungauged area zhang et al 2014 daily observed water levels at hukou were specified as the downstream open boundary conditions the time step was set to 5 s to ensure numerical stability based on the calibration and verification section 3 1 the bottom roughness height was determined to range from 0 02 m in the marshland region to 0 005 m in the channel region the hydrodynamic model was performed to simulate the water level inundation area and duration under natural and regulated conditions respectively the relative error re determination coefficient r 2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient e ns were used to assess the goodness of fit for water levels applying the following equations 4 re i 1 n s i o i i 1 n o i 100 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s 2 i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 6 e ns 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where n is the total number of time series of water level i is the corresponding ith water level o i is the observed water level s i is the simulated water level o is the averaged observed water level and s is the averaged simulated water level 2 4 simulation scenarios the plwcp approximately 3 km wide will be located 12 km north of xingzi and 27 km south of the yangtze river extensive floodplains are located upstream of the plwcp regulation of the plwcp controls the water level to gradually decrease from 14 5 m to 9 m yellow sea datum from september to march the regulation scheme is described as follows i sluices will remain open when the lake water level is high 1 april 31 august maintaining a natural connection with the yangtze river river lake connection period ii during 1 15 september when the water level at the plwcp is higher than 14 5 m all the sluice gates are open when the water level is lower than 14 5 m under the premise that the discharge meets the water flow needed for shipping aquatic ecology and the water environment the maximum level of water storage is 14 5 m impoundment period iii during 16 september 31 october the sluice will be controlled to ensure that the water level gradually drops to 12 m the first recession period iv from november to february the sluice will be controlled to gradually adjust the water level to 9 5 m the second recession period v during march the water level is maintained at no lower than 9 m by sluice adjustment to meet the shipping water ecology and water environmental demands ecological regulation period to understand the various hydrodynamic responses to the operation of the plwcp under different hydrological conditions a dry year a wet year and a normal year were simulated under natural conditions and regulated conditions by the plwcp respectively fig 2 highlights the water level variations in different years at the xingzi gauging station from 2000 to 2016 the water level in 2006 was significantly below the average water level during 2000 2016 the annual mean water level in 2006 was 11 6 m in contrast to 2006 2016 was a wet year with an annual mean water level of 13 9 m the annual mean water level in 2015 was 12 9 m which was between the values of 2006 and 2016 therefore 2006 2015 and 2016 were chosen as the typical dry normal and wet years respectively considering the natural and regulated conditions for each hydrological year a total of 6 scenarios were set up 3 results 3 1 model calibration and verification the hydrodynamic model was calibrated using water level observations at four stations in 2015 and those in 2006 and 2016 were used for model verification fig 3 the simulated values match the measured values most closely at xingzi station the error is slightly larger during the low water level period at duchang and tangyin the results of the statistical parameters at four water level stations are listed in table 1 the re between the simulated and measured water levels ranges from 1 3 to 2 4 in calibration and from 0 8 to 2 5 in verification and the r 2 and e ns vary from 0 95 to 1 00 in both calibration and verification furthermore the simulated inundation extents are in reasonably good agreement with the remote sensing images in spatiotemporal variation patterns in 2015 fig 4 these results show that the model has reasonable accuracy in reproducing the water level variations in poyang lake several velocity monitoring experiments were performed during 2010 2014 by the hydrological bureau of jiangxi province tan et al 2013 numerical simulations of velocity distribution were compared with field observations for velocity distribution the distributions of field measured velocity for the rising period 11 12 march in 2013 high water level period 30 31 august in 2014 recession period 9 12 october in 2010 and low water level period 19 20 december in 2010 were chosen to represent the velocity variations in different periods fig 5 the average error values of the current speed ranged from 0 04 m s to 0 2 m s the relative values of which were less than 20 the average error values of the current direction ranged from 5 to 10 which were higher during the high water level period and lower during the low water level period the good overall agreement suggests that the model can reproduce the hydrodynamics of poyang lake 3 2 natural spatiotemporal variabilities in water levels fig 6 shows simulated natural water level distributions on the 15th of every month from january to december 2015 in january and february low water level period the water body was mainly distributed in narrow channels and fractured sublakes the water level was high in the south and west and low in the north and east with a 6 7 m water level difference from march to may the water body rose from channels to nearby floodplains and spread from the lake centre to the lakeshore the spatial water level difference decreased to approximately 4 m and further decreased with increasing inundation areas in june and july high water level period all the sublakes were connected to the main lake and the whole lake was inundated without a significant water level gradient in space in august the water level began to recede the western lakeshore areas first emerged and the water level gradient increased gradually from november to december due to the sudden rise in the water level the water area was greater than that in spring in general poyang lake experienced significant spatiotemporal variations in water level increasing and receding processes with a large area of flooding and retreat 3 3 influence of the plwcp on water level fig 7 shows the water level variations at four stations under natural and regulated conditions the average increases in water levels during the four regulation periods are summarized in table 2 the seasonality of water levels was considerably altered by plwcp regulation the water level increase is largest during the first recession period followed by that during the impoundment period the water level variation was hardly affected during the ecological regulation period the xingzi station nearest to the plwcp is most affected the xingzi water level increased by 2 3 5 6 m during the first recession period and 1 3 2 6 m during the impoundment period compared with xingzi the water level increase at duchang is slightly less the increased water level at tangyin central lake is nearly half that at xingzi varying from 1 9 m to 3 2 m during the first recession period and from 1 0 m to 1 5 m during the impoundment period the water level at kangshan southern lake did not significantly change except during the first recession period with an increase of 1 1 2 3 m all stations had mostly less than a 0 2 m increase in water level during the ecological regulation period in addition the different hydrological years have various responses to the operation of the plwcp the impact of the project had a positive correlation with the extent of the low water level the dry year of 2006 was most affected by the project compared with the normal year of 2015 the wet year of 2016 was less affected in january february and more affected in september october due to the rapid autumn recession 3 4 influence of the plwcp on water level distribution the predicted water levels under plwcp regulation were compared with simulated water levels under natural conditions the changes in the water level distribution on 8 september 22 september 15 october 15 november 15 december 15 january 15 february and 15 march were calculated representing the change in each month during the regulation period fig 8 shows the distributions of water level changes triggered by the operation of the plwcp in 2006 2015 and 2016 in the impoundment period 8 sep the most impacted area was the northern channels in 2006 which expanded to the east bay in 2015 with a smaller magnitude in 2016 except for the southern and western shore areas most of the lakes were influenced by the project the water level in the northern channels increased by 3 m 1 m and 1 5 m in 2006 2015 and 2016 respectively however the impacted area was the smallest in 2006 and the largest in 2016 in the first recession period 22 sep and 15 oct the impacted area and magnitude further increased the water level increased by 4 5 m 1 2 m and 4 5 m in the northern channels 2 3 m 1 5 2 5 m and 2 5 3 m in the middle area and 1 2 m 1 2 m and 1 5 2 m in the east bay in 2006 2015 and 2016 respectively compared with other periods this period had the largest increase in water level and the largest impacted area in the second recession period 15 nov 15 dec 15 jan and 15 feb the impacted area was reduced compared with that in the first recession period and was mostly limited to the northern and middle channels for 2006 the water levels in the northern channels mostly increased by 3 4 m and the maximum increased water level was 1 m in the middle channels for 2015 the increased water levels reached up to 3 5 m with a maximum in january february and were lower than 1 m in november there was no significant increase in the water level in december for 2016 the increased water levels were 1 5 2 m in the northern channels and were mostly lower than 0 5 m in the middle and eastern parts of the lake in november december and were no more than 1 m in january february in the ecological regulation period 15 mar the increased water levels were all lower than 0 5 m for all three years suggesting a slight impact from the plwcp in general the northern part of the lake was the area most affected by the plwcp followed by the central and eastern parts the southern and western shore parts were hardly influenced the dry year 2006 was most impacted and the normal year 2015 was least impacted the wet year 2016 had a rapid water level decrease in autumn resulting in a more significant response than that in 2015 3 5 influence of the plwcp on inundation area and duration as a floodplain lake some originally exposed areas of poyang lake were inundated due to operation of the plwcp the increased inundation areas were mainly in the northern central and eastern parts of the lake fig 8 black legend table 3 shows the increased inundation areas during different periods of the plwcp s operation in 2006 2015 and 2016 during the first recession period the most impacted period the inundation areas increased by 802 513 and 689 km2 22 sep in 2006 2015 and 2016 respectively and the values were 417 283 and 259 km2 during the impoundment period respectively during the second recession period the increased inundation areas mostly varied from 100 to 350 km2 for the ecological period the increased inundation areas were all less than 160 km2 during the operation period of the plwcp 2006 had the greatest increase in inundation area and duration the inundation area in 2015 mostly increased by less than 350 km2 and no more than 550 km2 which was less than that in 2006 and 2016 based on the divided values of increased inundation areas from 100 km2 to 800 km2 the corresponding durations were calculated the durations had a negative logarithmic relationship with the increased inundation areas for three hydrological years fig 9a1 and b1 suggesting that the great increase in inundation area would last for a short time and that the small increase in inundation area would last for a long time according to the relationship there was an approximately 2 month duration 4 times hydraulic retention time for over 300 km2 of increased inundation area which was approximately 10 of the lake area for inundation areas that increased by over 600 km2 20 the duration decreased to approximately 1 month 2 times hydraulic retention time based on the statistics of each area interval fig 9a2 and b2 the increased inundation area of 100 200 km2 3 7 of the lake area has the longest duration 61 85 days and the increased inundation area of 500 600 km2 has the shortest durations of less than 10 days fig 10 shows the distributions of increased inundation duration the area with the greatest increased inundation duration was distributed in the northern lake near the plwcp in the northern lake the inundation duration maximally increased by more than 150 days in 2006 70 80 days in 2015 and more than 100 days in 2016 in the central floodplains around the channels and the eastern sublake the inundation duration also increased significantly with magnitudes of 50 80 days for 2006 and 2016 in the western lake the increased inundation duration was mostly less than 50 days for three years the southern lake was basically unaffected note that in the northern and central lakes there were some areas with no significant variation in the inundation duration fig 10 white area which correspond with the permanently inundated area calculated with satellite remote sensing wu and liu 2015 4 discussion for a floodplain system with complex bathymetry and hydrology the inundation response to the plwcp shows strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity the inundation regime alteration can be attributed to the hydrological conditions and the schemes of the regulation lai et al 2016 based on the efdc model quantified that the maximum increase in water level was 3 4 5 m caused by the plwcp regulation water level of 11 m in agreement with the results of the current study fig 7 in addition this study found that the northern waterway was most affected by the project and the western and southern parts of the lake were relatively less affected the influences on the inundation regime varied significantly under different hydrological conditions showing greater impacts of regulation under drier hydrological conditions this pattern is consistent with previous studies lai et al 2016 wang et al 2015 the mesh setting of the model from 25 m to over 1000 m adopts the advantages of locally refined mesh in previous models li et al 2014 yao et al 2018 considering both computational accuracy and efficiency compared with the previous models lai et al 2013 li et al 2014 this model depicts the topography of deltas and floodplains more finely with 37 296 grid cells and the minimum cell size of 25 m the calibration and verification results showed good agreement between the simulated and measured water levels e ns 0 95 and the ability to accurately reproduce the variations in inundation area and velocity therefore the model and mesh setting are suitable and accuracy in capturing the complex topography and hydrology of poyang lake floodplains uncertainties still exist with regard to the model and scenario limitations for example the 2010 dem is adopted in our model which is also the latest data however after the forbidden sand mining and 2020 flood wei et al 2020 the bathymetry of poyang lake might have undergone an ongoing change in addition the regulation scheme has been constantly optimized further works should be enhanced at field investigations and scheme comparison 4 1 upstream increasing inundation due to the dam this study attempts to quantify the inundation regime of the upstream floodplains caused by the operation of downstream dams the floodplain in this study is upstream and adjacent to the plwcp which only controls low water levels to specific values compared with the decreased water levels and inundation area in downstream floodplains of the dam arias et al 2014 chen et al 2021 graf 2006 the plwcp increased the water levels and inundation area of upstream floodplains suggesting opposite upstream and downstream effects of dams the water level variation across our studied dam maximum 4 5 m is higher than that 30 5 cm in arias et al 2014 and that 2 m in trung et al 2020 inundation area variations in our study mostly less than 20 are comparable to other studies arias et al 2014 pal and saha 2018 dam induced impacts vary widely depending on project size and operation as well as the distance from the dam which makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the impacts of different dams and upstream versus downstream impacts timpe and kaplan 2017 in general all the studies showed a highly spatiotemporal variation in the inundation pattern change suggesting the complex hydrological response of floodplains to water conservancy projects 4 2 impact on the river lake relationship the three gorges dam tgd located upstream of the yangtze river decreases the downstream discharge during the impoundment period in september leading to the decreased block effect of the yangtze river and increased drainage effect of downstream poyang lake zhang et al 2012 previous studies have noted that the tgd has resulted in a 1 2 m water level reduction in poyang lake hukou station from late summer to autumn lai et al 2014b zhang et al 2012 the impoundment of the plwcp coincides with the tgd impoundment period which will increase the autumn water level of poyang lake partly offsetting the decreased water level caused by tgd impoundment however the plwcp may alter the natural river lake connectivity between poyang lake and the yangtze river the forcing of the yangtze river on poyang lake is most significant in autumn guo et al 2012 yao et al 2016 this period is exactly the impoundment period of the plwcp in which the river lake connection will be disrupted meaning that the influence of the yangtze river on poyang lake might be substantially weakened and that the river lake relationship might undergo profound changes moreover due to the overlap in the impoundment period of the plwcp and tgd the discharge to the yangtze river downstream may further decrease in autumn influencing the water resources and environment downstream in addition numerous reservoirs have been implemented across the poyang lake basin xu et al 2020 the combined impacts from the various water conservancy projects make the hydrological regime more variable both the catchment and lake as well as the connected large river should be regulated overall as a system additionally a previous study showed that the bathymetry of the northern channels of poyang lake changed remarkably yao et al 2018 which is the site of the plwcp with the operation of the plwcp the sediment carrying capacity might be substantially reduced near the plwcp area resulting in sediment deposition and dramatic geomorphic adjustment of the northern lake area this occurrence might further induce changes in the river lake relationship 4 3 implications for wetland vegetation due to the change in the inundation pattern caused by the plwcp wetland ecosystems in floodplains might be affected changed inundation patterns determine vegetation species and distribution in floodplains kasprak et al 2021 the example of aquatic vegetation in floodplain lakes along the lower rhine showed that after regulation in lakes with higher water levels aquatic macrophyte vegetation was characterised by low species richness and frequent dominance by invasive species van geest et al 2005 the vegetation of poyang lake is mostly distributed on the western and eastern shores mu et al 2020 in which the inundation duration will increase by 0 50 days after the operation of the plwcp fig 10 given that different types of vegetation have various tolerances to inundation durations wan et al 2019 the plwcp might trigger vegetation succession in addition from 2000 to 2017 the areas of water and mudflats decreased and the total coverage of vegetation showed significantly increasing trends with vegetation expanding towards the lower centre of poyang lake han et al 2018 mu et al 2020 after the operation of the plwcp the water levels of the floodplains in the northern and central lakes will increase significantly fig 8 which might restrain the growth of vegetation in the northern and central floodplains and promote the vegetation to move up to higher elevations as a result the distribution pattern of vegetation might be changed 4 4 implications for habitat for wintering waterbirds changes in the water depth inundation duration and vegetation community as key habitat factors might further affect the abundance and distribution of wintering waterbirds liang et al 2021 teng et al 2021 xia et al 2021 the most suitable water depth for wintering waterbirds is less than 0 6 m teng et al 2021 the water areas with depths 0 6 m were extracted based on the results from november to february as potential suitable habitats for wintering waterbirds the durations and spatial distributions of potential suitable habitats were determined under natural and regulated conditions fig 11 for natural conditions in normal and wet years the potentially suitable habitats were distributed in most areas of the lake except for channel areas and permanent water areas after operation of the plwcp the spatial distributions of potential suitable habitats were enlarged in the dry year and mainly unchanged in normal and wet years while the duration in the northern central and eastern lake areas was significantly changed the duration in the areas adjacent to middle channels increased by 0 30 days and the maximum increase was 20 60 days in the northern area of central islands the duration in the central lake mainly decreased by 0 20 days the duration changes in the eastern areas varied from 10 to 10 days in the western and southern lake areas only some sporadic fragmentation areas were affected with duration changes of less than 10 days the results indicated that the duration of the suitable habitats in the northern central and eastern lake areas might be influenced by the plwcp with both positive and negative effects the study confirmed the conclusions of yao et al 2019 who indicated that the suitable habitat area might increase in dry years after operation of the plwcp the monthly average areas of potential suitable habitats from november to february are illustrated in fig 12 under natural conditions the areas of potential suitable habitats were 480 800 km2 compared to other years average areas of potential suitable habitats in november and december were minimum in the normal year of 2015 due to the sharp high water levels and maximum in the wet year of 2016 due to the suitable water level fig 2 after the operation of the plwcp the areas of potential suitable habitats decreased by 40 100 km2 in november and increased by less than 50 km2 in december january and february in addition to water depth suitable vegetation is also the primary factor influencing the choice of habitat for wintering waterbirds xia et al 2021 the degree of match between vegetation growth influenced by hydrological variations and the arrival timing of waterbirds should also be considered when assessing the influence of the plwcp on migratory birds 5 conclusions in floodplains the responses of ecosystems to water control projects are likely to be varied and complex assessment of the project s impact should be based on physical methods that can reflect spatiotemporal variations in floodplains given the importance of poyang lake servicing as an international wetland analyses of inundation pattern changes caused by the plwcp as the foundation for ecosystem research are urgently needed this study used a hydrodynamic model to reveal the quantitative influence of the plwcp on the water level inundation area and duration in poyang lake the results showed that the northern central and eastern lake areas were most affected by operation of the plwcp during impoundment and first recession periods september october the maximum increase in the water level reached 4 5 m in the northern channels most of the floodplains except those in the north showed a water level increase of less than 0 5 m from november to march the inundation area increased by less than 20 most of the time potential suitable habitats in the northern central and eastern lake areas might be impacted by the plwcp with both positive and negative effects the areas of suitable habitats decreased in november and slightly increased between december and february the results provide hydrological evidence to further explore the impact on vegetation waterbirds and the water environment the strong spatial and temporal heterogeneity responses result from the complex bathymetry and hydrology as well as the schemes of the regulation suggesting that space and temporality should be both considered when assessing ecological and environmental responses to the plwcp our study provided an example of how the hydrodynamic model could be used to quantify the spatial and temporal changes in inundation patterns in a highly dynamic floodplain the method used here is easily extendable to other floodplains worldwide to help understand inundation regime changes caused by water conservancy projects credit authorship contribution statement jing yao conceptualization
