corresponding author flow around a near bed horizontal circular cylinder mounted on a vertical side wall is simulated numerically in this study the purpose of the study is to investigate the flow characteristics around the junction area between the cylinder and two plane boundaries the effects of gap to diameter ratio g d 0 5 0 2 reynolds number based on the diameter r e d 1250 2500 5000 and the length to diameter aspect ratio l d 10 20 40 are investigated it is found that the three dimensional flow structures formed in the junction area between the vertical wall and the cylinder are strongly affected by the gap ratio highly three dimensional flow structures i e oscillations of horseshoe vortices are observed in the influence of gap ratio and reynolds number the end effect induced by the vertical wall is limited within 0 7d in the spanwise direction 0 5d upstream and 3d downstream of the cylinder the extent of the end effect is not sensitive to the gap ratio reynolds number or the aspect ratio keywords cfd les horseshoe vortex gap ratio near wall end effect 1 introductions as the key infrastructures for the offshore and coastal engineering offshore pipelines which are usually installed on the seabed attract substantial research interest in the past decades regarded as the prototype of the offshore piles locating in the shoulder of the seabed steady flow around a horizontal cylinder mounted perpendicularly to side walls at two ends with a parallel plane boundary in proximity is often encountered in physical model testing in water flumes or wind tunnels of flow around a near wall cylinder for simulating local scour around subsea pipelines cheng et al 2009 and related hydrodynamic forces yang et al 2018 a schematic illustration of the configuration is shown in fig 1 the flow is highly three dimensional 3 d near the junction area between the cylinder and two plane boundaries in some situations the highly 3 d flow is unwanted and creates difficulty in interpreting the test results as it is very different from the flow over the majority part of the cylinder this is often referred to as end effect in the literature the highly 3 d flow is expected to exhibit the flow characteristics of the following two flows that are widely studied 1 flow around junction area of a cylinder mounted on a perpendicular plane and 2 flow around a cylinder above a parallel plane the existing work on those two flows in the literature will be briefly reviewed below junction flow around a circular cylinder attached to a plane boundary has attracted substantial research interests over the past decades for its importance to engineering applications in the fields of aerodynamics heat transfer and offshore hydrodynamics junction flow is generally a complex three dimensional phenomenon involving three dimensional boundary layer separations formation of coherent flow structures and vortex shedding when a cylinder is mounted on a plane boundary the adverse pressure gradient in front of the cylinder near the plane boundary leads to the boundary layer to separate and forms a series of vortex tubes to wrap around the junction of the cylinder the vortex tubes formed around the base of the cylinder are often referred to as horseshoe vortices hv in the literature baker 1979 1980 1985 in the experimental results of seal and smith 1999 a complicated intertwining or braiding of two initially co rotating necklace vortices around the juncture of a circular cylinder was reported through hydrogen bubble visualization horseshoe vortices are highly unsteady and cause high surface pressure fluctuations and are attributed to the initiation of local scour around the cylinder founded on an erodible surface simpson 2001 early studies by thwaites and street 1960 and baker 1979 1980 1985 found that the formation of hv was dependent on reynolds number which is defined as r e d u d υ with d being the diameter of the cylinder u being the free stream velocity far away from the plane boundary and υ being the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the hv is classified into three types steady single or multiple pairs of vortices regular oscillatory vortices and irregular unsteady vortices the position of the primary horseshoe vortex in the steady vortex system has been found to be dependent on both of r e d and the relative displacement boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d baker 1979 1985 in the steady hv system one or more steady horseshoe vortices are formed the number of the hvs increases with the increase of r e d baker 1979 when r e d increases to a certain value the hv system becomes unsteady the steady hv was observed at r e d 1000 and chaotic hvs were observed at r e d 13000 in the investigation reported by thomas 1987 while the corresponding hv systems were observed at r e d 2000 and r e d 8000 respectively by wei et al 2001 greco 1990 classified the laminar horseshoe vortex system into five sub regimes which are steady oscillation amalgamating breakaway and transitional regimes in the sequence of increasing r e d when the hv system becomes unsteady the vortices in the upstream start to oscillate around their mean positions without direct interactions with each other this sub regime is called the oscillating sub regime as r e d is further increased the vortices are shed periodically and neighboring vortices interact and combine with each other to form new vortices this regime is referred to as the amalgamation sub regime the oscillating sub regime is observed when r e d is in the range of 1700 1900 and the amalgamation sub regime starts to appear when r e d increases to around 2500 greco 1990 the unsteady state of the horseshoe vortex system was also investigated by seal et al 1995 and wei et al 2001 experimentally and kirkil and constantinescu 2012 numerically it was found that a significant change to the hv system dynamics is accompanied by the change of δ d when r e d increased further the transition from the laminar to the turbulent state occurs in the junction area and the separated shear layer becomes irregular as r e d increased to around 9000 the clear separated shear layer turns to a turbulent juncture flow which indicated that the behaviors of the horseshoe vortex system cannot be predicted easily thomas 1987 by experiments and visbal 1991 by numerical simulations suggest that the periodical oscillation phenomenon of the hvs is not related to the karman vortex shedding from the cylinder and is independent of the influence of the incoming flow baker 1991 indicated that oscillations of hv system were ascribed to the oscillation of the entire vortex system as well as the instabilities of vortex core itself in the experiment of wei et al 2001 a large number of vortices was observed to cascade chaotically when r e d increases from 14000 to 24000 while escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011 observed a fast regular breakaway behavior for re d 20000 baker 1980 investigated the horseshoe vortex formed by the turbulent boundary layer in the range of re d 4000 90000 with different boundary layer thickness d δ 4 30 the measurement of pressure distributions showed that the distribution of the primary horseshoe vortex is not affected much by r e d under turbulent boundary layer conditions dargahi 1989 studied the flow around a vertical circular cylinder by flow visualizations through hydrogen bubbles at re d 6600 65000 the quasi periodically shedding of vortices was found which is similar to the results reported by baker 1980 the number of hv increases with the increase of r e d the dimensions of the vortex system is found independent of r e d but dependent on the diameter of the cylinder a detailed discussion on the junction flow is reported by simpson 2001 numerical simulations of junction flows have also been carried out to capture the dynamic features of horseshoe vortexes briley et al 1985 conducted a three dimensional simulation to investigate the horseshoe vortex of the flow at re d 200 the results demonstrated that the captured laminar flow structures can be accurately computed under a good convergence rates of the grid steady and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations rans and urands were used by apsley and leschziner 2001 and chen 1995 even though the positions of vortices turbulence intensities pressure distributions shear stress as well as the turbulent kinetic energy were provided the one or two eddy viscosity turbulent model applied showed a poor agreement with the experimental data and failed to capture the dynamic features of horseshoe vortex system paik et al 2007 applied detached eddy simulation to simulate turbulent horseshoe vortex system in a wing body junction successfully in paik et al 2007 periodic oscillating hvs were observed which was very similar to the previous experimental results given but the results failed to capture the location of hv cores detached eddy simulation was also used in the study of escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011 re d 20000 and 39000 were investigated to study the influence of re d on the horseshoe vortex system the observed instantaneous flow structures were very similar to the results of devenport and simpson 1990 large eddy simulations les were conducted by rodi 1997 tseng et al 2000 krajnovic and davidson 2002 and kirkil and constantinescu 2012 the simulations of rodi 1997 tseng et al 2000 and krajnovic and davidson 2002 performed computations on a square cylinder and have a general agreement with the data and topology structures observed in experiments at re d 40000 tseng et al 2000 only presented averaged magnitudes of pressure and shear stress and compared with dargahi 1989 for a circular cylinder the discrepancies were attributed to the conditions of incoming flow boundary layer conditions as well as the mesh resolution of the boundary layer rodi 1997 kirkil and constantinescu 2012 preformed three simulations ranging from re d 800 2140 and 4460 with relatively large boundary layer thickness and captured the laminar hv system transiting from the steady to oscillating and then to the breakaway sub regime the hv is a genuine feature of the junction flow and has a side effect on model testing results in wind tunnels or water flumes flow boundary layer will naturally form on the solid walls side top and bottom of the wind tunnel or water flume when a two dimensional slender model is mounted against the channel walls a hv system will be formed at each end of the model this hv represents an undesired three dimensional disturbance to the flow field for example when the hydrodynamics aerodynamics of a uniform cylinder is tested the two ends of the cylinder are normally mounted with two end plates to avoid the three dimensional effect from the free ends stansby 1974 the diameter of the end plates is normally just slightly larger than the cylinder diameter to limit the development of a thick boundary layer on the end plates gerich and eckelmann 1982 in this way the end effect due to hv can be managed to some extent however some model tests in a flume are not suitable for adding end plates to the cylinder for example when local scour below a cylinder is investigated in a water channel normally the ends of the cylinder are set against the side walls of test section directly without end plates attached this is because the end plates could cause extra scour sumer et al 2001 mentioned a half hv around the end of a cylinder partially buried on the sand bed the end effect due to hv would lead to different shear stress distribution on the sand bed near the ends of the model cylinder consequently it leads to different sediment transport rate which affects the time scale of the scour process thehv formed at the ends will also affect the pressure distribution on the cylinder therefore it is important to quantify the end effect due to hv in similar testing setup the effect of a plane parallel to the cylinder on the flow around circular cylinder also attracted substantial research interests in the past a few decades lei et al 1999 buresti and lanciotti 1992 jensen et al 1990 zdravkovich 1985 bearman and zdravkovich 1978 roshko et al 1975 kiya 1968 the flow structures and hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder are affected by the gap to diameter ratio g d wall boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d as well as the turbulence intensity in the boundary layer bearman and zdravkovich 1978 visualized flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary and measured pressure distribution on the cylinder surface and on the plane boundary at r e d 4 5 104 it was found the vortex shedding was suppressed for all gaps less than 0 3d lei et al 1999 found that the stagnation point moves upward and the base pressure decreases as the gap to diameter ratio increases and the vortex shedding is suppressed at gap ratio of 0 2 0 3 depending on the different wall boundary layer thickness yang et al 2018 found that the drag crisis phenomenon exists for g d 0 5 and found that the lift coefficient reduced with the increases of the gap ratio in the work of yang et al 2018 the boundary layer transition was largely influenced by the proximity of the plane boundary and side swapping phenomenon was found at large gap ratios the suppression of vortex shedding was observed at g d 0 3 tong et al 2017 reported a deflected flow near the shoulders between a spanning and non spanning section under the conditions of intermittent gap ratios which led to large variations of sectional forces the influence of the blockage ratio and aspect ratio has been revealed by west and apelt 1982 it was found that the blockage ratio affects pressure distributions force coefficients and vortex shedding frequency lei et al 2001 suggested that the aspect ratio of cylinder must be larger than 4d in order to simulate the three dimensional wake flow accurately sumner et al 2004 pattenden et al 2005 rodríguez y domínguez et al 2006 and sumner and heseltine 2008 reported the junction flow around the circular cylinder with small aspect ratio it was found that hv systems was weak and as the aspect ratio increased the strength of the system as well as the number of vortices increased sumner and heseltine 2008 reported a downwash phenomenon for cylinders with small aspect ratios the horseshoe vortex system and its interaction with the wake flow for a circular cylinder with large aspect ratio were reported by sahin et al 2007 and sahin and ozturk 2009 it was found that the swirling horseshoe vortices in the streamwise direction and counter clockwise vortices in the vertical plane downstream of the cylinder led an increased level of scour in the junction region in the experimental apparatus in water flumes or wind tunnels the steady flow around a near bed horizontal cylinder mounted on a vertical wall is widely regarded as the prototype for a series of physical model testings such as local scour around subsea pipeline and its related hydrodynamic forces the influence of a perpendicular wall and a parallel plane boundary leads to a highly three dimensional flow in the cylinder junction which is referred to as end effect in the literature the previous investigations on how to quantify the end effect on a horizontal cylinder mounted perpendicularly to side walls at two ends with a parallel plane boundary in proximity is rare due to the best knowledge of the author and this motivates the current numerical simulation work here are two objectives for the present simulation i provide a quantitative description of the highly three dimensional flow structures in the junction ii quantify the influence of the end effect on the circular cylinder to understand the end effect due to highly three dimensional flow structures on a circular cylinder near a parallel plane boundary a series of numerical simulation was carried out using les model firstly the numerical model was validated by comparing with published experimental results and then the end effect was analyzed in detail the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations of the flow have been presented the grid size independence study and the validation are given in section 3 and section 4 presents the simulation results and section 5 gives a general discussion about results followed by conclusions in the last section 2 methodology a large eddy simulation turbulent model is employed in the present work the filter incompressible navier stokes equations 1 u i t u u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j and the continuity equations 2 u i x i 0 where u i are flow velocities in the three spatial directions i 1 2 and 3 corresponding to the streamwise spanewise and lateral direction respectively ρ is the density of the fluid p is the pressure fluctuation ν is the kinematic viscosity of the incompressible flow and ν t is the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity t is time x i are the spatial coordinates a homogeneous dynamic smagorinsky model was adopted germano et al 1991 smagorinsky 1963 the boundary conditions are specified as following a uniform flow velocity u is specified in the streamwise direction at the inlet boundary hefg in fig 1 it is observed that the boundary layer is fairly quickly developed after the start of the simulations similar to nishino et al 2008 at the outlet dacb in fig 1 the neumann boundary condition i e zero normal gradient is adopted for the velocity and the pressure is specified as a reference value of zero symmetry boundary conditions were enforced on boundary hdae and the boundary eabf the non slip boundary condition was applied on the perpendicular wall hdcg in fig 1 the bed wall gcbf in fig 1 and the cylinder surface the finite volume method embedded in open source toolbox openfoam is employed to discretize the spatially filtered equations the gauss cubic scheme is used to discretize the advection terms while the gauss linear scheme is applied to discretize laplacian and pressure terms in the momentum equations the same model is applied to the results of section 3 as shown in fig 2 the calculations were performed on the facilities with a cray xc40 system supercomputer for a typical 3 d case in the present work 144 processors have been used for parallel computation and this leads to around 130 h wall clock time for the numerical simulation of up to around 500 non dimensional time units until the convergence is achieved in which the variation of averaged values of hydrodynamic force i e drag coefficient in the simulation is smaller than 3 based on the courant number criterion c o were chosen to keep below 0 5 for the entire computational domain which usually means the applied non dimensional time step is smaller than 0 005 the similar criterion was widely applied for precision of the simulation jiang et al 2016 tong et al 2017 the definition of courant number c o is defined by 3 c o u δ t δ l in which u is the magnitude of the velocity flowing through a cell δ l is the cell size along the velocity direction and δ t is the time step adopted in the simulation 3 grid size independence study and model validations a circular cylinder mounted on a perpendicular wall is simulated for the grid size independence study and validation purposes this refers to the case with g d in the analysis of section 4 the domain geometry is shown in fig 1 and has dimensions of 28d in the flow direction with 8d in the upstream side 16din the cross flow direction and 5d in the spanwise direction l d 10 due to the symmetry boundary a condition the computational domain in the x y plane is discretized with structured 4 nodes quadratic cells five different meshes are tested to examine the convergence of the numerical model with the key information including the total cell number n c e l l the expansion rate of mesh along the cylinder ω cell number on the cylinder circumference n c i r c l e size of the first layer mesh on the cylinder surface δ d the cell number in the spanwise direction of the cylinder n s p a n as well as the displacement of boundary layer thickness δ d details of the meshes are given in table 1 for all meshes the non dimensional distances from the first nodal point to the wall surfaces of both cylinder and the plane wall y u f δ ν kept to be smaller than 2 in which u f is the friction velocity the first layer mesh size around the cylinder and that on the perpendicular wall are kept the same to resolve the boundary layer flow in present work the grid size independence study is conducted in two steps the first step focuses on the first layer mesh on the wall surface and the second is the size of the square region in fig 1 in mesh 1 3 the first layer mesh on the wall surface is refined from 0 004d to 0 002d and then to 0 001d corresponding total number of mesh cells increasing from 1 69 105 to 3 49 105 and then to 5 51 105 r e d is set to 2500 for the purpose of comparing with experimental data by huang et al 2014 the averaged distributions of pressure coefficient c p p ρ u 2 2 are given in fig 3 in which ρ is the density of the flow it can be seen that a good convergence trend is achieved for mesh2 and mesh3 only a slight difference in the range of θ 60 300 in fig 3 a which indicates the benefit of the reduction of δ d for capturing the hvs a square region around the cylinder 6d 6d is refined three different sizes of the refined area were examined in the grid size independence study in order to accurately capture the detailed information of the flow structure around the cylinder and the hv structure at the junction in the meantime to save computational costs mesh4 5d 5d and mesh5 4d 4d are summarized in table 2 fig 3 b presents the convergence trend of pressure distributions for different refined areas the pressure distribution of mesh4 5d 5d is almost overlapping with the results of mesh3 6d 6d while c p of mesh5 4d 4d is obviously larger than c p of mesh4 and mesh3 the minimum pressure for mesh5 is 12 6 higher than the results of mesh3 and mesh4 this indicates that the square size of 4d 4d for mesh5 is not big enough for the simulation comparing with results of mesh3 and mesh4 hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding frequency are also checked in table 3 for centre positions of three horseshoe vortices in the plane of y 0 in the present study the drag and lift coefficients are defined as c d f d ρ l d u 2 2 and c l f l ρ l d u 2 2 in which f d and f l are the force component in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively and l is the cylinder length the normalized vortex shedding frequency strouhal number is defined as s t f d u where f is the frequency of the vortex shedding the mean drag coefficients c d for mesh3 and mesh4 are 1 08 and 1 07 correspondingly which are within the measured range of 1 0 1 2 in the subcritical range of reynolds number niemann and hölscher 1990 braza et al 1986 schewe 1983 the corresponding strouhal number are 0 214 and 0 217 respectively which also agree with the range of 0 207 0 22 in the work of roshko 1954 by comparing with the pressure distributions the mean drag coefficients c d the root mean square lift coefficient c l as well as strouhal number s t the results of mesh4 agree with the results of mesh3 very well mesh4 is used in this work for further simulations regarding on reynolds number effect on the grid size independency study supplementary simulations has been conducted and reynolds number r e d was set as r e d 5000 which is the maximum reynolds number analyzed in section 4 based on the same mesh structure with mesh4 mesh6 8 has 5d 5d of a square mesh region around the cylinder the first layer mesh on the wall surface is refined from 0 004d to 0 001d and then to 0 0007d corresponding total number of mesh cells increasing from 1 51 105 to 3 49 105 and then to 5 61 105 as shown in table 1 b the expansion rate of mesh along the cylinder ω cell number on the cylinder circumference n c i r c l e as well as the cell number in the spanwise direction of the cylinder n s p a n keep exactly the same for mesh6 8 according to the hydrodynamic forces in table 2 b and pressure distributions in fig 3 c results of mesh6 and mesh8 match together very well and achieve a good convergence while the result of mesh7 has relatively large discrepancy this indicates that mesh6 share the same mesh structure with mesh4 is fine enough to be adopted in the following numerical simulation huang et al 2014 successfully captured the different flow modes of hv through a particle image velocimetry piv system in the range of r e d 500 6000 and δ d 0 083 0 288 the mean values of flow structures at r e d 2500 and δ d 0 113 were given in huang et al 2014 s work a comparison between present numerical results and those by huang et al 2014 is provided in fig 4 and fig 5 in present work δ d 0 129 is captured at x 0 with the cylinder absent which is slightly higher than that measured y huang et al 2014 fig 4 shows the velocity vectors and streamlines of hv structure in the vertical plane y 0 upstream of the cylinder fig 4 a shows the piv result reported by huang et al 2014 three hvs were observed in the experiment in this work the vortices are named as hv1 hv2 and hv3 respectively with hv1 closest to the cylinder fig 4 b shows the results from the present study the three hvs were also captured in this work which agrees well with the flow structure observed by huang et al 2014 the center positions of three main vortexes in the plane of y 0 are located at x d z d 0 94 0 06 1 11 0 06 and 1 27 0 05 respectively in the experiment they were observed at x d z d 0 96 0 05 1 20 0 03 and 1 45 0 02 it can be seen that the vortices captured by the present cfd model are slightly further away from the base wall z 0 comparing with the experimental results fig 5 shows comparisons of velocity streamlines in two planes in the upstream with z d 0 05 and 0 1 due to the existence of the hv system a source point and a saddle point are observed in the plane of z d 0 05 this is captured by both the experiment and the present numerical simulation the flow structure in the plane of z d 0 1 are beyond the hvs therefore the source point and saddle point are absent table 4shows the comparison of locations of source and saddle points it can be seen that the results in this work agree quite well with the results of huang et al 2014 the comparisons shown above demonstrate that the present numerical model can capture the key features of hv system and can be applied for further investigation on the end effect of a near wall cylinder 4 numerical results the numerical results are reported in this section the main focus of the discussions will be on three dimensional flow structures in the junction area between the cylinder and the plane walls and their influences on other physical quantities such as dynamics of horseshoe vortices pressure distributions boundary layer separations on the cylinder surface the shear stress on the wall parallel to the cylinder at different g d conditions the measurement of unaffected boundary layer at the cylinder location has been conducted in the simulation domain without the cylinder as shown in table 2 the displacement of boundary layer thickness δ d is ranging from 0 113 to 0 115 for mesh4 and 6 with r e d 2500 and 5000 respectively the boundary layer has been demonstrated as a significant factor influencing the hydrodynamic forces lei et al 1999 the minimum gap ratio in the following discussion is g d 0 2 at which the cylinder is completely outside the boundary layer 4 1 influence of gap ratio the influence of g d on the three dimensional flow feature is examined by analyzing the simulation results of case 1 2 and 3 with g d 0 5 and 0 2 respectively at r e d 2500 it has been known that the vortex shedding from the cylinder will be suppressed for a cylinder near a plane boundary with g d 0 3 bearman and zdravkovich 1978 the cases with g d 0 5 and g d 0 2 are chosen to represent the flow regimes with and without vortex shedding respectively under the influence of the parallel wall the hydrodynamic forces for the three gap ratios are presented in table 5 the mean drag coefficient c d increases from 1 08 at g d to 1 18 at g d 0 5 and then reduces to 1 09 at g d 0 2 the mean lift coefficient c l increases from 0 0 to 0 15 and 0 27 as g d is reduced from to 0 5 and 0 2 correspondingly the root mean square value of the lift c l which is normally used as a measure of strength of vortex shedding reaches a value of 0 177 at g d 0 5 and reduces to a very small value of 0 011 at g d 0 2 suggesting the suppression of vortex shedding at g d 0 2 the st increases slightly as g d is reduced from to 0 5 and disappears at g d 0 2 the above results agree well with the experimental data in the subcritical flow regime reported by jensen et al 1990 in order to examine the general 3 d vortex structure around the cylinder λ2 criteria jeong and hussain 1995 is used to visualize the flow structure around the cylinder fig 6 presents two selected 3 d views of time averaged iso surfaces of λ 2 1 for g d 0 5 and 0 2 the right column of fig 6 shows an overall view of the 3 d flow structures with the side wall perpendicular to the cylinder at the bottom and the parallel wall on the right and the left column presents a projected view of that shown in the right column in the opposite direction to the lateral direction with the parallel wall on the bottom side it is seen from fig 6 that hv tubes are developed at the junction of the cylinder with the side wall and wrap around the cylinder surface facing the flow at a certain distance for g d shown in fig 6 a four vortex tubes are observed in the junction area with the side wall three of the four vortex tubes are actually the horseshoe vortices hvs and one of them is the bottom attached vortex bav the hvs namely as hv1 hv2 and hv3 and the bav are illustrated by the ω y contours along the middle section of y 0 in fig 7 the following changes of the flow structures near the junction area of the cylinder with the side wall are observed as g d is reduced in figs 6 and 7 1 the vortex tubes on the gap side between the cylinder and the parallel wall are squeezed merged and weakened due to their interactions with the boundary layer above the parallel wall fig 6 b and the shear layer developed on the gap side of the cylinder surface fig 6 c 2 the vortex tubes move closer to the cylinder as g d is reduced fig 7 and 3 a luff vortex tube is formed along the spanwise direction fig 6 c and hv3 disappear fig 7 c at g d 0 2 locations of the centre of hvs in the plane y 0 are quantified in table 6 it shows centre locations the vortices move towards the cylinder with the decrease of g d the corresponding streamlines and vorticity for quantifying end effect are presented in fig 8 for g d fig 8 a1 shows the flow structures are independent of the end effect no source or saddle points are observed in the upstream side of the cylinder streamlines emerges from the stagnation point of the cylinder and surrounding the wake regime in the downstream the horseshoe vortices don t exist due to the contour of vorticity as z d increases to 0 05 in fig 8 b1 a four way saddle point sd and a source point sc are indicated at fig 8 b1 for z d 0 05 with a distance of 1 2d and 0 85d to the cylinder centre a symmetrical convergence line lc is also presented which is generated from sd and moves towards downstream on the other hand the contours of vorticity are denoted by positive values with solid lines and negative values with dashed lines the contours of vorticity clearly show hv system at z d 0 05 in fig 8 b1 similar results are achieved for g d 0 5 and 0 2 in fig 8 2 and 3 a counter clockwise bav is formed in the upstream side of the cylinder for g d 0 5 in fig 8 b2 which is induced by hvs and disappear in the slice of z d 1 in fig 8 b3 and c3 luff vortex expands its size when far away from the junction and the centre of the vortex moves further downstream for g d 0 2 as z d further decreases to 0 01 sc is touching the cylinder surface and sd is away in the upstream the recirculation bubble becomes wider the influence of end effect on the wake flow region is presented in fig 9 with the time averaged streamlines and vorticity for the plane of z d 1 0 05 and 0 01 for g d the flow structures which are independent of end effect are presented in fig 9 a1 a four way saddle point sd1 is observed at x d 2 1 and a two way saddle point sd2 is located at the wake of the cylinder surface two symmetrical foci f1 and f2 are presented by the wake oriented streamlines located in the middle of sd1 and sd2 the streamlines of the recirculation bubble are observed to evolve from the separated boundary layer on the top and bottom sides of the cylinder surface separation points on the top sp1 and bottom sp2 sides are denoted in fig 9 a1 which is located at θ 90 6 and 270 3 respectively as z d decreases to 0 05 the recirculation bubble expands its size and sd2 moves toward the downstream at x d 2 5 sp1 sp2 achieve θ 94 6 and 265 6 at the slice of z d 0 01 in fig 9 c1 the convergence line lc emanates from the saddle point in the upstream and ends at sd1 lc originates from hv system in the juncture rather than the shear layer of the cylinder surface and a very wide recirculation bubble is formed two centres of foci f1 and f2 are generated from the upstream streamlines with low values of vorticity a reverse flow is presented located between f1 and f2 and forms another saddle point sd2 a four way saddle point sd1 is observed at x d 2 8 clear separation points cannot be observed similar to the results of g d the variations of saddle points foci as well as the recirculation bubble for g d 0 5 share very similar trend the main differences are that 1 the wake flow structures have asymmetrical pattern due to the blockage induced stagnation point in the upstream moving toward gap side and sd1 has a higher location of y d 2 f2 is not observed at z d 0 01 and still developing at z d 0 05 the streamlines orienting from the upstream interact with the boundary layer of the plane wall to form a counter clockwise bav at x d 3 5 far from the results of g d and 0 5 multiple saddle points and a stagnation line are presented for g d 0 2 in fig 9 3 at z d 1 0 05 and 0 01 clockwise vortices f3 is formed due to the existence of the luff vortex in fig 8 c3 and coalesces with f2 and to form large scale vortices for z d 0 05 and 0 01 three dimensional flow structures are dominant in the wake through the patterns of the stagnation lines and no bav is observed near the wake in fig 9 b3 and c3 the probe contours of u velocity for three gap ratios has been plotted in fig 10 the probe was set at z d 0 06 y 0 with ranging of x d 0 5 2 the contour shows u velocity in streamwise direction at range of x d 0 5 2 varies with simulation time the almost constant values in fig 10 a and b indicate that hsv systems for g d and 0 2 are stable without any oscillating process for g d 0 5 in fig 10 b the velocity contour experiences an obviously dynamic behavior at around x d 0 95 1 05 which is mainly due to the oscillation horseshoe vortices for exploring this oscillation process of the horseshoe vortices contours of vorticity in the spanwise direction ω y and velocity streamlines on the plane of y 0 within one oscillation period t 240 245 are plotted in fig 11 t is defined as the non dimensional time in the numerical simulation it includes three main horseshoe vortices named as hv1 hv2 and hv3 as labeled in fig 11 a due to the interaction between hv1 hv2 and the boundary layer on the perpendicular wall a boundary attached vortex is formed between hv1 and hv2 and it is named as bav1 due to the relatively low intensity of hv3 there is not an obvious boundary attached vortex formed in between hv2 and hv3 fig 11 shows that hv1 hv2 and bav experience certain fluctuation in term of locations and strength but the pattern does not change with time hv3 shows a merging process within these five snap shorts hv3 exists in fig 11 a b and c and then it merged to hv2 at t 243 fig 11 d only hv1 hv2 and bav1 exist at t 243 and 244 a new horseshoe vortex forms at t 245 and a new flow period starts to repeat the vortex oscillating process the trajectories of the horseshoe vortices are plotted in fig 12 at the beginning of this cycle hv1 hv2 hv3 and bav are all observed in the field hv1 oscillates in this cycle and the position changes in a small scale which is showed in fig 12 the bav behind the hv1 also changes slightly as hv1 oscillates in the cycle as can be seen from fig 11 bav reduces in size as time ranges from t 240 to t 242 and back to the original size from t 243 to t 245 at t 240 the negative vorticity below hv3 has begun evolving from the ground toward the downstream which induces the changing of hv2 the position of hv3 oscillates in a small scale from t 240 to t 242 at the same time hv2 moves toward downstream and reduces in size and hv2 and hv3 complete amalgamate at t 243 to form a new hv2 hv2 due to the influence of the negative vorticity below hv2 a new hv3 is forming in the upstream side and finally presented in the same position where hv2 stood before the changing process of positions of hv2 hv3 and hv2 is showed in fig 12 to achieve a better understanding about the oscillation behavior of the horseshoe vortices the velocity time history at a point with x d 1 y d 0 z d 0 06 is examined the variation of u velocity in streamwise direction is plotted in fig 13 a it can be seen from fig 13 a that the oscillation of u velocity contains different frequencies a fouier transform was applied to the velocity signal as plotted in fig 13 b three main peaks are observed in this figure which are st 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 separately the vortices mode 1 in fig 13 a shows 4 periods in the range from t 240 to t 260 which represents the peak st 0 2 in fig 13 b the vortices mode 2 in fig 13 a has 8 periods in the range of t 240 to t 260 which equals the peak with st 0 4 in fig 13 b and in fig 13 a the vortices mode 3 takes all peaks into account and get 12 periods in the range of t 20 which related to the peak in fig 13 b with st 0 6 among these three vortices with different frequencies the vortices with the highest amplitude that is the peak with st 0 2 represent the dynamic activities of bav and the period is 5 which agrees well with the period of horseshoe vortices oscillation process the influence of the parallel wall on the 3 d flow structure in the junction area is further quantified in fig 14 by examining ω x contours in the plane x 0 it is seen that the flow structures on positive y side are similar to those visualized in the y 0 plane in fig 7 except that hv3 for g d 0 5 is not captured by ω x contours the flow structures on the gap side y d 0 5 are modified significantly at g d 0 5 and 0 2 in fig 14 b and c hvs are merged to form hv attached to the parallel wall two small bavs are located in the corner between the two walls a large bav extends along lateral direction the extent of the end effect in the junction is identified as z d 0 3 for g d 0 5 and z d 0 5 for g d 0 2 based on the results shown in fig 14 the length of the circulation bubble in the behind the cylinder in the averaged flow field is defined as w l in this work w l and the locations of separation points on the cylinder surface are presented in fig 15 and fig 16 for g d w l drops dramatically as z d 0 2 and gradually stabilizes at z d 0 35 as z d increases to around 1 5 w l almost has no change which agrees well with the results of huang et al 2014 huang et al 2014 examined the flow structures at different z d slices and found the pattern of the recirculation bubble stabilized at z d 1 6 the variations of separation points on the top sp1 and bottom sp2 sides show the same influence of end effect in the junction the increases of sp1 and decreases of sp2 as z d is moving towards the junction represents the separated boundary layer moves toward the downstream side under the influence of end effect the extent of end effect is further investigated by examining the sectional pressure distributions on the cylinder and the shear stress distributions on the parallel wall fig 17 shows the distributions of mean pressure coefficient c p along different cross sections for g d 0 5 and 0 2 it is seen that c p values experience large variations for z d 0 3 and rarely change for z d 0 3 especially near the peaks at θ 80 and 290 to further quantify this the variation of φ c pb c p min gap with z d is plotted in fig 18 where c pb is the base pressure and defined as the average of the pressure on the cylinder surface between θ 120 and 260 c p min gap is the minimum pressure at around θ 290 for all three gap ratios it is seen that the influence of end effect is limited at z d 0 35 for g d and 0 5 and z d 0 5 for g d 0 2 this result is consistent with the findings derived from the flow structures shown in fig 14 shear stress distributions on the parallel wall are relevant to understanding local scour below the cylinder when a cylinder is placed above an erodible boundary with a small gap local scour will happen when the flow induced shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress for sediment transport to quantify the influence of side wall on the shear stress the amplification factor of the shear stress σ 0 is checked where σ 0 is defined as σ 0 τ 0 τ r e f in which τ 0 is the magnitude of the shear stress and τ r e f is the magnitude of reference shear stress in an area far away from the sidewall plane boundary and the cylinder shear stress τ 0 is defined as τ 0 τ x 2 τ z 2 in which τ x μ u y and τ z μ w y are the mean shear stress in the x and z directions respectively and μ is the dynamic viscosity fig 19 shows the contours of σ 0 as well as the streamlines on the parallel wall for g d 0 5 and 0 2 for g d 0 5 in fig 19 a σ 0 underneath the cylinder is obviously higher than the other area this is mainly due to the blockage effect of the cylinder the variation of shear stress in the spanwise direction under the cylinder is clearly due to the existence of hvs at the junction the area influenced by the side wall is roughly about 0 5 x d 1 7 and z d 0 5 similar to the results of g d 0 5 strong shear stress is also observed underneath the cylinder for g d 0 2 the range of end effect is roughly at 0 5 x d 3 and z d 0 7 in fig 19 b to quantify the influence of the side wall the shear stress distributions along a few lines with constant x d values underneath the cylinder are extracted in fig 20 the range of end effect on σ 0 is limited to z d 0 4 for g d 0 5 in fig 20 a and the highest σ 0 is observed at around z d 0 12 which is due to horseshoe vortexes in the junction as for g d 0 2 the range of end effect on σ 0 is limited to z d 0 7 the fluctuations of σ 0 observed between z d 0 3 0 6 are good indications of the complex three dimensionality in the junction area 4 2 influence of reynolds number in the present work the influence of r e d on the flow and the end effect is investigated at r e d 1250 2500 and 5000 with g d 0 5 due to the limitation of computational resources relatively small r e d values are employed baker 1979 presented the relationship between the number of vortexes with the boundary layer thickness and reynolds number but results of the cylinder with a perpendicular wall was however not reported yet case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 respectively were simulated to compare with case2 with r e d 2500 to investigate the influence of r e d on the end effect with a perpendicular wall effect three cases are simulated with g d 0 5 the general observations of averaged iso surfaces of λ 2 for case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 are shown in fig 21 a and b respectively compared with r e d 2500 shown in fig 6 b two hvs were observed for r e d 1250 three hvs for r e d 2500 and only one for r e d 5000 it should be noted that the flow structures in figs 21 and 22 are based on the averaged flow field the variation of the hydrodynamic forces with r e d has been summarized in table 7 c d c l and st are not very sensitive to r e d within the range of r e d investigated this agrees well with the experimental data of lei et al 1999 and yang et al 2018 for hydrodynamic forces for a near wall cylinder in the subcritical regime of r e d the hv system is however totally different as r e d increases from 1250 to 5000 the mean locations of hvs at the plane of y 0 has been presented in fig 22 and table 8 for details comparing with the case of r e d 2500 discussed above two pairs of hvs are observed in front of the cylinder and the locations are 0 92 0 08 and 1 14 0 07 for r e d 1250 which shares the very same locations with hv1 and hv2 of r e d 2500 as r e d increases further to 5000 only one pair of averaged hvs is reported which locates at 1 20 0 05 in the plane of y 0 the instantaneous hv system was then to be checked to quantify the influence of reynolds number probe contours of u velocity in streamwise direction has been given in fig 23 for r e d 1250 and 5000 the same locations with fig 10 at z d 0 06 y 0 with ranging of x d 0 5 2 the stable strips in fig 23 a shows that no oscillation is observed for r e d 1250 in other hand for r e d 5000 in fig 23 b periodical contours prove the existence of oscillations of hvs fig 24 shows the oscillations of hvs for r e d 5000 containing two clockwise rotating vortices hv1 hv2 and a small counter clockwise rotating vortices bav hvs for r e d 1250 is stationary which is corresponding to the laminar steady sub regime in the literature as discussed above hvs for r e d 2500 experienced a oscillating sub regime with three hvs for r e d 5000 an oscillating hv system with four hvs is observed the period of one full oscillation cycle is t 3d u hv1 hv2 and hv3 move toward the cylinder with cv1 keeping stationary cv1 decays gradually and hv1 takes place its location to form a new cv2 hv2 and hv3 take place the previous location further to form a new hv1 and hv2 hv3 appears in the end of the cycle the averaged wake structures in the cylinder wake are presented in fig 25 a and b for case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 correspondingly for the influence of r e d on the end effect at z d 0 01 the topology of h v s is strongly affected by the parallel wall and the asymmetric h v s are observed for three r e d as z d increases to 0 1 hv still has effect on the vortex shedding the same separation bubbles are observed in the front of the cylinder and attached on the parallel wall at the downstream the effect of hv is especially obvious for r e d 1250 for its broadband vortex shape shown in fig 25 b as z d increases further to 1 the end effect has been completely vanished for three r e d fig 27 a and b shows the streamlines at the seabed plane boundary for case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 as well as case2 with r e d 2500 is presented fig 19 a in the upstream of the cylinder the twisted and bended towards to the perpendicular wall streamlines are very similar between case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 2500 the streamlines are observed to parallel in the streamwise direction underneath the cylinder and turn twisted at z d 1 the two separation lines in the downstream are observed for both case2 and case5 at x d 1 6 and 2 4 while only one is observed for case4 with r e d 1250 at x d 2 the separation line at x d 2 4 for case5 shows the same attached vortexes as case2 in fig 25 b the same hv1 hv2 and hv3 for z d 1 are presented in fig 25 b3 r e d influences the flow structure in the wake and leads to different vortex shedding as r e d increases pressure gradient φ is applied to quantify the extent of end effect in the influence of reynolds number in fig 26 the extent of the end effect decreases with r e d and is limited at z d 0 4 0 35 and 0 25 for r e d 1250 2500 and 5000 correspondingly the amplification factor of shear stress σ 0 is also employed in fig 28 with very similar extend of end effect as shown in fig 26 the contour of the magnitude of the shear stress τ 0 at the plane boundary for case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 are shown in fig 27 a and b for case4 with r e d 1250 in fig 27 a high τ 0 area is located beneath the cylinder and the range of the effect of hv s at the junction end is around 0 5 x d 1 7 and z d 0 5 which is very close to the range for case2 with r e d 2500 in fig 19 a as r e d increases to 5000 the distribution of τ 0 on the seabed plane boundary changes much in fig 27 b the effect of hv s at the junction end expands to the range of 0 5 x d 2 2 and z d 0 5 and the high τ 0 in the wake indicates the vortex attached on the seabed plane in fig 25 a3 the amplitude of the magnitude of the shear stress σ 0 for case4 and case5 are presented in fig 28 a and b the highest σ 0 is observed at around z d 0 12 which is independent of r e d σ 0 of case4 with r e d 1250 shows less fluctuated as x d varies in fig 28 a while for case5 with r e d 5000 the high σ 0 induced by the attached vortex increases sharply as x d 0 5 4 3 influence of aspect ratio as another important parameter for the flow around the span and the hvs at the cylinder ends the influence of the aspect ratio l d on the flow and the end effect is examined in this study many studies have been carried out to investigate the influence of l d on hv systems for a single cylinder without the parallel wall sumner and heseltine 2008 rodríguez y domínguez et al 2006 pattenden et al 2005 sumner et al 2004 baker 1979 1980 taniguchi et al 1990 tested with different l d up to l d 5 the largest l d that has been previously studied was l d 6 sahin et al 2007 and sahin and ozturk 2009 the highly 3 d flow characteristics at the junction of the cylinder and end plate has been found in sahin and ozturk 2009 it was found that the presence of the horseshoe vortex system above the bed surface has an elevation of 0 06d in horizontal plane and energetic eddies were observed for increasing the turbulence quantities mass and momentum transfers through piv measurement in the present work three different l d which are 10 20 and 40 are employed for the case with g d 0 5 the influence of l d has been analyzed through case6 and case7 with l d 10 and 20 comparing with case2 with l d 5 the contour of iso surfaces of λ 2 and the streamline and vorticity for the symmetry plane for case6 and case7 has been plotted in fig 29 a and b it can be seen that three hvs are formed in the junction and the center positions are very close for case2 case6 and case7 as shown in fig 6 a and b and fig 21 the hydrodynamic forces for three cases are presented in table 9 the results of three cases have almost same force coefficients which indicates the increasing l d almost has no influence on the end effect fig 29 a and b shows the contour of iso surfaces of λ 2 and the streamline and vorticity for the symmetry plane for l d 10 and 20 the influence of the small aspect ratio can be explained by the influence of the boundary layer in this work as l d 5 the aspect ratio shows minor results on the horseshoe vortex the hydrodynamic forces as well as the averaged positions of hvs in the plane of y 0 are presented in tables 9 and 10 it is seen that they are not sensitive to l d possibly because the minimum l d investigated is too large this is further confirmed by the variation of φ with l d in fig 30 the sectional drag c d s and lift c l s coefficient are plotted in fig 31 the influence range of end effect is limited at z d 0 5 for all three aspect ratios 5 discussion according to the 3 d flow structures as discussed in figs 6 and 7 the laminar hv system experiences a transition from the steady sub regime g d to the oscillating sub regime g d 0 5 and then back to the steady sub regime g d 0 2 the trajectories of the vortex cores during a regular cycle were analyzed as the consequence of the adverse pressure gradients induced by the surface mounted cylinder the separation of the incoming boundary layer and the formation of a separation line on the bottom surface are formed and the reorganization of the above flow structures results in the formation of a system of coherent necklace vortices which is horseshoe vortex system case1 with g d shares the similar features and achieves a symmetrical steady hv system which are also observed by baker 1979 it can be seen that main necklace vortices of the hv system as shown in fig 7 have the same sense of rotation the bottom attached vortices bav as shown in fig 7 is believed to be formed by the main vortices interacting with the plane boundary the dominant mechanism is the upstream boundary layer vorticity in the spanwise direction of the channel as a result of the adverse pressure gradients the main horseshoe vortices originating in the separation region stretch around the cylinder and fold around the upstream part of the cylinder very close to the bottom the sides of the vortex lines become oriented in the streamwise direction with the vorticity being of opposite sense in the two sides legs of the horseshoe vortices however as the existence of the gap ratio the legs of the necklace vortices in the gap side is suppressed the adverse pressure gradients lead the main necklace vortices squeezed merged and weakened resulting in one vortices attached on the parallel wall on the other hand as the influence of g d 0 5 an oscillating hv system is observed hv1 is located closest to the cylinder whilst hv2 and hv3 merges with each other to form a new vortex greco 1990 regarded it as the amalgamating sub regime kirkil and constantinescu 2012 reported that this sub regime was observed in previous experiments and numerical simulations only for very specific flow conditions depending on the characteristic of the incoming boundary layer as shown in fig 11 during the amalgamation process it can be seen that vorticity is extracted from the side of hv3 and then convected over the top of the hv2 into the core of it which indicates that hv3 is adsorbed into hv2 rather than the opposite as the gap ratio further decrease to g d 0 2 in case3 the blockage effect in the gap suppressed the flow structures in the gap which agrees well with results of yang et al 2018 and bearman and zdravkovich 1978 the leg of the horseshoe vortices in the gap is completely blocked to form a luff vortex tube in the spanwise direction the blockage effect weakens the adverse pressure gradient and results in a steady laminar hv system for case influenced by the proximity of the parallel wall the 3 d horseshoe vortex structures formed in the junction area between the cylinder and the side wall contributes to the end effect at the junction through hydrodynamic forces and shear stress with an increase of reynolds number the strong instabilities due to their interactions with the boundary layer above the parallel wall and the shear layer developed on the gap side of the cylinder surface are introduced a four pair oscillating hv system is observed with a merging process of necklace vortices for case5 with r e d 5000 hv1 which is the closet to the cylinder breaks up as it moves towards the cylinder hv3 and hv4 shed from the formation region and then to form a new primary vortex and for case4 with r e d 1250 the instability is weak resulting in a stationary hv system in the investigations of aspect ratio effect the strength of the system as well as the number of vortices are not largely influenced in the range of current aspect ratio l d 5 10 20 which is usually applied in the experiments in water or wind tunnels through hydrodynamic forces and flow structures 6 conclusions in the present work the flow around a circular cylinder in a water channel is simulated through three dimensional large eddy simulations the influence of the side wall on the flow structure is investigated at three gap ratios g d 0 5 and 0 2 three reynolds numbers r e d 1250 2500 and 5000 and three aspect ratios l d 10 20 and 40 the main conclusions from the present work are summarized as follows 1 the 3 d horseshoe vortex structures formed in the junction area between the cylinder and the side wall are strongly affected by the proximity of the parallel wall the vortex tubes on the gap side between the cylinder and the parallel wall are squeezed merged and weakened due to their interactions with the boundary layer above the parallel wall and the shear layer developed on the gap side of the cylinder surface the vortex tubes move closer to the cylinder as g d is reduced and a luff vortex tube is formed along the spanwise direction 2 the extent of the end effect is examined by a number of quantities such as pressure distribution on the cylinder surface and shear stress on the parallel wall it is found that the extent of the end effect is not sensitive to gap ratio reynolds number and the aspect ratio within the parameter ranges studied the end effect is largely contained within 0 7d from the side wall credit authorship contribution statement fan yang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft zhongbing zhou software visualization

corresponding author flow around a near bed horizontal circular cylinder mounted on a vertical side wall is simulated numerically in this study the purpose of the study is to investigate the flow characteristics around the junction area between the cylinder and two plane boundaries the effects of gap to diameter ratio g d 0 5 0 2 reynolds number based on the diameter r e d 1250 2500 5000 and the length to diameter aspect ratio l d 10 20 40 are investigated it is found that the three dimensional flow structures formed in the junction area between the vertical wall and the cylinder are

usually installed on the seabed attract substantial research interest in the past decades regarded as the prototype of the offshore piles locating in the shoulder of the seabed steady flow around a horizontal cylinder mounted perpendicularly to side walls at two ends with a parallel plane boundary in proximity is often encountered in physical model testing in water flumes or wind tunnels of flow around a near wall cylinder for simulating local scour around subsea pipelines cheng et al 2009 and related hydrodynamic forces yang et al 2018 a schematic illustration of the configuration is shown in fig 1 the flow is highly three dimensional 3 d near the junction area between the cylinder and two plane boundaries in some situations the highly 3 d flow is unwanted and creates difficulty in interpreting the test results as it is very different from the flow over the majority part of the cylinder this is often referred to as end effect in the literature the highly 3 d flow is expected to exhibit the flow characteristics of the following two flows that are widely studied 1 flow around junction area of a cylinder mounted on a perpendicular plane and 2 flow around a cylinder above a parallel plane the existing work on those two flows in the literature will be briefly reviewed below junction flow around a circular cylinder attached to a plane boundary has attracted substantial research interests over the past decades for its importance to engineering applications in the fields of aerodynamics heat transfer and offshore hydrodynamics junction flow is generally a complex three dimensional phenomenon involving three dimensional boundary layer separations formation of coherent flow structures and vortex shedding when a cylinder is mounted on a plane boundary the adverse pressure gradient in front of the cylinder near the plane boundary leads to the boundary layer to separate and forms a series of vortex tubes to wrap around the junction of the cylinder the vortex tubes formed around the base of the cylinder are often referred to as horseshoe vortices hv in the literature baker 1979 1980 1985 in the experimental results of seal and smith 1999 a complicated intertwining or braiding of two initially co rotating necklace vortices around the juncture of a circular cylinder was reported through hydrogen bubble visualization horseshoe vortices are highly unsteady and cause high surface pressure fluctuations and are attributed to the initiation of local scour around the cylinder founded on an erodible surface simpson 2001 early studies by thwaites and street 1960 and baker 1979 1980 1985 found that the formation of hv was dependent on reynolds number which is defined as r e d u d υ with d being the diameter of the cylinder u being the free stream velocity far away from the plane boundary and υ being the kinematic viscosity of the fluid the hv is classified into three types steady single or multiple pairs of vortices regular oscillatory vortices and irregular unsteady vortices the position of the primary horseshoe vortex in the steady vortex system has been found to be dependent on both of r e d and the relative displacement boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d baker 1979 1985 in the steady hv system one or more steady horseshoe vortices are formed the number of the hvs increases with the increase of r e d baker 1979 when r e d increases to a certain value the hv system becomes unsteady the steady hv was observed at r e d 1000 and chaotic hvs were observed at r e d 13000 in the investigation reported by thomas 1987 while the corresponding hv systems were observed at r e d 2000 and r e d 8000 respectively by wei et al 2001 greco 1990 classified the laminar horseshoe vortex system into five sub regimes which are steady oscillation amalgamating breakaway and transitional regimes in the sequence of increasing r e d when the hv system becomes unsteady the vortices in the upstream start to oscillate around their mean positions without direct interactions with each other this sub regime is called the oscillating sub regime as r e d is further increased the vortices are shed periodically and neighboring vortices interact and combine with each other to form new vortices this regime is referred to as the amalgamation sub regime the oscillating sub regime is observed when r e d is in the range of 1700 1900 and the amalgamation sub regime starts to appear when r e d increases to around 2500 greco 1990 the unsteady state of the horseshoe vortex system was also investigated by seal et al 1995 and wei et al 2001 experimentally and kirkil and constantinescu 2012 numerically it was found that a significant change to the hv system dynamics is accompanied by the change of δ d when r e d increased further the transition from the laminar to the turbulent state occurs in the junction area and the separated shear layer becomes irregular as r e d increased to around 9000 the clear separated shear layer turns to a turbulent juncture flow which indicated that the behaviors of the horseshoe vortex system cannot be predicted easily thomas 1987 by experiments and visbal 1991 by numerical simulations suggest that the periodical oscillation phenomenon of the hvs is not related to the karman vortex shedding from the cylinder and is independent of the influence of the incoming flow baker 1991 indicated that oscillations of hv system were ascribed to the oscillation of the entire vortex system as well as the instabilities of vortex core itself in the experiment of wei et al 2001 a large number of vortices was observed to cascade chaotically when r e d increases from 14000 to 24000 while escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011 observed a fast regular breakaway behavior for re d 20000 baker 1980 investigated the horseshoe vortex formed by the turbulent boundary layer in the range of re d 4000 90000 with different boundary layer thickness d δ 4 30 the measurement of pressure distributions showed that the distribution of the primary horseshoe vortex is not affected much by r e d under turbulent boundary layer conditions dargahi 1989 studied the flow around a vertical circular cylinder by flow visualizations through hydrogen bubbles at re d 6600 65000 the quasi periodically shedding of vortices was found which is similar to the results reported by baker 1980 the number of hv increases with the increase of r e d the dimensions of the vortex system is found independent of r e d but dependent on the diameter of the cylinder a detailed discussion on the junction flow is reported by simpson 2001 numerical simulations of junction flows have also been carried out to capture the dynamic features of horseshoe vortexes briley et al 1985 conducted a three dimensional simulation to investigate the horseshoe vortex of the flow at re d 200 the results demonstrated that the captured laminar flow structures can be accurately computed under a good convergence rates of the grid steady and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations rans and urands were used by apsley and leschziner 2001 and chen 1995 even though the positions of vortices turbulence intensities pressure distributions shear stress as well as the turbulent kinetic energy were provided the one or two eddy viscosity turbulent model applied showed a poor agreement with the experimental data and failed to capture the dynamic features of horseshoe vortex system paik et al 2007 applied detached eddy simulation to simulate turbulent horseshoe vortex system in a wing body junction successfully in paik et al 2007 periodic oscillating hvs were observed which was very similar to the previous experimental results given but the results failed to capture the location of hv cores detached eddy simulation was also used in the study of escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011 re d 20000 and 39000 were investigated to study the influence of re d on the horseshoe vortex system the observed instantaneous flow structures were very similar to the results of devenport and simpson 1990 large eddy simulations les were conducted by rodi 1997 tseng et al 2000 krajnovic and davidson 2002 and kirkil and constantinescu 2012 the simulations of rodi 1997 tseng et al 2000 and krajnovic and davidson 2002 performed computations on a square cylinder and have a general agreement with the data and topology structures observed in experiments at re d 40000 tseng et al 2000 only presented averaged magnitudes of pressure and shear stress and compared with dargahi 1989 for a circular cylinder the discrepancies were attributed to the conditions of incoming flow boundary layer conditions as well as the mesh resolution of the boundary layer rodi 1997 kirkil and constantinescu 2012 preformed three simulations ranging from re d 800 2140 and 4460 with relatively large boundary layer thickness and captured the laminar hv system transiting from the steady to oscillating and then to the breakaway sub regime the hv is a genuine feature of the junction flow and has a side effect on model testing results in wind tunnels or water flumes flow boundary layer will naturally form on the solid walls side top and bottom of the wind tunnel or water flume when a two dimensional slender model is mounted against the channel walls a hv system will be formed at each end of the model this hv represents an undesired three dimensional disturbance to the flow field for example when the hydrodynamics aerodynamics of a uniform cylinder is tested the two ends of the cylinder are normally mounted with two end plates to avoid the three dimensional effect from the free ends stansby 1974 the diameter of the end plates is normally just slightly larger than the cylinder diameter to limit the development of a thick boundary layer on the end plates gerich and eckelmann 1982 in this way the end effect due to hv can be managed to some extent however some model tests in a flume are not suitable for adding end plates to the cylinder for example when local scour below a cylinder is investigated in a water channel normally the ends of the cylinder are set against the side walls of test section directly without end plates attached this is because the end plates could cause extra scour sumer et al 2001 mentioned a half hv around the end of a cylinder partially buried on the sand bed the end effect due to hv would lead to different shear stress distribution on the sand bed near the ends of the model cylinder consequently it leads to different sediment transport rate which affects the time scale of the scour process thehv formed at the ends will also affect the pressure distribution on the cylinder therefore it is important to quantify the end effect due to hv in similar testing setup the effect of a plane parallel to the cylinder on the flow around circular cylinder also attracted substantial research interests in the past a few decades lei et al 1999 buresti and lanciotti 1992 jensen et al 1990 zdravkovich 1985 bearman and zdravkovich 1978 roshko et al 1975 kiya 1968 the flow structures and hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder are affected by the gap to diameter ratio g d wall boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d as well as the turbulence intensity in the boundary layer bearman and zdravkovich 1978 visualized flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary and measured pressure distribution on the cylinder surface and on the plane boundary at r e d 4 5 104 it was found the vortex shedding was suppressed for all gaps less than 0 3d lei et al 1999 found that the stagnation point moves upward and the base pressure decreases as the gap to diameter ratio increases and the vortex shedding is suppressed at gap ratio of 0 2 0 3 depending on the different wall boundary layer thickness yang et al 2018 found that the drag crisis phenomenon exists for g d 0 5 and found that the lift coefficient reduced with the increases of the gap ratio in the work of yang et al 2018 the boundary layer transition was largely influenced by the proximity of the plane boundary and side swapping phenomenon was found at large gap ratios the suppression of vortex shedding was observed at g d 0 3 tong et al 2017 reported a deflected flow near the shoulders between a spanning and non spanning section under the conditions of intermittent gap ratios which led to large variations of sectional forces the influence of the blockage ratio and aspect ratio has been revealed by west and apelt 1982 it was found that the blockage ratio affects pressure distributions force coefficients and vortex shedding frequency lei et al 2001 suggested that the aspect ratio of cylinder must be larger than 4d in order to simulate the three dimensional wake flow accurately sumner et al 2004 pattenden et al 2005 rodríguez y domínguez et al 2006 and sumner and heseltine 2008 reported the junction flow around the circular cylinder with small aspect ratio it was found that hv systems was weak and as the aspect ratio increased the strength of the system as well as the number of vortices increased sumner and heseltine 2008 reported a downwash phenomenon for cylinders with small aspect ratios the horseshoe vortex system and its interaction with the wake flow for a circular cylinder with large aspect ratio were reported by sahin et al 2007 and sahin and ozturk 2009 it was found that the swirling horseshoe vortices in the streamwise direction and counter clockwise vortices in the vertical plane downstream of the cylinder led an increased level of scour in the junction region in the experimental apparatus in water flumes or wind tunnels the steady flow around a near bed horizontal cylinder mounted on a vertical wall is widely regarded as the prototype for a series of physical model testings such as local scour around subsea pipeline and its related hydrodynamic forces the influence of a perpendicular wall and a parallel plane boundary leads to a highly three dimensional flow in the cylinder junction which is referred to as end effect in the literature the previous investigations on how to quantify the end effect on a horizontal cylinder mounted perpendicularly to side walls at two ends with a parallel plane boundary in proximity is rare due to the best knowledge of the author and this motivates the current numerical simulation work here are two objectives for the present simulation i provide a quantitative description of the highly three dimensional flow structures in the junction ii quantify the influence of the end effect on the circular cylinder to understand the end effect due to highly three dimensional flow structures on a circular cylinder near a parallel plane boundary a series of numerical simulation was carried out using les model firstly the numerical model was validated by comparing with published experimental results and then the end effect was analyzed in detail the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations of the flow have been presented the grid size independence study and the validation are given in section 3 and section 4 presents the simulation results and section 5 gives a general discussion about results followed by conclusions in the last section 2 methodology a large eddy simulation turbulent model is employed in the present work the filter incompressible navier stokes equations 1 u i t u u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν ν t u i x j and the continuity equations 2 u i x i 0 where u i are flow velocities in the three spatial directions i 1 2 and 3 corresponding to the streamwise spanewise and lateral direction respectively ρ is the density of the fluid p is the pressure fluctuation ν is the kinematic viscosity of the incompressible flow and ν t is the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity t is time x i are the spatial coordinates a homogeneous dynamic smagorinsky model was adopted germano et al 1991 smagorinsky 1963 the boundary conditions are specified as following a uniform flow velocity u is specified in the streamwise direction at the inlet boundary hefg in fig 1 it is observed that the boundary layer is fairly quickly developed after the start of the simulations similar to nishino et al 2008 at the outlet dacb in fig 1 the neumann boundary condition i e zero normal gradient is adopted for the velocity and the pressure is specified as a reference value of zero symmetry boundary conditions were enforced on boundary hdae and the boundary eabf the non slip boundary condition was applied on the perpendicular wall hdcg in fig 1 the bed wall gcbf in fig 1 and the cylinder surface the finite volume method embedded in open source toolbox openfoam is employed to discretize the spatially filtered equations the gauss cubic scheme is used to discretize the advection terms while the gauss linear scheme is applied to discretize laplacian and pressure terms in the momentum equations the same model is applied to the results of section 3 as shown in fig 2 the calculations were performed on the facilities with a cray xc40 system supercomputer for a typical 3 d case in the present work 144 processors have been used for parallel computation and this leads to around 130 h wall clock time for the numerical simulation of up to around 500 non dimensional time units until the convergence is achieved in which the variation of averaged values of hydrodynamic force i e drag coefficient in the simulation is smaller than 3 based on the courant number criterion c o were chosen to keep below 0 5 for the entire computational domain which usually means the applied non dimensional time step is smaller than 0 005 the similar criterion was widely applied for precision of the simulation jiang et al 2016 tong et al 2017 the definition of courant number c o is defined by 3 c o u δ t δ l in which u is the magnitude of the velocity flowing through a cell δ l is the cell size along the velocity direction and δ t is the time step adopted in the simulation 3 grid size independence study and model validations a circular cylinder mounted on a perpendicular wall is simulated for the grid size independence study and validation purposes this refers to the case with g d in the analysis of section 4 the domain geometry is shown in fig 1 and has dimensions of 28d in the flow direction with 8d in the upstream side 16din the cross flow direction and 5d in the spanwise direction l d 10 due to the symmetry boundary a condition the computational domain in the x y plane is discretized with structured 4 nodes quadratic cells five different meshes are tested to examine the convergence of the numerical model with the key information including the total cell number n c e l l the expansion rate of mesh along the cylinder ω cell number on the cylinder circumference n c i r c l e size of the first layer mesh on the cylinder surface δ d the cell number in the spanwise direction of the cylinder n s p a n as well as the displacement of boundary layer thickness δ d details of the meshes are given in table 1 for all meshes the non dimensional distances from the first nodal point to the wall surfaces of both cylinder and the plane wall y u f δ ν kept to be smaller than 2 in which u f is the friction velocity the first layer mesh size around the cylinder and that on the perpendicular wall are kept the same to resolve the boundary layer flow in present work the grid size independence study is conducted in two steps the first step focuses on the first layer mesh on the wall surface and the second is the size of the square region in fig 1 in mesh 1 3 the first layer mesh on the wall surface is refined from 0 004d to 0 002d and then to 0 001d corresponding total number of mesh cells increasing from 1 69 105 to 3 49 105 and then to 5 51 105 r e d is set to 2500 for the purpose of comparing with experimental data by huang et al 2014 the averaged distributions of pressure coefficient c p p ρ u 2 2 are given in fig 3 in which ρ is the density of the flow it can be seen that a good convergence trend is achieved for mesh2 and mesh3 only a slight difference in the range of θ 60 300 in fig 3 a which indicates the benefit of the reduction of δ d for capturing the hvs a square region around the cylinder 6d 6d is refined three different sizes of the refined area were examined in the grid size independence study in order to accurately capture the detailed information of the flow structure around the cylinder and the hv structure at the junction in the meantime to save computational costs mesh4 5d 5d and mesh5 4d 4d are summarized in table 2 fig 3 b presents the convergence trend of pressure distributions for different refined areas the pressure distribution of mesh4 5d 5d is almost overlapping with the results of mesh3 6d 6d while c p of mesh5 4d 4d is obviously larger than c p of mesh4 and mesh3 the minimum pressure for mesh5 is 12 6 higher than the results of mesh3 and mesh4 this indicates that the square size of 4d 4d for mesh5 is not big enough for the simulation comparing with results of mesh3 and mesh4 hydrodynamic forces and vortex shedding frequency are also checked in table 3 for centre positions of three horseshoe vortices in the plane of y 0 in the present study the drag and lift coefficients are defined as c d f d ρ l d u 2 2 and c l f l ρ l d u 2 2 in which f d and f l are the force component in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively and l is the cylinder length the normalized vortex shedding frequency strouhal number is defined as s t f d u where f is the frequency of the vortex shedding the mean drag coefficients c d for mesh3 and mesh4 are 1 08 and 1 07 correspondingly which are within the measured range of 1 0 1 2 in the subcritical range of reynolds number niemann and hölscher 1990 braza et al 1986 schewe 1983 the corresponding strouhal number are 0 214 and 0 217 respectively which also agree with the range of 0 207 0 22 in the work of roshko 1954 by comparing with the pressure distributions the mean drag coefficients c d the root mean square lift coefficient c l as well as strouhal number s t the results of mesh4 agree with the results of mesh3 very well mesh4 is used in this work for further simulations regarding on reynolds number effect on the grid size independency study supplementary simulations has been conducted and reynolds number r e d was set as r e d 5000 which is the maximum reynolds number analyzed in section 4 based on the same mesh structure with mesh4 mesh6 8 has 5d 5d of a square mesh region around the cylinder the first layer mesh on the wall surface is refined from 0 004d to 0 001d and then to 0 0007d corresponding total number of mesh cells increasing from 1 51 105 to 3 49 105 and then to 5 61 105 as shown in table 1 b the expansion rate of mesh along the cylinder ω cell number on the cylinder circumference n c i r c l e as well as the cell number in the spanwise direction of the cylinder n s p a n keep exactly the same for mesh6 8 according to the hydrodynamic forces in table 2 b and pressure distributions in fig 3 c results of mesh6 and mesh8 match together very well and achieve a good convergence while the result of mesh7 has relatively large discrepancy this indicates that mesh6 share the same mesh structure with mesh4 is fine enough to be adopted in the following numerical simulation huang et al 2014 successfully captured the different flow modes of hv through a particle image velocimetry piv system in the range of r e d 500 6000 and δ d 0 083 0 288 the mean values of flow structures at r e d 2500 and δ d 0 113 were given in huang et al 2014 s work a comparison between present numerical results and those by huang et al 2014 is provided in fig 4 and fig 5 in present work δ d 0 129 is captured at x 0 with the cylinder absent which is slightly higher than that measured y huang et al 2014 fig 4 shows the velocity vectors and streamlines of hv structure in the vertical plane y 0 upstream of the cylinder fig 4 a shows the piv result reported by huang et al 2014 three hvs were observed in the experiment in this work the vortices are named as hv1 hv2 and hv3 respectively with hv1 closest to the cylinder fig 4 b shows the results from the present study the three hvs were also captured in this work which agrees well with the flow structure observed by huang et al 2014 the center positions of three main vortexes in the plane of y 0 are located at x d z d 0 94 0 06 1 11 0 06 and 1 27 0 05 respectively in the experiment they were observed at x d z d 0 96 0 05 1 20 0 03 and 1 45 0 02 it can be seen that the vortices captured by the present cfd model are slightly further away from the base wall z 0 comparing with the experimental results fig 5 shows comparisons of velocity streamlines in two planes in the upstream with z d 0 05 and 0 1 due to the existence of the hv system a source point and a saddle point are observed in the plane of z d 0 05 this is captured by both the experiment and the present numerical simulation the flow structure in the plane of z d 0 1 are beyond the hvs therefore the source point and saddle point are absent table 4shows the comparison of locations of source and saddle points it can be seen that the results in this work agree quite well with the results of huang et al 2014 the comparisons shown above demonstrate that the present numerical model can capture the key features of hv system and can be applied for further investigation on the end effect of a near wall cylinder 4 numerical results the numerical results are reported in this section the main focus of the discussions will be on three dimensional flow structures in the junction area between the cylinder and the plane walls and their influences on other physical quantities such as dynamics of horseshoe vortices pressure distributions boundary layer separations on the cylinder surface the shear stress on the wall parallel to the cylinder at different g d conditions the measurement of unaffected boundary layer at the cylinder location has been conducted in the simulation domain without the cylinder as shown in table 2 the displacement of boundary layer thickness δ d is ranging from 0 113 to 0 115 for mesh4 and 6 with r e d 2500 and 5000 respectively the boundary layer has been demonstrated as a significant factor influencing the hydrodynamic forces lei et al 1999 the minimum gap ratio in the following discussion is g d 0 2 at which the cylinder is completely outside the boundary layer 4 1 influence of gap ratio the influence of g d on the three dimensional flow feature is examined by analyzing the simulation results of case 1 2 and 3 with g d 0 5 and 0 2 respectively at r e d 2500 it has been known that the vortex shedding from the cylinder will be suppressed for a cylinder near a plane boundary with g d 0 3 bearman and zdravkovich 1978 the cases with g d 0 5 and g d 0 2 are chosen to represent the flow regimes with and without vortex shedding respectively under the influence of the parallel wall the hydrodynamic forces for the three gap ratios are presented in table 5 the mean drag coefficient c d increases from 1 08 at g d to 1 18 at g d 0 5 and then reduces to 1 09 at g d 0 2 the mean lift coefficient c l increases from 0 0 to 0 15 and 0 27 as g d is reduced from to 0 5 and 0 2 correspondingly the root mean square value of the lift c l which is normally used as a measure of strength of vortex shedding reaches a value of 0 177 at g d 0 5 and reduces to a very small value of 0 011 at g d 0 2 suggesting the suppression of vortex shedding at g d 0 2 the st increases slightly as g d is reduced from to 0 5 and disappears at g d 0 2 the above results agree well with the experimental data in the subcritical flow regime reported by jensen et al 1990 in order to examine the general 3 d vortex structure around the cylinder λ2 criteria jeong and hussain 1995 is used to visualize the flow structure around the cylinder fig 6 presents two selected 3 d views of time averaged iso surfaces of λ 2 1 for g d 0 5 and 0 2 the right column of fig 6 shows an overall view of the 3 d flow structures with the side wall perpendicular to the cylinder at the bottom and the parallel wall on the right and the left column presents a projected view of that shown in the right column in the opposite direction to the lateral direction with the parallel wall on the bottom side it is seen from fig 6 that hv tubes are developed at the junction of the cylinder with the side wall and wrap around the cylinder surface facing the flow at a certain distance for g d shown in fig 6 a four vortex tubes are observed in the junction area with the side wall three of the four vortex tubes are actually the horseshoe vortices hvs and one of them is the bottom attached vortex bav the hvs namely as hv1 hv2 and hv3 and the bav are illustrated by the ω y contours along the middle section of y 0 in fig 7 the following changes of the flow structures near the junction area of the cylinder with the side wall are observed as g d is reduced in figs 6 and 7 1 the vortex tubes on the gap side between the cylinder and the parallel wall are squeezed merged and weakened due to their interactions with the boundary layer above the parallel wall fig 6 b and the shear layer developed on the gap side of the cylinder surface fig 6 c 2 the vortex tubes move closer to the cylinder as g d is reduced fig 7 and 3 a luff vortex tube is formed along the spanwise direction fig 6 c and hv3 disappear fig 7 c at g d 0 2 locations of the centre of hvs in the plane y 0 are quantified in table 6 it shows centre locations the vortices move towards the cylinder with the decrease of g d the corresponding streamlines and vorticity for quantifying end effect are presented in fig 8 for g d fig 8 a1 shows the flow structures are independent of the end effect no source or saddle points are observed in the upstream side of the cylinder streamlines emerges from the stagnation point of the cylinder and surrounding the wake regime in the downstream the horseshoe vortices don t exist due to the contour of vorticity as z d increases to 0 05 in fig 8 b1 a four way saddle point sd and a source point sc are indicated at fig 8 b1 for z d 0 05 with a distance of 1 2d and 0 85d to the cylinder centre a symmetrical convergence line lc is also presented which is generated from sd and moves towards downstream on the other hand the contours of vorticity are denoted by positive values with solid lines and negative values with dashed lines the contours of vorticity clearly show hv system at z d 0 05 in fig 8 b1 similar results are achieved for g d 0 5 and 0 2 in fig 8 2 and 3 a counter clockwise bav is formed in the upstream side of the cylinder for g d 0 5 in fig 8 b2 which is induced by hvs and disappear in the slice of z d 1 in fig 8 b3 and c3 luff vortex expands its size when far away from the junction and the centre of the vortex moves further downstream for g d 0 2 as z d further decreases to 0 01 sc is touching the cylinder surface and sd is away in the upstream the recirculation bubble becomes wider the influence of end effect on the wake flow region is presented in fig 9 with the time averaged streamlines and vorticity for the plane of z d 1 0 05 and 0 01 for g d the flow structures which are independent of end effect are presented in fig 9 a1 a four way saddle point sd1 is observed at x d 2 1 and a two way saddle point sd2 is located at the wake of the cylinder surface two symmetrical foci f1 and f2 are presented by the wake oriented streamlines located in the middle of sd1 and sd2 the streamlines of the recirculation bubble are observed to evolve from the separated boundary layer on the top and bottom sides of the cylinder surface separation points on the top sp1 and bottom sp2 sides are denoted in fig 9 a1 which is located at θ 90 6 and 270 3 respectively as z d decreases to 0 05 the recirculation bubble expands its size and sd2 moves toward the downstream at x d 2 5 sp1 sp2 achieve θ 94 6 and 265 6 at the slice of z d 0 01 in fig 9 c1 the convergence line lc emanates from the saddle point in the upstream and ends at sd1 lc originates from hv system in the juncture rather than the shear layer of the cylinder surface and a very wide recirculation bubble is formed two centres of foci f1 and f2 are generated from the upstream streamlines with low values of vorticity a reverse flow is presented located between f1 and f2 and forms another saddle point sd2 a four way saddle point sd1 is observed at x d 2 8 clear separation points cannot be observed similar to the results of g d the variations of saddle points foci as well as the recirculation bubble for g d 0 5 share very similar trend the main differences are that 1 the wake flow structures have asymmetrical pattern due to the blockage induced stagnation point in the upstream moving toward gap side and sd1 has a higher location of y d 2 f2 is not observed at z d 0 01 and still developing at z d 0 05 the streamlines orienting from the upstream interact with the boundary layer of the plane wall to form a counter clockwise bav at x d 3 5 far from the results of g d and 0 5 multiple saddle points and a stagnation line are presented for g d 0 2 in fig 9 3 at z d 1 0 05 and 0 01 clockwise vortices f3 is formed due to the existence of the luff vortex in fig 8 c3 and coalesces with f2 and to form large scale vortices for z d 0 05 and 0 01 three dimensional flow structures are dominant in the wake through the patterns of the stagnation lines and no bav is observed near the wake in fig 9 b3 and c3 the probe contours of u velocity for three gap ratios has been plotted in fig 10 the probe was set at z d 0 06 y 0 with ranging of x d 0 5 2 the contour shows u velocity in streamwise direction at range of x d 0 5 2 varies with simulation time the almost constant values in fig 10 a and b indicate that hsv systems for g d and 0 2 are stable without any oscillating process for g d 0 5 in fig 10 b the velocity contour experiences an obviously dynamic behavior at around x d 0 95 1 05 which is mainly due to the oscillation horseshoe vortices for exploring this oscillation process of the horseshoe vortices contours of vorticity in the spanwise direction ω y and velocity streamlines on the plane of y 0 within one oscillation period t 240 245 are plotted in fig 11 t is defined as the non dimensional time in the numerical simulation it includes three main horseshoe vortices named as hv1 hv2 and hv3 as labeled in fig 11 a due to the interaction between hv1 hv2 and the boundary layer on the perpendicular wall a boundary attached vortex is formed between hv1 and hv2 and it is named as bav1 due to the relatively low intensity of hv3 there is not an obvious boundary attached vortex formed in between hv2 and hv3 fig 11 shows that hv1 hv2 and bav experience certain fluctuation in term of locations and strength but the pattern does not change with time hv3 shows a merging process within these five snap shorts hv3 exists in fig 11 a b and c and then it merged to hv2 at t 243 fig 11 d only hv1 hv2 and bav1 exist at t 243 and 244 a new horseshoe vortex forms at t 245 and a new flow period starts to repeat the vortex oscillating process the trajectories of the horseshoe vortices are plotted in fig 12 at the beginning of this cycle hv1 hv2 hv3 and bav are all observed in the field hv1 oscillates in this cycle and the position changes in a small scale which is showed in fig 12 the bav behind the hv1 also changes slightly as hv1 oscillates in the cycle as can be seen from fig 11 bav reduces in size as time ranges from t 240 to t 242 and back to the original size from t 243 to t 245 at t 240 the negative vorticity below hv3 has begun evolving from the ground toward the downstream which induces the changing of hv2 the position of hv3 oscillates in a small scale from t 240 to t 242 at the same time hv2 moves toward downstream and reduces in size and hv2 and hv3 complete amalgamate at t 243 to form a new hv2 hv2 due to the influence of the negative vorticity below hv2 a new hv3 is forming in the upstream side and finally presented in the same position where hv2 stood before the changing process of positions of hv2 hv3 and hv2 is showed in fig 12 to achieve a better understanding about the oscillation behavior of the horseshoe vortices the velocity time history at a point with x d 1 y d 0 z d 0 06 is examined the variation of u velocity in streamwise direction is plotted in fig 13 a it can be seen from fig 13 a that the oscillation of u velocity contains different frequencies a fouier transform was applied to the velocity signal as plotted in fig 13 b three main peaks are observed in this figure which are st 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 separately the vortices mode 1 in fig 13 a shows 4 periods in the range from t 240 to t 260 which represents the peak st 0 2 in fig 13 b the vortices mode 2 in fig 13 a has 8 periods in the range of t 240 to t 260 which equals the peak with st 0 4 in fig 13 b and in fig 13 a the vortices mode 3 takes all peaks into account and get 12 periods in the range of t 20 which related to the peak in fig 13 b with st 0 6 among these three vortices with different frequencies the vortices with the highest amplitude that is the peak with st 0 2 represent the dynamic activities of bav and the period is 5 which agrees well with the period of horseshoe vortices oscillation process the influence of the parallel wall on the 3 d flow structure in the junction area is further quantified in fig 14 by examining ω x contours in the plane x 0 it is seen that the flow structures on positive y side are similar to those visualized in the y 0 plane in fig 7 except that hv3 for g d 0 5 is not captured by ω x contours the flow structures on the gap side y d 0 5 are modified significantly at g d 0 5 and 0 2 in fig 14 b and c hvs are merged to form hv attached to the parallel wall two small bavs are located in the corner between the two walls a large bav extends along lateral direction the extent of the end effect in the junction is identified as z d 0 3 for g d 0 5 and z d 0 5 for g d 0 2 based on the results shown in fig 14 the length of the circulation bubble in the behind the cylinder in the averaged flow field is defined as w l in this work w l and the locations of separation points on the cylinder surface are presented in fig 15 and fig 16 for g d w l drops dramatically as z d 0 2 and gradually stabilizes at z d 0 35 as z d increases to around 1 5 w l almost has no change which agrees well with the results of huang et al 2014 huang et al 2014 examined the flow structures at different z d slices and found the pattern of the recirculation bubble stabilized at z d 1 6 the variations of separation points on the top sp1 and bottom sp2 sides show the same influence of end effect in the junction the increases of sp1 and decreases of sp2 as z d is moving towards the junction represents the separated boundary layer moves toward the downstream side under the influence of end effect the extent of end effect is further investigated by examining the sectional pressure distributions on the cylinder and the shear stress distributions on the parallel wall fig 17 shows the distributions of mean pressure coefficient c p along different cross sections for g d 0 5 and 0 2 it is seen that c p values experience large variations for z d 0 3 and rarely change for z d 0 3 especially near the peaks at θ 80 and 290 to further quantify this the variation of φ c pb c p min gap with z d is plotted in fig 18 where c pb is the base pressure and defined as the average of the pressure on the cylinder surface between θ 120 and 260 c p min gap is the minimum pressure at around θ 290 for all three gap ratios it is seen that the influence of end effect is limited at z d 0 35 for g d and 0 5 and z d 0 5 for g d 0 2 this result is consistent with the findings derived from the flow structures shown in fig 14 shear stress distributions on the parallel wall are relevant to understanding local scour below the cylinder when a cylinder is placed above an erodible boundary with a small gap local scour will happen when the flow induced shear stress exceeds the critical shear stress for sediment transport to quantify the influence of side wall on the shear stress the amplification factor of the shear stress σ 0 is checked where σ 0 is defined as σ 0 τ 0 τ r e f in which τ 0 is the magnitude of the shear stress and τ r e f is the magnitude of reference shear stress in an area far away from the sidewall plane boundary and the cylinder shear stress τ 0 is defined as τ 0 τ x 2 τ z 2 in which τ x μ u y and τ z μ w y are the mean shear stress in the x and z directions respectively and μ is the dynamic viscosity fig 19 shows the contours of σ 0 as well as the streamlines on the parallel wall for g d 0 5 and 0 2 for g d 0 5 in fig 19 a σ 0 underneath the cylinder is obviously higher than the other area this is mainly due to the blockage effect of the cylinder the variation of shear stress in the spanwise direction under the cylinder is clearly due to the existence of hvs at the junction the area influenced by the side wall is roughly about 0 5 x d 1 7 and z d 0 5 similar to the results of g d 0 5 strong shear stress is also observed underneath the cylinder for g d 0 2 the range of end effect is roughly at 0 5 x d 3 and z d 0 7 in fig 19 b to quantify the influence of the side wall the shear stress distributions along a few lines with constant x d values underneath the cylinder are extracted in fig 20 the range of end effect on σ 0 is limited to z d 0 4 for g d 0 5 in fig 20 a and the highest σ 0 is observed at around z d 0 12 which is due to horseshoe vortexes in the junction as for g d 0 2 the range of end effect on σ 0 is limited to z d 0 7 the fluctuations of σ 0 observed between z d 0 3 0 6 are good indications of the complex three dimensionality in the junction area 4 2 influence of reynolds number in the present work the influence of r e d on the flow and the end effect is investigated at r e d 1250 2500 and 5000 with g d 0 5 due to the limitation of computational resources relatively small r e d values are employed baker 1979 presented the relationship between the number of vortexes with the boundary layer thickness and reynolds number but results of the cylinder with a perpendicular wall was however not reported yet case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 respectively were simulated to compare with case2 with r e d 2500 to investigate the influence of r e d on the end effect with a perpendicular wall effect three cases are simulated with g d 0 5 the general observations of averaged iso surfaces of λ 2 for case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 are shown in fig 21 a and b respectively compared with r e d 2500 shown in fig 6 b two hvs were observed for r e d 1250 three hvs for r e d 2500 and only one for r e d 5000 it should be noted that the flow structures in figs 21 and 22 are based on the averaged flow field the variation of the hydrodynamic forces with r e d has been summarized in table 7 c d c l and st are not very sensitive to r e d within the range of r e d investigated this agrees well with the experimental data of lei et al 1999 and yang et al 2018 for hydrodynamic forces for a near wall cylinder in the subcritical regime of r e d the hv system is however totally different as r e d increases from 1250 to 5000 the mean locations of hvs at the plane of y 0 has been presented in fig 22 and table 8 for details comparing with the case of r e d 2500 discussed above two pairs of hvs are observed in front of the cylinder and the locations are 0 92 0 08 and 1 14 0 07 for r e d 1250 which shares the very same locations with hv1 and hv2 of r e d 2500 as r e d increases further to 5000 only one pair of averaged hvs is reported which locates at 1 20 0 05 in the plane of y 0 the instantaneous hv system was then to be checked to quantify the influence of reynolds number probe contours of u velocity in streamwise direction has been given in fig 23 for r e d 1250 and 5000 the same locations with fig 10 at z d 0 06 y 0 with ranging of x d 0 5 2 the stable strips in fig 23 a shows that no oscillation is observed for r e d 1250 in other hand for r e d 5000 in fig 23 b periodical contours prove the existence of oscillations of hvs fig 24 shows the oscillations of hvs for r e d 5000 containing two clockwise rotating vortices hv1 hv2 and a small counter clockwise rotating vortices bav hvs for r e d 1250 is stationary which is corresponding to the laminar steady sub regime in the literature as discussed above hvs for r e d 2500 experienced a oscillating sub regime with three hvs for r e d 5000 an oscillating hv system with four hvs is observed the period of one full oscillation cycle is t 3d u hv1 hv2 and hv3 move toward the cylinder with cv1 keeping stationary cv1 decays gradually and hv1 takes place its location to form a new cv2 hv2 and hv3 take place the previous location further to form a new hv1 and hv2 hv3 appears in the end of the cycle the averaged wake structures in the cylinder wake are presented in fig 25 a and b for case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 correspondingly for the influence of r e d on the end effect at z d 0 01 the topology of h v s is strongly affected by the parallel wall and the asymmetric h v s are observed for three r e d as z d increases to 0 1 hv still has effect on the vortex shedding the same separation bubbles are observed in the front of the cylinder and attached on the parallel wall at the downstream the effect of hv is especially obvious for r e d 1250 for its broadband vortex shape shown in fig 25 b as z d increases further to 1 the end effect has been completely vanished for three r e d fig 27 a and b shows the streamlines at the seabed plane boundary for case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 as well as case2 with r e d 2500 is presented fig 19 a in the upstream of the cylinder the twisted and bended towards to the perpendicular wall streamlines are very similar between case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 2500 the streamlines are observed to parallel in the streamwise direction underneath the cylinder and turn twisted at z d 1 the two separation lines in the downstream are observed for both case2 and case5 at x d 1 6 and 2 4 while only one is observed for case4 with r e d 1250 at x d 2 the separation line at x d 2 4 for case5 shows the same attached vortexes as case2 in fig 25 b the same hv1 hv2 and hv3 for z d 1 are presented in fig 25 b3 r e d influences the flow structure in the wake and leads to different vortex shedding as r e d increases pressure gradient φ is applied to quantify the extent of end effect in the influence of reynolds number in fig 26 the extent of the end effect decreases with r e d and is limited at z d 0 4 0 35 and 0 25 for r e d 1250 2500 and 5000 correspondingly the amplification factor of shear stress σ 0 is also employed in fig 28 with very similar extend of end effect as shown in fig 26 the contour of the magnitude of the shear stress τ 0 at the plane boundary for case4 and case5 with r e d 1250 and 5000 are shown in fig 27 a and b for case4 with r e d 1250 in fig 27 a high τ 0 area is located beneath the cylinder and the range of the effect of hv s at the junction end is around 0 5 x d 1 7 and z d 0 5 which is very close to the range for case2 with r e d 2500 in fig 19 a as r e d increases to 5000 the distribution of τ 0 on the seabed plane boundary changes much in fig 27 b the effect of hv s at the junction end expands to the range of 0 5 x d 2 2 and z d 0 5 and the high τ 0 in the wake indicates the vortex attached on the seabed plane in fig 25 a3 the amplitude of the magnitude of the shear stress σ 0 for case4 and case5 are presented in fig 28 a and b the highest σ 0 is observed at around z d 0 12 which is independent of r e d σ 0 of case4 with r e d 1250 shows less fluctuated as x d varies in fig 28 a while for case5 with r e d 5000 the high σ 0 induced by the attached vortex increases sharply as x d 0 5 4 3 influence of aspect ratio as another important parameter for the flow around the span and the hvs at the cylinder ends the influence of the aspect ratio l d on the flow and the end effect is examined in this study many studies have been carried out to investigate the influence of l d on hv systems for a single cylinder without the parallel wall sumner and heseltine 2008 rodríguez y domínguez et al 2006 pattenden et al 2005 sumner et al 2004 baker 1979 1980 taniguchi et al 1990 tested with different l d up to l d 5 the largest l d that has been previously studied was l d 6 sahin et al 2007 and sahin and ozturk 2009 the highly 3 d flow characteristics at the junction of the cylinder and end plate has been found in sahin and ozturk 2009 it was found that the presence of the horseshoe vortex system above the bed surface has an elevation of 0 06d in horizontal plane and energetic eddies were observed for increasing the turbulence quantities mass and momentum transfers through piv measurement in the present work three different l d which are 10 20 and 40 are employed for the case with g d 0 5 the influence of l d has been analyzed through case6 and case7 with l d 10 and 20 comparing with case2 with l d 5 the contour of iso surfaces of λ 2 and the streamline and vorticity for the symmetry plane for case6 and case7 has been plotted in fig 29 a and b it can be seen that three hvs are formed in the junction and the center positions are very close for case2 case6 and case7 as shown in fig 6 a and b and fig 21 the hydrodynamic forces for three cases are presented in table 9 the results of three cases have almost same force coefficients which indicates the increasing l d almost has no influence on the end effect fig 29 a and b shows the contour of iso surfaces of λ 2 and the streamline and vorticity for the symmetry plane for l d 10 and 20 the influence of the small aspect ratio can be explained by the influence of the boundary layer in this work as l d 5 the aspect ratio shows minor results on the horseshoe vortex the hydrodynamic forces as well as the averaged positions of hvs in the plane of y 0 are presented in tables 9 and 10 it is seen that they are not sensitive to l d possibly because the minimum l d investigated is too large this is further confirmed by the variation of φ with l d in fig 30 the sectional drag c d s and lift c l s coefficient are plotted in fig 31 the influence range of end effect is limited at z d 0 5 for all three aspect ratios 5 discussion according to the 3 d flow structures as discussed in figs 6 and 7 the laminar hv system experiences a transition from the steady sub regime g d to the oscillating sub regime g d 0 5 and then back to the steady sub regime g d 0 2 the trajectories of the vortex cores during a regular cycle were analyzed as the consequence of the adverse pressure gradients induced by the surface mounted cylinder the separation of the incoming boundary layer and the formation of a separation line on the bottom surface are formed and the reorganization of the above flow structures results in the formation of a system of coherent necklace vortices which is horseshoe vortex system case1 with g d shares the similar features and achieves a symmetrical steady hv system which are also observed by baker 1979 it can be seen that main necklace vortices of the hv system as shown in fig 7 have the same sense of rotation the bottom attached vortices bav as shown in fig 7 is believed to be formed by the main vortices interacting with the plane boundary the dominant mechanism is the upstream boundary layer vorticity in the spanwise direction of the channel as a result of the adverse pressure gradients the main horseshoe vortices originating in the separation region stretch around the cylinder and fold around the upstream part of the cylinder very close to the bottom the sides of the vortex lines become oriented in the streamwise direction with the vorticity being of opposite sense in the two sides legs of the horseshoe vortices however as the existence of the gap ratio the legs of the necklace vortices in the gap side is suppressed the adverse pressure gradients lead the main necklace vortices squeezed merged and weakened resulting in one vortices attached on the parallel wall on the other hand as the influence of g d 0 5 an oscillating hv system is observed hv1 is located closest to the cylinder whilst hv2 and hv3 merges with each other to form a new vortex greco 1990 regarded it as the amalgamating sub regime kirkil and constantinescu 2012 reported that this sub regime was observed in previous experiments and numerical simulations only for very specific flow conditions depending on the characteristic of the incoming boundary layer as shown in fig 11 during the amalgamation process it can be seen that vorticity is extracted from the side of hv3 and then convected over the top of the hv2 into the core of it which indicates that hv3 is adsorbed into hv2 rather than the opposite as the gap ratio further decrease to g d 0 2 in case3 the blockage effect in the gap suppressed the flow structures in the gap which agrees well with results of yang et al 2018 and bearman and zdravkovich 1978 the leg of the horseshoe vortices in the gap is completely blocked to form a luff vortex tube in the spanwise direction the blockage effect weakens the adverse pressure gradient and results in a steady laminar hv system for case influenced by the proximity of the parallel wall the 3 d horseshoe vortex structures formed in the junction area between the cylinder and the side wall contributes to the end effect at the junction through hydrodynamic forces and shear stress with an increase of reynolds number the strong instabilities due to their interactions with the boundary layer above the parallel wall and the shear layer developed on the gap side of the cylinder surface are introduced a four pair oscillating hv system is observed with a merging process of necklace vortices for case5 with r e d 5000 hv1 which is the closet to the cylinder breaks up as it moves towards the cylinder hv3 and hv4 shed from the formation region and then to form a new primary vortex and for case4 with r e d 1250 the instability is weak resulting in a stationary hv system in the investigations of aspect ratio effect the strength of the system as well as the number of vortices are not largely influenced in the range of current aspect ratio l d 5 10 20 which is usually applied in the experiments in water or wind tunnels through hydrodynamic forces and flow structures 6 conclusions in the present work the flow around a circular cylinder in a water channel is simulated through three dimensional large eddy simulations the influence of the side wall on the flow structure is investigated at three gap ratios g d 0 5 and 0 2 three reynolds numbers r e d 1250 2500 and 5000 and three aspect ratios l d 10 20 and 40 the main conclusions from the present work are summarized as follows 1 the 3 d horseshoe vortex structures formed in the junction area between the cylinder and the side wall are strongly affected by the proximity of the parallel wall the vortex tubes on the gap side between the cylinder and the parallel wall are squeezed merged and weakened due to their interactions with the boundary layer above the parallel wall and the shear layer developed on the gap side of the cylinder surface the vortex tubes move closer to the cylinder as g d is reduced and a luff vortex tube is formed along the spanwise direction 2 the extent of the end effect is examined by a number of quantities such as pressure distribution on the cylinder surface and shear stress on the parallel wall it is found that the extent of the end effect is not sensitive to gap ratio reynolds number and the aspect ratio within the parameter ranges studied the end effect is largely contained within 0 7d from the side wall credit authorship contribution statement fan yang conceptualization methodology software writing original draft zhongbing zhou software visualization

21491,an artificial neural network is developed to estimate the wave conditions within a port efficiently wave motions within the harbor subject to incident waves with varying combinations of offshore parameters i e significant wave height peak period and peak direction are simulated using the boussinesq type wave model to obtain a pre calculated dataset the outputs of the network are significant wave height and low frequency wave height within the port the neural network is trained on the dataset to ensure that efficient estimations for unknown cases with incident parameters similar to those in the pre calculated cases can be provided this is done to avoid the high computational cost of the wave model during real time prediction a k fold cross validation method is utilized to determine the optimum network among a variety of architectures as a first verification step the statistical results show that the network performs well when estimating unknown cases that are not included in the training process subsequently the network is successfully validated against the observed in situ data proving the reliability of both the wave model and neural networks once the forecasting of offshore wave parameters is provided the wave conditions within the port can be estimated quickly to realize the real time prediction keywords wave estimation low frequency waves harbor oscillations funwave tvd artificial neural network wave observation 1 introduction an efficient and reliable wave estimation method is vital for coastal engineering such as improvement on port operation schedules choi et al 2019 maximization of wave power extraction of a wave energy converter fusco and ringwood 2013 li and gao 2020 and prevention of structural damage of offshore fish cages zhao et al 2019 the prediction of wave conditions within a port is of crucial importance in order to control and regulate port operations moored ships especially should be moved to safer locations to avoid serious damage when severe wave conditions within the port are predicted additionally low frequency i e 1 400 1 30 hz waves usually generated through the nonlinear interaction of short wave groups are possibly the most common factor responsible for generating harbor oscillations gao et al 2016 2018 these oscillations in turn result in detrimental effects on harbor operation and vessel movement sakakibara and kubo 2008 kwak and pyun 2013 lopez and iglesias 2014 kumar et al 2016 accordingly low frequency waves should be included as an output of a wave estimation method the technique of wave modeling in the open sea has been well developed and applied extensively for wave forecasting in nearshore regions rogers et al 2007 sandhya et al 2014 most of these techniques are based on the third generation phase averaged spectral models such as wam monbaliu et al 2000 swan booij et al 1999 and wavewatch ⅲ tolman 2016 the efficiency and robustness of these models have been fully proved and it is expected that these spectral models can provide a reliable prediction for offshore short waves outside a port however the short waves within a port cannot be simulated accurately using these spectral models because wave diffraction and phase sensitive reflections are not considered well moreover spectral models are not designed to take account of the generation of low frequency waves the phase resolving boussinesq type model has become a crucial tool for performing simulations relating to wave refraction and diffraction nonlinear interactions of waves wave breaking and wave induced currents kirby 2016 one such model is the open source software funwave tvd that was developed by shi et al 2012 and has been applied extensively in a multitude of engineering problems the applications include wave prediction in a port choi et al 2019 harbor oscillation simulations gao et al 2017a 2019c tsunami modeling grilli et al 2017 gao et al 2019a and focused waves simulation gao et al 2020 overall the funwave tvd model is often associated with high computational costs owing to its phase resolving nature and the relatively large number of grids required to simulate short waves well the computational time of the funwave tvd model e g several hours for one case is generally acceptable for scientific investigations because the parallel computing technique of message passing interface mpi is utilized however the same is unacceptable for the real time wave forecasting at a harbor scale as nearly one hundred cases may be run in one day for the future waves of the next couple of days it is thus useful to develop and apply another technique to avoid the substantial computational cost associated with the funwave tvd model during real time prediction artificial neural network ann models have been used extensively in coastal and ocean engineering in recent years their application to engineering problems have been well documented such as the estimation of ocean wave conditions in coastal regions browne et al 2007 james et al 2018 estimation of low frequency wave energy in harbors lopez and iglesias 2013 prediction of structural stress and deformation of fish cages zhao et al 2019 improvement of port operability assessments kankal and yüksek 2012 lópez et al 2015 real time prediction of future waves for improving energy absorption of a wave energy converter li et al 2018 2019 and seasonal changes in beach profiles hashemi et al 2010 inspired by biological neural networks which are closely linked to the human brain ann models are designed to solve complex problems involving multiple factors uncertainties and nonlinearities there exist no task specific rules in ann models given that they learn and generalize using existing data once ann models are trained they can provide predictions extremely fast in this study we attempt to develop an efficient wave estimation method based on the funwave tvd and ann models it is hypothesized that the wave height within a port generally depends on the limited offshore wave parameters such as significant wave height peak period and peak direction the pre calculated dataset is generated using the funwave tvd model which simulates wave motions inside a port subject to incident waves with varying combinations of offshore parameters the neural network is trained based on the aforementioned dataset to ensure that efficient estimations for unknown cases with incident parameters similar to those in pre calculated cases can be provided thereby the high computational cost of the funwave tvd model during real time prediction can be avoided the outputs of the trained network are the total significant wave height and significant low frequency wave height within the harbor once the network has been trained it can estimate the wave conditions within the port efficiently the hambantota port built in 2017 is located along the southeastern sri lankan coastline and directly faces the north indian ocean as seen in fig 1 it is a major seaport in sri lanka playing a vital role in the international routes between asia and europe low frequency waves have been observed in the hambantota port that has resulted in disturbances to loading and unloading operations dong et al 2020 this factor led to the hambantota port being selected as the case study for establishing and testing the wave estimation method a considerable number of numerical studies have focused on determining low frequency waves inside a harbor e g dong et al 2010 guerrini et al 2014 diaz hernandez et al 2015 and have provided excellent results however these studies are ineffective during real time prediction applications to the best of the authors knowledge the efficient estimation of low frequency waves inside a harbor has been seldom investigated lopez and iglesias 2013 applied in situ data to train an ann model to estimate the low frequency waves inside a harbor however in spite of their great work this method suffered from poor spatial resolution owing to the limited number of wave sensors therefore useful information was provided only for berths located very close to the sensors in our view the novelty of the present study lies in developing an efficient estimation method for wave conditions within a harbor by a fully nonlinear wave model and artificial neural networks moreover this method provides the spatial characteristics of both short waves and low frequency waves inside the harbor this procedure could also be implemented in any harbor of interest the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the in situ measured wave conditions which are useful in establishing and verifying the wave estimation method in section 3 the setups of the funwave tvd and ann models including the computational grids boundary conditions incident wave parameters and neural architecture are described in detail section 4 presents the results and discussion through which the forecasting method is validated finally the conclusions drawn from this study are outlined in section 5 2 measured wave conditions the in situ measured wave data is useful in establishing and verifying the wave estimation method specifically the input wave parameters of pre calculated cases can be determined using the measured offshore wave data this ensures that the computational cost for unrealistic cases is avoided the output of the estimation method such as the wave heights within the port can be validated against the measured wave data inside the port it is thus indispensable to have an overall understanding of the measured wave conditions within the hambantota port before the establishment of the wave estimation method 2 1 observational setup two nortek acoustic waves and currents awac sensors were set up outside g1 and within g2 the hambantota port as depicted by the white circles in fig 1 using the technique of acoustic surface tracking ast the awac sensors are capable of measuring the direction resolved surface elevation the field observations were collected between 10th july and september 25 2019 data were absent on certain days i e aug 14 15 and aug 16 17 for the sensors located inside and outside the port respectively due to the adjustment of the device the sensor located inside the port collected data at a rate of 20 min per hour at a sampling rate of 4 hz the other sensor located outside the port collected data at a rate of 34 min per hour at a sampling rate of 2 hz additionally the data were inspected to detect spikes and were corrected by applying linear interpolation between the useful data points samples with too many spikes were discarded finally 1778 and 1765 samples were obtained for wave sensors g1 and g2 respectively moreover 1717 samples are under the same time range 2 2 general analysis of the wave measurement the significant wave height and significant low frequency wave height can be calculated using the following equations 1 h x 4 e x where x denotes the various frequency bands e x is the zeroth spectral moment of the x frequency band given by 2 e x f f s f d f where f and f are the lower and upper boundaries of the x frequency band f 0 and f yield the significant wave height namely h s f 1 400 and f 1 30 provide the significant low frequency wave height namely h lf the parameters within and outside the port are distinguished by means of the superscript g1 and g2 e g h s g 2 versus h s g 1 fig 2 illustrates the measured wave rose diagram outside the port the wave direction ranges from 157 5 to 225 furthermore approximately 95 of waves are concentrated in the s ssw direction 180 202 5 and the prevailing wave direction is southward with an occurrence of 60 however the significant wave heights 2 2 m are mainly concentrated in the ssw direction with an occurrence of 12 which is higher than the 2 4 measured in the southward direction fig 3 illustrates the time series of the significant wave heights inside and outside the port it can be seen that the total significant wave height i e h s was remarkably reduced by approximately 80 within the port however the significant low frequency wave height i e h lf with the frequency varying from 1 400 hz to 1 30 hz decreased by approximately 40 within the port h lf varying from 0 021 m to 0 263 m and h s ranging from 0 188 m to 0 565 m were of the same order as stated in dong et al 2020 the sensor g2 located is at the nodal lines where the wave height is minimal in most of low frequency resonant modes it is expected that h lf would be larger at other points such as the corners which would be further demonstrated in this study in summary h lf cannot be neglected inside the port and should be included in the output of the estimation method given that low frequency waves can lead to a response from larger ships that can interrupt port operations 3 models setup 3 1 methodological framework multilayer feed forward neural networks employing the error back propagation algorithm called bp networks hereafter are chosen on account of their generalization capabilities demuth et al 2014 moreover these capabilities have been proven in numerous applications lopez and iglesias 2013 lópez et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in this work the ann model is performed using an in house built neural toolbox in matlab the schematic of the estimation method is illustrated in fig 4 wave motions inside the hambantota port subject to incident waves with varying combinations of offshore parameters i e significant wave height peak period and peak direction are simulated by funwave tvd thereby generating a dataset which includes the training validation and testing sets for the ann models first a variety of ann architectures are proposed and trained using the training set second the validation set is adopted to measure the generalization capability of these architectures and subsequently to determine the optimum architecture third the test set which does not affect the training process provides an independent measure of the performance for the optimum architecture last but not least it is crucial to assess the optimum architecture using the in situ measurement dataset which can reflect the reliability of both the funwave tvd and artificial neural network models 3 2 setups of funwave tvd model this subsection describes the setups of the funwave tvd model including the computational domain numerical setting information relating to the computational cases and output setting the validation of the funwave tvd model is presented in subsection 4 3 against the in situ measured data 3 2 1 computational domain and numerical setting the funwave tvd model setup for the hambantota port is illustrated in fig 5 the computational domain covers an area of 3 76 3 84 km2 after a mesh resolution test in the simulation of irregular waves with peak period below 14 s the grid sizes δx δy 2 5 m are used to get sufficient resolution for short wave components in the other cases with peak period greater than 14 s the grid sizes δx δy 4 m are adopted the internal wave maker theory proposed by wei et al 1999 is used to generate irregular waves that propagate towards the shore the corresponding internal wave maker is located in the south of the computation domain marked by a dashed rectangle in fig 5 to prevent the reflected waves on the open boundaries sponge layers are employed at the offshore and lateral open boundaries indicated by the pink zone in fig 5 to fulfill the partially reflected conditions along the beaches and breakwaters see fig 5 bottom friction type sponge layers are placed in the vicinity of the beaches and breakwaters according to thompson et al 1996 the reflection coefficient is roughly 0 5 for a breakwater with an armor structure and is nearly 0 1 for a natural beach the values of the sponge width and friction coefficient are determined by a couple of pre tests the sketch of wave tank for pre tests is shown in fig 6 the pink zone denotes the friction type sponge where the damping effect of a breakwater on wave motions is applied the two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 is used to calculate the reflection coefficient the case of monochromatic wave with a period of 16 s and an amplitude of 0 3 m is considered as an example the water depth near the breakwater is approximately 10 m and thus uniform h 10 m in the case presented after tests sponge width of 20 m and friction coefficient of 10 0 are adopted the corresponding reflection coefficient is calculated as approximately 0 51 which is close to the target value the snaps of wave motions without and with the breakwater damping are shown in fig 7 it is seen that the bottom friction type sponge layer can damp the reflection well regarding the reflection at the beach as the wavelength becomes shorter due to the reduced water depth when waves propagate onshore the grid resolution is no longer sufficient thereby generating numerical dissipation based on the numerical results the reflection coefficient obtained for the beach is less than 0 1 with consideration of the breakwater damping note that results for the beach is not present for simplicity the sponge width and friction coefficient above are adopted in all numerical cases in this work other specific key numerical settings are briefly described below in general wave breaking is apparent as waves propagate toward the shoals and coastlines in order to treat the wave breaking phenomena the eddy viscosity breaking method kennedy et al 2000 shi et al 2018 is adopted which provided steady solutions in our experiments additionally wave breaking coefficients c brk 1 0 65 and c brk 2 0 35 are used the higher order muscl tvd scheme proposed by erduran et al 2005 is applied to enhance the computational accuracy and stability of the model in the funwave tvd model an adaptive time step is chosen following the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion in which the default courant number c is set to 0 5 however in our previous simulation using the funwave tvd model a smaller grid size resulted in a lower courant number for ensuring numerical stability accordingly the courant number c is set to 0 2 for all cases more details regarding the numerical scheme of the funwave tvd model can be found in shi et al 2016 3 2 2 computational cases the significant wave height and peak period bins adopted in composing the training set are shown in fig 8 attention is paid to areas with a high joint density thereby avoiding impractical combinations such as a small period combined with large wave height and vice versa and reducing the computational time furthermore a higher resolution of wave parameters is provided in areas with a highest joint density for each combination the peak wave direction is set to 155 180 205 220 respectively according to the in situ measured wave rose see fig 2 accordingly a total of 124 numerical cases we obtained to create the training and validation sets moreover table 1 records the wave parameters of the testing set that does not affect the training process and can thus provide an independent measure of the performance of the trained network hence a total of 133 numerical cases exist for multi direction wave simulations the modified jonswap spectrum and the wrapped directional spreading function goda 1999 are used which are expressed as 3 s g f θ s f g θ 4 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 5 g θ 1 2 π 1 π n 1 n exp n σ θ 2 2 cos n θ where f is the wave frequency t p is the spectral peak period σ is the spectral shape parameter and σ 0 07 when f 1 t p otherwise σ 0 09 γ 3 3 is the spectral bandwidth parameter σ θ 9 in degree is the directional parameter β j is defined as 6 β j 0 06238 1 094 0 01915 ln γ 0 23 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 the spectrum is decomposed into 100 frequency and 31 direction bins in which f min 0 02 hz f m ax 0 25 hz and θ m ax θ m in 120 for instance an input multi direction spectrum for funwave tvd modeling is shown in fig 9 the spectrum of numerical results outside the port see fig 1 is compared with the theoretical spectrum in fig 10 where a close agreement can be found between the diagrams generally the jonswap formulation was proposed to describe the wind generated waves with periods less than 20 s hence the spectral density of the input jonswap spectrum at the low frequency range 0 03 hz is minor see fig 10 it has been determined in the literature that the low frequency waves typically 30 s could be driven by short waves typically 20 s longuet higgins and stewart 1960 1962 this mechanism can be considered by funwave tvd thereby increasing the spectral density at the low frequency range therefore at the low frequency range the numerical solution is obviously higher than the theoretical value 3 2 3 output of funwave tvd the output of the funwave tvd model is useful in constructing the dataset for training validating and testing ann architectures for simplicity the funwave tvd model results at specific locations of interest instead of the entire computational domain are considered in the dataset besides the location of the g2 sensor attention is also focused on a total of eleven berth zones within the port according to the plain layout of the hambantota port as seen in fig 11 additionally the zone average h s and h lf in these zones are calculated in conclusion for each case the output of the funwave tvd model includes twelve pairs of h s and h lf each case is run for 5000 s to obtain a long term record after the wave field reaches a steady state the significant wave height h s calculated using the funwave tvd model is used 7 h s 4 m 0 m 0 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 η 2 d t where t 1 1600 s and t 2 5000 s are applied to all cases based on the time domain analysis of a certain case illustrated in section 4 1 as the duration δt of the steady state is 3400 s the frequency resolution is approximately 0 0003 hz note that for stationary irregular signals the zeroth spectral moment computed using eqs 2 and 7 are identical to obtain significant low frequency wave heights over the entire domain a filter pass module is added to the original code of the funwave tvd model this module can apply a band pass filter to the water surface elevation at different frequency ranges and at every time step using the discrete fourier transform this is done in order to avoid the output of time series information relating to surface elevations at a large number of locations 8 h x x y 4 m x x y m x x y f f t 1 t 2 η x y c o s 2 π f t d t 2 t 1 t 2 η x y s i n 2 π f t d t 2 δ t 2 d f where η x y is the time series of free surface elevation at the location x y x denotes different frequency bands m x is the zeroth spectral moment of the x frequency band at the location x y in the present work f and f are 1 400 hz and 1 30 hz respectively representing the frequency band of the low frequency oscillations and thereby giving the low frequency wave height h lf note that the time step dt is adaptive i e variable and changes according to the cfl criterion 3 3 setups of ann model 3 3 1 general description overall three types of layers are included in a bp network an input layer for sending data to the network a single or additional hidden layer for generating results based on the input and an output layer for providing the results a clear and detailed survey of basic neural network architectures and learning rules can be found in demuth et al 2014 regarding the implementation of ann model readers can refer to matlab for this study only critical steps related to the development of the bp network model are explained as follows for instance a double hidden layer architecture 3 2 3 24 is shown in fig 12 as mentioned above the three input parameters are the offshore significant wave height h s out peak period t p out and peak direction furthermore the target output parameters are the twelve pairs of significant wave heights h s and significant low frequency wave heights h lf inside the port before training it is often useful to scale the inputs and targets such that they always fall within a specified range 1 1 to avoid the adverse effect of the significant difference between the various parameters the normalized values are obtained as 9 x k x k x min x max x min where x min and x m ax are the minimum and maximum values of the parameters the normalized h s out t p out and θ p out propagates in the forward direction from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer at each neuron within hidden layer 1 layer 2 and the output layer the output x j is calculated 10 x j lay 1 f i 1 3 w i j lay 1 x i in a j lay 1 j 1 2 11 x j lay 2 f i 1 2 w i j lay 2 x i lay 1 a j lay 2 j 1 2 3 12 x j out f i 1 3 w i j out x i lay 2 a j o ut j 1 2 24 where w i j and a j are the weights and biases and f is the transfer or activation function note that no interaction of information occurs between neurons within the same layer to describe the nonlinear relationship the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function is applied to the hidden layers 13 f x 2 1 exp 2 x 1 in the output layer a linear transfer function purelin is used 14 f x x after the re normalization operation x j out becomes x j out that is the significant wave height h s and significant low frequency wave height h l f are attained initially all weights and biases are assigned randomly i e the network is untrained and cannot provide appropriate prediction the network is trained using the existing dataset to find the optimum weights and biases the error e is represented by the mean square error mse computed using the normalized output value and target value as follows 15 mse 1 24 n j 1 24 k 1 n x j k out x j k real 2 e where n denotes the number of training samples i e 124 in this work it is seen that e is a function of weights w i j and biases a j error e is utilized to adjust weights and biases of the front layers i e the so called error back propagation using the gradient descent method 16 w i j w i j κ e w i j 17 a j a j κ e a j where w i j and a j denote the updated weights and biases after each iteration κ is the learning rate and is constant of 0 1 in this work the levenberg marquardt algorithm hagan and menhaj 1994 and gradient descent with momentum weight bias learning function are adopted for the back propagation procedure to control the training procedure two parameters are used namely the iteration upper band and the target mse they are 500 and 0 003 respectively in this work once the number of iterations is greater than the iteration upper band or the mse is smaller than the target value the training procedure is stopped moreover the training ceases if the mse ceases to decrease note that readers may refer to matlab for details of setting and running ann model 3 3 2 selection of the neural network architecture the number of hidden layers and neurons has a crucial influence on the results fewer neurons and hidden layers will result in a poorly fit model with low accuracy however too many hidden layers or neurons will render the model exceedingly complex this implies that the network can perform exceedingly well while employing the training set but does not perform as well when exposed to a new dataset i e unknown cases a variety of network architectures with different numbers of hidden layers and neurons per layer are defined and compared to determine the optimum numbers of hidden layers and neurons notably in the present estimation method the data volume is small and the calculation is not overly complicated hence only single hidden layer and double hidden layer architectures are considered the one hidden layer architectures are 3 2 24 3 4 24 3 6 24 3 34 24 and 3 36 24 the two hidden layer architectures are 3 2 3 24 3 3 3 24 3 3 4 24 3 4 4 24 3 4 5 24 3 5 5 24 3 9 10 24 3 10 10 24 3 10 11 24 and 3 11 11 24 for instance a double hidden layer architecture 3 2 3 24 is depicted in fig 12 as mentioned in subsection 3 2 the dataset provided by the funwave tvd model is divided into three parts as seen in fig 13 1 the training set 112 samples used to train the network 2 the validation set 12 samples adopted to measure the network generalization and to halt training when the generalization ceases to improve usually the training set and validation set is referred to as a generalization set 3 test set 9 samples that has no effect on the training and provides an independent measure of network performance after training the mse of the validation set is used to determine the best performing architecture if only one generalization set is adopted only one validation error exists for each architecture to better evaluate an ann model based on the limited number of data samples a cross validation method of the k fold cross validation subtype shao 1993 is applied to the generalization set i e the construction of the training set and validation set the generalization set is randomly divided into k subsets of approximately equal size as seen in fig 13 the training set used to train the network comprises k 1 subsets the remaining set forms the validation set from which the corresponding validation error e v is calculated for each architecture the network is separately trained k times such that each subset is used exactly once for validation finally k validation errors i e e v are obtained and its mean value i e e v is used to represent the generalization capability of a particular architecture by comparing e v for all architectures the best architecture can be selected note that the data volume of this work is small the computational time is less than 1 min regardless of the type of the architecture the computational cost is therefore not considered to determine the best performing architecture subsequently the test set as seen in table 1 is used to assess the performance of the selected optimum architecture 4 results and discussions 4 1 results of funwave tvd a case with parameters h s out 2 0 m t p out 16 s θ p out 180 n is taken as an example to describe the numerical results of funwave tvd in detail such as the water surface evolution and wave height distribution to determine when the sea state can reach full development a short time significant wave height is defined as 18 h s t 4 m 0 t m 0 t 1 800 t 400 t 400 η 2 d t where t greater than 400 s furthermore without assuming a stationary signal the morlet wavelet transform mwt can generate both frequency and time domain information from the time series of the free surface levels dong et al 2008 the water surface elevation short time significant wave height and morlet wavelet spectra at gauge g2 are shown in fig 14 it is seen from fig 14 b that the wave motions has reached full development after t 1600 s in which phase the transient wavelet spectrum changes periodically as seen in fig 14 c fig 15 illustrates several transient snapshots of the wave surface elevation fig 15 a shows that most of the incoming waves are reflected along the breakwaters and only a minority propagate into the harbor through diffraction at the entrance subsequently the diffraction waves turn smaller decrease along their travel path propagating toward the side wall within the harbor as seen in fig 15 b a fully developed wave field at t 1600 s is shown in fig 15 c and d the apparent standing wave patterns are concentrated in the inner basin owing to the fully reflecting condition along the boundaries of the inner basin fig 16 manifests the distributions of wave heights within the hambantota port it is seen from fig 16 a that the significant wave height h s in the mid basin is generally smaller than that at the entrance zone due to wave diffraction however h s at certain locations within the inner basin is found to be higher than that at the entrance zone which may be attributed to the reflection along the boundaries the significant low frequency wave heights h lf seen in fig 16 b are spatially different over the entire harbor basin due to the patterns of the low frequency standing waves by comparing figs 1 and 16 it is found that the low frequency wave height is relatively small at the location of the sensor g2 which is consisent with the investigation of dong et al 2020 investigation of low frequency oscillations within a harbor can be also found in gao et al 2017b and gao et al 2019b 4 2 the optimum architecture and its performance on the test set to determine the optimum network architecture a total of 36 different architectures with one or two hidden layers are compared using the k fold cross validation method with k 10 the average validation error e v of each architecture is shown in fig 17 where significant variations could be found fig 17 a shows that a larger number of neurons do not always result in a smaller error as expected furthermore if the number of neurons is greater than 12 the improvement in network performance due to a larger number of neurons is limited compared with single hidden layer architectures it is seen that error of double hidden layer architecture as seen in fig 17 b is generally lower as they are capable of describing more complicated problems overall the architecture 3 7 8 24 with the lowest e v is considered the best performing architecture the test set see table 1 is used to assess the performance of the optimum architecture in unknown cases the estimated values i e h s g 2 e s t and h lf g 2 e s t and target values i e h s g 2 t a r and h lf g 2 t a r are recorded in table 2 it is seen that the proposed architecture can estimate the significant wave height accurately the total computational time of the test set is over 200 h using the funwave tvd model but less than 1 s using the neural network the extremely low computational cost of the ann model can better realize the real time prediction of waves within the port 4 3 performance of the optimum architecture on the in situ measurement dataset subsection 4 2 demonstrates that the present network i e the architecture 3 7 8 24 can perform well while employing the test set subsequently it is more important to assess the performance of this network using the in situ measured dataset specifically speaking the wave parameters recorded at sensor g1 are input to the network and then the estimated wave conditions inside the port including the location of sensor g2 are obtained the comparison of estimated and observed wave heights is implemented below in addition to the mse the pearson s correlation coefficient is used to measure the linear dependence between the in situ measured data and estimated results 19 r j 1 n x j x y j y j 1 n x j x 2 j 1 n y j y 2 where n is the number of samples of both variables i e 1717 the mean absolute error mae and relative mean absolute error rmae are calculated using 20 mae 1 n j 1 n a b s x j estimated x j target 21 rmae 1 n j 1 n a b s x j estimated x j target x j target 100 the comparison of estimated and target values is shown in fig 18 a and b where a generally good agreement is found between the two sets of values the estimation method can well describe the relationship between the wave conditions within the port and the offshore wave conditions the corresponding scatter diagrams are illustrated in fig 18 c and d statistics of errors and correlation coefficient are provided in table 3 in terms of the relative mean absolute error the method can better estimate h s g 2 relative to h lf g 2 conversely based on the correlation coefficient the estimated results of h lf g 2 are better overall the estimated h s g 2 is a little higher than the target values however though a close trend can be found between the estimated and target h lf g 2 the estimated value is remarkably smaller than the target value especially for the h lf g 2 greater than 0 1 m this phenomenon may result from that the following reasons first the incoming low frequency waves including bound and free long waves may be underestimated by the present simulation as the wave density of the input parametric spectrum at the range i e 1 400 1 30 hz is small second the observed spectra outside the port is found to be multi peak sometimes which are different from the present jonswap spectrum third it is known that the directional spread has an evident influence on the bound low frequency wave height bowers 1992 the present directional spreading function may be not well consistent with the observation appropriate modification of the input spectrum probably improve the prediction of the low frequency wave height this constitutes ongoing research in summary the optimum network performs well in estimating the in situ measurement dataset demonstrating the reliability of both funwave tvd and artificial neural network models 4 4 hindcasting wave condition within the hambantota port during the southwest monsoon 2019 the in situ observation typically suffers from poor spatial resolution due to the limited number of wave sensors and the discrete nature of measurement in the field observation for the hambantota port during the southwest monsoon in 2019 the wave sensor g2 was located at the center of the inner basin and not adjacent to any berth the practical wave condition at berths may be remarkably different from the results of the g2 sensor due to the standing wave patterns however the water surface elevations at the berth zones were not measured which makes hindcasting essential the hindcasting wave heights at various berths are obtained using the aforementioned wave estimation method and the measured offshore wave parameters fig 19 illustrates the hindcasting significant wave heights at berth zones 1 11 see fig 11 which provides a spatial characteristic of the wave condition along the berths in general the average h s at berths 1 7 in the inner basin is higher than wave heights at berths 8 11 in the mid basin which may be attributed to the fully reflecting condition along the boundaries of the inner basin however it is notable that the distribution of the average h lf is spatially different which result from the patterns of low frequency standing waves see fig 16 b the berth zones 2 5 and 9 which are near the anti nodal zones have the larger h l f while h l f at berth zones 1 6 and 8 which are near the nodal zones are significantly smaller 5 conclusion in this study an artificial neural network is developed to efficiently estimate the wave conditions within the hambantota port as this is of paramount importance for port management wave motions within the hambantota port subject to varying combinations of incident wave parameters i e significant wave height peak period and peak direction are simulated using funwave tvd with a high resolution grid the multilayer feed forward back propagation neural networks are utilized and trained based on pre calculated results to provide efficient estimations for unknown cases with incident parameters similar to those in the pre calculated cases this ensures that the high computational cost of funwave tvd in real time forecasting is avoided the outputs of the trained network are the total significant wave height and significant low frequency wave height within the harbor e g berth zones to determine the optimum network architecture from among various network architectures with different numbers of hidden layers and neurons per layer the k fold cross validation method is implemented a total of 36 architectures are trained and the corresponding average validation errors mse are computed the network with the lowest average validation error is selected as the optimum one subsequently the optimum network is applied on the test set i e unknown cases that are not considered in the training process the statistical results show that the network performs well in estimating the test set demonstrating the excellent generalization capability of this network the trained network is further validated against the observed in situ data statistical results indicate that the wave estimation method can well produce the observed wave heights which proves the reliability of both funwave tvd and artificial neural network models once the forecasting of offshore wave parameters is provided the wave conditions within the port can be estimated quickly to realize the real time prediction it is noteworthy that the procedure can be implemented in any harbor of interest in the event that wave sensors are employed outside the harbor the wave parameters measured can be used in the estimation method to realize real time estimation however the wave sensor cannot predict future waves which is vital for improving schedules of harbor operation based on the wind field data released in the internet spectral model such as wavewatch ⅲ can predict future waves outside the harbor for the next couple of days thereby realizing the prediction of wave conditions within the port lastly it is worth noting that there might be a couple of methods except ann can be used to estimate the unknown cases through the pre calculated dataset further effort may be devoted to study another useful method in the future credit authorship contribution statement

21491,an artificial neural network is developed to estimate the wave conditions within a port efficiently wave motions within the harbor subject to incident waves with varying combinations of offshore parameters i e significant wave height peak period and peak direction are simulated using the boussinesq type wave model to obtain a pre calculated dataset the outputs of the network are significant wave height and low frequency wave height within the port the neural network is trained on the dataset to ensure that efficient estimations for unknown cases with incident parameters similar to those in the pre calculated cases can be provided this is done to avoid the high computational cost of the wave model during real time prediction a k fold cross validation method is utilized to determine the optimum network among a variety of architectures as a first verification step the statistical results show that the network performs well when estimating unknown cases that are not included in the training process subsequently the network is successfully validated against the observed in situ data proving the reliability of both the wave model and neural networks once the forecasting of offshore wave parameters is provided the wave conditions within the port can be estimated quickly to realize the real time prediction keywords wave estimation low frequency waves harbor oscillations funwave tvd artificial neural network wave observation 1 introduction an efficient and reliable wave estimation method is vital for coastal engineering such as improvement on port operation schedules choi et al 2019 maximization of wave power extraction of a wave energy converter fusco and ringwood 2013 li and gao 2020 and prevention of structural damage of offshore fish cages zhao et al 2019 the prediction of wave conditions within a port is of crucial importance in order to control and regulate port operations moored ships especially should be moved to safer locations to avoid serious damage when severe wave conditions within the port are predicted additionally low frequency i e 1 400 1 30 hz waves usually generated through the nonlinear interaction of short wave groups are possibly the most common factor responsible for generating harbor oscillations gao et al 2016 2018 these oscillations in turn result in detrimental effects on harbor operation and vessel movement sakakibara and kubo 2008 kwak and pyun 2013 lopez and iglesias 2014 kumar et al 2016 accordingly low frequency waves should be included as an output of a wave estimation method the technique of wave modeling in the open sea has been well developed and applied extensively for wave forecasting in nearshore regions rogers et al 2007 sandhya et al 2014 most of these techniques are based on the third generation phase averaged spectral models such as wam monbaliu et al 2000 swan booij et al 1999 and wavewatch ⅲ tolman 2016 the efficiency and robustness of these models have been fully proved and it is expected that these spectral models can provide a reliable prediction for offshore short waves outside a port however the short waves within a port cannot be simulated accurately using these spectral models because wave diffraction and phase sensitive reflections are not considered well moreover spectral models are not designed to take account of the generation of low frequency waves the phase resolving boussinesq type model has become a crucial tool for performing simulations relating to wave refraction and diffraction nonlinear interactions of waves wave breaking and wave induced currents kirby 2016 one such model is the open source software funwave tvd that was developed by shi et al 2012 and has been applied extensively in a multitude of engineering problems the applications include wave prediction in a port choi et al 2019 harbor oscillation simulations gao et al 2017a 2019c tsunami modeling grilli et al 2017 gao et al 2019a and focused waves simulation gao et al 2020 overall the funwave tvd model is often associated with high computational costs owing to its phase resolving nature and the relatively large number of grids required to simulate short waves well the computational time of the funwave tvd model e g several hours for one case is generally acceptable for scientific investigations because the parallel computing technique of message passing interface mpi is utilized however the same is unacceptable for the real time wave forecasting at a harbor scale as nearly one hundred cases may be run in one day for the future waves of the next couple of days it is thus useful to develop and apply another technique to avoid the substantial computational cost associated with the funwave tvd model during real time prediction artificial neural network ann models have been used extensively in coastal and ocean engineering in recent years their application to engineering problems have been well documented such as the estimation of ocean wave conditions in coastal regions browne et al 2007 james et al 2018 estimation of low frequency wave energy in harbors lopez and iglesias 2013 prediction of structural stress and deformation of fish cages zhao et al 2019 improvement of port operability assessments kankal and yüksek 2012 lópez et al 2015 real time prediction of future waves for improving energy absorption of a wave energy converter li et al 2018 2019 and seasonal changes in beach profiles hashemi et al 2010 inspired by biological neural networks which are closely linked to the human brain ann models are designed to solve complex problems involving multiple factors uncertainties and nonlinearities there exist no task specific rules in ann models given that they learn and generalize using existing data once ann models are trained they can provide predictions extremely fast in this study we attempt to develop an efficient wave estimation method based on the funwave tvd and ann models it is hypothesized that the wave height within a port generally depends on the limited offshore wave parameters such as significant wave height peak period and peak direction the pre calculated dataset is generated using the funwave tvd model which simulates wave motions inside a port subject to incident waves with varying combinations of offshore parameters the neural network is trained based on the aforementioned dataset to ensure that efficient estimations for unknown cases with incident parameters similar to those in pre calculated cases can be provided thereby the high computational cost of the funwave tvd model during real time prediction can be avoided the outputs of the trained network are the total significant wave height and significant low frequency wave height within the harbor once the network has been trained it can estimate the wave conditions within the port efficiently the hambantota port built in 2017 is located along the southeastern sri lankan coastline and directly faces the north indian ocean as seen in fig 1 it is a major seaport in sri lanka playing a vital role in the international routes between asia and europe low frequency waves have been observed in the hambantota port that has resulted in disturbances to loading and unloading operations dong et al 2020 this factor led to the hambantota port being selected as the case study for establishing and testing the wave estimation method a considerable number of numerical studies have focused on determining low frequency waves inside a harbor e g dong et al 2010 guerrini et al 2014 diaz hernandez et al 2015 and have provided excellent results however these studies are ineffective during real time prediction applications to the best of the authors knowledge the efficient estimation of low frequency waves inside a harbor has been seldom investigated lopez and iglesias 2013 applied in situ data to train an ann model to estimate the low frequency waves inside a harbor however in spite of their great work this method suffered from poor spatial resolution owing to the limited number of wave sensors therefore useful information was provided only for berths located very close to the sensors in our view the novelty of the present study lies in developing an efficient estimation method for wave conditions within a harbor by a fully nonlinear wave model and artificial neural networks moreover this method provides the spatial characteristics of both short waves and low frequency waves inside the harbor this procedure could also be implemented in any harbor of interest the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the in situ measured wave conditions which are useful in establishing and verifying the wave estimation method in section 3 the setups of the funwave tvd and ann models including the computational grids boundary conditions incident wave parameters and neural architecture are described in detail section 4 presents the results and discussion through which the forecasting method is validated finally the conclusions drawn from this study are outlined in section 5 2 measured wave conditions the in situ measured wave data is useful in establishing and verifying the wave estimation method specifically the input wave parameters of pre calculated cases can be determined using the measured offshore wave data this ensures that the computational cost for unrealistic cases is avoided the output of the estimation method such as the wave heights within the port can be validated against the measured wave data inside the port it is thus indispensable to have an overall understanding of the measured wave conditions within the hambantota port before the establishment of the wave estimation method 2 1 observational setup two nortek acoustic waves and currents awac sensors were set up outside g1 and within g2 the hambantota port as depicted by the white circles in fig 1 using the technique of acoustic surface tracking ast the awac sensors are capable of measuring the direction resolved surface elevation the field observations were collected between 10th july and september 25 2019 data were absent on certain days i e aug 14 15 and aug 16 17 for the sensors located inside and outside the port respectively due to the adjustment of the device the sensor located inside the port collected data at a rate of 20 min per hour at a sampling rate of 4 hz the other sensor located outside the port collected data at a rate of 34 min per hour at a sampling rate of 2 hz additionally the data were inspected to detect spikes and were corrected by applying linear interpolation between the useful data points samples with too many spikes were discarded finally 1778 and 1765 samples were obtained for wave sensors g1 and g2 respectively moreover 1717 samples are under the same time range 2 2 general analysis of the wave measurement the significant wave height and significant low frequency wave height can be calculated using the following equations 1 h x 4 e x where x denotes the various frequency bands e x is the zeroth spectral moment of the x frequency band given by 2 e x f f s f d f where f and f are the lower and upper boundaries of the x frequency band f 0 and f yield the significant wave height namely h s f 1 400 and f 1 30 provide the significant low frequency wave height namely h lf the parameters within and outside the port are distinguished by means of the superscript g1 and g2 e g h s g 2 versus h s g 1 fig 2 illustrates the measured wave rose diagram outside the port the wave direction ranges from 157 5 to 225 furthermore approximately 95 of waves are concentrated in the s ssw direction 180 202 5 and the prevailing wave direction is southward with an occurrence of 60 however the significant wave heights 2 2 m are mainly concentrated in the ssw direction with an occurrence of 12 which is higher than the 2 4 measured in the southward direction fig 3 illustrates the time series of the significant wave heights inside and outside the port it can be seen that the total significant wave height i e h s was remarkably reduced by approximately 80 within the port however the significant low frequency wave height i e h lf with the frequency varying from 1 400 hz to 1 30 hz decreased by approximately 40 within the port h lf varying from 0 021 m to 0 263 m and h s ranging from 0 188 m to 0 565 m were of the same order as stated in dong et al 2020 the sensor g2 located is at the nodal lines where the wave height is minimal in most of low frequency resonant modes it is expected that h lf would be larger at other points such as the corners which would be further demonstrated in this study in summary h lf cannot be neglected inside the port and should be included in the output of the estimation method given that low frequency waves can lead to a response from larger ships that can interrupt port operations 3 models setup 3 1 methodological framework multilayer feed forward neural networks employing the error back propagation algorithm called bp networks hereafter are chosen on account of their generalization capabilities demuth et al 2014 moreover these capabilities have been proven in numerous applications lopez and iglesias 2013 lópez et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 liu et al 2020 in this work the ann model is performed using an in house built neural toolbox in matlab the schematic of the estimation method is illustrated in fig 4 wave motions inside the hambantota port subject to incident waves with varying combinations of offshore parameters i e significant wave height peak period and peak direction are simulated by funwave tvd thereby generating a dataset which includes the training validation and testing sets for the ann models first a variety of ann architectures are proposed and trained using the training set second the validation set is adopted to measure the generalization capability of these architectures and subsequently to determine the optimum architecture third the test set which does not affect the training process provides an independent measure of the performance for the optimum architecture last but not least it is crucial to assess the optimum architecture using the in situ measurement dataset which can reflect the reliability of both the funwave tvd and artificial neural network models 3 2 setups of funwave tvd model this subsection describes the setups of the funwave tvd model including the computational domain numerical setting information relating to the computational cases and output setting the validation of the funwave tvd model is presented in subsection 4 3 against the in situ measured data 3 2 1 computational domain and numerical setting the funwave tvd model setup for the hambantota port is illustrated in fig 5 the computational domain covers an area of 3 76 3 84 km2 after a mesh resolution test in the simulation of irregular waves with peak period below 14 s the grid sizes δx δy 2 5 m are used to get sufficient resolution for short wave components in the other cases with peak period greater than 14 s the grid sizes δx δy 4 m are adopted the internal wave maker theory proposed by wei et al 1999 is used to generate irregular waves that propagate towards the shore the corresponding internal wave maker is located in the south of the computation domain marked by a dashed rectangle in fig 5 to prevent the reflected waves on the open boundaries sponge layers are employed at the offshore and lateral open boundaries indicated by the pink zone in fig 5 to fulfill the partially reflected conditions along the beaches and breakwaters see fig 5 bottom friction type sponge layers are placed in the vicinity of the beaches and breakwaters according to thompson et al 1996 the reflection coefficient is roughly 0 5 for a breakwater with an armor structure and is nearly 0 1 for a natural beach the values of the sponge width and friction coefficient are determined by a couple of pre tests the sketch of wave tank for pre tests is shown in fig 6 the pink zone denotes the friction type sponge where the damping effect of a breakwater on wave motions is applied the two point method proposed by goda and suzuki 1976 is used to calculate the reflection coefficient the case of monochromatic wave with a period of 16 s and an amplitude of 0 3 m is considered as an example the water depth near the breakwater is approximately 10 m and thus uniform h 10 m in the case presented after tests sponge width of 20 m and friction coefficient of 10 0 are adopted the corresponding reflection coefficient is calculated as approximately 0 51 which is close to the target value the snaps of wave motions without and with the breakwater damping are shown in fig 7 it is seen that the bottom friction type sponge layer can damp the reflection well regarding the reflection at the beach as the wavelength becomes shorter due to the reduced water depth when waves propagate onshore the grid resolution is no longer sufficient thereby generating numerical dissipation based on the numerical results the reflection coefficient obtained for the beach is less than 0 1 with consideration of the breakwater damping note that results for the beach is not present for simplicity the sponge width and friction coefficient above are adopted in all numerical cases in this work other specific key numerical settings are briefly described below in general wave breaking is apparent as waves propagate toward the shoals and coastlines in order to treat the wave breaking phenomena the eddy viscosity breaking method kennedy et al 2000 shi et al 2018 is adopted which provided steady solutions in our experiments additionally wave breaking coefficients c brk 1 0 65 and c brk 2 0 35 are used the higher order muscl tvd scheme proposed by erduran et al 2005 is applied to enhance the computational accuracy and stability of the model in the funwave tvd model an adaptive time step is chosen following the courant friedrichs lewy cfl criterion in which the default courant number c is set to 0 5 however in our previous simulation using the funwave tvd model a smaller grid size resulted in a lower courant number for ensuring numerical stability accordingly the courant number c is set to 0 2 for all cases more details regarding the numerical scheme of the funwave tvd model can be found in shi et al 2016 3 2 2 computational cases the significant wave height and peak period bins adopted in composing the training set are shown in fig 8 attention is paid to areas with a high joint density thereby avoiding impractical combinations such as a small period combined with large wave height and vice versa and reducing the computational time furthermore a higher resolution of wave parameters is provided in areas with a highest joint density for each combination the peak wave direction is set to 155 180 205 220 respectively according to the in situ measured wave rose see fig 2 accordingly a total of 124 numerical cases we obtained to create the training and validation sets moreover table 1 records the wave parameters of the testing set that does not affect the training process and can thus provide an independent measure of the performance of the trained network hence a total of 133 numerical cases exist for multi direction wave simulations the modified jonswap spectrum and the wrapped directional spreading function goda 1999 are used which are expressed as 3 s g f θ s f g θ 4 s f β j h s 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 1 25 t p f 4 γ exp t p f 1 2 2 σ 2 5 g θ 1 2 π 1 π n 1 n exp n σ θ 2 2 cos n θ where f is the wave frequency t p is the spectral peak period σ is the spectral shape parameter and σ 0 07 when f 1 t p otherwise σ 0 09 γ 3 3 is the spectral bandwidth parameter σ θ 9 in degree is the directional parameter β j is defined as 6 β j 0 06238 1 094 0 01915 ln γ 0 23 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 the spectrum is decomposed into 100 frequency and 31 direction bins in which f min 0 02 hz f m ax 0 25 hz and θ m ax θ m in 120 for instance an input multi direction spectrum for funwave tvd modeling is shown in fig 9 the spectrum of numerical results outside the port see fig 1 is compared with the theoretical spectrum in fig 10 where a close agreement can be found between the diagrams generally the jonswap formulation was proposed to describe the wind generated waves with periods less than 20 s hence the spectral density of the input jonswap spectrum at the low frequency range 0 03 hz is minor see fig 10 it has been determined in the literature that the low frequency waves typically 30 s could be driven by short waves typically 20 s longuet higgins and stewart 1960 1962 this mechanism can be considered by funwave tvd thereby increasing the spectral density at the low frequency range therefore at the low frequency range the numerical solution is obviously higher than the theoretical value 3 2 3 output of funwave tvd the output of the funwave tvd model is useful in constructing the dataset for training validating and testing ann architectures for simplicity the funwave tvd model results at specific locations of interest instead of the entire computational domain are considered in the dataset besides the location of the g2 sensor attention is also focused on a total of eleven berth zones within the port according to the plain layout of the hambantota port as seen in fig 11 additionally the zone average h s and h lf in these zones are calculated in conclusion for each case the output of the funwave tvd model includes twelve pairs of h s and h lf each case is run for 5000 s to obtain a long term record after the wave field reaches a steady state the significant wave height h s calculated using the funwave tvd model is used 7 h s 4 m 0 m 0 1 t 2 t 1 t 1 t 2 η 2 d t where t 1 1600 s and t 2 5000 s are applied to all cases based on the time domain analysis of a certain case illustrated in section 4 1 as the duration δt of the steady state is 3400 s the frequency resolution is approximately 0 0003 hz note that for stationary irregular signals the zeroth spectral moment computed using eqs 2 and 7 are identical to obtain significant low frequency wave heights over the entire domain a filter pass module is added to the original code of the funwave tvd model this module can apply a band pass filter to the water surface elevation at different frequency ranges and at every time step using the discrete fourier transform this is done in order to avoid the output of time series information relating to surface elevations at a large number of locations 8 h x x y 4 m x x y m x x y f f t 1 t 2 η x y c o s 2 π f t d t 2 t 1 t 2 η x y s i n 2 π f t d t 2 δ t 2 d f where η x y is the time series of free surface elevation at the location x y x denotes different frequency bands m x is the zeroth spectral moment of the x frequency band at the location x y in the present work f and f are 1 400 hz and 1 30 hz respectively representing the frequency band of the low frequency oscillations and thereby giving the low frequency wave height h lf note that the time step dt is adaptive i e variable and changes according to the cfl criterion 3 3 setups of ann model 3 3 1 general description overall three types of layers are included in a bp network an input layer for sending data to the network a single or additional hidden layer for generating results based on the input and an output layer for providing the results a clear and detailed survey of basic neural network architectures and learning rules can be found in demuth et al 2014 regarding the implementation of ann model readers can refer to matlab for this study only critical steps related to the development of the bp network model are explained as follows for instance a double hidden layer architecture 3 2 3 24 is shown in fig 12 as mentioned above the three input parameters are the offshore significant wave height h s out peak period t p out and peak direction furthermore the target output parameters are the twelve pairs of significant wave heights h s and significant low frequency wave heights h lf inside the port before training it is often useful to scale the inputs and targets such that they always fall within a specified range 1 1 to avoid the adverse effect of the significant difference between the various parameters the normalized values are obtained as 9 x k x k x min x max x min where x min and x m ax are the minimum and maximum values of the parameters the normalized h s out t p out and θ p out propagates in the forward direction from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer at each neuron within hidden layer 1 layer 2 and the output layer the output x j is calculated 10 x j lay 1 f i 1 3 w i j lay 1 x i in a j lay 1 j 1 2 11 x j lay 2 f i 1 2 w i j lay 2 x i lay 1 a j lay 2 j 1 2 3 12 x j out f i 1 3 w i j out x i lay 2 a j o ut j 1 2 24 where w i j and a j are the weights and biases and f is the transfer or activation function note that no interaction of information occurs between neurons within the same layer to describe the nonlinear relationship the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid function is applied to the hidden layers 13 f x 2 1 exp 2 x 1 in the output layer a linear transfer function purelin is used 14 f x x after the re normalization operation x j out becomes x j out that is the significant wave height h s and significant low frequency wave height h l f are attained initially all weights and biases are assigned randomly i e the network is untrained and cannot provide appropriate prediction the network is trained using the existing dataset to find the optimum weights and biases the error e is represented by the mean square error mse computed using the normalized output value and target value as follows 15 mse 1 24 n j 1 24 k 1 n x j k out x j k real 2 e where n denotes the number of training samples i e 124 in this work it is seen that e is a function of weights w i j and biases a j error e is utilized to adjust weights and biases of the front layers i e the so called error back propagation using the gradient descent method 16 w i j w i j κ e w i j 17 a j a j κ e a j where w i j and a j denote the updated weights and biases after each iteration κ is the learning rate and is constant of 0 1 in this work the levenberg marquardt algorithm hagan and menhaj 1994 and gradient descent with momentum weight bias learning function are adopted for the back propagation procedure to control the training procedure two parameters are used namely the iteration upper band and the target mse they are 500 and 0 003 respectively in this work once the number of iterations is greater than the iteration upper band or the mse is smaller than the target value the training procedure is stopped moreover the training ceases if the mse ceases to decrease note that readers may refer to matlab for details of setting and running ann model 3 3 2 selection of the neural network architecture the number of hidden layers and neurons has a crucial influence on the results fewer neurons and hidden layers will result in a poorly fit model with low accuracy however too many hidden layers or neurons will render the model exceedingly complex this implies that the network can perform exceedingly well while employing the training set but does not perform as well when exposed to a new dataset i e unknown cases a variety of network architectures with different numbers of hidden layers and neurons per layer are defined and compared to determine the optimum numbers of hidden layers and neurons notably in the present estimation method the data volume is small and the calculation is not overly complicated hence only single hidden layer and double hidden layer architectures are considered the one hidden layer architectures are 3 2 24 3 4 24 3 6 24 3 34 24 and 3 36 24 the two hidden layer architectures are 3 2 3 24 3 3 3 24 3 3 4 24 3 4 4 24 3 4 5 24 3 5 5 24 3 9 10 24 3 10 10 24 3 10 11 24 and 3 11 11 24 for instance a double hidden layer architecture 3 2 3 24 is depicted in fig 12 as mentioned in subsection 3 2 the dataset provided by the funwave tvd model is divided into three parts as seen in fig 13 1 the training set 112 samples used to train the network 2 the validation set 12 samples adopted to measure the network generalization and to halt training when the generalization ceases to improve usually the training set and validation set is referred to as a generalization set 3 test set 9 samples that has no effect on the training and provides an independent measure of network performance after training the mse of the validation set is used to determine the best performing architecture if only one generalization set is adopted only one validation error exists for each architecture to better evaluate an ann model based on the limited number of data samples a cross validation method of the k fold cross validation subtype shao 1993 is applied to the generalization set i e the construction of the training set and validation set the generalization set is randomly divided into k subsets of approximately equal size as seen in fig 13 the training set used to train the network comprises k 1 subsets the remaining set forms the validation set from which the corresponding validation error e v is calculated for each architecture the network is separately trained k times such that each subset is used exactly once for validation finally k validation errors i e e v are obtained and its mean value i e e v is used to represent the generalization capability of a particular architecture by comparing e v for all architectures the best architecture can be selected note that the data volume of this work is small the computational time is less than 1 min regardless of the type of the architecture the computational cost is therefore not considered to determine the best performing architecture subsequently the test set as seen in table 1 is used to assess the performance of the selected optimum architecture 4 results and discussions 4 1 results of funwave tvd a case with parameters h s out 2 0 m t p out 16 s θ p out 180 n is taken as an example to describe the numerical results of funwave tvd in detail such as the water surface evolution and wave height distribution to determine when the sea state can reach full development a short time significant wave height is defined as 18 h s t 4 m 0 t m 0 t 1 800 t 400 t 400 η 2 d t where t greater than 400 s furthermore without assuming a stationary signal the morlet wavelet transform mwt can generate both frequency and time domain information from the time series of the free surface levels dong et al 2008 the water surface elevation short time significant wave height and morlet wavelet spectra at gauge g2 are shown in fig 14 it is seen from fig 14 b that the wave motions has reached full development after t 1600 s in which phase the transient wavelet spectrum changes periodically as seen in fig 14 c fig 15 illustrates several transient snapshots of the wave surface elevation fig 15 a shows that most of the incoming waves are reflected along the breakwaters and only a minority propagate into the harbor through diffraction at the entrance subsequently the diffraction waves turn smaller decrease along their travel path propagating toward the side wall within the harbor as seen in fig 15 b a fully developed wave field at t 1600 s is shown in fig 15 c and d the apparent standing wave patterns are concentrated in the inner basin owing to the fully reflecting condition along the boundaries of the inner basin fig 16 manifests the distributions of wave heights within the hambantota port it is seen from fig 16 a that the significant wave height h s in the mid basin is generally smaller than that at the entrance zone due to wave diffraction however h s at certain locations within the inner basin is found to be higher than that at the entrance zone which may be attributed to the reflection along the boundaries the significant low frequency wave heights h lf seen in fig 16 b are spatially different over the entire harbor basin due to the patterns of the low frequency standing waves by comparing figs 1 and 16 it is found that the low frequency wave height is relatively small at the location of the sensor g2 which is consisent with the investigation of dong et al 2020 investigation of low frequency oscillations within a harbor can be also found in gao et al 2017b and gao et al 2019b 4 2 the optimum architecture and its performance on the test set to determine the optimum network architecture a total of 36 different architectures with one or two hidden layers are compared using the k fold cross validation method with k 10 the average validation error e v of each architecture is shown in fig 17 where significant variations could be found fig 17 a shows that a larger number of neurons do not always result in a smaller error as expected furthermore if the number of neurons is greater than 12 the improvement in network performance due to a larger number of neurons is limited compared with single hidden layer architectures it is seen that error of double hidden layer architecture as seen in fig 17 b is generally lower as they are capable of describing more complicated problems overall the architecture 3 7 8 24 with the lowest e v is considered the best performing architecture the test set see table 1 is used to assess the performance of the optimum architecture in unknown cases the estimated values i e h s g 2 e s t and h lf g 2 e s t and target values i e h s g 2 t a r and h lf g 2 t a r are recorded in table 2 it is seen that the proposed architecture can estimate the significant wave height accurately the total computational time of the test set is over 200 h using the funwave tvd model but less than 1 s using the neural network the extremely low computational cost of the ann model can better realize the real time prediction of waves within the port 4 3 performance of the optimum architecture on the in situ measurement dataset subsection 4 2 demonstrates that the present network i e the architecture 3 7 8 24 can perform well while employing the test set subsequently it is more important to assess the performance of this network using the in situ measured dataset specifically speaking the wave parameters recorded at sensor g1 are input to the network and then the estimated wave conditions inside the port including the location of sensor g2 are obtained the comparison of estimated and observed wave heights is implemented below in addition to the mse the pearson s correlation coefficient is used to measure the linear dependence between the in situ measured data and estimated results 19 r j 1 n x j x y j y j 1 n x j x 2 j 1 n y j y 2 where n is the number of samples of both variables i e 1717 the mean absolute error mae and relative mean absolute error rmae are calculated using 20 mae 1 n j 1 n a b s x j estimated x j target 21 rmae 1 n j 1 n a b s x j estimated x j target x j target 100 the comparison of estimated and target values is shown in fig 18 a and b where a generally good agreement is found between the two sets of values the estimation method can well describe the relationship between the wave conditions within the port and the offshore wave conditions the corresponding scatter diagrams are illustrated in fig 18 c and d statistics of errors and correlation coefficient are provided in table 3 in terms of the relative mean absolute error the method can better estimate h s g 2 relative to h lf g 2 conversely based on the correlation coefficient the estimated results of h lf g 2 are better overall the estimated h s g 2 is a little higher than the target values however though a close trend can be found between the estimated and target h lf g 2 the estimated value is remarkably smaller than the target value especially for the h lf g 2 greater than 0 1 m this phenomenon may result from that the following reasons first the incoming low frequency waves including bound and free long waves may be underestimated by the present simulation as the wave density of the input parametric spectrum at the range i e 1 400 1 30 hz is small second the observed spectra outside the port is found to be multi peak sometimes which are different from the present jonswap spectrum third it is known that the directional spread has an evident influence on the bound low frequency wave height bowers 1992 the present directional spreading function may be not well consistent with the observation appropriate modification of the input spectrum probably improve the prediction of the low frequency wave height this constitutes ongoing research in summary the optimum network performs well in estimating the in situ measurement dataset demonstrating the reliability of both funwave tvd and artificial neural network models 4 4 hindcasting wave condition within the hambantota port during the southwest monsoon 2019 the in situ observation typically suffers from poor spatial resolution due to the limited number of wave sensors and the discrete nature of measurement in the field observation for the hambantota port during the southwest monsoon in 2019 the wave sensor g2 was located at the center of the inner basin and not adjacent to any berth the practical wave condition at berths may be remarkably different from the results of the g2 sensor due to the standing wave patterns however the water surface elevations at the berth zones were not measured which makes hindcasting essential the hindcasting wave heights at various berths are obtained using the aforementioned wave estimation method and the measured offshore wave parameters fig 19 illustrates the hindcasting significant wave heights at berth zones 1 11 see fig 11 which provides a spatial characteristic of the wave condition along the berths in general the average h s at berths 1 7 in the inner basin is higher than wave heights at berths 8 11 in the mid basin which may be attributed to the fully reflecting condition along the boundaries of the inner basin however it is notable that the distribution of the average h lf is spatially different which result from the patterns of low frequency standing waves see fig 16 b the berth zones 2 5 and 9 which are near the anti nodal zones have the larger h l f while h l f at berth zones 1 6 and 8 which are near the nodal zones are significantly smaller 5 conclusion in this study an artificial neural network is developed to efficiently estimate the wave conditions within the hambantota port as this is of paramount importance for port management wave motions within the hambantota port subject to varying combinations of incident wave parameters i e significant wave height peak period and peak direction are simulated using funwave tvd with a high resolution grid the multilayer feed forward back propagation neural networks are utilized and trained based on pre calculated results to provide efficient estimations for unknown cases with incident parameters similar to those in the pre calculated cases this ensures that the high computational cost of funwave tvd in real time forecasting is avoided the outputs of the trained network are the total significant wave height and significant low frequency wave height within the harbor e g berth zones to determine the optimum network architecture from among various network architectures with different numbers of hidden layers and neurons per layer the k fold cross validation method is implemented a total of 36 architectures are trained and the corresponding average validation errors mse are computed the network with the lowest average validation error is selected as the optimum one subsequently the optimum network is applied on the test set i e unknown cases that are not considered in the training process the statistical results show that the network performs well in estimating the test set demonstrating the excellent generalization capability of this network the trained network is further validated against the observed in situ data statistical results indicate that the wave estimation method can well produce the observed wave heights which proves the reliability of both funwave tvd and artificial neural network models once the forecasting of offshore wave parameters is provided the wave conditions within the port can be estimated quickly to realize the real time prediction it is noteworthy that the procedure can be implemented in any harbor of interest in the event that wave sensors are employed outside the harbor the wave parameters measured can be used in the estimation method to realize real time estimation however the wave sensor cannot predict future waves which is vital for improving schedules of harbor operation based on the wind field data released in the internet spectral model such as wavewatch ⅲ can predict future waves outside the harbor for the next couple of days thereby realizing the prediction of wave conditions within the port lastly it is worth noting that there might be a couple of methods except ann can be used to estimate the unknown cases through the pre calculated dataset further effort may be devoted to study another useful method in the future credit authorship contribution statement

21492,the effect of torpedo shape on its penetration depth and pull out capacity is explored using laboratory scale experiments the study offers a number of useful practical implications for the design of full scale torpedo anchors results demonstrate that the resistance to penetration and extraction of torpedo anchors is strongly affected by their fin design a transparent soil surrogate made of magnesium lithium phyllosilicate mlps was employed to simulate soft marine clay three torpedo models having a length to diameter l d ratio of eight and a similar weight w but different fin length to diameter ratios lf d of zero no fins 2 6 and 5 2 were penetrated vertically at an impact velocity of 4 5 m s it was found that fin length correlated negatively with penetration depth p and positively with the maximum resistance to extraction however the maximum extraction resistance normalized by weight w increased from 2 3 for the case of no fins to 3 1 for short fins and to 3 6 for long fins transparent soils enabled measurement of in situ displacements within the target during penetration and pullout and correlating them to the torpedo behavior soil displacement increases with the increase of penetration depth till full embedment after that displacements remain constant keywords transparent soil laponite rd torpedo fins cohesion anchors marine clay 1 introduction torpedo anchors are often used as moorings for offshore oil production facilities especially in deep waters they are considered a low cost option due to their easy fabrication and installation and little restriction on their use in great water depths medeiros 2002 torpedo anchors consist of a steel pipe filled with scrap metal and or concrete diameters are typically on the order of 0 75 1m and lengths are typically 12 17m mccarron 2011 brandão et al 2006 a torpedo anchor may be with or without fins fins increase stability during falling and penetration li et al 2014 it has been reported that embedment depth decreases when fins are added to the anchors because of the friction between the fins and the surrounding soil however the pullout capacity is reported to increase due to fins o loughlin et al 2004 the embedment depth p depends mainly on the impact velocity torpedo geometry the shear strength of the penetrated soil soil sensitivity and strain rate kim et al 2015b wang et al 2016 p in full scale tests is reported to be in the range of 1 1 2 4 torpedo length l medeiros 2002 brandao et al 2006 additionally the penetration depth was found in several centrifuge tests to depend on clay cohesion and ranged between 1 and 1 7 l hossain et al 2014 2015 pullout resistance of torpedo anchors aka capacity depends on embedment depth and interaction with the surrounding soils which is a function of the anchor shape in most cases the soil consists of soft clay or very loose sand embedment depth of torpedo anchors depends on the shear strength of the penetrated soil as well as the torpedo impact speed which is a function of the falling distance anchor weight and anchor shape the forces acting on the torpedo anchor during penetration and pullout are shown in fig 1 pullout vertical capacity of torpedo anchors in clay is reported to be in the range of 3 5 their weight o loughlin et al 2004 and also 1 to 4 their weight according to richardson et al 2009 and 2 4 to 4 1 their weight according to o beirne et al 2014 thus in general the pullout capacity of torpedo anchors in clay is in a range of one to five times their weight depending on the soil s shear strength in calcareous silt the pullout capacity is reported to be 0 5 to 0 7 times the capacity for kaolin clay hossain et al 2014 for any specific scenario pullout capacity is influenced by the pullout angle at the mudline and reconsolidation of clays or ageing of sands over time in the target soil the pullout capacity decreases with the increase of the inclination angle from zero horizontal to 90 vertical reconsolidation or ageing of the soil around the torpedo increases pullout capacity but this is a slow phenomenon cyclic loading presumably influences the pull out capacity but this requires further investigation few theoretical and numerical studies have been carried on torpedo anchors notably aubeny and shi 2006 carried out numerical simulations of low speed penetration into soft saturated clay and then used comparisons with field data to derive the effective shear strength agreement with direct measurements of shear strength was only approximate probably due to the perfectly plastic nature of the constitutive model employed which inhibited its ability to simulate events occurring during penetration similarly sabetamal et al 2016 compared numerical simulations and centrifuge test results for two cases of torpedo pullout and showed good agreement with the predicted ultimate penetration depth additionally they concluded that the embedment depth of the anchors was a function of the impact velocity the strain rate dependency of the shear strength and the drag resistance the main goal of this research is to isolate and evaluate the effect of fin length on the pullout capacity and the embedment depth of torpedo anchors in soft marine clay validating the failure mechanism between the torpedo anchor and the surrounding soil during pullout is one of the goals of this study to do that a transparent soil surrogate was used to simulate soft marine clay using a transparent soil enables us to observe torpedo anchor movements through both penetration and pullout results from this study can be used to improve numerical simulation of torpedo anchors by comparing experimental and numerical representative particle trajectories within the soil target by using digital image correlation the soil strains around the torpedo shaft and around the fins can be determined 2 experimental setup and image analysis 2 1 torpedoes and accelerator models of torpedo anchors used in this study were made of stainless steel rods with diameter d 19 mm and length l 152 mm thus based on diameter these are roughly 2 scale from actual typical torpedo anchors three models were fabricated with conical heads having interior angles of 60 two had fins and one was without fins the fin lengths were 0 65l 5 2d and 0 325l 2 6d the fins were made from 3 mm thick stainless steel they were glued to the torpedo shafts via grooves that were filled with a strong adhesive all torpedo shafts had threaded chambers in their rear which were closed with cap screws that contained eyelet holes for attaching the pullout thread the chambers permitted maintaining a constant torpedo weight by adding weights to the interior as needed so that the total weight of all torpedo anchors was a constant 350g torpedo anchors penetrated the surrogate soil targets under their own weight after falling 1 80 m six feet under gravity through a vertical muzzle the muzzle consisted of four acrylic rails held in place by seven 3d printed guide blocks the torpedo models and muzzle are shown in figs 2 and 3 the average velocity of impact reported in this study was 4 5 m s impact velocity depends mainly on gravity and the drop height so approximately the impact velocity is the same for all models all torpedoes apparently experienced similar air drag forces which together with a constant height of fall and gravitational acceleration contributed to a constant impact velocity 3 materials magnesium lithium phyllosilicate mlps known commercially as laponite rd hydrated with water and sodium pyrophosphate spp was used to simulate very soft marine clay mlps is a chemical material manufactured by byk additives instruments the refractive index for mlps is 1 336 iskander et al 2015 which is very close to that of water 1 333 wallace and rutherford 2015 studied the geotechnical properties of mlps and they endorsed its use to simulate soft clay especially for marine clays the maximum percent of mlps that can be use with water only to produce a transparent medium is 4 5 by adding spp to water the mlps fraction can be increased from 4 5 to 15 addition of a small amount of spp is believed to cause its negative ions to adsorb to the positive rims of the mlps plates temporarily preventing them from organizing thus decreasing the viscosity and providing the required time for entrapped air to escape before initial mlps coagulation is complete thus addition of spp decreases the internal voids and increases the density of the produced mlps beemer et al 2016 in this study 9 mlps and 0 405 spp were used a 105 rpm mixer was used to prepare the samples first spp was mixed with water and then mlps particles were dispersed inside the mix and mixing continued for 20 min 3 1 experimental chamber a special design for the model chambers was chosen to permit inserting a plane of sparse black sand that forms an embedded plane of seeding particles chen et al 2014 these particles passed a 40 sieve and were retained on a 60 sieve the embedded plane was formed at the center of the chamber such that it vertically intersected the path of torpedoes during penetration fig 3 the embedded plane permitted tracking the speckle pattern formed by the seeding particles and employing digital image correlation dic to determine soil deformations and strains during torpedo penetration and pullout the seeded plane was found to be necessary for achieving good contrast in the captured images under the short exposure times required for dynamic penetration events thus permitting the use of dic model chambers were made from 0 5 inch thick plate acrylic with internal dimension w x l x h 16 cm 16 cm x 47 cm the front and top sides were held in place by screws the other sides were glued three chambers were used in this study and all samples were cast at the same time the models were cast in six steps according to procedures detailed by omidvar et al 2014 as follows 1 the removable front side was taken off the top plate was attached and the bottom half of the chamber filled since the as poured mlps has little or no strength the sample was left for an hour so that the mlps would gain strength to be able to support the seeding particles 2 seeding particles were sprinkled sparsely to form the embedded plane after adding the black seeding particles the sample was left for another hour to make sure that the black particles will remain at the same positions during the casting of the second top half of the sample 3 the second half of the box was filled with mlps 4 the front side was reattached after which the box was rotated 90 so that the embedded plane became vertical 5 the top cover was removed and one inch from the top of each sample was removed and replaced with water 6 models were aged for five weeks to reach the desired shear strength before doing the test 3 2 shear strength of target soil a miniature ball penetrometer mbp developed by ads et al 2020 was employed to measure the undrained shear strength of each sample the ball diameter was 19 mm the ball to shaft cross section area ratio was 10 1 and the penetration rate was 3 8 mm s ball to shaft cross section area and the penetration rate followed recommendations by dejong et al 2010 for full scale insitu ball penetrometers each model was sounded four times seven days after the pullout test and the results are averaged in fig 4 the undrained shear strength was found to increase from about 1 0 kpa close to the tops to about 2 0 kpa at depths of 35 cm 3 3 image acquisition during penetration images of the torpedo were captured using an nac hx5 high speed camera careful alignment of the muzzle and the model ensured that the muzzle was vertical and that the torpedoes would go through the embedded seeded plane the camera framing rate was 2500 s a nikon nikkor lens with a focal length of 50 mm and a maximum aperture of 1 1 2 was attached to the high speed camera the camera was focused on the embedded black particles the model was illuminated indirectly using two 500w lowell tungsten lamps that were directed to a white sheet behind the model lights were adjusted to provide uniform illumination in all parts of the embedded sheet and exposure was adjusted by trial and error to achieve the sharpest possible image during pullout a nikon 3200 camera was employed along with a nikon nikkor lens since test duration is longer that in penetration led lights were used to illuminate the sample to avoid heating the mlps two 75 w spectro led 1144 super bright 5600k continuous i e no flicker lights were directed to a white sheet behind the sample similar to the penetration setup lights and aperture were adjusted by trial and error to achieve sharp uniform illumination of the embedded sheet 3 4 image analysis digital image correlation dic was employed to determine deformations in the target soils during penetration and pullout dic is a pattern matching technique that can be used to compare successive images to determine relative displacements the captured images are divided into a number of interrogation windows in order to determine the spatial distribution of deformation within the image dic employs a correlation function to locate position shifts of successive interrogation window pairs before and after deformation to determine the average displacement between corresponding interrogation windows a simple dic technique was proposed by sadek et al 2003 to measure particles movements inside a transparent soil adaptive cross correlation acc which employs window re sizing and window shifting liu and iskander 2004 was used to reduce the errors associated with conventional dic the main goal of dic was to determine the displacement field including magnitude and direction zero mean normalized sum of squared difference znssd was selected as the optimization criterion for better matching chen et al 2017 dic analysis was carried out using pivview 3c software by using znssd the difference between corresponding integration windows was minimized the initial window size for the penetration process which was selected for this analysis was 96 96 pixels and the final window size was 64 64 pixels with 25 overlap the selection of this window size resulted in calculation of displacement fields on a 48 48 pixel grid equivalent to 0 3d for images of pullout the initial window size was also 96 96 pixels and the final window size was 64 64 pixels with overlap 75 this selection resulted in calculation of the displacement field on a 16 16 pixel grid equivalent to 0 1d vertical and horizontal displacements were obtained for each node at the center of each interrogation window by resolving the dic displacements into their vertical and horizontal components the volumetric and shear strains were calculated depending on the horizontal and vertical displacement for each node by using a constant strain triangle cst element for each of three adjacent integration windows center points and the linear shape function for this cst the displacement matrix for each triangle was calculated using the nodal displacement and the shape function as suggested by onate 2009 next volumetric and shear strains were calculated using the displacement matrix through a plane strain algorithm described in detail by omidvar et al 2014 4 experimental test program 4 1 penetration tests three penetration and three pullout tests were conducted with the anchors shown in fig 2 using fins decreased the penetration depth as shown in fig 5 and table 1 penetration depth decreases with the increase in fin length with the torpedo without fins having the greatest penetration depth the embedment depth decreased by 30 and 7 for torpedoes with long 0 65l and short 0 325l fins respectively this is consistent with field results where the penetration depth of finned torpedoes 0 65 0 70l decreased by 30 35 in comparison to finless torpedoes o loughlin et al 2013 since the final depth of burial normalized by torpedo length p l in these mlps tests is similar to p l for full scale anchors in soft clay the shear strength of mlps in these experiments must be similar to the shear strength of marine clay under actual torpedo impact loads therefore these experiments further substantiate the ability of mlps to simulate the behavior of natural clay previously presented in beemer and aubeny 2012 chini et al 2015 and ads et al 2020 4 2 pullout test setup pullout loads were determined using a load frame consisting of four steel rods two pulleys a load cell and a linear actuator fig 6 before penetration a wire was attached to an eyelet that was attached to the rear of the torpedo anchors after penetration the wire was attached to a load cell that was connected to the linear actuator the use of pulleys permitted reducing the overall height of the test setup the linear actuator moved down to pull out the torpedo with a constant rate of 0 72 mm s the load cell capacity is 222 4 n 50lb and its precision is 0 0022n 0 0005lb the experimental setup is shown in fig 7 5 penetration test results 5 1 motion of the anchors penetration velocity v for anchors decreases with penetration depth as shown in fig 8 the impact velocity was measured in air just before the torpedoes penetrated the target and the average impact velocity was 4 5 m s velocity decreased as torpedoes penetrated the target fig 8 velocity within the soil target was obtained by differentiating the displacement record with respect to time and variations in the observed velocity results from the measurement resolution at 2500 hz not being fast enough to obtain a smooth record of velocity deceleration of torpedoes was influenced by their geometry using fins decreases the penetration velocity with penetration velocity inversely proportional to fin length similar to observations reported by hasanloo et al 2012 note that the force on the torpedo is proportional to dv dt which is equal to v dv dx velocities were obtained by comparing the movement of torpedoes in successive images which contributed to a fair amount of unavoidable scatter nevertheless some clear trends are evident the length of the torpedoes is 8d so over the range 0 to 8d the torpedo experiences increasing submergence at first the force only depends on the shank and then at some point the fins are also engaged in terms of v t the transitions are not distinct between shank only versus shank and the increasing effect of fins however once the models are fully submerged the finned torpedoes clearly have different values of dv dx or dv dt slopes than before full submergence the break in slope for the no fin model is small in comparison to the finned torpedoes for all models after 8d penetration the deceleration slope dv dt is constant within the data resolution deceleration depends on the fin configuration for no fins the slope is 20 m s2 for short fins it is 25 m s2 and for long fins it is 29 m s2 addition of fins helped improve the verticality the installed torpedoes were inclined by 5 1 and 2 for the finless torpedo and torpedoes with short and long fins respectively 5 2 displacement fields during penetration vertical and horizontal displacements were determined from dic incremental displacement fields were determined by analysis of two consecutive images at three depths of penetration 6d 8d and 10d horizontal displacement fields for torpedoes with long fins 0 65 l and short fins 0 325 l are shown in fig 9 the incremental displacements are small for finless torpedoes and are not shown in addition incremental vertical displacements for both torpedoes are shown in fig 10 the displacement can be converted to velocities by dividing by the interframe time 0 4 ms cumulative vertical and horizontal displacements at different levels 3d 6d 9d and 12d are shown in figs 11 and 12 for all torpedoes in general the flow is consistent with incompressible flow it is down in front of the penetrator and up along the sides to form a splash like movement 5 2 1 analysis of incremental horizontal displacement fields the horizontal zone of influence is defined as the region within which horizontal movements can be resolved the extents of the zones of influence in the plane of one of the fin pairs for both fin designs extend to the full width of the test chamber which is 4d from the axis below about 8d which represents full embedment the displacement field in front of the penetrator is effectively constant i e the displacement field moves at the same rate with the torpedo anchor for both fin designs the displacement is outward in the lower part of the anchor and inward in the upper part which is consistent with prior numerical analyses kim et al 2015a however the fin length affects local soil movements near the torpedo differently for the case of the short fin torpedo there are two regions of soil movements one near the nose and the second in front of the fins leaving a region around the shank between the nose and the leading edge of the fins in which the target soil appears stationary in the horizontal direction in the case of long fins the horizontal displacements extended from the nose to the leading edge of the long fins suggesting that the soil moves horizontally as one unit rather than two at depth 8d the maximum incremental horizontal displacement was 0 10 and 0 085 of torpedo diameter for long fins and short fins respectively using large fins increases the horizontal displacements compared to small fins by approximately 15 20 5 2 2 analysis of incremental vertical displacement fields for both fin designs the zones of influence increase during embedment but decrease as the torpedo is brought to rest vertical displacements are downward near and in front of the nose but upward behind the nose and along the fins at depth 8d fully embedded the maximum incremental downward vertical movements away from the torpedo tip were 0 27 d and 0 21 d for the torpedoes with long fins and short fins respectively the maximum upward displacement just in front of the fins was 0 127 d and 0 138 d for the torpedoes with long and short fins respectively this suggests that the effect of the shank penetrating the soil exceeds the effect of the fins and that the net movement is upward this is not surprising since the volume of the fins at full embedment is 39 and 16 of the volume of the shank for long and short fins respectively soil particles move away from the torpedo tip in the case of long fins 25 30 more than for the case of small fins 5 2 3 cumulative displacement fields cumulative vertical displacements are shown in fig 11 for all three torpedoes at a number of fixed planes of interest poi chosen at depths 3d 6d 9d and 12d and for the torpedo penetration depths of 2d 4d 6d 8d 10d and 12d from the figures displacement is downward in front of torpedoes up till the point when the torpedoes intersects with the plane of interest deformation is upward after the torpedoes pass a given plane the zone of influence zoi scaled by torpedo diameter is 1 5d on one side and 2 5d on the other side for the case of the torpedo without fins owing to minor misalignment the total width of the zoi for the torpedo without fins is approximately 4d for the case of finned torpedoes the zoi extended for more than 3d from the torpedo center from each side the elastic compression behavior of the material governed the vertical displacement before the torpedo approached the poi vertical displacements were downward and continued to increase at the torpedo centerline after the torpedo penetrated the poi away from the centerline displacements were negligible before penetrating the poi but were upward after the torpedo penetrated it upward movements were typically larger than downward movements the maximum vertical displacement usually occurred upward behind the torpedo nose after penetrating the poi at a horizontal distance approximately 2d from the penetration centerline for example at full embedment depth 8d and poi at depth of 9d the maximum vertical displacements were an upward 1 03 d 1 55 d and 2 15 d for the finless torpedo and the torpedoes with short and long fins respectively using fins increased the upward vertical displacement by approximately 50 100 of that for the finless torpedo cumulative horizontal displacements are shown in fig 12 for all three torpedoes at a number of pois chosen at depths 3d 6d 9d and 12d and for the torpedo penetration depths of 2d 4d 6d 8d 10d and 12d horizontal displacements increased as the torpedo approached the poi and continued to increase with depth after penetration maximum horizontal displacements occurred at a distance of 1 2 d from the penetration centerline at full embedment depth 8d and a poi of 9d the maximum horizontal displacements were 0 43 d 0 89 d and 0 98 d for the finless torpedo and torpedoes with short and long fins respectively using fins increased the horizontal displacements by 100 130 relative to the finless torpedo 5 3 particle trajectories particle trajectories are useful for comprehensive understanding of the particle movements and that can be used to improve numerical simulations in this study particles were traced at three levels located at depths 3d 6d and 9d at each depth three particles located at three horizontal distances from the centerline at 0 5d 1d and 2d were tracked total 9 particles complete trajectories were traced as the torpedoes moved from the surface to a depth of 2d 4d 6d 8d 10d and 12d fig 13 consistent with the displacement analysis the results show that particles closest to the torpedo move downward before the torpedo reaches their level but move upwards after torpedoes penetrate the monitoring level as expected particle movements were greatest for torpedoes with fins suggesting that fins cause soil disturbance significant soil displacements were observed for finned torpedoes at a distance of 2d from the centerline however movements were absent for the finless torpedoes at the same distance at a distance of 1d from the centerline all finned and finless torpedoes resulted in significant soil movements and the movements increased with the length of the fins the extent of the observed movements is undoubtedly related to the shear strength of the target soils considering the weak strength of mlps it is believed that these zones represent lower bounds of movement isochrones that can be anticipated during torpedo penetration in natural soils 5 4 shear strain the incremental shear strain for torpedoes with long and short fins is shown in fig 14 for penetration depths 6d 8d and 10d with the maximum values near the torpedo being approximately 0 01 of physical interest is the shear strain rate which is computed by dividing by the camera inter frame time strain rate in front of the torpedo tip decreases with the increase of penetration depth since the torpedo slows down for torpedoes with long fins the maximum shear strain rate was about 33 s for torpedo with short fins the maximum shear strain rate was about 25 s this result is in agreement with that reported by kim et al 2015b that reducing the distance between the fins end the torpedo nose increases the strain rate due to the interaction with end bearing failure in general the increase in the shear strain rates increases soil undrained shear strengths we note that according the rate dependence of mlps discussed by ads et al 2020 strain rates in this range will result in increased strength relative to a reference value at 0 2 s by about 30 dimensional arguments suggest that strain rate should be inversely proportional to scale hence shear strength should be higher in these subscale experiments than in full scale events the effect however cannot be quantified at this time since the strain rate is far from uniform 6 pullout test results 6 1 effect of fins on pullout capacity using long fins decreases the penetration depth table 2 but on the other hand it increases the pullout capacity table 3 as shown in fig 15 the load increases rapidly at the beginning during the pullout however post peak load decreases at a smaller rate possibly due to the decrease in the shear strength of the mobilized soil which is manifested as a reduction in the reverse end bearing it is believed the peak load coincides soil failure in reverse end bearing and this is consistent with wang et al 2018 observations the maximum pullout capacity was 12 2n 10 5n and 7 9 n for torpedoes with long fins short fins and without fins in other words using short fins increases capacity relative to the finless torpedo by 33 while using long fins increases it by 58 note that the submerged weight of these anchors is 2 9n thus the efficiency of the most effective anchor defined as load divided by weight was 4 2 these capacities normalized by weight w 350 g increased from 2 3 for the case of no fins to 3 1 for short fins and to 3 6 for long fins the buoyant weight captured at the end of each pullout test is different owing to the fact that different amounts of soil were attached to the rear of the torpedoes the torpedo with no fins arrives at the surface after a displacement of 17d where d is the shank diameter there is no visible effect on the pullout load trend as the rear of the torpedo breaks the surface this is consistent with the hypothesis that the reverse end bearing stress is not a large factor in the pullout resistance especially for the finless torpedo this differs from the behavior of the anchors with fins which pull out at 14d for short fins and 8d for long fins apparently the extra surface area of the fin faces does make a significant contribution to the reverse end bearing resistance the cross sectional area encompassed by the fins is approximately 4 times that encompassed by the shank however four fins are not able to support all the soil so the contribution is less than what would be expected had the fins engaged all the soil in reverse bearing capacity once the upper end has pulled out the resistance for the torpedo with short fins is less than the torpedo with no fins for the torpedo with short fins the lower edge of the fins emerges from the surface at 18d at that point the resistance seems to level off to a value similar to that of the torpedo with no fins at about 4n which is only slightly more than the weight suggesting there is little frictional resistance at this point all of the three torpedoes have approximately the same behavior before reaching maximum pullout load but after the maximum the load decreases more rapidly for the torpedo with large fins than the others increasing the length of fins from 0 325l to 0 65l increases pullout capacity by approximately 20 the failure happened at a normalized pullout distance approximately equal to 2 3d for both torpedoes with long and short fins while for the torpedo without fins failure is at a normalized pullout distance approximately equal to 2d 6 2 displacement fields at failure vertical and horizontal incremental displacements for torpedoes at failure are shown in fig 16 these displacements have occurred during the interval that the torpedo itself moved up about 2 8d there are several significant features in the vertical displacement results 1 there are regions of upward displacement both at the top and bottom of the anchor the upward movement below the torpedo may imply that there is a suction as the torpedo pulls away from the soil in which it is embedded the existence of suction is also consistent with the direction of horizontal displacement which is inward directed along the tip the entrainment of soil behind the tip could result in additional shear stress however it does not imply added mass since the peak vertical displacement is much less than the displacement of the torpedo itself over the measurement interval in the case of fins there is also an extensive region of upward displacement behind the torpedo which is consistent with a large role of the reverse bearing stress surprisingly the displacement is still downward along the shaft even though the torpedo is moving up at this time moreover the magnitude of the displacement along the shaft increases markedly for positions more than about 4d above the tip which may influence the torpedo with short fins much more than the torpedo with long fins the downward displacement along the shaft could be caused by flow into the low pressure region below the tip in any event it is not fin related since it also occurs along the torpedo without fins using fins increases the influence zone around the fins the influence zone extended to 4 2d 3 2d and 2 6d for torpedoes with long fins with short fins and without fins respectively 7 practical implications for the design of torpedoed anchors although this study is based on small scale tests it offers a number of useful practical implications for the design of full scale torpedo anchors first use of fins increases the vertical stability during penetration which is typically desirable second the terminal depth of penetration decreases with the increase of the fins length the longer the fins are the shallowest the penetration depth third the pullout capacity increases with the increase of the fins length despite the reduced penetration length due to the increase in the reverse end bearing resistance with the extra surface area of the fin faces likely contributing to the observed increase in reverse end bearing resistance for example using a torpedo with 0 75l fins decreases the penetration depth by 30 of that for finless torpedo however it increases the pullout capacity by 50 of that for finless torpedo thus use of long fins is supported by the reported observations 8 limitations the use of mlps transparent surrogate to model the behavior of very soft clay offers many advantages in visualizing soil structure interactions at the same time the technique introduces a number of limitations as follows the effect of gravity is not scaled appropriately due to the 1g nature of the model however the strength of clays is generally less dependent on scaling of the gravitational field than sands small scale laboratory tests have a great effect on results in granular materials but there is a limited effect in case of cohesive soils shin et al 1993 and meyerhof 1983 therefore for very soft clay it is believed that the effect of the scale is limited the size of the chamber was limited to maintain sample transparency which may contribute to some minor boundary effects on the projectiles during penetration or pullout 9 conclusions models of transparent synthetic soft marine clay were used to explore the effect of fin length on penetration and pullout of torpedo anchors use of transparent soils and dic provides quantitative measurements of local soil conditions around the anchors which permits exploring the zone of influence zoi during penetration the width of the zoi was 2d from the penetration centerline for finless torpedoes and extended to more than 3d from the centerline for finned torpedoes during pullout soils located 2 3 d above the torpedo played an important role in capacity development incremental movements cumulative displacements particle trajectories and pullout capacities were measured during penetration and pullout there were a number of significant findings 1 using fins decreases the penetration depth due to the increase of the friction force between the fins and the surrounding soils but it increases the 1 pullout capacity and 2 torpedo verticality 2 using fins increased observed vertical cumulative displacements by 50 100 relative to the finless torpedo and increased the horizontal cumulative displacements by 100 130 of that observed for the finless torpedo 3 before penetrating any horizontal plane of interest poi deformations within the soil were largely elastic in nature after torpedoes penetrate the poi irrecoverable deformations propagate in the target soil due to the interaction between the torpedo and its fins with the surrounding soil maximum vertical displacement after penetrating the poi is upward and occurs at a distance of 2d from the torpedo centerline while maximum horizontal displacement occurred at a distance of 1 2d from the torpedo centerline 4 the maximum pullout capacity of finned torpedoes occurs at a pullout distance of 2 3 shank diameters for the marine clay simulant employed in this study the efficiency of these anchors is defined as the peak pull out load normalized by submerged weight the efficiency of finned torpedoes was approximately 130 150 that of the finless torpedo the maximum pullout capacity increases by using fins and increases with increase of fin length the maximum observed efficiency was found to be 4 2 for the torpedo with long fins using long fins increases the capacity torpedoes owing to the significant increase in the reverse end bearing resistance and the increase in friction

21492,the effect of torpedo shape on its penetration depth and pull out capacity is explored using laboratory scale experiments the study offers a number of useful practical implications for the design of full scale torpedo anchors results demonstrate that the resistance to penetration and extraction of torpedo anchors is strongly affected by their fin design a transparent soil surrogate made of magnesium lithium phyllosilicate mlps was employed to simulate soft marine clay three torpedo models having a length to diameter l d ratio of eight and a similar weight w but different fin length to diameter ratios lf d of zero no fins 2 6 and 5 2 were penetrated vertically at an impact velocity of 4 5 m s it was found that fin length correlated negatively with penetration depth p and positively with the maximum resistance to extraction however the maximum extraction resistance normalized by weight w increased from 2 3 for the case of no fins to 3 1 for short fins and to 3 6 for long fins transparent soils enabled measurement of in situ displacements within the target during penetration and pullout and correlating them to the torpedo behavior soil displacement increases with the increase of penetration depth till full embedment after that displacements remain constant keywords transparent soil laponite rd torpedo fins cohesion anchors marine clay 1 introduction torpedo anchors are often used as moorings for offshore oil production facilities especially in deep waters they are considered a low cost option due to their easy fabrication and installation and little restriction on their use in great water depths medeiros 2002 torpedo anchors consist of a steel pipe filled with scrap metal and or concrete diameters are typically on the order of 0 75 1m and lengths are typically 12 17m mccarron 2011 brandão et al 2006 a torpedo anchor may be with or without fins fins increase stability during falling and penetration li et al 2014 it has been reported that embedment depth decreases when fins are added to the anchors because of the friction between the fins and the surrounding soil however the pullout capacity is reported to increase due to fins o loughlin et al 2004 the embedment depth p depends mainly on the impact velocity torpedo geometry the shear strength of the penetrated soil soil sensitivity and strain rate kim et al 2015b wang et al 2016 p in full scale tests is reported to be in the range of 1 1 2 4 torpedo length l medeiros 2002 brandao et al 2006 additionally the penetration depth was found in several centrifuge tests to depend on clay cohesion and ranged between 1 and 1 7 l hossain et al 2014 2015 pullout resistance of torpedo anchors aka capacity depends on embedment depth and interaction with the surrounding soils which is a function of the anchor shape in most cases the soil consists of soft clay or very loose sand embedment depth of torpedo anchors depends on the shear strength of the penetrated soil as well as the torpedo impact speed which is a function of the falling distance anchor weight and anchor shape the forces acting on the torpedo anchor during penetration and pullout are shown in fig 1 pullout vertical capacity of torpedo anchors in clay is reported to be in the range of 3 5 their weight o loughlin et al 2004 and also 1 to 4 their weight according to richardson et al 2009 and 2 4 to 4 1 their weight according to o beirne et al 2014 thus in general the pullout capacity of torpedo anchors in clay is in a range of one to five times their weight depending on the soil s shear strength in calcareous silt the pullout capacity is reported to be 0 5 to 0 7 times the capacity for kaolin clay hossain et al 2014 for any specific scenario pullout capacity is influenced by the pullout angle at the mudline and reconsolidation of clays or ageing of sands over time in the target soil the pullout capacity decreases with the increase of the inclination angle from zero horizontal to 90 vertical reconsolidation or ageing of the soil around the torpedo increases pullout capacity but this is a slow phenomenon cyclic loading presumably influences the pull out capacity but this requires further investigation few theoretical and numerical studies have been carried on torpedo anchors notably aubeny and shi 2006 carried out numerical simulations of low speed penetration into soft saturated clay and then used comparisons with field data to derive the effective shear strength agreement with direct measurements of shear strength was only approximate probably due to the perfectly plastic nature of the constitutive model employed which inhibited its ability to simulate events occurring during penetration similarly sabetamal et al 2016 compared numerical simulations and centrifuge test results for two cases of torpedo pullout and showed good agreement with the predicted ultimate penetration depth additionally they concluded that the embedment depth of the anchors was a function of the impact velocity the strain rate dependency of the shear strength and the drag resistance the main goal of this research is to isolate and evaluate the effect of fin length on the pullout capacity and the embedment depth of torpedo anchors in soft marine clay validating the failure mechanism between the torpedo anchor and the surrounding soil during pullout is one of the goals of this study to do that a transparent soil surrogate was used to simulate soft marine clay using a transparent soil enables us to observe torpedo anchor movements through both penetration and pullout results from this study can be used to improve numerical simulation of torpedo anchors by comparing experimental and numerical representative particle trajectories within the soil target by using digital image correlation the soil strains around the torpedo shaft and around the fins can be determined 2 experimental setup and image analysis 2 1 torpedoes and accelerator models of torpedo anchors used in this study were made of stainless steel rods with diameter d 19 mm and length l 152 mm thus based on diameter these are roughly 2 scale from actual typical torpedo anchors three models were fabricated with conical heads having interior angles of 60 two had fins and one was without fins the fin lengths were 0 65l 5 2d and 0 325l 2 6d the fins were made from 3 mm thick stainless steel they were glued to the torpedo shafts via grooves that were filled with a strong adhesive all torpedo shafts had threaded chambers in their rear which were closed with cap screws that contained eyelet holes for attaching the pullout thread the chambers permitted maintaining a constant torpedo weight by adding weights to the interior as needed so that the total weight of all torpedo anchors was a constant 350g torpedo anchors penetrated the surrogate soil targets under their own weight after falling 1 80 m six feet under gravity through a vertical muzzle the muzzle consisted of four acrylic rails held in place by seven 3d printed guide blocks the torpedo models and muzzle are shown in figs 2 and 3 the average velocity of impact reported in this study was 4 5 m s impact velocity depends mainly on gravity and the drop height so approximately the impact velocity is the same for all models all torpedoes apparently experienced similar air drag forces which together with a constant height of fall and gravitational acceleration contributed to a constant impact velocity 3 materials magnesium lithium phyllosilicate mlps known commercially as laponite rd hydrated with water and sodium pyrophosphate spp was used to simulate very soft marine clay mlps is a chemical material manufactured by byk additives instruments the refractive index for mlps is 1 336 iskander et al 2015 which is very close to that of water 1 333 wallace and rutherford 2015 studied the geotechnical properties of mlps and they endorsed its use to simulate soft clay especially for marine clays the maximum percent of mlps that can be use with water only to produce a transparent medium is 4 5 by adding spp to water the mlps fraction can be increased from 4 5 to 15 addition of a small amount of spp is believed to cause its negative ions to adsorb to the positive rims of the mlps plates temporarily preventing them from organizing thus decreasing the viscosity and providing the required time for entrapped air to escape before initial mlps coagulation is complete thus addition of spp decreases the internal voids and increases the density of the produced mlps beemer et al 2016 in this study 9 mlps and 0 405 spp were used a 105 rpm mixer was used to prepare the samples first spp was mixed with water and then mlps particles were dispersed inside the mix and mixing continued for 20 min 3 1 experimental chamber a special design for the model chambers was chosen to permit inserting a plane of sparse black sand that forms an embedded plane of seeding particles chen et al 2014 these particles passed a 40 sieve and were retained on a 60 sieve the embedded plane was formed at the center of the chamber such that it vertically intersected the path of torpedoes during penetration fig 3 the embedded plane permitted tracking the speckle pattern formed by the seeding particles and employing digital image correlation dic to determine soil deformations and strains during torpedo penetration and pullout the seeded plane was found to be necessary for achieving good contrast in the captured images under the short exposure times required for dynamic penetration events thus permitting the use of dic model chambers were made from 0 5 inch thick plate acrylic with internal dimension w x l x h 16 cm 16 cm x 47 cm the front and top sides were held in place by screws the other sides were glued three chambers were used in this study and all samples were cast at the same time the models were cast in six steps according to procedures detailed by omidvar et al 2014 as follows 1 the removable front side was taken off the top plate was attached and the bottom half of the chamber filled since the as poured mlps has little or no strength the sample was left for an hour so that the mlps would gain strength to be able to support the seeding particles 2 seeding particles were sprinkled sparsely to form the embedded plane after adding the black seeding particles the sample was left for another hour to make sure that the black particles will remain at the same positions during the casting of the second top half of the sample 3 the second half of the box was filled with mlps 4 the front side was reattached after which the box was rotated 90 so that the embedded plane became vertical 5 the top cover was removed and one inch from the top of each sample was removed and replaced with water 6 models were aged for five weeks to reach the desired shear strength before doing the test 3 2 shear strength of target soil a miniature ball penetrometer mbp developed by ads et al 2020 was employed to measure the undrained shear strength of each sample the ball diameter was 19 mm the ball to shaft cross section area ratio was 10 1 and the penetration rate was 3 8 mm s ball to shaft cross section area and the penetration rate followed recommendations by dejong et al 2010 for full scale insitu ball penetrometers each model was sounded four times seven days after the pullout test and the results are averaged in fig 4 the undrained shear strength was found to increase from about 1 0 kpa close to the tops to about 2 0 kpa at depths of 35 cm 3 3 image acquisition during penetration images of the torpedo were captured using an nac hx5 high speed camera careful alignment of the muzzle and the model ensured that the muzzle was vertical and that the torpedoes would go through the embedded seeded plane the camera framing rate was 2500 s a nikon nikkor lens with a focal length of 50 mm and a maximum aperture of 1 1 2 was attached to the high speed camera the camera was focused on the embedded black particles the model was illuminated indirectly using two 500w lowell tungsten lamps that were directed to a white sheet behind the model lights were adjusted to provide uniform illumination in all parts of the embedded sheet and exposure was adjusted by trial and error to achieve the sharpest possible image during pullout a nikon 3200 camera was employed along with a nikon nikkor lens since test duration is longer that in penetration led lights were used to illuminate the sample to avoid heating the mlps two 75 w spectro led 1144 super bright 5600k continuous i e no flicker lights were directed to a white sheet behind the sample similar to the penetration setup lights and aperture were adjusted by trial and error to achieve sharp uniform illumination of the embedded sheet 3 4 image analysis digital image correlation dic was employed to determine deformations in the target soils during penetration and pullout dic is a pattern matching technique that can be used to compare successive images to determine relative displacements the captured images are divided into a number of interrogation windows in order to determine the spatial distribution of deformation within the image dic employs a correlation function to locate position shifts of successive interrogation window pairs before and after deformation to determine the average displacement between corresponding interrogation windows a simple dic technique was proposed by sadek et al 2003 to measure particles movements inside a transparent soil adaptive cross correlation acc which employs window re sizing and window shifting liu and iskander 2004 was used to reduce the errors associated with conventional dic the main goal of dic was to determine the displacement field including magnitude and direction zero mean normalized sum of squared difference znssd was selected as the optimization criterion for better matching chen et al 2017 dic analysis was carried out using pivview 3c software by using znssd the difference between corresponding integration windows was minimized the initial window size for the penetration process which was selected for this analysis was 96 96 pixels and the final window size was 64 64 pixels with 25 overlap the selection of this window size resulted in calculation of displacement fields on a 48 48 pixel grid equivalent to 0 3d for images of pullout the initial window size was also 96 96 pixels and the final window size was 64 64 pixels with overlap 75 this selection resulted in calculation of the displacement field on a 16 16 pixel grid equivalent to 0 1d vertical and horizontal displacements were obtained for each node at the center of each interrogation window by resolving the dic displacements into their vertical and horizontal components the volumetric and shear strains were calculated depending on the horizontal and vertical displacement for each node by using a constant strain triangle cst element for each of three adjacent integration windows center points and the linear shape function for this cst the displacement matrix for each triangle was calculated using the nodal displacement and the shape function as suggested by onate 2009 next volumetric and shear strains were calculated using the displacement matrix through a plane strain algorithm described in detail by omidvar et al 2014 4 experimental test program 4 1 penetration tests three penetration and three pullout tests were conducted with the anchors shown in fig 2 using fins decreased the penetration depth as shown in fig 5 and table 1 penetration depth decreases with the increase in fin length with the torpedo without fins having the greatest penetration depth the embedment depth decreased by 30 and 7 for torpedoes with long 0 65l and short 0 325l fins respectively this is consistent with field results where the penetration depth of finned torpedoes 0 65 0 70l decreased by 30 35 in comparison to finless torpedoes o loughlin et al 2013 since the final depth of burial normalized by torpedo length p l in these mlps tests is similar to p l for full scale anchors in soft clay the shear strength of mlps in these experiments must be similar to the shear strength of marine clay under actual torpedo impact loads therefore these experiments further substantiate the ability of mlps to simulate the behavior of natural clay previously presented in beemer and aubeny 2012 chini et al 2015 and ads et al 2020 4 2 pullout test setup pullout loads were determined using a load frame consisting of four steel rods two pulleys a load cell and a linear actuator fig 6 before penetration a wire was attached to an eyelet that was attached to the rear of the torpedo anchors after penetration the wire was attached to a load cell that was connected to the linear actuator the use of pulleys permitted reducing the overall height of the test setup the linear actuator moved down to pull out the torpedo with a constant rate of 0 72 mm s the load cell capacity is 222 4 n 50lb and its precision is 0 0022n 0 0005lb the experimental setup is shown in fig 7 5 penetration test results 5 1 motion of the anchors penetration velocity v for anchors decreases with penetration depth as shown in fig 8 the impact velocity was measured in air just before the torpedoes penetrated the target and the average impact velocity was 4 5 m s velocity decreased as torpedoes penetrated the target fig 8 velocity within the soil target was obtained by differentiating the displacement record with respect to time and variations in the observed velocity results from the measurement resolution at 2500 hz not being fast enough to obtain a smooth record of velocity deceleration of torpedoes was influenced by their geometry using fins decreases the penetration velocity with penetration velocity inversely proportional to fin length similar to observations reported by hasanloo et al 2012 note that the force on the torpedo is proportional to dv dt which is equal to v dv dx velocities were obtained by comparing the movement of torpedoes in successive images which contributed to a fair amount of unavoidable scatter nevertheless some clear trends are evident the length of the torpedoes is 8d so over the range 0 to 8d the torpedo experiences increasing submergence at first the force only depends on the shank and then at some point the fins are also engaged in terms of v t the transitions are not distinct between shank only versus shank and the increasing effect of fins however once the models are fully submerged the finned torpedoes clearly have different values of dv dx or dv dt slopes than before full submergence the break in slope for the no fin model is small in comparison to the finned torpedoes for all models after 8d penetration the deceleration slope dv dt is constant within the data resolution deceleration depends on the fin configuration for no fins the slope is 20 m s2 for short fins it is 25 m s2 and for long fins it is 29 m s2 addition of fins helped improve the verticality the installed torpedoes were inclined by 5 1 and 2 for the finless torpedo and torpedoes with short and long fins respectively 5 2 displacement fields during penetration vertical and horizontal displacements were determined from dic incremental displacement fields were determined by analysis of two consecutive images at three depths of penetration 6d 8d and 10d horizontal displacement fields for torpedoes with long fins 0 65 l and short fins 0 325 l are shown in fig 9 the incremental displacements are small for finless torpedoes and are not shown in addition incremental vertical displacements for both torpedoes are shown in fig 10 the displacement can be converted to velocities by dividing by the interframe time 0 4 ms cumulative vertical and horizontal displacements at different levels 3d 6d 9d and 12d are shown in figs 11 and 12 for all torpedoes in general the flow is consistent with incompressible flow it is down in front of the penetrator and up along the sides to form a splash like movement 5 2 1 analysis of incremental horizontal displacement fields the horizontal zone of influence is defined as the region within which horizontal movements can be resolved the extents of the zones of influence in the plane of one of the fin pairs for both fin designs extend to the full width of the test chamber which is 4d from the axis below about 8d which represents full embedment the displacement field in front of the penetrator is effectively constant i e the displacement field moves at the same rate with the torpedo anchor for both fin designs the displacement is outward in the lower part of the anchor and inward in the upper part which is consistent with prior numerical analyses kim et al 2015a however the fin length affects local soil movements near the torpedo differently for the case of the short fin torpedo there are two regions of soil movements one near the nose and the second in front of the fins leaving a region around the shank between the nose and the leading edge of the fins in which the target soil appears stationary in the horizontal direction in the case of long fins the horizontal displacements extended from the nose to the leading edge of the long fins suggesting that the soil moves horizontally as one unit rather than two at depth 8d the maximum incremental horizontal displacement was 0 10 and 0 085 of torpedo diameter for long fins and short fins respectively using large fins increases the horizontal displacements compared to small fins by approximately 15 20 5 2 2 analysis of incremental vertical displacement fields for both fin designs the zones of influence increase during embedment but decrease as the torpedo is brought to rest vertical displacements are downward near and in front of the nose but upward behind the nose and along the fins at depth 8d fully embedded the maximum incremental downward vertical movements away from the torpedo tip were 0 27 d and 0 21 d for the torpedoes with long fins and short fins respectively the maximum upward displacement just in front of the fins was 0 127 d and 0 138 d for the torpedoes with long and short fins respectively this suggests that the effect of the shank penetrating the soil exceeds the effect of the fins and that the net movement is upward this is not surprising since the volume of the fins at full embedment is 39 and 16 of the volume of the shank for long and short fins respectively soil particles move away from the torpedo tip in the case of long fins 25 30 more than for the case of small fins 5 2 3 cumulative displacement fields cumulative vertical displacements are shown in fig 11 for all three torpedoes at a number of fixed planes of interest poi chosen at depths 3d 6d 9d and 12d and for the torpedo penetration depths of 2d 4d 6d 8d 10d and 12d from the figures displacement is downward in front of torpedoes up till the point when the torpedoes intersects with the plane of interest deformation is upward after the torpedoes pass a given plane the zone of influence zoi scaled by torpedo diameter is 1 5d on one side and 2 5d on the other side for the case of the torpedo without fins owing to minor misalignment the total width of the zoi for the torpedo without fins is approximately 4d for the case of finned torpedoes the zoi extended for more than 3d from the torpedo center from each side the elastic compression behavior of the material governed the vertical displacement before the torpedo approached the poi vertical displacements were downward and continued to increase at the torpedo centerline after the torpedo penetrated the poi away from the centerline displacements were negligible before penetrating the poi but were upward after the torpedo penetrated it upward movements were typically larger than downward movements the maximum vertical displacement usually occurred upward behind the torpedo nose after penetrating the poi at a horizontal distance approximately 2d from the penetration centerline for example at full embedment depth 8d and poi at depth of 9d the maximum vertical displacements were an upward 1 03 d 1 55 d and 2 15 d for the finless torpedo and the torpedoes with short and long fins respectively using fins increased the upward vertical displacement by approximately 50 100 of that for the finless torpedo cumulative horizontal displacements are shown in fig 12 for all three torpedoes at a number of pois chosen at depths 3d 6d 9d and 12d and for the torpedo penetration depths of 2d 4d 6d 8d 10d and 12d horizontal displacements increased as the torpedo approached the poi and continued to increase with depth after penetration maximum horizontal displacements occurred at a distance of 1 2 d from the penetration centerline at full embedment depth 8d and a poi of 9d the maximum horizontal displacements were 0 43 d 0 89 d and 0 98 d for the finless torpedo and torpedoes with short and long fins respectively using fins increased the horizontal displacements by 100 130 relative to the finless torpedo 5 3 particle trajectories particle trajectories are useful for comprehensive understanding of the particle movements and that can be used to improve numerical simulations in this study particles were traced at three levels located at depths 3d 6d and 9d at each depth three particles located at three horizontal distances from the centerline at 0 5d 1d and 2d were tracked total 9 particles complete trajectories were traced as the torpedoes moved from the surface to a depth of 2d 4d 6d 8d 10d and 12d fig 13 consistent with the displacement analysis the results show that particles closest to the torpedo move downward before the torpedo reaches their level but move upwards after torpedoes penetrate the monitoring level as expected particle movements were greatest for torpedoes with fins suggesting that fins cause soil disturbance significant soil displacements were observed for finned torpedoes at a distance of 2d from the centerline however movements were absent for the finless torpedoes at the same distance at a distance of 1d from the centerline all finned and finless torpedoes resulted in significant soil movements and the movements increased with the length of the fins the extent of the observed movements is undoubtedly related to the shear strength of the target soils considering the weak strength of mlps it is believed that these zones represent lower bounds of movement isochrones that can be anticipated during torpedo penetration in natural soils 5 4 shear strain the incremental shear strain for torpedoes with long and short fins is shown in fig 14 for penetration depths 6d 8d and 10d with the maximum values near the torpedo being approximately 0 01 of physical interest is the shear strain rate which is computed by dividing by the camera inter frame time strain rate in front of the torpedo tip decreases with the increase of penetration depth since the torpedo slows down for torpedoes with long fins the maximum shear strain rate was about 33 s for torpedo with short fins the maximum shear strain rate was about 25 s this result is in agreement with that reported by kim et al 2015b that reducing the distance between the fins end the torpedo nose increases the strain rate due to the interaction with end bearing failure in general the increase in the shear strain rates increases soil undrained shear strengths we note that according the rate dependence of mlps discussed by ads et al 2020 strain rates in this range will result in increased strength relative to a reference value at 0 2 s by about 30 dimensional arguments suggest that strain rate should be inversely proportional to scale hence shear strength should be higher in these subscale experiments than in full scale events the effect however cannot be quantified at this time since the strain rate is far from uniform 6 pullout test results 6 1 effect of fins on pullout capacity using long fins decreases the penetration depth table 2 but on the other hand it increases the pullout capacity table 3 as shown in fig 15 the load increases rapidly at the beginning during the pullout however post peak load decreases at a smaller rate possibly due to the decrease in the shear strength of the mobilized soil which is manifested as a reduction in the reverse end bearing it is believed the peak load coincides soil failure in reverse end bearing and this is consistent with wang et al 2018 observations the maximum pullout capacity was 12 2n 10 5n and 7 9 n for torpedoes with long fins short fins and without fins in other words using short fins increases capacity relative to the finless torpedo by 33 while using long fins increases it by 58 note that the submerged weight of these anchors is 2 9n thus the efficiency of the most effective anchor defined as load divided by weight was 4 2 these capacities normalized by weight w 350 g increased from 2 3 for the case of no fins to 3 1 for short fins and to 3 6 for long fins the buoyant weight captured at the end of each pullout test is different owing to the fact that different amounts of soil were attached to the rear of the torpedoes the torpedo with no fins arrives at the surface after a displacement of 17d where d is the shank diameter there is no visible effect on the pullout load trend as the rear of the torpedo breaks the surface this is consistent with the hypothesis that the reverse end bearing stress is not a large factor in the pullout resistance especially for the finless torpedo this differs from the behavior of the anchors with fins which pull out at 14d for short fins and 8d for long fins apparently the extra surface area of the fin faces does make a significant contribution to the reverse end bearing resistance the cross sectional area encompassed by the fins is approximately 4 times that encompassed by the shank however four fins are not able to support all the soil so the contribution is less than what would be expected had the fins engaged all the soil in reverse bearing capacity once the upper end has pulled out the resistance for the torpedo with short fins is less than the torpedo with no fins for the torpedo with short fins the lower edge of the fins emerges from the surface at 18d at that point the resistance seems to level off to a value similar to that of the torpedo with no fins at about 4n which is only slightly more than the weight suggesting there is little frictional resistance at this point all of the three torpedoes have approximately the same behavior before reaching maximum pullout load but after the maximum the load decreases more rapidly for the torpedo with large fins than the others increasing the length of fins from 0 325l to 0 65l increases pullout capacity by approximately 20 the failure happened at a normalized pullout distance approximately equal to 2 3d for both torpedoes with long and short fins while for the torpedo without fins failure is at a normalized pullout distance approximately equal to 2d 6 2 displacement fields at failure vertical and horizontal incremental displacements for torpedoes at failure are shown in fig 16 these displacements have occurred during the interval that the torpedo itself moved up about 2 8d there are several significant features in the vertical displacement results 1 there are regions of upward displacement both at the top and bottom of the anchor the upward movement below the torpedo may imply that there is a suction as the torpedo pulls away from the soil in which it is embedded the existence of suction is also consistent with the direction of horizontal displacement which is inward directed along the tip the entrainment of soil behind the tip could result in additional shear stress however it does not imply added mass since the peak vertical displacement is much less than the displacement of the torpedo itself over the measurement interval in the case of fins there is also an extensive region of upward displacement behind the torpedo which is consistent with a large role of the reverse bearing stress surprisingly the displacement is still downward along the shaft even though the torpedo is moving up at this time moreover the magnitude of the displacement along the shaft increases markedly for positions more than about 4d above the tip which may influence the torpedo with short fins much more than the torpedo with long fins the downward displacement along the shaft could be caused by flow into the low pressure region below the tip in any event it is not fin related since it also occurs along the torpedo without fins using fins increases the influence zone around the fins the influence zone extended to 4 2d 3 2d and 2 6d for torpedoes with long fins with short fins and without fins respectively 7 practical implications for the design of torpedoed anchors although this study is based on small scale tests it offers a number of useful practical implications for the design of full scale torpedo anchors first use of fins increases the vertical stability during penetration which is typically desirable second the terminal depth of penetration decreases with the increase of the fins length the longer the fins are the shallowest the penetration depth third the pullout capacity increases with the increase of the fins length despite the reduced penetration length due to the increase in the reverse end bearing resistance with the extra surface area of the fin faces likely contributing to the observed increase in reverse end bearing resistance for example using a torpedo with 0 75l fins decreases the penetration depth by 30 of that for finless torpedo however it increases the pullout capacity by 50 of that for finless torpedo thus use of long fins is supported by the reported observations 8 limitations the use of mlps transparent surrogate to model the behavior of very soft clay offers many advantages in visualizing soil structure interactions at the same time the technique introduces a number of limitations as follows the effect of gravity is not scaled appropriately due to the 1g nature of the model however the strength of clays is generally less dependent on scaling of the gravitational field than sands small scale laboratory tests have a great effect on results in granular materials but there is a limited effect in case of cohesive soils shin et al 1993 and meyerhof 1983 therefore for very soft clay it is believed that the effect of the scale is limited the size of the chamber was limited to maintain sample transparency which may contribute to some minor boundary effects on the projectiles during penetration or pullout 9 conclusions models of transparent synthetic soft marine clay were used to explore the effect of fin length on penetration and pullout of torpedo anchors use of transparent soils and dic provides quantitative measurements of local soil conditions around the anchors which permits exploring the zone of influence zoi during penetration the width of the zoi was 2d from the penetration centerline for finless torpedoes and extended to more than 3d from the centerline for finned torpedoes during pullout soils located 2 3 d above the torpedo played an important role in capacity development incremental movements cumulative displacements particle trajectories and pullout capacities were measured during penetration and pullout there were a number of significant findings 1 using fins decreases the penetration depth due to the increase of the friction force between the fins and the surrounding soils but it increases the 1 pullout capacity and 2 torpedo verticality 2 using fins increased observed vertical cumulative displacements by 50 100 relative to the finless torpedo and increased the horizontal cumulative displacements by 100 130 of that observed for the finless torpedo 3 before penetrating any horizontal plane of interest poi deformations within the soil were largely elastic in nature after torpedoes penetrate the poi irrecoverable deformations propagate in the target soil due to the interaction between the torpedo and its fins with the surrounding soil maximum vertical displacement after penetrating the poi is upward and occurs at a distance of 2d from the torpedo centerline while maximum horizontal displacement occurred at a distance of 1 2d from the torpedo centerline 4 the maximum pullout capacity of finned torpedoes occurs at a pullout distance of 2 3 shank diameters for the marine clay simulant employed in this study the efficiency of these anchors is defined as the peak pull out load normalized by submerged weight the efficiency of finned torpedoes was approximately 130 150 that of the finless torpedo the maximum pullout capacity increases by using fins and increases with increase of fin length the maximum observed efficiency was found to be 4 2 for the torpedo with long fins using long fins increases the capacity torpedoes owing to the significant increase in the reverse end bearing resistance and the increase in friction

computational fluid dynamics circular square and rectangular bodies are the useful examples of bluff body ramos garcía et al 2017 wang et al 2019 jiang and cheng 2018 ke 2019 abdollah et al 2008 shohankar 2008 islam et al 2012 cao et al 2014 okajima 1990 flow behind multiple bluff bodies has practical applications in science and engineering such as buildings chimneys overhead power line bundles heat exchangers wind tunnel bridges offshore platforms masts micro electro mechanical system devices and cooling of fibers etc the mutual interaction of flow with bluff bodies is generally governed by many non dimensional flow parameters these parameters are gap ratio g reynolds number re strouhal number st fluid forces like drag and lift coefficients cd and cl in case of multiple circular and square bluff bodies while in the case of the rectangular body aspect ratio ar has also a great effect on fluid flow characteristics in many aspects in open literature limited published work is available on flow behind a single rectangular body but no reference data are available on flow past three rectangular bodies arranged side by side which motivates the current study in the flow behind a square body the vortices separation point is fixed at upper and lower surface of the body while in case of circular body vortices emerge from the whole surface of the body moreover many differences are notable between square and rectangular body abdollah et al 2008 investigated that the wake of a square body is larger than rectangular body sohankar 2008 found that strouhal number increases for small aspect ratios and discontinuity occur in strouhal due to flow reattachment on the longer side of the body at large aspect ratios islam et al 2012 reported that the effect of aspect

aspect ratio on flow behind three rectangular bodies numerous studies are available in the open literature for two and three circular and square bodies respectively arranged side by side here some representative cases for flow past three bodies arranged side by side are discussed islam et al 2016a numerically observed bistable asymmetric inphase antiphase antiphase modulated synchronized inphase antiphase synchronized and the modulated synchronized flow pattern for three square bodies also no secondary body interaction frequencies were observed for large gap ratios kang 2004 numerically reported modulation synchronized inphase synchronized flip flopping deflected and single bluff body pattern zhang and zhou 2001 experimentally concluded that if gap ratio between the bodies is identical the flow is symmetric about the center line and as gap ratio was slightly increased remarkable change occurred in the flow behavior rahman et al 2015 numerically studied two dimensional flow behind three side by side square bodies using the lattice boltzmann method lbm in their work the effect of reynolds number on flow structure mechanism was extensively studied and it was observed that at large reynolds number the primary vortex shedding frequency dominates the flow and secondary body interaction frequencies disappear han et al 2013 observed single bluff body deflected flip flopping non identical steady state antiphase synchronized inphase synchronized and combined in phase and anti phase synchronized pattern for flow behind three circular bodies from the above literature survey it can be concluded that in most of the studies the effect of g and re were studied for flow behind three side by side circular and square bodies on the other hand aspect ratio is also one of the important flow parameters which affects the flow characteristics behind a body abdollah et al 2008 shohankar 2008 islam et al 2012 cao et al 2014 okajima 1990 therefore the present numerical computations are performed to analyze the effect of aspect ratio on flow around three rectangular bodies arranged side by side using the lattice boltzmann method in the present study we will investigate how flow behavior is affected by aspect ratio for different g at fixed re 150 2 numerical technique and flow parameters in earlier numerical studies concerning the investigation of fluid structure interaction problems the traditional methods like finite element method finite difference method and finite volume method were extensively used in these methods the governing differential equations are discretized over finite elements or nodes which result in system of equations these systems are then solved by different iterative techniques the macroscopic properties like density velocity pressure etc of system particles are calculated by solving mass and momentum conservation equations these methods are also termed as top to bottom approaches in literature however the lattice boltzmann method is a quite different approach which is termed as bottom to top approach in this approach instead of discretizing a differential equation the discrete boltzmann equation is used which is quite simple and easy to handle due to ease implementation and better accuracy lbm is adopted as a numerical technique for the present study a two dimensional nine velocity particles d2q9 model with bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision term is used for simulations of the current problem the evolution equation of lbm is 1 f i x c i δ t t δ t f i x t 1 τ f i x t f i e q x t i 0 1 2 8 where t and δt represents the time and its increment respectively c i are the discrete velocity directions f i and f i eq represents the particle distribution function and the equilibrium distribution function respectively and τ is the relaxation parameter the equilibrium distribution function is calculated as 2 f i e q ρ w i 1 1 5 c i u 4 5 c i u 2 1 5 u 2 i 0 1 2 8 where w 0 4 9 for i 0 w i 1 9 for i 1 2 3 4 and w i 1 36 for i 5 6 7 8 are the weighting coefficients the density ρ and the velocity u in lbm are computed as 3 ρ i 0 8 f i u 1 ρ i 1 8 c i f i eq 1 is the governing equation of lbm

the geometry of flow around three side by side rectangular bodies is shown in fig 1 three rectangular bodies b 1 b 2 and b 3 of length ℓ and width d are placed side by side in a channel of height h and length l at the inlet the uniform inflow velocity is incorporated while on the surface of the rectangular body no slip boundary condition which is treated in lbm using bounce back rule is implemented guo et al 2000 at the outlet of the computational domain the convective boundary condition is incorporated sukop and thorne 2005 while periodic boundary condition is used on the lower and upper walls of the computational channel breuer et al 2000 kumar et al 2008 chatterjee et al 2010 the upstream and downstream locations are represented by lupstrean and ldownstrean respectively in this study the effect of ar varying between 0 25 and 4 will be systematically analyzed at five different spacing values which are g 0 5 1 5 2 3 and 4 4 effect of computational domain it is very important to choose an appropriate domain size for numerical simulations because the accuracy and computational time of the problem are dependent on computational domain in order to choose suitable domain size we have calculated the values of the mean drag coefficient cdmean and root mean square value of the drag coefficient cdrms for flow around three side by side rectangular bodies placed at different positions inside the computational domain for g ar 1 5 1 5 and re 150 these values are presented in table 1 table 1 shows that the differences in results of cdmean and cdrms on the domain size lupstream 8d ldownstream 30d h 9d and other domain size combinations are very small for all three bodies that s why in the current study all the simulations are performed at lupstream 8d ldownstream 30d h 9d excluding the bodies and gap ratios 5 code validation study before going to the actual problem the unsteady flow past a single square body at re 150 is simulated to use as a reference for further numerical investigations of flow behind three side by side rectangular bodies a computational domain of 36d 9d without the body is used for simulation the values of the drag coefficient st cdrms and root mean square values of lift coefficients clrms are compared with existing experimental measurements of okajima 1990 and norberg 1993 and numerical data of gera et al 2010 and sohankar et al 1995 table 2 table 2 shows that the present results for the strouhal number at re 150 are very close to the experimental data of norberg 1993 and okajima 1990 the presented results also agree well with the numerical computations of gera et al 2010 and sohankar et al 1995 from this analysis it can be concluded that the computed data of cd st and root mean square values of drag and lift coefficients for flow past a square isolated body agree well with the published data of other researchers in literature this illustrates that our code can capture the flow characteristics behind a square body efficiently and can be used for the numerical simulations behind three side by side rectangular bodies 6 results and discussions after choosing an appropriate domain size and validating our numerical code we have systematically performed numerical simulations to investigate the effect of ar on flow around three rectangular bodies at g 0 5 1 5 2 3 and 4 for fixed re 150 different flow patterns observed in this study will be discussed in the following subsections also the fluid forces acting on each individual body at small moderate and large gap ratios will be presented for the sake of brevity only representative cases will be discussed 6 1 flow patterns the first flow pattern observed in this study is named as deflected flow pattern this flow pattern is investigated at g ar 0 5 1 5 0 5 2 0 5 2 5 0 5 3 0 5 3 5 and 0 5 4 the vorticity contour visualization drag and lift signals and power spectra of a representative case at g ar 0 5 1 5 are presented in fig 2 it is clear from fig 2 a that at immediate wake region of the computational domain the vortices are incomplete and irregular the jet flow generated in the gaps between the bodies cause distortion and amalgamation in vortices flow in the gap between the bodies oscillates and deflect to the side where the frequency of shed vortices is higher see fig 2 a another important feature of this pattern is that due to small g the fluid wake bursts see fig 2 a from time trace analysis shown in fig 2 b and c it can be seen that both cd and cl signals are modulated due to small g and strong jet flow in this flow pattern due to deflection of flow from one bluff body to another the drag force increases the primary vortex shedding frequency st in the present study is determined by applying the fast fourier transform fft on the lift signals the highest peak represents the primary vortex shedding frequency while the other peaks represent the secondary bodies interaction frequencies for deflected flow pattern it is extremely difficult to calculate any specific value for primary vortex shedding frequency due to the complex flow structure due to the strong interaction of jet flow secondary bodies interaction frequencies can be clearly seen in the fft spectrum of cl see fig 2 d f kang 2003 observed the same flow pattern at g 0 4 for flow past two side by side circular bodies and kang 2004 observed similar flow pattern at g 0 3 for three bodies placed side by side islam et al 2016b also reported the same flow pattern for a row of five rectangular bodies the second flow pattern investigated in this study is bistable flow which occurs at g ar 0 5 0 75 0 5 1 0 5 1 25 and 0 5 1 75 the flow structure mechanism of this flow pattern behind the three bodies at g ar 0 5 0 75 is presented as a representative case in fig 3 in this flow pattern the wake behind the bodies are irregular and inconsistent the wake is initially wider and then become narrower due the gap flow between the bodies see fig 3 a at the near wake the flow structure is complex due to small g and jet flow and at further downstream the shape and size of the vortices are affected due to biased flow fig 3 a from temporal variations of cd and cl it can be seen that the drag and lift forces are drastically unsteady with varying amplitudes fig 3 b and c due to modulation of lift coefficient a complex spectrum of cl can be seen and there is no deficit value of strouhal number see fig 3 d f same flow pattern was observed by islam et al 2016a at g 0 5 for flow around three bodies the third flow pattern observed in this study is flip flopping pattern investigated at g ar 1 5 1 25 1 5 1 5 1 5 2 5 and 1 5 3 the flow structure of a representative case at g ar 1 5 1 5 is presented in fig 4 due to small g and ar the effect of jet between the gaps of consecutive bodies is very strong and a complex flow structure can be seen at the downstream position of the channel fig 4 a it can be seen from fig 4 a that the shed vortices are not fully developed at small downstream and destroyed at further downstream of the channel kang 2004 and islam et al 2016a reported flip flopping pattern for three circular and square bodies respectively the time signals of cd and cl show modulated behavior fig 4 b and c which indicates that how the flow flip flop between the rectangular bodies due to jet flow each body experience fluctuating forces with higher frequencies and jet induced frequencies along with primary vortex shedding frequency see fig 4 d f from the power spectrum of flip flopping pattern presented in fig 4 d f it is clear that the flow is dominated by secondary bodies interaction frequencies islam et al 2016b also found flip flopping flow for a row of five rectangular bodies the chaotic flow pattern is the fourth pattern observed in this study at g ar 1 5 0 25 1 5 0 5 1 5 1 75 and 1 5 2 a representative case for this flow pattern at g ar 1 5 1 75 is presented in fig 5 from fig 5 a it is clear that due to merging of vortices at immediate wake region a distorted and amalgamated flow can be seen at far wake region due to non similarity of vortices the drag and lift signal are random with uneven mode see fig 5 c and d the drag amplitude of middle body shows variations see fig 5 c also in the power spectra graph the secondary frequencies appear due to the interaction of secondary bodies frequencies fig 5 d f kumar et al 2008 and awale 2014 found the chaotic flow pattern for different g the fifth flow pattern is symmetric pattern which occurred at g ar 0 5 0 25 0 5 0 5 1 5 3 5 1 5 0 75 1 5 1 and 1 5 4 the vorticity contour visualization cd and cl signals and power spectra graph of a representative case at g ar 0 5 0 5 are presented in fig 6 in this flow pattern the vortices generate from the upper and lower bodies exhibit symmetry with respect to the middle body fig 6 a from the time trace analysis of cd and cl fig 6 b c it is clear that the cl signal of the middle body is steady indicating that a constant lift force is applied by the fluid on the middle body while the drag coefficients show periodic behavior cl signal of bodies b 1 and b 3 are anti phase to each other which confirm the symmetry of the flow fig 6 c from power spectrum graph fig 6 d and e the visibility of small secondary peaks is due to variation in amplitude of lift coefficient due to steady behavior straight line of cl of middle body the spectrum is not shown here kang 2003 found steady flow pattern at g 0 5 islam et al 2016a reported the same flow pattern at g 1 5 wang and zhou 2005 also observed the steady flow pattern for the flow around two bodies at 1 2 g 2 the synchronized flow pattern generally occurs at large gap ratios awale 2014 chatterjee et al 2010 islam et al 2016 kumar et al 2008 for the current study synchronized flow pattern is observed at g 2 3 and 4 for all aspect ratios the g ar 4 0 75 case is presented as a representative case in fig 7 from vorticity contours graph shown in fig 7 a it can be seen that the vortices from each body in triad move smoothly throughout the channel in alternate fashion due to large g the effect of jet flow vanishes and vortex shedding behavior at downstream of the channel is like a single bluff body and for each body a separate von karman vortex street can be seen the variation in amplitude of drag curve can be seen in fig 7 b the lift signal fig 7 c is periodic because of the fully developed flow behind each body due to the periodic nature of lift coefficient only primary vortex shedding frequency is observed in power spectrum shown in fig 7 d f rahman et al 2015 han et al 2013 kumar et al 2008 awale 2014 and chatterjee et al 2010 reported the same flow pattern 6 2 physical parameters in the present study cdmean and st of each body are calculated and compared with the cdmean and st of the single body at small gap ratio g 0 5 moderate gap ratio g 2 and large gap ratio g 4 fig 8 for each case the aspect ratio is varied from 0 25 to 4 in fig 8 cdmean1 cdmean2 and cdmean3 and st1 st2 and st3 represent the mean drag coefficient and strouhal number of lower middle and upper body respectively at small and intermediate spacing values the mean drag coefficient of lower and upper bodies show decreasing behavior and have almost similar values fig 8 a c at small g the cdmean of middle body show increasing behavior fig 8 a while at moderate g it shows decreasing behavior for increasing ar fig 8 c sooraj et al 2019 reported that the flow is highly unstable at small g for flow behind three side by side circular bodies and as g increases the flow become comparatively stable at large spacing value the cdmean of all bodies show decreasing behavior for increasing ar and all values are same fig 8 e the values of mean drag coefficients of all bodies are greater than the values of single body due to the effect of aspect ratio the local maximum value 3 2077 of cdmean1 is observed at g ar 1 5 0 25 and the flow pattern at this combination of g and ar was bistable fig 3 at g ar 1 5 3 5 the mean drag coefficient of second body is 1 5663 which is the minimum value of cdmean for all chosen cases and the flow pattern at this g and ar was symmetric flow pattern fig 6 from fig 8 b it can be seen that strouhal values of lower and middle bodies first decrease with ar and approach to the st of a single body at ar 1 strouhal values of middle body have maximum value at ar 0 25 decreases in the range 0 25 ar 1 becomes steady at intermediate ar and modulated at large ar fig 8 b d at small g and for ar 1 the st values of all bodies are smaller than the values of a single body while at large g and for all aspect ratios these values are greater than the single body data see fig 8 b f at large g as the effect of gap flow vanishes the strouhal values of all bodies are similar st1 st2 and st3 give maximum value at small ar for large spacing and approach to the st of single body at ar 0 5 and for all other values of ar strouhal value of all bodies exhibit decreasing trend 7 conclusions numerical investigations of flow around three rectangular bodies arranged side by side at fixed reynolds number of 150 were carried out in this study using the lattice boltzmann method the purpose of this study is to fully analyze the effect of aspect ratio 0 25 ar 4 and gap ratio g 0 5 1 5 2 3 and 4 on flow characteristics and force variations of flow past three rectangular bodies the results were presented and discussed in terms of vorticity contours cd and cl

ar 0 25 while for other values of ar it became greater than cdmean of an isolated body on the other hand the cdmeans of upper and lower bodies were maximum at small ar and then decrease up to some extent for higher values of ar and g ii for moderate spacing it was observed that as the ar increases the value of cdmean1 cdmean2 and cdmean3 approaches the cdmean of an isolated body iv at large spacing cdmean1 cdmean2 and cdmean3 showed decreasing behavior like a single body also it was found that at large g the cdmean of each body becomes approximately same at all ar v at small spacing the strouhal value of lower and upper body decreased and approached to st of a single body at ar 1 vi st1 st2 and st3 were found to be maximum at small ar for large g and approach to the st of an isolated

21493,this work focuses on the analysis of flow structure mechanism behind three rectangular bodies arranged side by side such type of arrangement can be seen in various applications of practical significance lattice boltzmann method is adopted as a numerical technique for the current study the simulations are performed for the unsteady newtonian and the incompressible flow past three rectangular bodies to investigate the behavior of flow at different aspect ratios gap ratios and fixed reynolds number the numerical results obtained from the proposed study are compared with the results available in the literature the observed findings of the current study line up well with the existing findings of other researchers keywords aspect ratio flow pattern gap ratio rectangular body side by side strouhal number 1 introduction flow past bluff bodies involve various fluid dynamic phenomena such as jet flow wake formation fluid structure interactions and different flow pattern mechanism these phenomena have great physical significance in science and engineering such type of bluff bodies flow has gained great interest of researcher and engineers working in the field of computational fluid dynamics circular square and rectangular bodies are the useful examples of bluff body ramos garcía et al 2017 wang et al 2019 jiang and cheng 2018 ke 2019 abdollah et al 2008 shohankar 2008 islam et al 2012 cao et al 2014 okajima 1990 flow behind multiple bluff bodies has practical applications in science and engineering such as buildings chimneys overhead power line bundles heat exchangers wind tunnel bridges offshore platforms masts micro electro mechanical system devices and cooling of fibers etc the mutual interaction of flow with bluff bodies is generally governed by many non dimensional flow parameters these parameters are gap ratio g reynolds number re strouhal number st fluid forces like drag and lift coefficients cd and cl in case of multiple circular and square bluff bodies while in the case of the rectangular body aspect ratio ar has also a great effect on fluid flow characteristics in many aspects in open literature limited published work is available on flow behind a single rectangular body but no reference data are available on flow past three rectangular bodies arranged side by side which motivates the current study in the flow behind a square body the vortices separation point is fixed at upper and lower surface of the body while in case of circular body vortices emerge from the whole surface of the body moreover many differences are notable between square and rectangular body abdollah et al 2008 investigated that the wake of a square body is larger than rectangular body sohankar 2008 found that strouhal number increases for small aspect ratios and discontinuity occur in strouhal due to flow reattachment on the longer side of the body at large aspect ratios islam et al 2012 reported that the effect of aspect ratios was notable on cd cl strouhal number and vortex shedding mechanism cao et al 2014 observed that strouhal number have significant variation with shear parameter and lift forces on rectangular body okajima 1990 reported that small change in aspect ratio results drastic changes in fluid structure on the basis of these findings the numerical simulations are conducted to analyze the effect of aspect ratio on flow behind three rectangular bodies numerous studies are available in the open literature for two and three circular and square bodies respectively arranged side by side here some representative cases for flow past three bodies arranged side by side are discussed islam et al 2016a numerically observed bistable asymmetric inphase antiphase antiphase modulated synchronized inphase antiphase synchronized and the modulated synchronized flow pattern for three square bodies also no secondary body interaction frequencies were observed for large gap ratios kang 2004 numerically reported modulation synchronized inphase synchronized flip flopping deflected and single bluff body pattern zhang and zhou 2001 experimentally concluded that if gap ratio between the bodies is identical the flow is symmetric about the center line and as gap ratio was slightly increased remarkable change occurred in the flow behavior rahman et al 2015 numerically studied two dimensional flow behind three side by side square bodies using the lattice boltzmann method lbm in their work the effect of reynolds number on flow structure mechanism was extensively studied and it was observed that at large reynolds number the primary vortex shedding frequency dominates the flow and secondary body interaction frequencies disappear han et al 2013 observed single bluff body deflected flip flopping non identical steady state antiphase synchronized inphase synchronized and combined in phase and anti phase synchronized pattern for flow behind three circular bodies from the above literature survey it can be concluded that in most of the studies the effect of g and re were studied for flow behind three side by side circular and square bodies on the other hand aspect ratio is also one of the important flow parameters which affects the flow characteristics behind a body abdollah et al 2008 shohankar 2008 islam et al 2012 cao et al 2014 okajima 1990 therefore the present numerical computations are performed to analyze the effect of aspect ratio on flow around three rectangular bodies arranged side by side using the lattice boltzmann method in the present study we will investigate how flow behavior is affected by aspect ratio for different g at fixed re 150 2 numerical technique and flow parameters in earlier numerical studies concerning the investigation of fluid structure interaction problems the traditional methods like finite element method finite difference method and finite volume method were extensively used in these methods the governing differential equations are discretized over finite elements or nodes which result in system of equations these systems are then solved by different iterative techniques the macroscopic properties like density velocity pressure etc of system particles are calculated by solving mass and momentum conservation equations these methods are also termed as top to bottom approaches in literature however the lattice boltzmann method is a quite different approach which is termed as bottom to top approach in this approach instead of discretizing a differential equation the discrete boltzmann equation is used which is quite simple and easy to handle due to ease implementation and better accuracy lbm is adopted as a numerical technique for the present study a two dimensional nine velocity particles d2q9 model with bhatnagar gross krook bgk collision term is used for simulations of the current problem the evolution equation of lbm is 1 f i x c i δ t t δ t f i x t 1 τ f i x t f i e q x t i 0 1 2 8 where t and δt represents the time and its increment respectively c i are the discrete velocity directions f i and f i eq represents the particle distribution function and the equilibrium distribution function respectively and τ is the relaxation parameter the equilibrium distribution function is calculated as 2 f i e q ρ w i 1 1 5 c i u 4 5 c i u 2 1 5 u 2 i 0 1 2 8 where w 0 4 9 for i 0 w i 1 9 for i 1 2 3 4 and w i 1 36 for i 5 6 7 8 are the weighting coefficients the density ρ and the velocity u in lbm are computed as 3 ρ i 0 8 f i u 1 ρ i 1 8 c i f i eq 1 is the governing equation of lbm and this equation is used in the current work for fluid flow simulations guo et al 2000 the speed of sound and pressure are calculated as 4 c s 1 3 5 p ρ c s 2 the kinematic viscosity is calculated as 6 ν τ 1 2 c s 2 δ t the important flow parameters that have been used in this study are defined 7 gap spacing g s d where s is the surface to surface distance between the bodies and d is the size of

the geometry of flow around three side by side rectangular bodies is shown in fig 1 three rectangular bodies b 1 b 2 and b 3 of length ℓ and width d are placed side by side in a channel of height h and length l at the inlet the uniform inflow velocity is incorporated while on the surface of the rectangular body no slip boundary condition which is treated in lbm using bounce back rule is implemented guo et al 2000 at the outlet of the computational domain the convective boundary condition is incorporated sukop and thorne 2005 while periodic boundary condition is used on the lower and upper walls of the computational channel breuer et al 2000 kumar et al 2008 chatterjee et al 2010 the upstream and downstream locations are represented by lupstrean and ldownstrean respectively in this study the effect of ar varying between 0 25 and 4 will be systematically analyzed at five different spacing values which are g 0 5 1 5 2 3 and 4 4 effect of computational domain it is very important to choose an appropriate domain size for numerical simulations because the accuracy and computational time of the problem are dependent on computational domain in order to choose suitable domain size we have calculated the values of the mean drag coefficient cdmean and root mean square value of the drag coefficient cdrms for flow around three side by side rectangular bodies placed at different positions inside the computational domain for g ar 1 5 1 5 and re 150 these values are presented in table 1 table 1 shows that the differences in results of cdmean and cdrms on the domain size lupstream 8d ldownstream 30d h 9d and other domain size combinations are very small for all three bodies that s why in the current study all the simulations are performed at lupstream 8d ldownstream 30d h 9d excluding the bodies and gap ratios 5 code validation study before going to the actual problem the unsteady flow past a single square body at re 150 is simulated to use as a reference for further numerical investigations of flow behind three side by side rectangular bodies a computational domain of 36d 9d without the body is used for simulation the values of the drag

also agree well with the numerical computations of gera et al 2010 and sohankar et al 1995 from this analysis it can be concluded that the computed data of cd st and root mean square values of drag and lift coefficients for flow past a square isolated body agree well with the published data of other researchers in literature this illustrates that our code can capture the flow characteristics behind a square body efficiently and can be used for the numerical simulations behind three side by side rectangular bodies 6 results and discussions after choosing an appropriate domain size and validating our numerical code we have systematically performed numerical simulations to investigate the effect of ar on flow around three rectangular bodies at g 0 5 1 5 2 3 and 4 for fixed re 150

values are same fig 8 e the values of mean drag coefficients of all bodies are greater than the values of single body due to the effect of aspect ratio the local maximum value 3 2077 of cdmean1 is observed at g ar 1 5 0 25 and the flow pattern at this combination of g and ar was bistable fig 3 at g ar 1 5 3 5 the mean drag coefficient of second body is 1 5663 which is the minimum value of cdmean for all chosen cases and the flow pattern at this g and ar was symmetric flow pattern fig 6 from fig 8 b it can be seen that strouhal values of lower and middle bodies first decrease with ar and approach to the st of a single body at ar 1 strouhal values of middle body have maximum value at ar 0 25 decreases in the range 0 25 ar 1 becomes steady at intermediate ar and modulated at large

21494,the aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of model extension and boundary conditions on the buckling behaviour of aluminium integrally stiffened panels under uniaxial compressive loading two types of models with different extensions the multi span model and half multi half span model are employed and combined with various boundary conditions namely fixed simply supported and symmetric boundary conditions the fabrication related imperfections such as initial deformations material softening in heat affected zone and residual stresses are simulated in the numerical analysis the results show some new evidence of the effect of different model extension and boundary conditions on the numerical results for the ultimate strength of aluminium integrally stiffened panels which also explains the discrepancy between the experimental data and numerical results of aluminium integrally stiffened panels with the same cross section and span length the configurations of model extension and boundary conditions are proposed for numerical simulations and experimental tests of aluminium integrally stiffened panels keywords aluminium structure integrally stiffened panel buckling strength model extent boundary conditions 1 introduction stiffened panels are the elementary building block for many large steel structures and widely used in ship and offshore structures the main role of this type of structural component is to resist lateral load and also in plane compression guedes soares and soreide 1983 aluminium alloys with yield strengths ranging from 200 mpa to 600 mpa and having about one third the density and stiffness of steel can be easily cast machined drawn and extruded mazzolani 2003 due to the higher strength to weight ratio aluminium stiffened panels are increasingly employed in high speed ferries and ship superstructures as well as living quarters in offshore installations moan 2003 according to their manufacturing process aluminium stiffened panels break down into two types collette 2005 one is the traditional built up stiffened panels by joining the stiffeners to the skin plate and the other is welding extruded profiles which are known as integrally stiffened panel isp the isp consists of the base plate skin and single or multiple stiffeners stringer in a single component directly obtained by extrusion operations the isp eliminates the need to weld the stiffeners to the panel and has a better surface finish than built up panels as the only joint required is a longitudinal butt weld where the sections join which can typically be joined by automatic welding to form large flat decks very quickly and at reduced costs the aluminium association 2000 thus the isps are popular for internal decks and weather decks on high speed vessels and offshore structures aluminium alloys are more sensitive to welding than steel during the thermal cycle of welding process the heat added and conducted close to the welded seam does not only induce the geometrical distortions initial deformation and residual stresses but also reduces the yield stress and changes the shape of the stress strain curve in the heat affected zone haz around the weld the material softening in the haz will significantly affect the ultimate strength behaviour of aluminium structures whereas its effect in steel structures is of smaller importance mazzolani 2003 the initial deformation material softening and residual stresses are the 3 major forms of initial imperfections and they have significant influence on the mechanical performance of aluminium structures especially on the buckling behaviour the literature on aluminium panels is relatively limited in comparison with steel structures but there are still many results available the buckling or ultimate strength characteristics of stiffened aluminium panels has been investigated both experimentally mofflin 1983 zha and moan 2001 aalberg et al 2001 clarke and swan 1985 paik et al 2008 2009 rønning et al 2010 brando and matteis 2011 kristensen and moan 1999 and numerically mofflin 1983 aalberg et al 2001 kristensen and moan 1999 rigo et al 2003 khedmati and ghavami 2009 2010a 2010b paulo et al 2013 li et al 2017 paik and duran 2004 european committee for standardization 1998 most of these studies mainly focused on the investigation of the effect of material properties initial deformations and welding induced imperfections i e residual stresses and heat affected zones on the ultimate strength of unstiffened and stiffened aluminium panels little attention has been paid to the characteristics of the finite element model adopted namely the extension of the geometry and the boundary conditions as a representative of the behaviour of a larger panel the employment of different extensions of the model single bay two bay and three bay model and boundary conditions simply support fixed support and symmetric boundary condition in the numerical simulations have been recently studied for steel plates but there is no such systematic investigation for aluminium panels the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under compressive load is a highly nonlinear phenomenon including material and geometrical nonlinearities paik and thayamballi 2003 in a general sense a model that intends to represent the behaviour of a larger structure needs to have the appropriate boundary conditions thus it is very important to properly define the boundary conditions that are associated with the extension adopted for the model in nonlinear finite element analysis nfea in order to avoid the errors caused by excessively rigid or flexible boundary conditions it is desirable to take the entire structure into consideration when performing the nfea however real world engineering structures can be very large and conducting a conventional nfea with a model of the entire structure is usually impractical because of the huge computational effort required normally a model that is a cut out of the entire structure is often adopted for structural performance assessment for the evaluation of ultimate strength of ship hull by nfea besides 1 the entire hull model the commonly adopted extents of model are 2 the three cargo hold 1 1 1 model 3 the two cargo hold model 1 2 1 1 2 4 the one cargo hold model 5 the two bay sliced hull model 1 2 1 1 2 bay and 6 the single bay sliced hull model the computational efficiency improves from 1 to 6 but the numerical accuracy may drop due to the influence of artificial boundary conditions hughes and paik 2010 however aluminum and steel are not just different in the young s modulus and yield strength but also in many other mechanic properties the buckling behaviour or ultimate strength of stiffened panels is a complicated nonlinear problem that involves geometrical and material nonlinearities thus it is interesting and also necessary to study whether the findings of stiffened steel plates apply to stiffened aluminium plates to investigate the buckling behaviour of stiffened panels the extensions of model usually adopted are the 1 span panel model the 1 2 1 1 2 span panel model and the 3 span panel model the 1 span panel with fixed and simply supported boundary conditions are employed in most experimental investigations and numerical simulations this kind of models is suitable only when the restraint at the ends transverse frame location is either zero or infinity fixed or simply supported in reality the rigidity of transverse frames is neither infinite nor zero based on this consideration the latter two including transverse frames in the models are more suitable for the investigation of buckling behaviour and the translational and rotational restraints at the transverse frame locations on the rest of the model are automatically accounted for ghavami and khedmati 2006 carried out numerical and experimental investigations on the post buckling behaviour of 3 span steel stiffened panels with simply supported boundary conditions under compressive load the fem results show good consistency with the test results xu and guedes soares 2011 investigated the effect of different model configurations on the ultimate strength under compressive loading including 3 span 2 span 1 span and 1 2 1 1 2 span with fixed and simply supported boundary conditions 3 span gordo and guedes soares 2008 and the 2 span xu et al 2013a 2013b models were also used in the ultimate strength tests of the stiffened panels in addition xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b investigated the influence of boundary conditions on the collapse behaviour of stiffened panels under uniaxial and combined loads in which the 1 2 1 1 2 span and 1 2 1 2 span models with symmetric conditions were employed in recent years the 1 2 1 1 2 span model with symmetric conditions have become more popular in numerical simulations all these studies have demonstrated sufficient accuracy for simulating the behaviour of large stiffened steel panels doan et al 2020 investigated the ultimate compressive strength of equivalent stiffened panels made of aluminium and steel and the results have shown that the equivalent stiffened panels yield at the same compressive load but the aluminium panels have higher ultimate strength than the steel panels however ideal plasto elastic models were used by doan et al for aluminium and steel while actual stress strain curves are usually recommend in engineering applications as aluminium alloys have smaller young s modulus than steels and there is no distinct yield platform in the stress strain curve thus it is unknown if these approaches are equally applicable to aluminium stiffened panels because the material properties of aluminium alloy are different from that of structural steel and also the effect of welding are different in the aforementioned studies of aluminium stiffened panels aalberg et al 2001 performed an experimental investigation on 1 span isps of aa6082 t2 with both l shaped stiffeners and closed stiffeners the test rig allowed the specimen ends loaded edges to rotate simply supported meanwhile it was capable of representing both simply supported and free boundary conditions along the two unloaded longitudinal edges of the test panels numerical simulations of these panels were carried out by paulo et al 2013 who also assessed the effects of initial deformations and material properties on ultimate strength the numerical results obtained by paulo et al were in good agreement with the experimental results by aalberg et al in the framework of a benchmark on the ultimate strength of aluminium stiffened panels carried out by the committee iii 1 ultimate strength of issc 2003 rigo et al 2003 where the same extrusion cross section with l shaped stiffeners fig 1 a as in aalberg et al s experimental investigation was chosen for the investigation the contributors built a 2 span fe model instead of 1 span test panel with simply supported along the unloaded edges and restrained rotation at the two loaded ends fig 1b shows the results in comparison with issc there are some distinct differences particularly in the collapse modes and ultimate load values which is probably caused by the different extents of model and particular boundary conditions adopted in the simulations in the continuation of the activities carried out by issc 2003 iii 1 khedmati et al 2010a worked on the post buckling behaviour of the three span panels under combined axial compression and lateral pressure and derived empirical formulations for estimation of ultimate strength khedmati et al 2010b li et al 2018 investigated the ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium panels and sensitivity assessment of ultimate strength to the imperfections typically the amplitude and shape of the initial deformations haz and residual stresses has been performed the objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the extension of the model and the boundary conditions on the buckling behaviour of aluminium isp under compressive load five different configurations of fe models with the same cross section and varying model extension and boundary conditions are employed to calculate the ultimate strength of the continuous aluminium isps the fabrication related imperfections such as initial deformations material softening in haz and residual stresses are also simulated the numerical results are compared and analysed to find out which configuration is more suitable for numerical simulations with acceptable accuracy to represent a larger structure and which is more appropriate to represent large panels in experimental or numerical simulation 2 numerical models 2 1 description of the extrusion cross section and material properties the extrusion cross section with l shaped stiffeners originally provided by aalberg et al 2001 fig 1a is chosen in the present study the integrally stiffened panels were built with five extruded aluminium profiles of aa6082 t6 and joined together by longitudinal welding the nominal dimensions of the extruded profiles are presented in fig 1a the nominal width of the extruded profiles is 252 5 mm and the total nominal width for panels with five extrusions is hence 1262 5 mm the measured geometric imperfections w 1 to w 5 fig 1a were negative opposite direction of stiffeners side and the amplitudes did not exceed 2 0 mm and varied smoothly the experiments were performed by a standard vertical loading frame with displacement control the axial compression load is applied at the upper end of the specimen through a stiff loading transverse beam while the reaction force is obtained at the lower end meanwhile the cylindrical bearing at the lower end allows test panels to rotate and the specially designed fixtures along the two longitudinal unloaded edges also provided simply supported boundary conditions fig 2 shows the true stress versus strain curves of aa6082 t6 in base metal and also the haz derived by issc 2003 iii 1 rigo et al 2003 which was originally provided by aalberg et al 2001 based on standard tensile test the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of base metal and softening material in haz is 70 000 n mm2 and 0 3 respectively the material properties are implemented into fe models via modelling by elasto plastic formulation with piecewise linear work hardening 2 2 model extension and boundary conditions two kinds of extension of models are employed in the present study one is the multi span models with an integer number n of spans and n 1 transverse frames such as 1 span 2 span 3 span 4 span and 5 span panel models and the other is the half multi half span models which is obtained by combining two extend half span ends with central whole spans such as 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 2 1 2 span and 1 2 3 1 2 span panel model combined with the different boundary conditions at the loaded ends five configurations of fe models are chosen to calculate the ultimate strength of the continuous isps namely the multi span models with fixed and simply supported boundary conditions respectively the half multi half span models with fixed simply supported and symmetric boundary condition respectively as typically illustrated by 3 span and 1 2 1 1 2 span models in fig 3 in the following definitions u v and w indicate translational displacements corresponding to the x y and z coordinates rx ry and rz stand for the rotational constraints about the coordinate axis and 0 indicates a constraint the boundary conditions on longitudinal edges parallel to the stiffeners have only a minor influence on panel strength but when the edges are fixed the panel strength slightly higher than simply supported boundary condition paik et al 2009 thus the two longitudinal unloaded edges in all five configurations fig 3 are modelled as simply supported i e w ry rz 0 with each edge restrained to keep it straight the displacements along z axis at the intersections between the plate and the central transverse frames are restrained i e w 0 the two transverse loaded ends are attached to rigid walls using marc rbe2 s element formulation to keep the ends moving around the reference points the reference points are created by longitudinal translation 25 mm offset along the x direction to the transverse end equal to the thickness of the bearing pads in ref aalberg et al 2001 of the centroid of cross sectional area which ensure the imposed axial displacement force transfer exactly through the neutral axis n a i e through the centroid of the panel cross sectional area for the first configuration fig 3a and third configuration fig 3c the fixed boundary condition is applied i e v w rx ry rz 0 with u imposed displacement for the second configuration fig 3b and the fourth configuration fig 3d the reference points allow the ends to rotate simply supported i e v w rx rz 0 with u imposed displacement for the last configuration fig 3e the symmetric boundary condition is applied i e ry rz 0 with u imposed displacement the third configuration assumes that the collapse deformations of the stiffened panels have a shape symmetric about the x axis which means that the two ends have the same displacement and inverse rotation 2 3 finite element modelling and solution techniques the same fe schemes and imperfection modelling techniques provided by issc 2003 iii 1 members rigo et al 2003 are employed in this study which are briefly introduced as follows 2 3 1 fe code element type and mesh size all analyses in this study are carried out using the commercial finite element code msc marc the same as lehmann et al in issc 2003 iii 1 four node thin shell element shell139 is employed to discrete the aluminium isp model the shell139 element has six degrees of freedom at each node which is powerful in non linear analysis and not sensitive to distortion tanaka et al 2014 in order to avoid the error introduced by the adopted mesh size a mesh size convergence study is performed the meshing configurations and corresponding numerical results are shown in table 1 the ultimate strength obtained with mesh configuration b is very close to the results obtained with configuration c and d thus configuration b as shown in fig 3 with 10 elements for the plate between each two adjacent stiffeners of which 2 for the plate in the haz 3 for the web of the stiffener and 1 for the flange is chosen in the present study which was also the configuration employed by lehmann et al 2 3 2 modelling of initial deformations since the geometrical imperfections measured by aalberg et al were the out of plane deflection along the transversal mid span of the panels only not in the longitudinal direction those data are not enough to develop initial deformation shapes for the numerical models besides the effect of initial deformations on the ultimate strength of aluminium stiffened panels is not the main concern in the present study according to the procedure for defining the initial deformations provided by issc 2003 iii 1 the shape of initial deformation is obtained by applying lateral pressure on one side of the plate as shown in fig 4 a the pressure is calibrated to obtain a linear elastic deflection w 3 of 2 mm at the central point of the central panel i e at mid span of the central stiffener in the negative direction as defined in fig 1 same as observed by aalberg et al and opposite to issc 2003 iii 1 2 3 3 modelling of haz when aluminium plates are welded zones with reduced yield strength and residual stresses are created the extension width of the haz is mainly affected by the applied welding process and the welding parameters as well as the material properties according to several studies zha and moan 2001 clarke and swan 1985 paik et al 2008 kristensen and moan 1999 and a eurocode european committee for standardization 1998 the width of the haz is suggested to extend 25 mm on each side of the weld note that 20 mm is proposed in eurocode 9 where softening material properties are assigned in these areas in the present study 50 mm 25 mm on each side of the weld is adopted as shown in fig 4b 2 3 4 modelling of residual stresses it is known that there are residual stresses in tension close to the welds and a corresponding residual stress in compression further away from the welds to maintain equilibrium for a given aluminium plate with a longitudinal butt weld fig 4b shows the actual distribution of residual stresses represented by the red line inside the plate for the convenience in numerical simulations an idealized distribution mode fig 4b represented by the blue line was adopted in several studies moan 2003 khedmati and ghavami 2009 paik and duran 2004 in which the width of the tensile residual stress block is equivalent to haz and the magnitude of stress is assumed equal to the flow limit of the material in haz and the corresponding residual stresses in compression can be found by imposing zero resultant forces 1 σ r b h a z σ r b b h a z 0 where σ r is the residual stresses in tension σ r the residual stresses in compression b the width of plate including haz and b h a z the width of haz the idealized distribution mode with tensile residual stress of 130 n mm 2 and width of 50 mm is employed the residual stresses are implemented into the fe models as initial stress 2 3 5 nonlinear solution method all calculations are performed by the arc length method which traces the equilibrium configurations with increments in the length of the arc this method is efficient for simulating the buckling or collapse behaviours where the load displacement response shows a negative stiffness and the structure must release strain energy to remain in equilibrium and has succeeded in capturing the snap back response in the vicinity of critical regions riks 1979 fig 5 illustrates the graphical interpretation of the arc length iteration technique 3 numerical results and discussions in all cases the loading capacity curves are expressed in terms of average stress average strain also called stress strain curve the average stress is the reaction force obtained from the reference point divided by the cross sectional area of the panel equal to 7649 mm2 and the average strain is the ratio of the applied displacement to the length of the panel 3 1 the multi span models with fixed condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the multi span models with fixed boundary conditions is analysed in this subsection firstly the ultimate strength results of the 3 span panel obtained in the present study is compared with these provided by issc 2003 iii 1 it is expected to obtain the same maximum stress and observe similar collapse modes with the same calculation conditions the effect of residual stresses and the shape of initial deformations is discussed secondly the influence of the variation of extent of multi span models with fixed boundary conditions on the ultimate strength is analysed for the first purpose four cases with different imperfections are employed case 1 the initial deformation is positive and has a standard magnitude of 2 mm and the haz is considered without residual stresses which is the same as employed by most contributors of issc 2003 iii 1 case 2 the initial deformation is the same as case 1 and the haz and residual stresses are implemented which is the same as lehmann et al in issc 2003 iii 1 case 3 the initial deformation is in the negative direction with standard magnitude the haz is included without residual stresses similar to case 1 but with an opposite initial deformation case 4 the initial deformation is same as case 3 and the haz and the residual stresses are also implemented which is regarded as the standard imperfection condition in this analysis the obtained results for these cases are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 and table 2 where they are also compared to those provided by issc 2003 iii 1 the stress strain curves in case 1 and case 2 obtained in the present study are very similar to those by the issc members the maximum stress is about 0 8 different from rigo et al s 9 5 from yao et al s and 6 9 from lehmann et al s in case 1 and 4 8 different from lehmann et al s in case 2 these differences are probably induced by the mesh size the element types the codes and the numerical procedures number of steps etc and especially the adopted values forming the material formulation in the fe modelling procedure the deflection modes of the panel in case 1 and case 2 fig 7a d show that the panel has a failure induced by a global flexural buckling in the central span followed by a stiffener tripping in the two extended spans which is consistent with the issc by comparing the ultimate strength with and without residual stresses case 1 versus case 2 case 3 versus case 4 it can be seen that the simulations with residual stresses produce slightly higher about 1 2 ultimate strength for the employed aluminium isp the same trends and phenomenon are also observed by lehmann et al a conclusion can be drawn that the residual stresses will improve the ultimate strength of the employed aluminium isp by 1 2 furthermore in comparison with the ultimate strength of the panels with different initial deformations case 1 versus case 3 case 2 versus case 4 it can be found that the ultimate strength of the panel with negative initial deformation is slightly smaller than the one with positive imperfections but still much higher than the values measured by aalberg et al about 117 n mm2 a possible cause for these phenomena is related to the collapse modes or deformation energy for the deflection modes of the panel in case 3 and case 4 fig 7e h the panel has a failure induced by stiffener tripping in the two extended spans with an out of plane deformation in the negative direction which is a little different from the case 1 and case 2 thus the initial deformations will not only affect the level of ultimate strength but also change the failure mode of the structure after the verification of the fe modelling and solution techniques employed in the present study the attention will be paid mainly to the influence of the model extension on the ultimate strength of multi span models with fixed boundary conditions the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage of numerical simulation table 3 represents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes since the computational accuracy increases with the model extent the ultimate strength of the model with maximum of extent number of spans in the series is hereafter regarded as reference value and hence the maximum average stress of the 5 span model is taken as the reference value in this subsection it can be observed from the stress strain curves that the response curve of the 1 span model bears a somewhat large difference with the other four models and the stress strain curve of the 4 span model overlaps with that of the 5 span model after reaching the peak values a snap through occurs in the curves of the 2 span and the 3 span model in contrast a snap back is observed in the curves of the 4 span and the 5 span model with the increase of the extent the error relative to the reference value decreases from 12 4 to 1 6 and the numerical results for the ultimate strength of the 4 span model is very close to that of the 5 span model a close inspection of collapse modes shows that for all models the collapse is induced by stiffener tripping with out of plane deformation in the negative direction the buckling takes place in the extended spans for the 1 span 2 span and 3 span models but in the central span for the 4 span and 5 span models besides the boundary conditions all the spans have the same material cross section dimension and initial imperfections since the buckling of the 1 span model 2 span model and 3 span model is located in the extended span the artificial boundary conditions may have an influence on the accuracy of numerical results however this influence according to the saint venant principle can be excluded for the 4 span and 5 span models as the buckle is located in the central span hence the numerical results for the 4 span model and the 5 span model match better with the loading characteristics of actual structures 3 2 the multi span models with simply supported condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the multi span models with simply supported boundary conditions is analysed in this subsection firstly the ultimate strength of the 1 span panel is compared with these provided by aalberg et al 2001 and paulo et al 2013 it is also expected to obtain equal values and similar response to the references secondly the influence of the variation of extent of multi span models with simply supported boundary conditions on the ultimate strength is performed fig 11 shows the stress strain curve of 1 span model with simply supported conditions compared with the results by different researchers table 4 represents a summary of the results for the ultimate strength and collapse modes it is found that the trend of the stress strain curve and the accuracy of ultimate strength obtained based on the present analyses are in good agreement with those carried out by other researchers with the increase of axial displacement average strain the axial load average stress increases almost linearly up to the ultimate load afterwards there are sudden increases of out of pane deflection and sideway tripping deflection of stiffener stiffener tripping as shown in fig 13a and fig 14a and accompanied by rapid decrease in axial load the same phenomena in the pre buckling post buckling and post collapse are also observed by aalberg et al but a more severe drop after the peak values was obtained by paulo et al focusing on the initial stage of the stress strain curves there is a distinct deviation between the experimental measured and theoretical initial stiffness the slope of response curves it is caused by the inclusion of the deformations in the teflon sheet and the lubricant in the thrust bearings in the measured axial displacement explained by aalberg et al in comparison with the ultimate strength obtained by the aalberg et al the maximum difference is about 6 8 and the minimum difference is about 3 9 to the measured values the differences are probably induced by the adopted nominal geometrical dimensions of cross section material properties and initial deformation in fe modelling procedure in comparison with the results obtained by paulo et al there is a difference of 7 2 from the panel with a 2 mm initial deformation although the same magnitude is used which is mainly caused by the different adopted shape of initial deformation for the simulations performed by paulo et al the initial deformations are obtained by the eigenvalue analyses ev and the first order mode is adopted now the influence of the model extension on the ultimate strength of multi span models with simply supported boundary conditions is investigated the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 12 figs 13 and 14 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage of numerical simulation table 5 presents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes it can be found that with the increase of the extension the stress strain curve of 1 span model is very different from that of the others except the 1 span model the snap back occurs in the response curves after reaching the peak values for the other models it is remarkable that with the increase of the extension the numerical results for the maximum average stress converge in a fluctuating other than a monotonic pattern the 1 span model having the lowest value for the maximum stress among the five bears a difference of 22 76 from that of the 5 span model while the 2 span model has the highest maximum stress 6 15 than the 5 span model compared to the numerical results for the fixed boundary conditions as presented in table 3 the results obtained with simply supported boundary conditions are clearly smaller which again proves that the implemented boundary conditions in nfea have a significant influence on the ultimate strength of aluminium isp it can be observed from the collapse modes of the models that the collapses of all models are a result of stiffener tripping however with all the models the buckling takes place in the extended span therefore the influence of artificial boundary conditions cannot be excluded and the results may lack fidelity it is very likely to make the objective assumption that transverse frames and bulkheads can effectively support the longitudinal structural members plate stiffeners etc and then come to the intuitive conclusion that the simply supported boundary condition compared to the fixed boundary condition is more appropriate however the numerical results show that the actual boundary of panels can be more complex and the application of simply supported boundary conditions introduces negative influences 3 3 the half multi half span models with fixed condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the half multi half span models with fixed boundary conditions is analysed in this subsection the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage of numerical simulation table 6 represents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes it can be found that before reaching the maximum stress the stress strain curves of the three models are almost same for the 1 2 1 1 2 span model the stress decreases slowly after the peak value while for the other two models snap back occurs after reaching the peak values and the load carrying capacity rapidly reduces a comparison of the results shows that the 1 2 1 1 2 span and the 1 2 2 1 2 span models have similar ultimate strengths and they are slightly larger than that of the 1 2 3 1 2 span model 4 8 and 5 5 higher respectively inspection of the collapse modes of the three models indicates that the failure is induced by the stiffener tripping with out of plane deformation in the negative direction and the buckle is located in the central span and adjacent to the extended half span ends 3 4 the half multi half span models with simply supported condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the half multi half span models with simply supported boundary conditions is analysed in this subsection the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 18 fig 19 and fig 20 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage table 7 represents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes it can be found that the pattern of the stress strain curves of the three models are very similar to those obtained with fixed boundary conditions for the 1 2 1 1 2 span model the stress decreases slowly after reaching the peak value while for the other two models a snap back is observed and the load carrying capacity drops rapidly the values and differences of ultimate strength of the three models are also very similar to those obtained with the fixed boundary condition the 1 2 1 1 2 span and the 1 2 2 1 2 span models have similar ultimate strengths which are 5 5 and 4 3 higher than that of the 1 2 3 1 2 span model in this case the failure is also induced by the stiffener tripping with out of plane deformation in the negative direction and the buckle is located at the central span 3 5 the half multi half span models with symmetric condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the half multi half span models with symmetric condition is analysed in this subsection the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 21 fig 22 and fig 23 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage of numerical simulation table 8 represents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes it can be seen that the stress strain curves of the four models are almost the same and there is only a very slight difference in the value of maximum stress and post collapse region after the stress reaching the peak value snap back occurs in the response curve after reaching the ultimate strength and the load carrying capacity rapidly drops the four models have very similar values of maximum average stress with the maximum relative error being 2 2 in this case the failure is also induced by the stiffener tripping with out of plane deformation in the negative direction the buckle is located at the boundary of the 1 2 1 2 span model while for the other three models it is located in the central span it appears that the half multi half span models with symmetric conditions can produce more reasonable numerical results however this conclusion is too soon to be made before the further comparison and analysis of other configurations and models 3 6 summary discussion for the purpose of better description the assumptions that have been made previously are re emphasized here so as to lead the following two general main requirements of analysis a when the buckle is located in the extended span or half span the use of the accuracy of numerical results is doubtful as the influence of artificial boundary conditions cannot be excluded b on the premise of a the ultimate strength of the model with maximum number of spans in the present discussion is considered most accurate and is taken as the reference value table 9 presents a summary of results for the models with the five configurations for the multi span model with fixed boundary conditions the results for the 4 span and 5 span models are obtained in accordance with the requirements stated above and are thus taken as the reference value for this series for the multi span models with simply supported boundary conditions the obtained results do not satisfy the requirements because in all the models the buckle is located in the extended span thus there is no reference value for this series and all the maximum stresses of these models are smaller than other configurations for the half multi half span models with fixed boundary conditions all the results of the all three models comply with the two requirements and maximum stress of the 1 2 3 1 2 span model is taken as the reference results for this series for the half multi half span models with simply supported and symmetric boundary condition the results are similar to those obtained for the half multi half span models with fixed boundary conditions fig 24 shows the stress strain curves of the models whose ultimate strength is taken as the reference value it can be found that the pattern and accuracy of the response curves are in good agreement with each other the difference in the value of maximum stress is negligible ranging from 0 6 to 1 1 there are small differences in the post collapse region which however do not come into the analysis of ultimate strength it can be concluded that the ultimate strength of the aluminium isp investigated in the present study under uniaxial compressive loading is about 160 n mm2 which is approximately 60 of the yield strength of its base metal hence the results obtained by issc 2003 iii 1 are acceptable while the ones provided by aalberg et al are somewhat underestimated in order to achieve a balance between the number of elements of the model and the computational efficiency it is suggested to use the half multi half span models with symmetric boundary conditions for numerical investigation of ultimate strength and buckling behaviour of aluminium isp according to the results presented in subsection 3 5 the 1 2 1 1 2 span model with symmetric condition is preferable for numerical simulations for two reasons it avoids the excessive tedious work of modelling and the danger of using artificial boundary conditions and at the same time produces numerical results of acceptable accuracy however it is obvious that symmetric conditions can hardly be implemented in experiments at the same time numerical analysis shows that the ultimate strength of aluminium isp is very sensitive to simply supported boundary condition and the 1 span model with simply supported boundary conditions will underestimate the load carrying capacity of panels thus if experimental facility allows multi span 4 span or 5 span models with fixed boundary condition should be used and more satisfactory experimental results can be expected on the other hand the sizes of models cannot be very large or wide due to the constraints of the experimental facilities a common practice to avoid the influence of boundary conditions is to use 1 span with two non integer extended span models table 10 presents a list of frequently used extended models with both simply supported and fixed boundary conditions it can be seen that the results obtained with the listed models are higher than the generally accepted numerical estimates which means the extended spans do not perform well in removing the influence of boundary conditions or in another word in simulating the real boundary conditions of panels although 1 span models with simply supported boundary condition as used by aalberg et al may result in underestimation they are a safe choice in designing real engineering structures and the experimental results can be used to validate and improve theoretical methods 4 conclusions five different model configurations are studied in order to investigate the influence of model extension and boundary conditions on the predicted buckling behaviour of aluminium integrally stiffened panels under uniaxial compressive loading it is shown that the residual stresses may improve the ultimate strength of the aluminium isps while the initial deformations will likely due to the particular collapse mode or deformation energy not only affect the level of ultimate strength but also change the failure mode of the structure it has been found that for the multi span models the simple supported boundary condition has a significant influence on the results for ultimate strength and cause buckling to occur in the central span other than in the extended span and result in numerical and experimental results lower than the actual load carrying capacity for other configurations of extension of models with varied boundary conditions increase of extension of model will reduce the influence of boundary conditions on the ultimate strength among them the symmetric condition does the best in this aspect and the fixed condition takes the second place systematic comparison shows that half multi half span models with symmetric boundary conditions are preferable for numerical simulations of ultimate strength and buckling behaviour of aluminium isps and the configuration of 1 2 1 1 2 span model with symmetric boundary conditions can be a good choice for the nfea as which avoids the risk of huge computational effort required and misunderstanding and also have a good accuracy use of 1 span model with simply supported boundary conditions in experiments may underestimate the ultimate strength of the aluminium isps but it is still an acceptable choice for engineering structural designs as underestimation of ultimate strength is equivalent to higher strength reserve in addition adoption of 1 span model with simply supported boundary conditions can also be meaningful because experimentation also serves to validate and improve theoretical

21494,the aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of model extension and boundary conditions on the buckling behaviour of aluminium integrally stiffened panels under uniaxial compressive loading two types of models with different extensions the multi span model and half multi half span model are employed and combined with various boundary conditions namely fixed simply supported and symmetric boundary conditions the fabrication related imperfections such as initial deformations material softening in heat affected zone and residual stresses are simulated in the numerical analysis the results show some new evidence of the effect of different model extension and boundary conditions on the numerical results for the ultimate strength of aluminium integrally stiffened panels which also explains the discrepancy between the experimental data and numerical results of aluminium integrally stiffened panels with the same cross section and span length the configurations of model extension and boundary conditions are proposed for numerical simulations and experimental tests of aluminium integrally stiffened panels keywords aluminium structure integrally stiffened panel buckling strength model extent boundary conditions 1 introduction stiffened panels are the elementary building block for many large steel structures and widely used in ship and offshore structures the main role of this type of structural component is to resist lateral load and also in plane compression guedes soares and soreide 1983 aluminium alloys with yield strengths ranging from 200 mpa to 600 mpa and having about one third the density and stiffness of steel can be easily cast machined drawn and extruded mazzolani 2003 due to the higher strength to weight ratio aluminium stiffened panels are increasingly employed in high speed ferries and ship superstructures as well as living quarters in offshore installations moan 2003 according to their manufacturing process aluminium stiffened panels break down into two types collette 2005 one is the traditional built up stiffened panels by joining the stiffeners to the skin plate and the other is welding extruded profiles which are known as integrally stiffened panel isp the isp consists of the base plate skin and single or multiple stiffeners stringer in a single component directly obtained by extrusion operations the isp eliminates the need to weld the stiffeners to the panel and has a better surface finish than built up panels as the only joint required is a longitudinal butt weld where the sections join which can typically be joined by automatic welding to form large flat decks very quickly and at reduced costs the aluminium association 2000 thus the isps are popular for internal decks and weather decks on high speed vessels and offshore structures aluminium alloys are more sensitive to welding than steel during the thermal cycle of welding process the heat added and conducted close to the welded seam does not only induce the geometrical distortions initial deformation and residual stresses but also reduces the yield stress and changes the shape of the stress strain curve in the heat affected zone haz around the weld the material softening in the haz will significantly affect the ultimate strength behaviour of aluminium structures whereas its effect in steel structures is of smaller importance mazzolani 2003 the initial deformation material softening and residual stresses are the 3 major forms of initial imperfections and they have significant influence on the mechanical performance of aluminium structures especially on the buckling behaviour the literature on aluminium panels is relatively limited in comparison with steel structures but there are still many results available the buckling or ultimate strength characteristics of stiffened aluminium panels has been investigated both experimentally mofflin 1983 zha and moan 2001 aalberg et al 2001 clarke and swan 1985 paik et al 2008 2009 rønning et al 2010 brando and matteis 2011 kristensen and moan 1999 and numerically mofflin 1983 aalberg et al 2001 kristensen and moan 1999 rigo et al 2003 khedmati and ghavami 2009 2010a 2010b paulo et al 2013 li et al 2017 paik and duran 2004 european committee for standardization 1998 most of these studies mainly focused on the investigation of the effect of material properties initial deformations and welding induced imperfections i e residual stresses and heat affected zones on the ultimate strength of unstiffened and stiffened aluminium panels little attention has been paid to the characteristics of the finite element model adopted namely the extension of the geometry and the boundary conditions as a representative of the behaviour of a larger panel the employment of different extensions of the model single bay two bay and three bay model and boundary conditions simply support fixed support and symmetric boundary condition in the numerical simulations have been recently studied for steel plates but there is no such systematic investigation for aluminium panels the ultimate strength of stiffened panels under compressive load is a highly nonlinear phenomenon including material and geometrical nonlinearities paik and thayamballi 2003 in a general sense a model that intends to represent the behaviour of a larger structure needs to have the appropriate boundary conditions thus it is very important to properly define the boundary conditions that are associated with the extension adopted for the model in nonlinear finite element analysis nfea in order to avoid the errors caused by excessively rigid or flexible boundary conditions it is desirable to take the entire structure into consideration when performing the nfea however real world engineering structures can be very large and conducting a conventional nfea with a model of the entire structure is usually impractical because of the huge computational effort required normally a model that is a cut out of the entire structure is often adopted for structural performance assessment for the evaluation of ultimate strength of ship hull by nfea besides 1 the entire hull model the commonly adopted extents of model are 2 the three cargo hold 1 1 1 model 3 the two cargo hold model 1 2 1 1 2 4 the one cargo hold model 5 the two bay sliced hull model 1 2 1 1 2 bay and 6 the single bay sliced hull model the computational efficiency improves from 1 to 6 but the numerical accuracy may drop due to the influence of artificial boundary conditions hughes and paik 2010 however aluminum and steel are not just different in the young s modulus and yield strength but also in many other mechanic properties the buckling behaviour or ultimate strength of stiffened panels is a complicated nonlinear problem that involves geometrical and material nonlinearities thus it is interesting and also necessary to study whether the findings of stiffened steel plates apply to stiffened aluminium plates to investigate the buckling behaviour of stiffened panels the extensions of model usually adopted are the 1 span panel model the 1 2 1 1 2 span panel model and the 3 span panel model the 1 span panel with fixed and simply supported boundary conditions are employed in most experimental investigations and numerical simulations this kind of models is suitable only when the restraint at the ends transverse frame location is either zero or infinity fixed or simply supported in reality the rigidity of transverse frames is neither infinite nor zero based on this consideration the latter two including transverse frames in the models are more suitable for the investigation of buckling behaviour and the translational and rotational restraints at the transverse frame locations on the rest of the model are automatically accounted for ghavami and khedmati 2006 carried out numerical and experimental investigations on the post buckling behaviour of 3 span steel stiffened panels with simply supported boundary conditions under compressive load the fem results show good consistency with the test results xu and guedes soares 2011 investigated the effect of different model configurations on the ultimate strength under compressive loading including 3 span 2 span 1 span and 1 2 1 1 2 span with fixed and simply supported boundary conditions 3 span gordo and guedes soares 2008 and the 2 span xu et al 2013a 2013b models were also used in the ultimate strength tests of the stiffened panels in addition xu and guedes soares 2013a 2013b investigated the influence of boundary conditions on the collapse behaviour of stiffened panels under uniaxial and combined loads in which the 1 2 1 1 2 span and 1 2 1 2 span models with symmetric conditions were employed in recent years the 1 2 1 1 2 span model with symmetric conditions have become more popular in numerical simulations all these studies have demonstrated sufficient accuracy for simulating the behaviour of large stiffened steel panels doan et al 2020 investigated the ultimate compressive strength of equivalent stiffened panels made of aluminium and steel and the results have shown that the equivalent stiffened panels yield at the same compressive load but the aluminium panels have higher ultimate strength than the steel panels however ideal plasto elastic models were used by doan et al for aluminium and steel while actual stress strain curves are usually recommend in engineering applications as aluminium alloys have smaller young s modulus than steels and there is no distinct yield platform in the stress strain curve thus it is unknown if these approaches are equally applicable to aluminium stiffened panels because the material properties of aluminium alloy are different from that of structural steel and also the effect of welding are different in the aforementioned studies of aluminium stiffened panels aalberg et al 2001 performed an experimental investigation on 1 span isps of aa6082 t2 with both l shaped stiffeners and closed stiffeners the test rig allowed the specimen ends loaded edges to rotate simply supported meanwhile it was capable of representing both simply supported and free boundary conditions along the two unloaded longitudinal edges of the test panels numerical simulations of these panels were carried out by paulo et al 2013 who also assessed the effects of initial deformations and material properties on ultimate strength the numerical results obtained by paulo et al were in good agreement with the experimental results by aalberg et al in the framework of a benchmark on the ultimate strength of aluminium stiffened panels carried out by the committee iii 1 ultimate strength of issc 2003 rigo et al 2003 where the same extrusion cross section with l shaped stiffeners fig 1 a as in aalberg et al s experimental investigation was chosen for the investigation the contributors built a 2 span fe model instead of 1 span test panel with simply supported along the unloaded edges and restrained rotation at the two loaded ends fig 1b shows the results in comparison with issc there are some distinct differences particularly in the collapse modes and ultimate load values which is probably caused by the different extents of model and particular boundary conditions adopted in the simulations in the continuation of the activities carried out by issc 2003 iii 1 khedmati et al 2010a worked on the post buckling behaviour of the three span panels under combined axial compression and lateral pressure and derived empirical formulations for estimation of ultimate strength khedmati et al 2010b li et al 2018 investigated the ultimate strength of stiffened aluminium panels and sensitivity assessment of ultimate strength to the imperfections typically the amplitude and shape of the initial deformations haz and residual stresses has been performed the objective of this study is to investigate the influence of the extension of the model and the boundary conditions on the buckling behaviour of aluminium isp under compressive load five different configurations of fe models with the same cross section and varying model extension and boundary conditions are employed to calculate the ultimate strength of the continuous aluminium isps the fabrication related imperfections such as initial deformations material softening in haz and residual stresses are also simulated the numerical results are compared and analysed to find out which configuration is more suitable for numerical simulations with acceptable accuracy to represent a larger structure and which is more appropriate to represent large panels in experimental or numerical simulation 2 numerical models 2 1 description of the extrusion cross section and material properties the extrusion cross section with l shaped stiffeners originally provided by aalberg et al 2001 fig 1a is chosen in the present study the integrally stiffened panels were built with five extruded aluminium profiles of aa6082 t6 and joined together by longitudinal welding the nominal dimensions of the extruded profiles are presented in fig 1a the nominal width of the extruded profiles is 252 5 mm and the total nominal width for panels with five extrusions is hence 1262 5 mm the measured geometric imperfections w 1 to w 5 fig 1a were negative opposite direction of stiffeners side and the amplitudes did not exceed 2 0 mm and varied smoothly the experiments were performed by a standard vertical loading frame with displacement control the axial compression load is applied at the upper end of the specimen through a stiff loading transverse beam while the reaction force is obtained at the lower end meanwhile the cylindrical bearing at the lower end allows test panels to rotate and the specially designed fixtures along the two longitudinal unloaded edges also provided simply supported boundary conditions fig 2 shows the true stress versus strain curves of aa6082 t6 in base metal and also the haz derived by issc 2003 iii 1 rigo et al 2003 which was originally provided by aalberg et al 2001 based on standard tensile test the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of base metal and softening material in haz is 70 000 n mm2 and 0 3 respectively the material properties are implemented into fe models via modelling by elasto plastic formulation with piecewise linear work hardening 2 2 model extension and boundary conditions two kinds of extension of models are employed in the present study one is the multi span models with an integer number n of spans and n 1 transverse frames such as 1 span 2 span 3 span 4 span and 5 span panel models and the other is the half multi half span models which is obtained by combining two extend half span ends with central whole spans such as 1 2 1 2 span 1 2 1 1 2 span 1 2 2 1 2 span and 1 2 3 1 2 span panel model combined with the different boundary conditions at the loaded ends five configurations of fe models are chosen to calculate the ultimate strength of the continuous isps namely the multi span models with fixed and simply supported boundary conditions respectively the half multi half span models with fixed simply supported and symmetric boundary condition respectively as typically illustrated by 3 span and 1 2 1 1 2 span models in fig 3 in the following definitions u v and w indicate translational displacements corresponding to the x y and z coordinates rx ry and rz stand for the rotational constraints about the coordinate axis and 0 indicates a constraint the boundary conditions on longitudinal edges parallel to the stiffeners have only a minor influence on panel strength but when the edges are fixed the panel strength slightly higher than simply supported boundary condition paik et al 2009 thus the two longitudinal unloaded edges in all five configurations fig 3 are modelled as simply supported i e w ry rz 0 with each edge restrained to keep it straight the displacements along z axis at the intersections between the plate and the central transverse frames are restrained i e w 0 the two transverse loaded ends are attached to rigid walls using marc rbe2 s element formulation to keep the ends moving around the reference points the reference points are created by longitudinal translation 25 mm offset along the x direction to the transverse end equal to the thickness of the bearing pads in ref aalberg et al 2001 of the centroid of cross sectional area which ensure the imposed axial displacement force transfer exactly through the neutral axis n a i e through the centroid of the panel cross sectional area for the first configuration fig 3a and third configuration fig 3c the fixed boundary condition is applied i e v w rx ry rz 0 with u imposed displacement for the second configuration fig 3b and the fourth configuration fig 3d the reference points allow the ends to rotate simply supported i e v w rx rz 0 with u imposed displacement for the last configuration fig 3e the symmetric boundary condition is applied i e ry rz 0 with u imposed displacement the third configuration assumes that the collapse deformations of the stiffened panels have a shape symmetric about the x axis which means that the two ends have the same displacement and inverse rotation 2 3 finite element modelling and solution techniques the same fe schemes and imperfection modelling techniques provided by issc 2003 iii 1 members rigo et al 2003 are employed in this study which are briefly introduced as follows 2 3 1 fe code element type and mesh size all analyses in this study are carried out using the commercial finite element code msc marc the same as lehmann et al in issc 2003 iii 1 four node thin shell element shell139 is employed to discrete the aluminium isp model the shell139 element has six degrees of freedom at each node which is powerful in non linear analysis and not sensitive to distortion tanaka et al 2014 in order to avoid the error introduced by the adopted mesh size a mesh size convergence study is performed the meshing configurations and corresponding numerical results are shown in table 1 the ultimate strength obtained with mesh configuration b is very close to the results obtained with configuration c and d thus configuration b as shown in fig 3 with 10 elements for the plate between each two adjacent stiffeners of which 2 for the plate in the haz 3 for the web of the stiffener and 1 for the flange is chosen in the present study which was also the configuration employed by lehmann et al 2 3 2 modelling of initial deformations since the geometrical imperfections measured by aalberg et al were the out of plane deflection along the transversal mid span of the panels only not in the longitudinal direction those data are not enough to develop initial deformation shapes for the numerical models besides the effect of initial deformations on the ultimate strength of aluminium stiffened panels is not the main concern in the present study according to the procedure for defining the initial deformations provided by issc 2003 iii 1 the shape of initial deformation is obtained by applying lateral pressure on one side of the plate as shown in fig 4 a the pressure is calibrated to obtain a linear elastic deflection w 3 of 2 mm at the central point of the central panel i e at mid span of the central stiffener in the negative direction as defined in fig 1 same as observed by aalberg et al and opposite to issc 2003 iii 1 2 3 3 modelling of haz when aluminium plates are welded zones with reduced yield strength and residual stresses are created the extension width of the haz is mainly affected by the applied welding process and the welding parameters as well as the material properties according to several studies zha and moan 2001 clarke and swan 1985 paik et al 2008 kristensen and moan 1999 and a eurocode european committee for standardization 1998 the width of the haz is suggested to extend 25 mm on each side of the weld note that 20 mm is proposed in eurocode 9 where softening material properties are assigned in these areas in the present study 50 mm 25 mm on each side of the weld is adopted as shown in fig 4b 2 3 4 modelling of residual stresses it is known that there are residual stresses in tension close to the welds and a corresponding residual stress in compression further away from the welds to maintain equilibrium for a given aluminium plate with a longitudinal butt weld fig 4b shows the actual distribution of residual stresses represented by the red line inside the plate for the convenience in numerical simulations an idealized distribution mode fig 4b represented by the blue line was adopted in several studies moan 2003 khedmati and ghavami 2009 paik and duran 2004 in which the width of the tensile residual stress block is equivalent to haz and the magnitude of stress is assumed equal to the flow limit of the material in haz and the corresponding residual stresses in compression can be found by imposing zero resultant forces 1 σ r b h a z σ r b b h a z 0 where σ r is the residual stresses in tension σ r the residual stresses in compression b the width of plate including haz and b h a z the width of haz the idealized distribution mode with tensile residual stress of 130 n mm 2 and width of 50 mm is employed the residual stresses are implemented into the fe models as initial stress 2 3 5 nonlinear solution method all calculations are performed by the arc length method which traces the equilibrium configurations with increments in the length of the arc this method is efficient for simulating the buckling or collapse behaviours where the load displacement response shows a negative stiffness and the structure must release strain energy to remain in equilibrium and has succeeded in capturing the snap back response in the vicinity of critical regions riks 1979 fig 5 illustrates the graphical interpretation of the arc length iteration technique 3 numerical results and discussions in all cases the loading capacity curves are expressed in terms of average stress average strain also called stress strain curve the average stress is the reaction force obtained from the reference point divided by the cross sectional area of the panel equal to 7649 mm2 and the average strain is the ratio of the applied displacement to the length of the panel 3 1 the multi span models with fixed condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the multi span models with fixed boundary conditions is analysed in this subsection firstly the ultimate strength results of the 3 span panel obtained in the present study is compared with these provided by issc 2003 iii 1 it is expected to obtain the same maximum stress and observe similar collapse modes with the same calculation conditions the effect of residual stresses and the shape of initial deformations is discussed secondly the influence of the variation of extent of multi span models with fixed boundary conditions on the ultimate strength is analysed for the first purpose four cases with different imperfections are employed case 1 the initial deformation is positive and has a standard magnitude of 2 mm and the haz is considered without residual stresses which is the same as employed by most contributors of issc 2003 iii 1 case 2 the initial deformation is the same as case 1 and the haz and residual stresses are implemented which is the same as lehmann et al in issc 2003 iii 1 case 3 the initial deformation is in the negative direction with standard magnitude the haz is included without residual stresses similar to case 1 but with an opposite initial deformation case 4 the initial deformation is same as case 3 and the haz and the residual stresses are also implemented which is regarded as the standard imperfection condition in this analysis the obtained results for these cases are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 and table 2 where they are also compared to those provided by issc 2003 iii 1 the stress strain curves in case 1 and case 2 obtained in the present study are very similar to those by the issc members the maximum stress is about 0 8 different from rigo et al s 9 5 from yao et al s and 6 9 from lehmann et al s in case 1 and 4 8 different from lehmann et al s in case 2 these differences are probably induced by the mesh size the element types the codes and the numerical procedures number of steps etc and especially the adopted values forming the material formulation in the fe modelling procedure the deflection modes of the panel in case 1 and case 2 fig 7a d show that the panel has a failure induced by a global flexural buckling in the central span followed by a stiffener tripping in the two extended spans which is consistent with the issc by comparing the ultimate strength with and without residual stresses case 1 versus case 2 case 3 versus case 4 it can be seen that the simulations with residual stresses produce slightly higher about 1 2 ultimate strength for the employed aluminium isp the same trends and phenomenon are also observed by lehmann et al a conclusion can be drawn that the residual stresses will improve the ultimate strength of the employed aluminium isp by 1 2 furthermore in comparison with the ultimate strength of the panels with different initial deformations case 1 versus case 3 case 2 versus case 4 it can be found that the ultimate strength of the panel with negative initial deformation is slightly smaller than the one with positive imperfections but still much higher than the values measured by aalberg et al about 117 n mm2 a possible cause for these phenomena is related to the collapse modes or deformation energy for the deflection modes of the panel in case 3 and case 4 fig 7e h the panel has a failure induced by stiffener tripping in the two extended spans with an out of plane deformation in the negative direction which is a little different from the case 1 and case 2 thus the initial deformations will not only affect the level of ultimate strength but also change the failure mode of the structure after the verification of the fe modelling and solution techniques employed in the present study the attention will be paid mainly to the influence of the model extension on the ultimate strength of multi span models with fixed boundary conditions the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 8 fig 9 and fig 10 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage of numerical simulation table 3 represents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes since the computational accuracy increases with the model extent the ultimate strength of the model with maximum of extent number of spans in the series is hereafter regarded as reference value and hence the maximum average stress of the 5 span model is taken as the reference value in this subsection it can be observed from the stress strain curves that the response curve of the 1 span model bears a somewhat large difference with the other four models and the stress strain curve of the 4 span model overlaps with that of the 5 span model after reaching the peak values a snap through occurs in the curves of the 2 span and the 3 span model in contrast a snap back is observed in the curves of the 4 span and the 5 span model with the increase of the extent the error relative to the reference value decreases from 12 4 to 1 6 and the numerical results for the ultimate strength of the 4 span model is very close to that of the 5 span model a close inspection of collapse modes shows that for all models the collapse is induced by stiffener tripping with out of plane deformation in the negative direction the buckling takes place in the extended spans for the 1 span 2 span and 3 span models but in the central span for the 4 span and 5 span models besides the boundary conditions all the spans have the same material cross section dimension and initial imperfections since the buckling of the 1 span model 2 span model and 3 span model is located in the extended span the artificial boundary conditions may have an influence on the accuracy of numerical results however this influence according to the saint venant principle can be excluded for the 4 span and 5 span models as the buckle is located in the central span hence the numerical results for the 4 span model and the 5 span model match better with the loading characteristics of actual structures 3 2 the multi span models with simply supported condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the multi span models with simply supported boundary conditions is analysed in this subsection firstly the ultimate strength of the 1 span panel is compared with these provided by aalberg et al 2001 and paulo et al 2013 it is also expected to obtain equal values and similar response to the references secondly the influence of the variation of extent of multi span models with simply supported boundary conditions on the ultimate strength is performed fig 11 shows the stress strain curve of 1 span model with simply supported conditions compared with the results by different researchers table 4 represents a summary of the results for the ultimate strength and collapse modes it is found that the trend of the stress strain curve and the accuracy of ultimate strength obtained based on the present analyses are in good agreement with those carried out by other researchers with the increase of axial displacement average strain the axial load average stress increases almost linearly up to the ultimate load afterwards there are sudden increases of out of pane deflection and sideway tripping deflection of stiffener stiffener tripping as shown in fig 13a and fig 14a and accompanied by rapid decrease in axial load the same phenomena in the pre buckling post buckling and post collapse are also observed by aalberg et al but a more severe drop after the peak values was obtained by paulo et al focusing on the initial stage of the stress strain curves there is a distinct deviation between the experimental measured and theoretical initial stiffness the slope of response curves it is caused by the inclusion of the deformations in the teflon sheet and the lubricant in the thrust bearings in the measured axial displacement explained by aalberg et al in comparison with the ultimate strength obtained by the aalberg et al the maximum difference is about 6 8 and the minimum difference is about 3 9 to the measured values the differences are probably induced by the adopted nominal geometrical dimensions of cross section material properties and initial deformation in fe modelling procedure in comparison with the results obtained by paulo et al there is a difference of 7 2 from the panel with a 2 mm initial deformation although the same magnitude is used which is mainly caused by the different adopted shape of initial deformation for the simulations performed by paulo et al the initial deformations are obtained by the eigenvalue analyses ev and the first order mode is adopted now the influence of the model extension on the ultimate strength of multi span models with simply supported boundary conditions is investigated the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 12 figs 13 and 14 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage of numerical simulation table 5 presents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes it can be found that with the increase of the extension the stress strain curve of 1 span model is very different from that of the others except the 1 span model the snap back occurs in the response curves after reaching the peak values for the other models it is remarkable that with the increase of the extension the numerical results for the maximum average stress converge in a fluctuating other than a monotonic pattern the 1 span model having the lowest value for the maximum stress among the five bears a difference of 22 76 from that of the 5 span model while the 2 span model has the highest maximum stress 6 15 than the 5 span model compared to the numerical results for the fixed boundary conditions as presented in table 3 the results obtained with simply supported boundary conditions are clearly smaller which again proves that the implemented boundary conditions in nfea have a significant influence on the ultimate strength of aluminium isp it can be observed from the collapse modes of the models that the collapses of all models are a result of stiffener tripping however with all the models the buckling takes place in the extended span therefore the influence of artificial boundary conditions cannot be excluded and the results may lack fidelity it is very likely to make the objective assumption that transverse frames and bulkheads can effectively support the longitudinal structural members plate stiffeners etc and then come to the intuitive conclusion that the simply supported boundary condition compared to the fixed boundary condition is more appropriate however the numerical results show that the actual boundary of panels can be more complex and the application of simply supported boundary conditions introduces negative influences 3 3 the half multi half span models with fixed condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the half multi half span models with fixed boundary conditions is analysed in this subsection the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 15 fig 16 and fig 17 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage of numerical simulation table 6 represents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes it can be found that before reaching the maximum stress the stress strain curves of the three models are almost same for the 1 2 1 1 2 span model the stress decreases slowly after the peak value while for the other two models snap back occurs after reaching the peak values and the load carrying capacity rapidly reduces a comparison of the results shows that the 1 2 1 1 2 span and the 1 2 2 1 2 span models have similar ultimate strengths and they are slightly larger than that of the 1 2 3 1 2 span model 4 8 and 5 5 higher respectively inspection of the collapse modes of the three models indicates that the failure is induced by the stiffener tripping with out of plane deformation in the negative direction and the buckle is located in the central span and adjacent to the extended half span ends 3 4 the half multi half span models with simply supported condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the half multi half span models with simply supported boundary conditions is analysed in this subsection the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 18 fig 19 and fig 20 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage table 7 represents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes it can be found that the pattern of the stress strain curves of the three models are very similar to those obtained with fixed boundary conditions for the 1 2 1 1 2 span model the stress decreases slowly after reaching the peak value while for the other two models a snap back is observed and the load carrying capacity drops rapidly the values and differences of ultimate strength of the three models are also very similar to those obtained with the fixed boundary condition the 1 2 1 1 2 span and the 1 2 2 1 2 span models have similar ultimate strengths which are 5 5 and 4 3 higher than that of the 1 2 3 1 2 span model in this case the failure is also induced by the stiffener tripping with out of plane deformation in the negative direction and the buckle is located at the central span 3 5 the half multi half span models with symmetric condition at loaded ends the buckling behaviour of the half multi half span models with symmetric condition is analysed in this subsection the stress strain curves for all models are compared with each other in fig 21 fig 22 and fig 23 show the deflection modes of all models at ultimate strength level and final stage of numerical simulation table 8 represents a summary of all results regarding the ultimate strength and collapse modes it can be seen that the stress strain curves of the four models are almost the same and there is only a very slight difference in the value of maximum stress and post collapse region after the stress reaching the peak value snap back occurs in the response curve after reaching the ultimate strength and the load carrying capacity rapidly drops the four models have very similar values of maximum average stress with the maximum relative error being 2 2 in this case the failure is also induced by the stiffener tripping with out of plane deformation in the negative direction the buckle is located at the boundary of the 1 2 1 2 span model while for the other three models it is located in the central span it appears that the half multi half span models with symmetric conditions can produce more reasonable numerical results however this conclusion is too soon to be made before the further comparison and analysis of other configurations and models 3 6 summary discussion for the purpose of better description the assumptions that have been made previously are re emphasized here so as to lead the following two general main requirements of analysis a when the buckle is located in the extended span or half span the use of the accuracy of numerical results is doubtful as the influence of artificial boundary conditions cannot be excluded b on the premise of a the ultimate strength of the model with maximum number of spans in the present discussion is considered most accurate and is taken as the reference value table 9 presents a summary of results for the models with the five configurations for the multi span model with fixed boundary conditions the results for the 4 span and 5 span models are obtained in accordance with the requirements stated above and are thus taken as the reference value for this series for the multi span models with simply supported boundary conditions the obtained results do not satisfy the requirements because in all the models the buckle is located in the extended span thus there is no reference value for this series and all the maximum stresses of these models are smaller than other configurations for the half multi half span models with fixed boundary conditions all the results of the all three models comply with the two requirements and maximum stress of the 1 2 3 1 2 span model is taken as the reference results for this series for the half multi half span models with simply supported and symmetric boundary condition the results are similar to those obtained for the half multi half span models with fixed boundary conditions fig 24 shows the stress strain curves of the models whose ultimate strength is taken as the reference value it can be found that the pattern and accuracy of the response curves are in good agreement with each other the difference in the value of maximum stress is negligible ranging from 0 6 to 1 1 there are small differences in the post collapse region which however do not come into the analysis of ultimate strength it can be concluded that the ultimate strength of the aluminium isp investigated in the present study under uniaxial compressive loading is about 160 n mm2 which is approximately 60 of the yield strength of its base metal hence the results obtained by issc 2003 iii 1 are acceptable while the ones provided by aalberg et al are somewhat underestimated in order to achieve a balance between the number of elements of the model and the computational efficiency it is suggested to use the half multi half span models with symmetric boundary conditions for numerical investigation of ultimate strength and buckling behaviour of aluminium isp according to the results presented in subsection 3 5 the 1 2 1 1 2 span model with symmetric condition is preferable for numerical simulations for two reasons it avoids the excessive tedious work of modelling and the danger of using artificial boundary conditions and at the same time produces numerical results of acceptable accuracy however it is obvious that symmetric conditions can hardly be implemented in experiments at the same time numerical analysis shows that the ultimate strength of aluminium isp is very sensitive to simply supported boundary condition and the 1 span model with simply supported boundary conditions will underestimate the load carrying capacity of panels thus if experimental facility allows multi span 4 span or 5 span models with fixed boundary condition should be used and more satisfactory experimental results can be expected on the other hand the sizes of models cannot be very large or wide due to the constraints of the experimental facilities a common practice to avoid the influence of boundary conditions is to use 1 span with two non integer extended span models table 10 presents a list of frequently used extended models with both simply supported and fixed boundary conditions it can be seen that the results obtained with the listed models are higher than the generally accepted numerical estimates which means the extended spans do not perform well in removing the influence of boundary conditions or in another word in simulating the real boundary conditions of panels although 1 span models with simply supported boundary condition as used by aalberg et al may result in underestimation they are a safe choice in designing real engineering structures and the experimental results can be used to validate and improve theoretical methods 4 conclusions five different model configurations are studied in order to investigate the influence of model extension and boundary conditions on the predicted buckling behaviour of aluminium integrally stiffened panels under uniaxial compressive loading it is shown that the residual stresses may improve the ultimate strength of the aluminium isps while the initial deformations will likely due to the particular collapse mode or deformation energy not only affect the level of ultimate strength but also change the failure mode of the structure it has been found that for the multi span models the simple supported boundary condition has a significant influence on the results for ultimate strength and cause buckling to occur in the central span other than in the extended span and result in numerical and experimental results lower than the actual load carrying capacity for other configurations of extension of models with varied boundary conditions increase of extension of model will reduce the influence of boundary conditions on the ultimate strength among them the symmetric condition does the best in this aspect and the fixed condition takes the second place systematic comparison shows that half multi half span models with symmetric boundary conditions are preferable for numerical simulations of ultimate strength and buckling behaviour of aluminium isps and the configuration of 1 2 1 1 2 span model with symmetric boundary conditions can be a good choice for the nfea as which avoids the risk of huge computational effort required and misunderstanding and also have a good accuracy use of 1 span model with simply supported boundary conditions in experiments may underestimate the ultimate strength of the aluminium isps but it is still an acceptable choice for engineering structural designs as underestimation of ultimate strength is equivalent to higher strength reserve in addition adoption of 1 span model with simply supported boundary conditions can also be meaningful because experimentation also serves to validate and improve theoretical
