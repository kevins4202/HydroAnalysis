exploring and developing the ocean because of their intelligence convenience and efficiency the future trend of ocean exploration is toward deep blue which puts forward higher requirements on the strength reliability and endurance of auv in particular the hull strength of auv directly determines its maximum working depth auv widely uses the torpedo shape due to its superior hydrodynamic performance therefore the central part of the auv is usually cylindrical which provides the main space for the mounted sensors and equipment it is not easy to accurately study and analyze the strength of the auv composite hull it is necessary to consider material properties structural forms pressure and temperature changes and seawater corrosion but there is no definite model and design standard this paper studies the strength and stability of the auv composite reinforced cylindrical hull based on finite element analysis fea and response surface method rsm it is aiming to design a high strength lightweight hull that can provide an adequate sizeable internal space it is also why many scholars use numerical simulation or experiment methods to carry out the research adding ribs to the

geometry model the composite hull studied in this paper has been successfully applied to the auv engineering prototype and has passed multiple sea trials the composite hull adopts the structural form of metal interface and non metal hull body the metal interface material is 7075 t6 aluminum alloy and the interface is connected with other hull sections through wedge rings the stepped surface is knurled to increase the reliability of the connection between the metal interface and the non metal hull body the entire metal interface is treated with hard anodizing to increase surface hardness and corrosion resistance t700 carbon fiber epoxy composite material is selected to make a non metal hull body the composite hull adopts the layered structure composed of 22 axial layers and 47 circumferential winding layers the thickness for the layer of the composite is between 0 15 mm and 0 25 mm the internal layer is made by a three dimensional weaving process a waterproof rubber layer is provided on the connection between the metal interface and non metal hull to prevent water seepage the entire outer surface of the composite hull is sprayed with a polyurea layer to prevent the hull from colliding and increase the surface s smoothness strengthening ribs are provided at both ends and the middle of the composite hull to enhance the strength of the lightweight composite hull the auv engineering prototype is shown in fig 1 and the composite hull structure is shown in fig 2 many factors affect the structure and strength of the hull in this paper the parameters that have a crucial effect on the strength of the hull are selected and studied which are the length l of the hull the thickness t of the hull the width w and height h of rib in order to improve the efficiency and reliability of simulation and optimization design the initial thickness of the hull is preliminarily calculated according to the empirical formula and the reasonable value range is determined the outer diameter d of the hull is 324 mm d t is greater than 20 if t is 15 mm according to the classification of the national standard of the people s republic of china pressure vessel the hull is thin walled 1 l c r 1 17 d d t 1 2 according to the formula of the critical length of hull l c r is calculated at about 1762 mm according to the use requirements the length of the hull is less than 1000 mm after the design is completed l is less than l c r and the hull is a short tube based on the small deflection theory of cylindrical metal shell the critical buckling pressure of a thin walled short tube is expressed as 2 p cr 2 59 e r t d 2 5 l d 3 t d 0 6 p c r l 2 59 e r 0 4 t can be obtained from the above formula it can be obtained by simplifying the classical lamination theory of composite material mechanics 4 e 11 e x m 4 2 2 g x y g y z m 2 n 2 e y n 4 5 e 22 e x n 4 2 2 g x y g y z m 2 n 2 e y m 4 6 m cos θ 7 n sin θ where p c r is the critical instability pressure e r is the average hoop modulus of the hull e 11 is the hoop modulus of the longitudinal fiber layer e 22 is the axial modulus of the longitudinal fiber layer e x is the elastic modulus of the fiber direction e y is the elastic modulus perpendicular to the fiber direction g x y is the shear modulus in the xy plane g y z is the shear modulus in the yz plane θ is the winding angle the deep sea type iii pressure vessel studied by junior and papaelias 2021 adopts 7075 t6 aluminum alloy as the inner lining and t700 carbon fiber epoxy composite material wound on the outside the pressure vessel is also made of t700 carbon fiber epoxy composite material wang et al 2015 liao et al 2019 this paper refers to the mechanical properties of composite material in the literature as shown in tables 1 and 2 the maximum working depth of the hull studied in this paper is 1500 m and the pressure is about 15 mpa the design safety factor is 1 5 so the critical instability pressure p c r is 22 5 mpa the 45 winding angle is adopted for estimation and the thickness ratio of the hoop axial layer is set to 2 1 according to the principle of modulus distribution of composite laminates e r can be expressed as 8 e r 1 3 e 11 2 3 e x the hull length is calculated as 900 mm and the thickness of the hull is estimated at 11 mm to compare the theoretical calculation value with the actual test value the first version of the composite hull was processed and the pressure test was carried out the first version of the hull is made of t700 carbon fiber and 7075 t6 aluminum alloy the outer diameter of the hull is 324 mm and the length of the hull is 900 mm due to the uncertainty of the axial load and the requirement to prevent water seepage the thickness has been increased to 15 mm including the effective pressure resistance thickness of 12 mm and the collision proof waterproof layer of 3 mm during the pressure test staged pressurization is carried out and the pressurization speed is 2 3 mpa min after the pressure reaches 3 mpa 5 mpa 10 mpa and 15 mpa it is maintained for 2 min respectively at the 15th minute of the pressure test when the pressure rose to 17 4 mpa the hull burst and failed the boosting process and the damaged hull are shown in fig 3 the pressure test results of the first version composite hull show that the following two conclusions 1 the actual strength and stability of the hull are not as high as theoretical calculations the thickness of 11 mm can reach the compressive strength of 22 5 mpa by theoretical calculation while the actual ultimate compressive strength of the effective thickness of 12 mm is 17 4 mpa 2 although the strength of the hull with an effective thickness of 12 mm meets the requirements of auv use at 1500 m underwater the safety margin is low the risk of using this hull is high which affects the reliability of auv increasing the thickness is a general way to improve the strength and stability of the hull but it will reduce the space in the hull and increase the weight of the hull at the same time which affects the endurance of auv therefore it is essential to find a way to optimize the pressure resistant structure and parameters of the composite hull which can meet strength and stability requirements and achieve a lightweight design actual stress testing is time consuming and costly in this paper based on ansys workbench and design expert the composite hull is studied the structural form of small thickness and built in hoop strengthening ribs is applied rsm is used to optimize the critical parameters of the hull and ribs and the sensitivity analysis is carried out the critical parameters and their changes are shown in table 3 3 fea and response surface 3 1 overall optimization process in this paper solidworks is used for 3d parametric modeling of the composite hull and the model is imported into ansys workbench for static structural analysis modeling and simulation calculations are carried out on the asus expertcenter d5 tower desktop computer the computer is equipped with a sixteen core intel r core tm i7 10700 cpu 2 90 ghz and 32 0 gb ram with strong processing performance the overall optimization process is shown in fig 4 first the material type and characteristics are set in the engineering database the material characteristic values are from the literature mentioned above and then confirm the number of variables and initial values in the geometry module then the mesh division is completed in the model module based on the tetrahedron method and the pia the advantage of this algorithm is to keep the larger mesh as much as possible after ensuring the necessary mesh refinement thereby speeding up the calculation it can repair the geometry and allow the existence of poor quality geometry it is required to set the number of cells across the gap when refining which is limited by the minimum mesh size it is set to 3 in this simulation process after the mesh is generated the refinement of the mesh is stepped with the medium mesh surrounding the smallest mesh analytical settings are made in the static structure module including uniformly distributed external pressure equivalently calculated axial load and restraint method of the composite hull finally the solution information is clarified in the solution module the goal is to obtain the maximum equivalent stress maximum shear stress and maximum total deformation and distribution the results of the simulation calculation are presented in the result module after completing the simulation of the variable s initial value set the name and unit of the input and output parameters in the parameter module respectively then enter the response surface optimization stage four input parameters are selected and limited in the experimental design link after confirming the output parameters perform the experimental design based on box behnken after the simulation calculation is completed the value of the output parameters can be automatically filled in the designed experiment table the response surface image between any two input parameters and one output parameter is established in the response surface module and the input parameter is compared with the output parameter the sensitivity analysis of the influence of input parameters on output parameters is carried out in the optimization process we select the target type of each output parameter and adopt screening and moga to optimize the output parameters the candidate design points are listed in the result table 3 2 finite element analysis the initial geometric model of the composite hull is established in solidworks and t is 15 mm l is 900 mm h is 5 mm w is 60 mm in order to improve the efficiency of fea multi parameter integrated modeling is adopted the interior of the hull interface is supported by high strength connectors the ultimate strength test results show that the strength requirements are met the finite element model is established in ansys workbench using tetrahedral mesh and the mesh division is based on pia three minimum mesh sizes 2 mm 3 mm and 5 mm are used to study the mesh sensitivity of the composite hull the difference among the results of all mesh sizes is less than 3 therefore 3 mm minimum mesh size is adopted and the number of cells across the gap is 3 after the mesh is refined it is distributed in a stepped manner with 3082927 nodes and 2138355 elements the meshing is shown in fig 5 radial fixed support is applied to the inner diameter arc surface of the interface and strengthening ribs at both ends of the hull the hull s outer surface is applied to a constant uniform pressure of 20 mpa about 1 3 times the maximum working depth pressure of auv the total axial equivalent load of the hull interface is 1648959 n multiplied by the pressure and cross sectional area the two axial support surfaces are allocated by the area respectively 517134 n and 1131825 n the solution targets are equivalent stress shear stress and total deformation the corresponding cloud maps are shown in fig 6 with a magnification of 10 the results show that the maximum equivalent stress of the initial model of the three rib hull is 811 16 mpa located in the interior of the hull supported by a connector the maximum shear stress is 120 06 mpa distributed along the axial strengthening rib on both sides the maximum total deformation is 2 69 mm and it is symmetrically distributed around the central strengthening rib the mass of the hull is 23 34 kg the entrance of the wedge ring is obviously deformed by axial load extrusion so the annular cover must be installed during pressure test and deep sea trial after parameter setting according to table 3 the box behnken experiment design is performed in ansys workbench to obtain 25 design points and complete numerical calculation through the calculation results and fig 6 it is known that the central strengthening rib has little effect on the equivalent stress but significantly reduces shear stress and total deformation the equivalent stress of the three rib schemes all meet the requirements the shear stress exceeds the allowable range the total deformation is slightly more prominent and the hull s stability is not high therefore the four reinforcement scheme is adopted to improve stability and consistent modeling and analysis are performed the initial finite element model of the four rib hull contains 3143401 nodes and 2177989 elements and the distance between the ribs is consistent as shown in fig 7 the simulation results of the initial model of the four rib hull are demonstrated in fig 8 the results show that the maximum equivalent stress of the initial model of the four rib hull is 836 55 mpa which is also located in the interior of the hull supported by a connector the maximum shear stress is 114 85 mpa situated in the middle of the hull the maximum total deformation is 2 58 mm which is distributed in a strip along the axial direction the width of the middle part of the hull is more significant and the width of the region supported by ribs is smaller the mass of the hull is 23 83 kg the comparison between the three rib and four rib hull at 25 design points is shown in fig 9 the following conclusions can be drawn from fig 9 compared with the three rib hull the equivalent stress change law of the four rib hull is more complicated and the equivalent stress of some models is slightly increased but they all meet the strength requirements the shear stress and total deformation of the four rib hull are generally reduced the maximum shear stress is still greater than the shear strength and the interval between the two ribs in the middle needs to be further optimized the mass of the four rib hull is slightly larger than that of the three rib hull due to the additional rib 3 3 response surface optimization the response surface of the three rib and four rib hull are established and optimized in the response surface module three dimensional response surface images of any two input parameters and one output parameter can be obtained the goodness of fit of the response surface is shown in fig 10 it can be seen from the fitness images of the two response surfaces that the fit of mass and maximum total deformation are perfect and the design points are distributed on a straight line the relative root mean square error of mass and maximum total deformation of the four rib hull are 0 and 0 01 respectively the fitting of the maximum shear stress of the four rib hull is better than that of the three rib hull and the relative root mean square error is 0 71 the relative root mean square error of the maximum equivalent stress of the four rib hull is 2 40 the response surface established in workbench is shown in fig 11 the left side is the response surface of the three rib hull and the right side is the response surface of the four rib hull it can be seen from the image that t and w have a more apparent effect on the equivalent stress compared with the other two parameters t and l have more significant effects on shear stress total deformation and mass the above conclusions are consistent with ansys workbench sensitivity analysis results as shown in fig 12 we determine the optimization strategy and establish a multi objective optimization model the maximum equivalent stress and shear stress must meet the strength requirements and obtain the minimum value and the mass and maximum total deformation shall be minimum the model is solved by screening and moga and no optimization results are obtained for the three rib hull the optimization results of the four rib hull are shown in table 4 the mathematical model of multi objective optimization is 9 s max v c s min s max v s max v s s min s max v min d max v min m v 800 l 1000 14 t 16 4 h 6 55 w 65 where s max is the maximum equivalent stress c s is the compressive strength s max is the maximum shear stress s s is the shear strength s max is the maximum total deformation m is the mass v is a variable set v l t h w the hull optimized by the screening method is too long and heavy which is not convenient for processing and practical application the results optimized by the moga method are consistent except for the length of the hull considering the difficulty of actual processing l is determined to be 900 mm and the remaining parameters are rounded to 16 mm 4 mm and 55 mm based on the principle of proximity the optimized design parameters are directly used to establish the optimization model of strengthening rib interval the interval d between the two ribs in the middle is taken as a single variable to perform fea the parameter settings and analysis results are shown in table 5 the data in table 5 shows that the equivalent stress increases first and then decreases as the interval of the central ribs decreases which all meet the strength requirements the shear stress decreases first and then increases but the change is not apparent meeting the shear strength requirements the total deformation gradually increases the response surface is established based on kriging optimization calculations are performed with the equivalent stress and shear stress meeting the strength requirements and taking the minimum value as the objective the optimization result is d 150 mm 4 response surface based on design expert 4 1 response surface optimization the box behnken experiment is designed in design expert and the response surface quadratic model is established and analyzed using data from 25 design points the response surface is shown in fig 13 in fig 13 the left side is the response surface of the three rib hull and the right side is the response surface of the four rib hull it is found that the maximum shear stress and total deformation of the four rib hull are significantly smaller than that of the three rib hull especially when t is small when t and w are both smaller the maximum equivalent stress of the four rib hull is greater than that of the three rib hull the increase in the number of ribs reduces the influence of w on the maximum equivalent stress of the hull this change is more apparent when t is small under the same parameters the increase in the number of ribs will cause the mass to increase slightly since the mass gain does not change much this is acceptable the above conclusion shows that it is correct to increase the number of ribs to reduce the maximum shear stress by comparing the response surface shown in figs 11 and 13 it is found that the response surface models established by the two methods are highly consistent the coefficient of determination r 2 is used to evaluate the goodness of fit and the value of r 2 is shown in table 6 the following conclusions can be drawn from the table the response surface models established by the above two methods have a better fit for maximum total deformation and mass the goodness of fit established for the three rib hull is higher than that of the four rib hull the response surface model based on design expert has a better fit than the model based on ansys workbench 4 2 response surface quadratic model the quadratic model is one of the crucial models commonly used in rsm the general expression of the response surface quadratic model is 10 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k 1 j i 1 k β i j x i x j i 1 k β i i x i 2 ɛ where x is the independent variable y is the dependent variable k is the number of independent variables β 0 is a constant β i β i i and β i j are the coefficient of variables ɛ is random experiment error and assumed to be zero in this paper the response surface quadratic model is established in the design expert analysis module the model of maximum equivalent stress maximum shear stress maximum deformation and mass are respectively expressed as 11 s max 8374 141 1 483 l 527 678 t 191 278 h 70 811 w 0 067 l t 0 053 l h 5 690 1 0 3 l w 3 253 t h 0 134 t w 1 080 h w 2 913 1 0 4 l 2 14 037 t 2

w 2 14 m 1 401 1 767 1 0 3 l 0 028 t 0 053 h 0 016 w 1 675 1 0 3 l t 8 870 1 0 20 l h 5 000 1 0 6 l w 2 500 1 0 3 t h 5 000 1 0 4 t w 6 500 1 0 3 h w 2 083 1 0 7 l 2 5 833 1 0 3 t 2 0 002 h 2 3 333 1 0 5 w 2 it can be seen from the model expression that the coupling effect of t h and t w on the maximum deformation is not significant and the coupling effect of l h on the mass is so weak that it can be ignored in the calculation parameter optimization is done in the design expert optimization module and the results are consistent with the previous results the optimized parameters of the composite hull are shown in table 7 the strength and stability of the optimized hull are analyzed table 8 shows the comparison between the prediction results of the response surface quadratic model and the numerical simulation results based on ansys the results verify the accuracy of the response surface quadratic model and the errors are all within 4 this model can be used to predict the characteristics of the hull accurately 5 experiment verification the optimized hull is made by the three dimensional weaving process after the composite hull is processed the autoclave test and the sea trial are carried out successively strain gauges are used to construct a hull strain detection system the strain gauges are closely attached to the inner hull in a circular and longitudinal alternate manner detecting strains in different directions the hull s inner bottom is equipped with a leak detection device which can monitor water seepage and leakage in real time the strain detection system and leak detection device are shown in fig 14 the pressure test is carried out in stages and one test is divided into three stages 0 8 mpa 8 12 mpa and 12 18 mpa after the first two stages are completed the pressure is maintained for 10 min and the pressure is maintained for 1 h after the pressure reaches 18 mpa in order to test the fatigue resistance of the hull a total of five cyclic tests are carried out the test results show that the hull is normal and there is no water seepage in order to simulate the natural working environment of auv three cycle tests are carried out afterward the test is divided into five stages 0 3 mpa 3 6 mpa 6 9 mpa 9 12 mpa 12 15 mpa after completing the first and third stages the pressure is maintained for 2 min the pressure is maintained for 5 min after the completion of the second and fourth stages after the pressure reaches 15 mpa the pressure is maintained for 1 h the pressure test setting interface and hull are shown in fig 15 after completing the pressure test the strength and reliability of the composite hull are verified based on x ray non destructive inspection technology the auv engineering prototype conducted a standardized sea trial near the xisha islands in the south china sea 18 1 n 111 e in december 2020 completed two submerged trials and monitored the entire strain state of the hull in real time in the first submerged trial auv sails steadily at the desired depth of 1550 m for 570 s and the maximum dive depth reaches 1557 m the maximum dive depth of the second submerged trial is 1549 m after the completion of the two submerged trials auv returns safely and is successfully recovered the trials show that the composite hull is reliable the standardized sea trial in the south china sea is shown in fig 16 and the depth change of the first dive is demonstrated in fig 17 during the sea trial the strain detection data and pressure sensor data were fused to carry out bidirectional calibration on the one hand the pressure sensor data can be calibrated to the strain detection data so that the strain detection data can be better matched with the diving depth on the other hand the strain detection data can be used to check the pressure sensor data to give early warning when the auv exceeds the safe depth to further improve the reliability of the auv the strain state of the hull is shown in fig 18 6 conclusions in this paper the strength and stability of the auv carbon fiber composite hull are numerically simulated based on parametric modeling and fea the rsm is adopted to generate 3d response surface images and the input parameters are analyzed and optimized a response surface quadratic model is established based on the simulated samples the strength and stability of the hull are verified through trials and the reliability of this method is also verified the relevant conclusions drawn through the research of this paper are as follows the strength to weight ratio of carbon fiber composite is much greater than that of metals the main failure modes of carbon fiber composite hull are shear and instability failure the equivalent stress of the contact part of the hull and connector is more significant the shear stress and total deformation of the middle part of the hull are more considerable the thickness of the hull has the most significant influence on the strength and stability of the hull the length of the hull has no apparent effect on the equivalent stress the elongation of the hull will lead to an increase in shear stress and total deformation arranging annular strengthening ribs in the hull is an effective way to improve strength and stability and the width of ribs does not need to be large the height of ribs plays a major role and as the height increases the equivalent stress and total deformation can be effectively reduced it is also critical to determine the installation location of ribs this paper proposes a new research idea for auv cylindrical pressure hull and the method is highly versatile and can be applied in many fields an accurate response surface model can be established to predict parameters using appropriate experimental design methods through efficient modeling and accurate simulation there are still deficiencies in the research of this paper for example the impact of changing seawater temperatures and corrosion on the carbon fiber composite hull is not taken into account the difference in strength and stability of the interface between isotropic and anisotropic materials has not been studied this

exploring and developing the ocean because of their intelligence convenience and efficiency the future trend of ocean exploration is toward deep blue which puts forward higher requirements on the strength reliability and endurance of auv in particular the hull strength of auv directly determines its maximum working depth auv widely uses the torpedo shape due to its superior hydrodynamic performance therefore the central part of the auv is usually cylindrical which provides the main space for the mounted sensors and equipment it is not easy to accurately study and analyze the strength of the auv composite hull it is necessary to consider material properties structural forms pressure and temperature changes and seawater corrosion but there is no definite model and design standard this paper studies the strength and stability of the auv composite reinforced cylindrical hull based on finite element analysis fea and response surface method rsm it is aiming to design a high strength lightweight hull that can provide an adequate sizeable internal space it is also why many scholars use numerical simulation or experiment methods to carry out the research adding ribs to the

geometry model the composite hull studied in this paper has been successfully applied to the auv engineering prototype and has passed multiple sea trials the composite hull adopts the structural form of metal interface and non metal hull body the metal interface material is 7075 t6 aluminum alloy and the interface is connected with other hull sections through wedge rings the stepped surface is knurled to increase the reliability of the connection between the metal interface and the non metal hull body the entire metal interface is treated with hard anodizing to increase surface hardness and corrosion resistance t700 carbon fiber epoxy composite material is selected to make a non metal hull body the composite hull adopts the layered structure composed of 22 axial layers and 47 circumferential winding layers the thickness for the layer of the composite is between 0 15 mm and 0 25 mm the internal layer is made by a three dimensional weaving process a waterproof rubber layer is provided on the connection between the metal interface and non metal hull to prevent water seepage the entire outer surface of the composite hull is sprayed with a polyurea layer to prevent the hull from colliding and increase the surface s smoothness strengthening ribs are provided at both ends and the middle of the composite hull to enhance the strength of the lightweight composite hull the auv engineering prototype is shown in fig 1 and the composite hull structure is shown in fig 2 many factors affect the structure and strength of the hull in this paper the parameters that have a crucial effect on the strength of the hull are selected and studied which are the length l of the hull the thickness t of the hull the width w and height h of rib in order to improve the efficiency and reliability of simulation and optimization design the initial thickness of the hull is preliminarily calculated according to the empirical formula and the reasonable value range is determined the outer diameter d of the hull is 324 mm d t is greater than 20 if t is 15 mm according to the classification of the national standard of the people s republic of china pressure vessel the hull is thin walled 1 l c r 1 17 d d t 1 2 according to the formula of the critical length of hull l c r is calculated at about 1762 mm according to the use requirements the length of the hull is less than 1000 mm after the design is completed l is less than l c r and the hull is a short tube based on the small deflection theory of cylindrical metal shell the critical buckling pressure of a thin walled short tube is expressed as 2 p cr 2 59 e r t d 2 5 l d 3 t d 0 6 p c r l 2 59 e r 0 4 t can be obtained from the above formula it can be obtained by simplifying the classical lamination theory of composite material mechanics 4 e 11 e x m 4 2 2 g x y g y z m 2 n 2 e y n 4 5 e 22 e x n 4 2 2 g x y g y z m 2 n 2 e y m 4 6 m cos θ 7 n sin θ where p c r is the critical instability pressure e r is the average hoop modulus of the hull e 11 is the hoop modulus of the longitudinal fiber layer e 22 is the axial modulus of the longitudinal fiber layer e x is the elastic modulus of the fiber direction e y is the elastic modulus perpendicular to the fiber direction g x y is the shear modulus in the xy plane g y z is the shear modulus in the yz plane θ is the winding angle the deep sea type iii pressure vessel studied by junior and papaelias 2021 adopts 7075 t6 aluminum alloy as the inner lining and t700 carbon fiber epoxy composite material wound on the outside the pressure vessel is also made of t700 carbon fiber epoxy composite material wang et al 2015 liao et al 2019 this paper refers to the mechanical properties of composite material in the literature as shown in tables 1 and 2 the maximum working depth of the hull studied in this paper is 1500 m and the pressure is about 15 mpa the design safety factor is 1 5 so the critical instability pressure p c r is 22 5 mpa the 45 winding angle is adopted for estimation and the thickness ratio of the hoop axial layer is set to 2 1 according to the principle of modulus distribution of composite laminates e r can be expressed as 8 e r 1 3 e 11 2 3 e x the hull length is calculated as 900 mm and the thickness of the hull is estimated at 11 mm to compare the theoretical calculation value with the actual test value the first version of the composite hull was processed and the pressure test was carried out the first version of the hull is made of t700 carbon fiber and 7075 t6 aluminum alloy the outer diameter of the hull is 324 mm and the length of the hull is 900 mm due to the uncertainty of the axial load and the requirement to prevent water seepage the thickness has been increased to 15 mm including the effective pressure resistance thickness of 12 mm and the collision proof waterproof layer of 3 mm during the pressure test staged pressurization is carried out and the pressurization speed is 2 3 mpa min after the pressure reaches 3 mpa 5 mpa 10 mpa and 15 mpa it is maintained for 2 min respectively at the 15th minute of the pressure test when the pressure rose to 17 4 mpa the hull burst and failed the boosting process and the damaged hull are shown in fig 3 the pressure test results of the first version composite hull show that the following two conclusions 1 the actual strength and stability of the hull are not as high as theoretical calculations the thickness of 11 mm can reach the compressive strength of 22 5 mpa by theoretical calculation while the actual ultimate compressive strength of the effective thickness of 12 mm is 17 4 mpa 2 although the strength of the hull with an effective thickness of 12 mm meets the requirements of auv use at 1500 m underwater the safety margin is low the risk of using this hull is high which affects the reliability of auv increasing the thickness is a general way to improve the strength and stability of the hull but it will reduce the space in the hull and increase the weight of the hull at the same time which affects the endurance of auv therefore it is essential to find a way to optimize the pressure resistant structure and parameters of the composite hull which can meet strength and stability requirements and achieve a lightweight design actual stress testing is time consuming and costly in this paper based on ansys workbench and design expert the composite hull is studied the structural form of small thickness and built in hoop strengthening ribs is applied rsm is used to optimize the critical parameters of the hull and ribs and the sensitivity analysis is carried out the critical parameters and their changes are shown in table 3 3 fea and response surface 3 1 overall optimization process in this paper solidworks is used for 3d parametric modeling of the composite hull and the model is imported into ansys workbench for static structural analysis modeling and simulation calculations are carried out on the asus expertcenter d5 tower desktop computer the computer is equipped with a sixteen core intel r core tm i7 10700 cpu 2 90 ghz and 32 0 gb ram with strong processing performance the overall optimization process is shown in fig 4 first the material type and characteristics are set in the engineering database the material characteristic values are from the literature mentioned above and then confirm the number of variables and initial values in the geometry module then the mesh division is completed in the model module based on the tetrahedron method and the pia the advantage of this algorithm is to keep the larger mesh as much as possible after ensuring the necessary mesh refinement thereby speeding up the calculation it can repair the geometry and allow the existence of poor quality geometry it is required to set the number of cells across the gap when refining which is limited by the minimum mesh size it is set to 3 in this simulation process after the mesh is generated the refinement of the mesh is stepped with the medium mesh surrounding the smallest mesh analytical settings are made in the static structure module including uniformly distributed external pressure equivalently calculated axial load and restraint method of the composite hull finally the solution information is clarified in the solution module the goal is to obtain the maximum equivalent stress maximum shear stress and maximum total deformation and distribution the results of the simulation calculation are presented in the result module after completing the simulation of the variable s initial value set the name and unit of the input and output parameters in the parameter module respectively then enter the response surface optimization stage four input parameters are selected and limited in the experimental design link after confirming the output parameters perform the experimental design based on box behnken after the simulation calculation is completed the value of the output parameters can be automatically filled in the designed experiment table the response surface image between any two input parameters and one output parameter is established in the response surface module and the input parameter is compared with the output parameter the sensitivity analysis of the influence of input parameters on output parameters is carried out in the optimization process we select the target type of each output parameter and adopt screening and moga to optimize the output parameters the candidate design points are listed in the result table 3 2 finite element analysis the initial geometric model of the composite hull is established in solidworks and t is 15 mm l is 900 mm h is 5 mm w is 60 mm in order to improve the efficiency of fea multi parameter integrated modeling is adopted the interior of the hull interface is supported by high strength connectors the ultimate strength test results show that the strength requirements are met the finite element model is established in ansys workbench using tetrahedral mesh and the mesh division is based on pia three minimum mesh sizes 2 mm 3 mm and 5 mm are used to study the mesh sensitivity of the composite hull the difference among the results of all mesh sizes is less than 3 therefore 3 mm minimum mesh size is adopted and the number of cells across the gap is 3 after the mesh is refined it is distributed in a stepped manner with 3082927 nodes and 2138355 elements the meshing is shown in fig 5 radial fixed support is applied to the inner diameter arc surface of the interface and strengthening ribs at both ends of the hull the hull s outer surface is applied to a constant uniform pressure of 20 mpa about 1 3 times the maximum working depth pressure of auv the total axial equivalent load of the hull interface is 1648959 n multiplied by the pressure and cross sectional area the two axial support surfaces are allocated by the area respectively 517134 n and 1131825 n the solution targets are equivalent stress shear stress and total deformation the corresponding cloud maps are shown in fig 6 with a magnification of 10 the results show that the maximum equivalent stress of the initial model of the three rib hull is 811 16 mpa located in the interior of the hull supported by a connector the maximum shear stress is 120 06 mpa distributed along the axial strengthening rib on both sides the maximum total deformation is 2 69 mm and it is symmetrically distributed around the central strengthening rib the mass of the hull is 23 34 kg the entrance of the wedge ring is obviously deformed by axial load extrusion so the annular cover must be installed during pressure test and deep sea trial after parameter setting according to table 3 the box behnken experiment design is performed in ansys workbench to obtain 25 design points and complete numerical calculation through the calculation results and fig 6 it is known that the central strengthening rib has little effect on the equivalent stress but significantly reduces shear stress and total deformation the equivalent stress of the three rib schemes all meet the requirements the shear stress exceeds the allowable range the total deformation is slightly more prominent and the hull s stability is not high therefore the four reinforcement scheme is adopted to improve stability and consistent modeling and analysis are performed the initial finite element model of the four rib hull contains 3143401 nodes and 2177989 elements and the distance between the ribs is consistent as shown in fig 7 the simulation results of the initial model of the four rib hull are demonstrated in fig 8 the results show that the maximum equivalent stress of the initial model of the four rib hull is 836 55 mpa which is also located in the interior of the hull supported by a connector the maximum shear stress is 114 85 mpa situated in the middle of the hull the maximum total deformation is 2 58 mm which is distributed in a strip along the axial direction the width of the middle part of the hull is more significant and the width of the region supported by ribs is smaller the mass of the hull is 23 83 kg the comparison between the three rib and four rib hull at 25 design points is shown in fig 9 the following conclusions can be drawn from fig 9 compared with the three rib hull the equivalent stress change law of the four rib hull is more complicated and the equivalent stress of some models is slightly increased but they all meet the strength requirements the shear stress and total deformation of the four rib hull are generally reduced the maximum shear stress is still greater than the shear strength and the interval between the two ribs in the middle needs to be further optimized the mass of the four rib hull is slightly larger than that of the three rib hull due to the additional rib 3 3 response surface optimization the response surface of the three rib and four rib hull are established and optimized in the response surface module three dimensional response surface images of any two input parameters and one output parameter can be obtained the goodness of fit of the response surface is shown in fig 10 it can be seen from the fitness images of the two response surfaces that the fit of mass and maximum total deformation are perfect and the design points are distributed on a straight line the relative root mean square error of mass and maximum total deformation of the four rib hull are 0 and 0 01 respectively the fitting of the maximum shear stress of the four rib hull is better than that of the three rib hull and the relative root mean square error is 0 71 the relative root mean square error of the maximum equivalent stress of the four rib hull is 2 40 the response surface established in workbench is shown in fig 11 the left side is the response surface of the three rib hull and the right side is the response surface of the four rib hull it can be seen from the image that t and w have a more apparent effect on the equivalent stress compared with the other two parameters t and l have more significant effects on shear stress total deformation and mass the above conclusions are consistent with ansys workbench sensitivity analysis results as shown in fig 12 we determine the optimization strategy and establish a multi objective optimization model the maximum equivalent stress and shear stress must meet the strength requirements and obtain the minimum value and the mass and maximum total deformation shall be minimum the model is solved by screening and moga and no optimization results are obtained for the three rib hull the optimization results of the four rib hull are shown in table 4 the mathematical model of multi objective optimization is 9 s max v c s min s max v s max v s s min s max v min d max v min m v 800 l 1000 14 t 16 4 h 6 55 w 65 where s max is the maximum equivalent stress c s is the compressive strength s max is the maximum shear stress s s is the shear strength s max is the maximum total deformation m is the mass v is a variable set v l t h w the hull optimized by the screening method is too long and heavy which is not convenient for processing and practical application the results optimized by the moga method are consistent except for the length of the hull considering the difficulty of actual processing l is determined to be 900 mm and the remaining parameters are rounded to 16 mm 4 mm and 55 mm based on the principle of proximity the optimized design parameters are directly used to establish the optimization model of strengthening rib interval the interval d between the two ribs in the middle is taken as a single variable to perform fea the parameter settings and analysis results are shown in table 5 the data in table 5 shows that the equivalent stress increases first and then decreases as the interval of the central ribs decreases which all meet the strength requirements the shear stress decreases first and then increases but the change is not apparent meeting the shear strength requirements the total deformation gradually increases the response surface is established based on kriging optimization calculations are performed with the equivalent stress and shear stress meeting the strength requirements and taking the minimum value as the objective the optimization result is d 150 mm 4 response surface based on design expert 4 1 response surface optimization the box behnken experiment is designed in design expert and the response surface quadratic model is established and analyzed using data from 25 design points the response surface is shown in fig 13 in fig 13 the left side is the response surface of the three rib hull and the right side is the response surface of the four rib hull it is found that the maximum shear stress and total deformation of the four rib hull are significantly smaller than that of the three rib hull especially when t is small when t and w are both smaller the maximum equivalent stress of the four rib hull is greater than that of the three rib hull the increase in the number of ribs reduces the influence of w on the maximum equivalent stress of the hull this change is more apparent when t is small under the same parameters the increase in the number of ribs will cause the mass to increase slightly since the mass gain does not change much this is acceptable the above conclusion shows that it is correct to increase the number of ribs to reduce the maximum shear stress by comparing the response surface shown in figs 11 and 13 it is found that the response surface models established by the two methods are highly consistent the coefficient of determination r 2 is used to evaluate the goodness of fit and the value of r 2 is shown in table 6 the following conclusions can be drawn from the table the response surface models established by the above two methods have a better fit for maximum total deformation and mass the goodness of fit established for the three rib hull is higher than that of the four rib hull the response surface model based on design expert has a better fit than the model based on ansys workbench 4 2 response surface quadratic model the quadratic model is one of the crucial models commonly used in rsm the general expression of the response surface quadratic model is 10 y β 0 i 1 k β i x i i 1 k 1 j i 1 k β i j x i x j i 1 k β i i x i 2 ɛ where x is the independent variable y is the dependent variable k is the number of independent variables β 0 is a constant β i β i i and β i j are the coefficient of variables ɛ is random experiment error and assumed to be zero in this paper the response surface quadratic model is established in the design expert analysis module the model of maximum equivalent stress maximum shear stress maximum deformation and mass are respectively expressed as 11 s max 8374 141 1 483 l 527 678 t 191 278 h 70 811 w 0 067 l t 0 053 l h 5 690 1 0 3 l w 3 253 t h 0 134 t w 1 080 h w 2 913 1 0 4 l 2 14 037 t 2

w 2 14 m 1 401 1 767 1 0 3 l 0 028 t 0 053 h 0 016 w 1 675 1 0 3 l t 8 870 1 0 20 l h 5 000 1 0 6 l w 2 500 1 0 3 t h 5 000 1 0 4 t w 6 500 1 0 3 h w 2 083 1 0 7 l 2 5 833 1 0 3 t 2 0 002 h 2 3 333 1 0 5 w 2 it can be seen from the model expression that the coupling effect of t h and t w on the maximum deformation is not significant and the coupling effect of l h on the mass is so weak that it can be ignored in the calculation parameter optimization is done in the design expert optimization module and the results are consistent with the previous results the optimized parameters of the composite hull are shown in table 7 the strength and stability of the optimized hull are analyzed table 8 shows the comparison between the prediction results of the response surface quadratic model and the numerical simulation results based on ansys the results verify the accuracy of the response surface quadratic model and the errors are all within 4 this model can be used to predict the characteristics of the hull accurately 5 experiment verification the optimized hull is made by the three dimensional weaving process after the composite hull is processed the autoclave test and the sea trial are carried out successively strain gauges are used to construct a hull strain detection system the strain gauges are closely attached to the inner hull in a circular and longitudinal alternate manner detecting strains in different directions the hull s inner bottom is equipped with a leak detection device which can monitor water seepage and leakage in real time the strain detection system and leak detection device are shown in fig 14 the pressure test is carried out in stages and one test is divided into three stages 0 8 mpa 8 12 mpa and 12 18 mpa after the first two stages are completed the pressure is maintained for 10 min and the pressure is maintained for 1 h after the pressure reaches 18 mpa in order to test the fatigue resistance of the hull a total of five cyclic tests are carried out the test results show that the hull is normal and there is no water seepage in order to simulate the natural working environment of auv three cycle tests are carried out afterward the test is divided into five stages 0 3 mpa 3 6 mpa 6 9 mpa 9 12 mpa 12 15 mpa after completing the first and third stages the pressure is maintained for 2 min the pressure is maintained for 5 min after the completion of the second and fourth stages after the pressure reaches 15 mpa the pressure is maintained for 1 h the pressure test setting interface and hull are shown in fig 15 after completing the pressure test the strength and reliability of the composite hull are verified based on x ray non destructive inspection technology the auv engineering prototype conducted a standardized sea trial near the xisha islands in the south china sea 18 1 n 111 e in december 2020 completed two submerged trials and monitored the entire strain state of the hull in real time in the first submerged trial auv sails steadily at the desired depth of 1550 m for 570 s and the maximum dive depth reaches 1557 m the maximum dive depth of the second submerged trial is 1549 m after the completion of the two submerged trials auv returns safely and is successfully recovered the trials show that the composite hull is reliable the standardized sea trial in the south china sea is shown in fig 16 and the depth change of the first dive is demonstrated in fig 17 during the sea trial the strain detection data and pressure sensor data were fused to carry out bidirectional calibration on the one hand the pressure sensor data can be calibrated to the strain detection data so that the strain detection data can be better matched with the diving depth on the other hand the strain detection data can be used to check the pressure sensor data to give early warning when the auv exceeds the safe depth to further improve the reliability of the auv the strain state of the hull is shown in fig 18 6 conclusions in this paper the strength and stability of the auv carbon fiber composite hull are numerically simulated based on parametric modeling and fea the rsm is adopted to generate 3d response surface images and the input parameters are analyzed and optimized a response surface quadratic model is established based on the simulated samples the strength and stability of the hull are verified through trials and the reliability of this method is also verified the relevant conclusions drawn through the research of this paper are as follows the strength to weight ratio of carbon fiber composite is much greater than that of metals the main failure modes of carbon fiber composite hull are shear and instability failure the equivalent stress of the contact part of the hull and connector is more significant the shear stress and total deformation of the middle part of the hull are more considerable the thickness of the hull has the most significant influence on the strength and stability of the hull the length of the hull has no apparent effect on the equivalent stress the elongation of the hull will lead to an increase in shear stress and total deformation arranging annular strengthening ribs in the hull is an effective way to improve strength and stability and the width of ribs does not need to be large the height of ribs plays a major role and as the height increases the equivalent stress and total deformation can be effectively reduced it is also critical to determine the installation location of ribs this paper proposes a new research idea for auv cylindrical pressure hull and the method is highly versatile and can be applied in many fields an accurate response surface model can be established to predict parameters using appropriate

20181,the cargo oil system is an irreplaceable component of a tanker of which the operational safety affects task completion this study proposes an operational safety evaluation methodology for fusing multiple task information which identifies the assessment level and abnormal points different data features are used to express the changes in the operating state at different time stages to improve the performance of the method the data monitoring error analysis technique based on distance and coefficient of variation approach are employed to deal with uncertainty and subjectivity the optimal data reliability and comprehensive weight are then fed as input values to the evidential reasoning er rule the proposed operational safety evaluation methodology has been applied to the cargo pump system of a 49 000 ton tanker comparing with equipment maintenance records the results of the proposed method can reflect the actual task safety condition and verify the feasibility and effectiveness furthermore weak links and improvement measures present new insights for operational safety management for tanker corporations keywords multiple task information cargo oil system operational safety evaluation fusion er 1 introduction crude oil is considered the blood of industry as well as the main driving force of various activities in modern society particularly due to the expanded generation and utilization of petroleum over recent decades tanker has become an irreplaceable vehicle for cross border trade cargo oil system is mainly used for loading and discharging which is however not risk free above all due to the complex structure phased operation long service time and physicochemical properties of cargo oil a majority of dangerous factors in course of running will inevitably increase potential risks hazardous or even catastrophic consequences will happen to personnel tanker port and marine eco environment zhao et al 2012 once excessive leakage and fire explosion chen et al 2020 guo et al 2016 occur therefore the operational safety assessment of cargo oil system has become the significant module of the oil tanker transportation reliability which has attracted substantial attention from ship owners shipping companies and maritime regulatory authorities and is also the focus of research by relevant professional scholars burgherr 2007 chen et al 2019 vidmar and perkovič 2018 focused on the statistics and trend analysis of the number of oil spills from tankers in recent decades and discussed the key factors behind oil spill and the potential losses on this basis many scholars evaluated the risk of oil spill in tanker collision by simulation kim et al 2015 experiment tavakoli et al 2011 and case analysis goerlandt and montewka 2014 hou et al 2017 li et al 2019 moreover according to the international tanker owners pollution federation 2016 tanker leakage occurs during loading 40 and unloading 30 which usually occurs in ports oil terminals and the largest part 60 is caused by fire explosion and equipment failure most of which are caused by equipment and ship body failure vanem et al 2008 summarized the lng accidents in history and found that the collision risk was the highest by reviewing the previous research however no specific accident reason analysis was conducted and no specific suggestions and measures were put forward to control the accidents as a result appropriate management tools should be considered to improve the safety level of chemical tankers during cargo operations arslan 2009 fault tree analysis fta method was used to construct the accident model of liquefied natural gas lng ship when loading and unloading liquid cargo which can conduct risk analysis on the consequences of the accident and to propose recommendations and operational measures to prevent leakage and bayesian network bn was used to analyze the dynamic safety of the unloading process of lng carrier and the results showed that collision was the most likely accident in the unloading process which may cause disastrous consequences yeo et al 2016 cargo oil system factors were proposed as the main contributor and significant issues to hazardous loading and discharging accidents the commonly used security assessment methods are mainly divided into three categories namely model based methods knowledge based methods and data driven methods the first type needs a detailed system working mechanism but it is often difficult to build a mathematical model the second one needs to obtain prior knowledge and the results are greatly affected by the subjective will of experts the third one is mainly based on test or sensor data which is poor in performance and interpretability when the amount of data is small in addition some scholars have improved and strengthened the ship monitoring system to ensure operational safety based on the international ship management code an advanced liquid cargo ship cargo monitoring system was built with the decision support kim et al 2008 to provide a basic follow up function deployment and application of intelligent ship li et al 2020 designed the hardware system and basic software platform which can exchange data in a unified format through sharing according to the design characteristics of the aframax tanker plessas et al 2016 simulated the cargo unloading process of the tanker which can monitor all relevant ship parameters such as the characteristics of pump valve group pipeline system flow pressure ship response etc and then a multi criteria optimization method based on preference was applied to the modeling simulation process operating data of the cargo oil system could be collected through the automation system however the lack of effective statistics classification and analysis restrain the decision support of operational safety management furthermore as a multi level and multi faceted process information fusion can monitor connect correlate estimate and combine multi source data to achieve accurate state estimation which has been widely used from this point of view it is essential to develop a methodology to incorporate operating parameters into safety evaluation for effective accident prevention a methodology for evaluating the operational safety of tanker cargo oil system is proposed in this study by applying the evidential reasoning er rule to fuse multiple task information the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the theoretical background of er rule and the operational safety evaluation model with an illustrative real case construction of index system detailed data acquisition fusion results of er rule and discussions are embedded in section 3 eventually section 4 concludes this paper 2 methodology 2 1 er review in order to overcome the difficulty that the traditional dempster shafer d s evidence theory cannot effectively deal with the conflict evidence and combinatorial explosion problem based on meeting the traditional bayesian joint probability reasoning yang and sen 1994 yang and singh 1994 proposed er method in 1994 and further developed it yang 2001 yang et al 2006 yang and xu 2002 moreover to effectively distinguishes the reliability and weight of evidence yang and xu 2013 propounded er rule which was widely applied in various fields wang 2000 proposed a decision making framework based on subjective safety analysis which used er to synthesize safety at different levels so as to generate the priority related to design or operation for ranking purpose and to conduct formal ship safety assessment considering the cable laying conditions and their impact on maritime safety a fuzzy argumentation method for submarine cable routing in offshore wind farms was proposed jiang et al 2019 wan et al 2018 established the quantitative measurement and evaluation model of green port development and used er method to summarize the evaluation results of each index port using a unified method consisting of fuzzy group decision making fuzzy evidence reasoning methods and the concept of expected utility pathak et al 2021 evaluated the key success factors of sustainable freight transportation according to the four competitive priorities and developed an evaluation framework of comprehensive performance wu et al 2018 incorporated er and prioritization techniques similar to ideal solutions in emergency decision making and then proposed an improved non command ship handling method which was applied to the main engine failure as an example chang et al 2021 combined failure mode and effect analysis fmea methods with er and rule based bayesian networks rbn to quantify the risk level of identified maritime autonomous surface vessel mass hazards the reliability and weight are the two key parameters of evidence typical methods for obtaining weights include the coefficient of variation method the maximum deviation method the objective weighting method and the expert scoring method as for the typical methods for obtaining reliability there are distance based methods probability statistics based methods task oriented methods and complexity based methods chen and zhou 2020 applied the analytic algorithm of er yang and xu 2013 to complete performance evaluation of weaponry equipment including the coefficient of variation method and distance based method from the latest literature zhou et al 2021 systematically combed the development process of evidence theory around confidence distribution and finally made a brief review and prospect of evidence theory from practical applications 2 2 operational safety evaluation model of cargo oil system the operational safety evaluation model is established based on er rule mainly including constructing index system calculating reliability and weight converting input data and fusing multiple information and the flowchart is shown in fig 1 then the specific procedures of all approaches are expressed in the following steps step 1 analytic hierarchy process ahp is adopted to establish the evaluation index system and evaluation target for top level can be divided into multiple primary indexes and then each level index can continue to refine into multiple secondary indexes for example x i is the i th first level index and x i k is the k th second level index through the integration of multi layer er from bottom to top the evaluation result of the target is finally obtained step 2 calculate the data reliability 1 x i k o 1 t t 1 t x i k o t 2 h x i k o t x i k o t x i k o 3 h x i k o 1 t t 1 t h x i k o t 1 t t 1 t x i k o t x i k o therefore the data reliability of the index is as follows 4 ε x i k o h x i k o max h x i k o t where x i k o means index x i k in task o x i k o t is the data of index x i k at moment t t 1 2 t in task o o 1 2 o and x i k o represents the average value of all x i k o t furthermore ε x i k o is the data reliability of index x i k in task o h x i k o t represents the distance between x i k o t and x i k o h x i k o represents the average distance between x i k o t and other values this method focuses on the degree of interference in the process of data acquisition and assumes that the monitoring data does not contain the consistency deviation caused by system error step 3 calculate the weight of each index the coefficient of variation method is to dynamically allocate the weight of each index according to the relative change magnitude of each index the greater the change of index value the stronger the ability to identify the corresponding index features and the greater the corresponding index weight 5 ω x i k o ξ x i k o k 1 l ξ x i k o 6 ξ x i k o s x i k o x i k o 7 s x i k o 1 t 1 t 1 t x i k o t x i k o 2 finally mixed weight comprehensively considers the reliability in step 3 and ω x i k o as shown in formula 8 8 ϖ x i k o ω x i k o 1 ω x i k o ε x i k o where ω x i k o and s x i k o respectively represent the weight and variance of index x i k in task o and ξ x i k o can reflect the relative change of index x i k in task o ϖ x i k o is the mixed weight of index x i k in task o step 4 uniform information format different indexes have different information formats which may be in the form of numerical value subjective distribution or qualitative description accordingly before information fusion the input information needs to be transformed into a unified framework for description assuming that there are l basic attributes x 1 x 2 x k x l and defining n evaluation levels d d 1 d 2 d j d n so the belief distribution is as follows 9 s x k d j β j k j 1 2 n k 1 2 l where β j k has the following form 10 β j k x k b j 1 x k b j 1 b j j n b j x k b j 1 1 β j k x k j n 1 0 j n n 1 where β j k x k is the belief degree of x k then b j and b j 1 represent two adjacent evaluation level reference values and x k represents the input value to be converted step 5 the distributed belief structure obtained by er rule can be expressed as 11 s x d j β j j 1 2 n where β j is the belief of evaluation result d j and analytic algorithm of er rule is as follows 12 β j μ k 1 l ϖ k β j k 1 ϖ k j 1 n β j k k 1 l 1 ϖ k j 1 n β j k 1 μ k 1 l 1 ϖ k 13 μ k 1 l j 1 n ϖ k β j k 1 ϖ k k 1 l β j k n 1 k 1 l 1 ϖ k j 1 n β j k 1 where l and n respectively represent the number of evidence and evaluation levels and ϖ k β j k respectively represent the mixed weight of x k and the belief degree of x k relative to evaluation level d j step 6 fuse the results obtained in steps 3 4 and 5 through er rule to own the operational safety evaluation result of the confidence structure 3 case study 3 1 constructing evaluation index system of cargo pump the cargo oil pump yang et al 2013 yüksel and köseoğlu 2020 the key power equipment of cargo oil system and the heart of a tanker can make cargo oil flow in the oil pipeline the operating state directly affects the progress of the unloading task thus evaluating operational safety is significant in light of the actual operation state the operation plan can be adjusted in time for maintenance or replacement to ensure efficient and safe completion of a mission most modern large oil tankers chose vertical centrifugal pumps driven by steam turbines as the main cargo pumps during operation the deterioration of components and equipment and the interference of human factors will affect the performance of the cargo pumps the failure modes as shown in fig 2 a cargo pump system generally with three cargo pumps is selected as the research object and its operational safety is the evaluation objective bottom bearing temperature pump casing temperature and upper bearing temperature are selected as indexes so three level evaluation system is established as shown in fig 3 x i is the i th first level index and x i k is the k th second level index of the i th first level index 3 2 acquiring operating parameters of cargo pump communicating with oil companies cargo oil system of the current tanker has the function of real time acquisition and display of operation data but task values aren t fully utilized so it is difficult to provide data support for the operation and maintenance so as sensing technology computer technology and communication developing ship shore integration has become the trend wherein the framework of cargo oil management system is shown in fig 4 in which safety risk evaluation is an essential module among them beidou navigation satellite system bds is a global satellite navigation system developed by china and it s also the third mature satellite navigation system applied widely in marine transportation huang et al 2017 xin and gao 2019 after global position system gps and global navigation satellite system glonass this paper uses its unique short message function to establish the ship shore communication module as shown in fig 5 which can not only transmit the data collected by the sensor to the shore based monitoring center but also send the relevant commands of the shore based management personnel to the monitored ship so through cooperation with an oil company a 49 000 ton crude oil tanker is selected which is composed of three vertical centrifugal cargo pumps with single stage and double suction besides each cargo pump selects 9 consecutive unloading tasks and after filtering out abnormal data every index obtains 54 groups among which each task includes 6 moments t 1 2 3 4 5 6 three dimensional data lists are displayed in fig 6 additionally the cargo oil pump system has completed a total of 16 unloading tasks and the pump combination of each task is shown in table 1 3 3 results and discussion the above acquired monitoring data are input into the calculation of secondary er and primary er then the evaluation level of each pump s operating state and the risk level of cargo pump system in every task are obtained on this basis making statistical analysis on the results and calculating the task risk level of different pump combinations and further proposing existing weakness and improvement measures 3 3 1 calculation of secondary er fusion through secondary er the belief degree of four evaluation levels of each cargo pump at 54 moments in 9 tasks are attained as shown in fig 7 fig 8 and fig 10 in sequence thereafter the overall statistical analysis of evaluation results is made and the abnormal situations are analyzed by combing with the equipment maintenance history records 1 1 cargo pump there are 9 tasks meanwhile task 4 o 4 is selected as an example to present step2 to step5 the operating parameters from moment 19 to 24 in fig 6 a are displayed in table 2 firstly calculating reliability weight and mixed weight ε x 1 k 4 the reliability of x 1 k in task 4 can be calculated from formula 1 to 4 and ω x 1 k 4 the weight of x 1 k in task 4 can be calculated from formula 5 to 7 further synthesizing ε x 1 k 4 and ω x 1 k 4 into formula 8 ϖ x 1 k 4 the comprehensive weight of x 1 k in task 4 is obtained the specific results are as following ε x 1 1 4 0 4483 ε x 1 2 4 0 5480 ε x 1 3 4 0 4195 ω x 1 1 4 0 0814 ω x 1 2 4 0 7979 ω x 1 3 4 0 1207 ϖ x 1 1 4 0 1286 ϖ x 1 2 4 0 6384 ϖ x 1 3 4 0 1721 secondly converting into belief degrees according to the technical information of the cargo pump and the experience and knowledge of the crew semantic value and the corresponding quantitative value are shown in table 3 according to table 3 and formula 10 the data in table 2 is converted into β j x 1 k 4 t which means belief degree of the j th j 1 2 3 4 semantic value of x 1 k at moment t in task 4 taking t 1 in table 2 as an example the belief degree corresponding to four semantic values are calculated indicated as below β 1 x 1 1 4 1 0 1533 β 2 x 1 1 4 1 0 8467 β 3 x 1 1 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 1 4 1 0 β 1 x 1 2 4 1 0 1467 β 2 x 1 2 4 1 0 8533 β 3 x 1 2 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 2 4 1 0 β 1 x 1 3 4 1 0 2267 β 2 x 1 3 4 1 0 7733 β 3 x 1 3 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 3 4 1 0 then based on the safety protection requirements in the tanker operation specification four reference grades are set for the operation state of cargo pump expressed as d d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 h e a l t h y q u a l i f i e d a b n o r m a l f a u l t by substituting the above results into formulas 12 and 13 the operational state evaluation belief degree of x 1 at t 1 in task 4 can be got listed hereafter β 1 x 1 4 1 0 8969 β 2 x 1 4 1 0 1031 β 3 x 1 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 4 1 0 so the belief distribution form shown in formula 9 can be described as s x 1 4 1 d 1 0 8969 d 2 0 1031 d 3 0 d 4 0 in light of the above the evaluation result of 1 cargo pump at t 1 in task 4 is h e a l t h y 0 8969 q u a l i f i e d 0 1031 a b n o r m a l 0 f a u l t 0 so according to the principle of maximum membership operating status is verbalized as h e a l t h y at last through repeating the above process the belief degree distribution and evaluation result of 1 cargo pump operating state at every moment in each task are calculated according to evaluation levels the belief degrees of 9 tasks are plotted as 4 column charts a b c and d shown in fig 7 in fig 7 the overall trend is to plateau decline and then recover the statistical result is h e a l t h y 48 88 89 q u a l i f i e d 4 7 41 a b n o r m a l 2 37 f a u l t 0 0 and nearly 90 is h e a l t h y specifically the statistical results of the 9 tasks are shown in table 4 among them the first 3 tasks were stable and in h e a l t h y but in tasks 4 and 5 the belief degree of h e a l t h y declined from 0 89 to 0 57 more seriously task 6 started with q u a l i f i e d then the operational performance deteriorated gradually over time and when t 5 6 it turned into a b n o r m a l by task 7 the operational performance was significantly improved and restored to h e a l t h y with low belief degree task 8 and 9 had been adjusted to h e a l t h y next the running data in fig 6 a and equipment maintenance records are analyzed for significant performance degradation in task 4 x 1 1 and x 1 3 increased sharply at t 1 respectively from 45 c to 55 c and from 40 c to 45 c and the temperatures continued to rise slightly in task 5 but inspection and maintenance had not been carried out after entering task 6 x 1 1 and x 1 3 continued to increase and reached a maximum of 58 2 c and 57 c respectively at t 4 after completing task 6 there were records of overhauling coupling and replacing journal universal joint so it is speculated that during tasks 4 to 6 the associated accessories of the pump shaft were seriously damaged resulting in a rapid increase in temperature after maintenance the performance of 1 pump was improved and by the grinding in of task 7 the operations of the subsequent two missions were restored 2 2 cargo pump the calculation process is the same as 1 cargo pump according to evaluation levels the belief degree of 9 tasks are plotted as 4 column charts a b c and d shown in fig 8 in fig 8 the state is on a downtrend the proportion of the four conditions at 54 moments is h e a l t h y 18 33 33 q u a l i f i e d 19 35 19 a b n o r m a l 15 27 78 f a u l t 2 3 7 firstly the proportions of the first three conditions are close but q u a l i f i e d are the highest and there are two faults indicating that the pump performed with risk secondly further analyzing every task the running performance had been gradually declining in 9 tasks and most of the other tasks were q u a l i f i e d and a b n o r m a l except task 1 in which the result sometimes even was f a u l t in one word 2 cargo pump had been running with degradation even failure to clarify the reason primarily the runtime of each pump in all tasks are stated by fig 9 in total 233 1h 275 3h and 260 4h respectively and even 2 is the longest additionally through consulting the operating data in fig 6 b x 2 1 x 2 2 and x 2 3 were all rising especially x 2 1 even as high as 77 8 c reaching the warning temperature then as the equipment maintenance history described during this period there were not only no maintenance history but also no periodic inspection records by comprehensive inference the managers usually formulated the discharging task based on experience so they did not reasonably allocate the using time of three pumps which caused working continuously for a long time simultaneously the operator had received that the temperature exceeded the alarm threshold but they ignored to report and take action to ascertain predicaments 3 3 cargo pump the calculation process is also the same as 1 cargo pump according to evaluation levels the belief degree of 9 tasks are plotted as 4 column charts a b c and d shown in fig 10 in fig 10 the overall trend is to keep working well to sum up the proportion at 54 moments is h e a l t h y 48 88 89 q u a l i f i e d 6 11 11 a b n o r m a l 0 0 f a u l t 0 0 and compared with 1 and 2 pump it remained in h e a l t h y for a long time and had no a b n o r m a l attention and f a u l t moments among them task 4 in a were all in h e a l t h y but the belief degree decreased lightly and then in task 5 increased to about 0 8 and remained until the end of task 8 finally the belief degree in task 9 declined below 0 4 in a and expanded to nearly 0 7 in b resulting in degenerating to q u a l i f i e d further to refer to the operation data in fig 6 c x 3 3 compared with the highest 39 4 c in task 3 increased significantly to 48 6 c at t 1 in task 4 then with the extension of running it reached as high as 50 3 c at t 6 and remained at about 50 c without further development in the subsequent tasks however in task 9 it exceeded 40 c and ended up at a maximum of 42 3 c eventually through reviewing equipment maintenance history 3 pump carried out the upper and lower bearing inspections subsequently replaced the mechanical seal and the o ring to restore pump performance ahead of degrading to failure 3 3 2 analyzing the reliability and weight initially the reliability and weight of every index are calculated in section 3 3 1 which are dynamically changed in different tasks of the same pump the values are listed hereafter in two groups of broken lines a and b in fig 11 then 1 pump is taken as an example when o 2 4 5 the operating parameters of x 1 2 in fig 6 are represented in table 5 and the values of maximum range are calculated on the one hand the reliability of x 1 2 in tasks 2 and 5 in figure a are respectively ε x 1 2 2 0 8503 and ε x 1 2 5 0 3333 maximum range change from 4 9 to 5 8 indicating that the reliability will alter with the difference of each group of input data on the other hand the weights of tasks 3 and 4 in figure b of x 1 1 x 1 2 and x 1 3 are severally ω x 1 1 3 0 2133 ω x 1 2 3 0 4527 ω x 1 3 3 0 3340 and ω x 1 1 4 0 0814 ω x 1 2 4 0 7979 ω x 1 3 4 0 1207 ω x 1 1 and ω x 1 3 have little change on the contrary ω x 1 2 4 increases by 0 3452 compared with ω x 1 2 3 the proportion of ω x 1 2 4 is about 80 far greater than that of others furthermore the operating parameters of x 1 1 x 1 2 and x 1 3 in task 4 are described in table 3 so the values of maximum range are 1 9 9 8 and 2 2 after comparison the fluctuation of x 1 2 is more massive than x 1 1 and x 1 3 that is the operational performance of 1 pump reflected by x 1 2 is unstable ergo the accuracy of evaluation results can be improved by adjusting weights 3 3 3 calculation of primary er fusion according to the severity of risk results the task security risk is divided from low to high into four levels d d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 l o w r i s k a v e r a g e r i s k h i g h e r r i s k m a j o r r i s k in section3 3 1 the operating status belief degree of three cargo pumps has been obtained assuming that the operating states of the three main cargo oil pumps have the same impact on the operational safety of the cargo oil pump system so the weight is an average distribution of 1 as stated in fig 7 the results of the corresponding combination are substituted into the formula 12 and 13 for the first level fusion to get the belief degree taking task 4 at t 1 as an example the operating state belief degree of 1 2 and 3 are respectively presented as following β 1 x 1 4 1 0 8969 β 2 x 1 4 1 0 1031 β 3 x 1 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 4 1 0 β 1 x 2 4 1 0 2784 β 2 x 2 4 1 0 5114 β 3 x 2 4 1 0 2101 β 4 x 2 4 1 0 β 1 x 3 4 1 0 6813 β 2 x 3 4 1 0 3187 β 3 x 3 4 1 0 β 4 x 3 4 1 0 furthermore the weights are all 1 3 so the belief degree of 4 risk levels and the belief distribution form are as follows β 1 x 1 0 6351 β 2 x 1 0 2536 β 3 x 1 0 0501 β 4 x 1 0 0612 s x 1 d 1 0 6351 d 2 0 2536 d 3 0 0501 d 4 0 0612 the evaluation results of the cargo oil pump system are expressed as l o w r i s k 0 6351 a v e r a g e r i s k 0 2536 h i g h e r r i s k 0 0501 m a j o r r i s k 0 0612 so the operational safety risk level at t 1 in task 4 is l o w r i s k finally by repeating the above process the belief degree of safety risk assessment levels of cargo pump system in 16 unloading tasks are plotted as 4 column charts a b c and d presented in fig 12 in fig 12 the trend is fluctuated without a stable law additionally the distribution ratios of the four evaluation results at 96 moments obtained by classification calculation are l o w r i s k 79 82 29 a v e r a g e r i s k 8 8 33 h i g h e r r i s k 9 9 38 m a j o r r i s k 0 0 l o w r i s k and a v e r a g e r i s k were more likely to develop into h i g h e r r i s k moreover there was a tendency to turn into m a j o r r i s k in particular the first 7 tasks in a were l o w r i s k but the belief degree in tasks 8 and 12 were significantly higher in b than that in a and which in c extended to nearly 0 5 in the last 3 moments of task 12 by contrast the belief distribution in b c and d in task 14 h i g h e r r i s k was only slightly greater than m a j o r r i s k at t 1 2 besides h i g h e r r i s k exceeded 0 6 at t 4 5 6 which indicated that the system operation risk intensified from the above analysis of figs 10 and 2 pump had been running for ages with potential breakdown as stated in table 1 tasks 8 12 and 14 are all involved which leads to the poor operational safety of these tasks 3 3 4 evaluation results of different pump combinations different pump combinations could produce different evaluation results due to the limitation of cargo volume task time and port capacity there are seven modes of cargo oil pump system such as single pump two pumps or three pumps combination as shown in table 6 fig 12 illustrates that the operational safety of task 14 accomplished by 2 pump alone was very poor thus without considering other factors the belief distribution of 7 combinations are in fig 13 a b c and d where the data of three pumps presented from task 8 in fig 6 the order of the 7 combinations is 1 5 3 7 4 6 2 from high to low according to the results of operational safety evaluation the evaluation results of unloading task participated with 1 and 3 pump in the form of a single pump or double pump are l o w r i s k and the belief degree is 0 9 or above which would be better than the actual 2 pump so when formulating an unloading plan the optimal combination based on the evaluation results of each pump operational performance can reduce the risk of unloading task of the cargo oil pump system 3 3 5 weak links and improvement measures 1 with starving for extremely high safety requirements the hidden dangers of unloading task not only exist but also require strict attention to detect timely and take accurate actions although m a j o r r i s k is 0 and l o w r i s k accounts for 82 29 follow up work should strengthen the crew s various business ability training track the training effect guide and supervise the crew s standard operation and fortify education of the crew s responsibility 2 the management personnel didn t consider safer pump combinations when making a task plan therefore based on inputting operation data of the task comparing the output results of operational safety evaluation in actual and hypothetical pump combinations could be as an auxiliary decision making basis 3 in summary the main reasons for the decrease in the operating performance of cargo oil pumps are the wear and poor lubrication of couplings journals universal joints mechanical seals and o rings foremost the hidden dangers can be eliminated through enhancing the daily maintenance efforts strictly checking the safety and technical conditions and focusing on the inspection of key components and other measures 4 conclusion in this article a novel methodology for operational safety evaluation of cargo oil system based on fusing multiple task information is proposed the proposed

20181,the cargo oil system is an irreplaceable component of a tanker of which the operational safety affects task completion this study proposes an operational safety evaluation methodology for fusing multiple task information which identifies the assessment level and abnormal points different data features are used to express the changes in the operating state at different time stages to improve the performance of the method the data monitoring error analysis technique based on distance and coefficient of variation approach are employed to deal with uncertainty and subjectivity the optimal data reliability and comprehensive weight are then fed as input values to the evidential reasoning er rule the proposed operational safety evaluation methodology has been applied to the cargo pump system of a 49 000 ton tanker comparing with equipment maintenance records the results of the proposed method can reflect the actual task safety condition and verify the feasibility and effectiveness furthermore weak links and improvement measures present new insights for operational safety management for tanker corporations keywords multiple task information cargo oil system operational safety evaluation fusion er 1 introduction crude oil is considered the blood of industry as well as the main driving force of various activities in modern society particularly due to the expanded generation and utilization of petroleum over recent decades tanker has become an irreplaceable vehicle for cross border trade cargo oil system is mainly used for loading and discharging which is however not risk free above all due to the complex structure phased operation long service time and physicochemical properties of cargo oil a majority of dangerous factors in course of running will inevitably increase potential risks hazardous or even catastrophic consequences will happen to personnel tanker port and marine eco environment zhao et al 2012 once excessive leakage and fire explosion chen et al 2020 guo et al 2016 occur therefore the operational safety assessment of cargo oil system has become the significant module of the oil tanker transportation reliability which has attracted substantial attention from ship owners shipping companies and maritime regulatory authorities and is also the focus of research by relevant professional scholars burgherr 2007 chen et al 2019 vidmar and perkovič 2018 focused on the statistics and trend analysis of the number of oil spills from tankers in recent decades and discussed the key factors behind oil spill and the potential losses on this basis many scholars evaluated the risk of oil spill in tanker collision by simulation kim et al 2015 experiment tavakoli et al 2011 and case analysis goerlandt and montewka 2014 hou et al 2017 li et al 2019 moreover according to the international tanker owners pollution federation 2016 tanker leakage occurs during loading 40 and unloading 30 which usually occurs in ports oil terminals and the largest part 60 is caused by fire explosion and equipment failure most of which are caused by equipment and ship body failure vanem et al 2008 summarized the lng accidents in history and found that the collision risk was the highest by reviewing the previous research however no specific accident reason analysis was conducted and no specific suggestions and measures were put forward to control the accidents as a result appropriate management tools should be considered to improve the safety level of chemical tankers during cargo operations arslan 2009 fault tree analysis fta method was used to construct the accident model of liquefied natural gas lng ship when loading and unloading liquid cargo which can conduct risk analysis on the consequences of the accident and to propose recommendations and operational measures to prevent leakage and bayesian network bn was used to analyze the dynamic safety of the unloading process of lng carrier and the results showed that collision was the most likely accident in the unloading process which may cause disastrous consequences yeo et al 2016 cargo oil system factors were proposed as the main contributor and significant issues to hazardous loading and discharging accidents the commonly used security assessment methods are mainly divided into three categories namely model based methods knowledge based methods and data driven methods the first type needs a detailed system working mechanism but it is often difficult to build a mathematical model the second one needs to obtain prior knowledge and the results are greatly affected by the subjective will of experts the third one is mainly based on test or sensor data which is poor in performance and interpretability when the amount of data is small in addition some scholars have improved and strengthened the ship monitoring system to ensure operational safety based on the international ship management code an advanced liquid cargo ship cargo monitoring system was built with the decision support kim et al 2008 to provide a basic follow up function deployment and application of intelligent ship li et al 2020 designed the hardware system and basic software platform which can exchange data in a unified format through sharing according to the design characteristics of the aframax tanker plessas et al 2016 simulated the cargo unloading process of the tanker which can monitor all relevant ship parameters such as the characteristics of pump valve group pipeline system flow pressure ship response etc and then a multi criteria optimization method based on preference was applied to the modeling simulation process operating data of the cargo oil system could be collected through the automation system however the lack of effective statistics classification and analysis restrain the decision support of operational safety management furthermore as a multi level and multi faceted process information fusion can monitor connect correlate estimate and combine multi source data to achieve accurate state estimation which has been widely used from this point of view it is essential to develop a methodology to incorporate operating parameters into safety evaluation for effective accident prevention a methodology for evaluating the operational safety of tanker cargo oil system is proposed in this study by applying the evidential reasoning er rule to fuse multiple task information the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the theoretical background of er rule and the operational safety evaluation model with an illustrative real case construction of index system detailed data acquisition fusion results of er rule and discussions are embedded in section 3 eventually section 4 concludes this paper 2 methodology 2 1 er review in order to overcome the difficulty that the traditional dempster shafer d s evidence theory cannot effectively deal with the conflict evidence and combinatorial explosion problem based on meeting the traditional bayesian joint probability reasoning yang and sen 1994 yang and singh 1994 proposed er method in 1994 and further developed it yang 2001 yang et al 2006 yang and xu 2002 moreover to effectively distinguishes the reliability and weight of evidence yang and xu 2013 propounded er rule which was widely applied in various fields wang 2000 proposed a decision making framework based on subjective safety analysis which used er to synthesize safety at different levels so as to generate the priority related to design or operation for ranking purpose and to conduct formal ship safety assessment considering the cable laying conditions and their impact on maritime safety a fuzzy argumentation method for submarine cable routing in offshore wind farms was proposed jiang et al 2019 wan et al 2018 established the quantitative measurement and evaluation model of green port development and used er method to summarize the evaluation results of each index port using a unified method consisting of fuzzy group decision making fuzzy evidence reasoning methods and the concept of expected utility pathak et al 2021 evaluated the key success factors of sustainable freight transportation according to the four competitive priorities and developed an evaluation framework of comprehensive performance wu et al 2018 incorporated er and prioritization techniques similar to ideal solutions in emergency decision making and then proposed an improved non command ship handling method which was applied to the main engine failure as an example chang et al 2021 combined failure mode and effect analysis fmea methods with er and rule based bayesian networks rbn to quantify the risk level of identified maritime autonomous surface vessel mass hazards the reliability and weight are the two key parameters of evidence typical methods for obtaining weights include the coefficient of variation method the maximum deviation method the objective weighting method and the expert scoring method as for the typical methods for obtaining reliability there are distance based methods probability statistics based methods task oriented methods and complexity based methods chen and zhou 2020 applied the analytic algorithm of er yang and xu 2013 to complete performance evaluation of weaponry equipment including the coefficient of variation method and distance based method from the latest literature zhou et al 2021 systematically combed the development process of evidence theory around confidence distribution and finally made a brief review and prospect of evidence theory from practical applications 2 2 operational safety evaluation model of cargo oil system the operational safety evaluation model is established based on er rule mainly including constructing index system calculating reliability and weight converting input data and fusing multiple information and the flowchart is shown in fig 1 then the specific procedures of all approaches are expressed in the following steps step 1 analytic hierarchy process ahp is adopted to establish the evaluation index system and evaluation target for top level can be divided into multiple primary indexes and then each level index can continue to refine into multiple secondary indexes for example x i is the i th first level index and x i k is the k th second level index through the integration of multi layer er from bottom to top the evaluation result of the target is finally obtained step 2 calculate the data reliability 1 x i k o 1 t t 1 t x i k o t 2 h x i k o t x i k o t x i k o 3 h x i k o 1 t t 1 t h x i k o t 1 t t 1 t x i k o t x i k o therefore the data reliability of the index is as follows 4 ε x i k o h x i k o max h x i k o t where x i k o means index x i k in task o x i k o t is the data of index x i k at moment t t 1 2 t in task o o 1 2 o and x i k o represents the average value of all x i k o t furthermore ε x i k o is the data reliability of index x i k in task o h x i k o t represents the distance between x i k o t and x i k o h x i k o represents the average distance between x i k o t and other values this method focuses on the degree of interference in the process of data acquisition and assumes that the monitoring data does not contain the consistency deviation caused by system error step 3 calculate the weight of each index the coefficient of variation method is to dynamically allocate the weight of each index according to the relative change magnitude of each index the greater the change of index value the stronger the ability to identify the corresponding index features and the greater the corresponding index weight 5 ω x i k o ξ x i k o k 1 l ξ x i k o 6 ξ x i k o s x i k o x i k o 7 s x i k o 1 t 1 t 1 t x i k o t x i k o 2 finally mixed weight comprehensively considers the reliability in step 3 and ω x i k o as shown in formula 8 8 ϖ x i k o ω x i k o 1 ω x i k o ε x i k o where ω x i k o and s x i k o respectively represent the weight and variance of index x i k in task o and ξ x i k o can reflect the relative change of index x i k in task o ϖ x i k o is the mixed weight of index x i k in task o step 4 uniform information format different indexes have different information formats which may be in the form of numerical value subjective distribution or qualitative description accordingly before information fusion the input information needs to be transformed into a unified framework for description assuming that there are l basic attributes x 1 x 2 x k x l and defining n evaluation levels d d 1 d 2 d j d n so the belief distribution is as follows 9 s x k d j β j k j 1 2 n k 1 2 l where β j k has the following form 10 β j k x k b j 1 x k b j 1 b j j n b j x k b j 1 1 β j k x k j n 1 0 j n n 1 where β j k x k is the belief degree of x k then b j and b j 1 represent two adjacent evaluation level reference values and x k represents the input value to be converted step 5 the distributed belief structure obtained by er rule can be expressed as 11 s x d j β j j 1 2 n where β j is the belief of evaluation result d j and analytic algorithm of er rule is as follows 12 β j μ k 1 l ϖ k β j k 1 ϖ k j 1 n β j k k 1 l 1 ϖ k j 1 n β j k 1 μ k 1 l 1 ϖ k 13 μ k 1 l j 1 n ϖ k β j k 1 ϖ k k 1 l β j k n 1 k 1 l 1 ϖ k j 1 n β j k 1 where l and n respectively represent the number of evidence and evaluation levels and ϖ k β j k respectively represent the mixed weight of x k and the belief degree of x k relative to evaluation level d j step 6 fuse the results obtained in steps 3 4 and 5 through er rule to own the operational safety evaluation result of the confidence structure 3 case study 3 1 constructing evaluation index system of cargo pump the cargo oil pump yang et al 2013 yüksel and köseoğlu 2020 the key power equipment of cargo oil system and the heart of a tanker can make cargo oil flow in the oil pipeline the operating state directly affects the progress of the unloading task thus evaluating operational safety is significant in light of the actual operation state the operation plan can be adjusted in time for maintenance or replacement to ensure efficient and safe completion of a mission most modern large oil tankers chose vertical centrifugal pumps driven by steam turbines as the main cargo pumps during operation the deterioration of components and equipment and the interference of human factors will affect the performance of the cargo pumps the failure modes as shown in fig 2 a cargo pump system generally with three cargo pumps is selected as the research object and its operational safety is the evaluation objective bottom bearing temperature pump casing temperature and upper bearing temperature are selected as indexes so three level evaluation system is established as shown in fig 3 x i is the i th first level index and x i k is the k th second level index of the i th first level index 3 2 acquiring operating parameters of cargo pump communicating with oil companies cargo oil system of the current tanker has the function of real time acquisition and display of operation data but task values aren t fully utilized so it is difficult to provide data support for the operation and maintenance so as sensing technology computer technology and communication developing ship shore integration has become the trend wherein the framework of cargo oil management system is shown in fig 4 in which safety risk evaluation is an essential module among them beidou navigation satellite system bds is a global satellite navigation system developed by china and it s also the third mature satellite navigation system applied widely in marine transportation huang et al 2017 xin and gao 2019 after global position system gps and global navigation satellite system glonass this paper uses its unique short message function to establish the ship shore communication module as shown in fig 5 which can not only transmit the data collected by the sensor to the shore based monitoring center but also send the relevant commands of the shore based management personnel to the monitored ship so through cooperation with an oil company a 49 000 ton crude oil tanker is selected which is composed of three vertical centrifugal cargo pumps with single stage and double suction besides each cargo pump selects 9 consecutive unloading tasks and after filtering out abnormal data every index obtains 54 groups among which each task includes 6 moments t 1 2 3 4 5 6 three dimensional data lists are displayed in fig 6 additionally the cargo oil pump system has completed a total of 16 unloading tasks and the pump combination of each task is shown in table 1 3 3 results and discussion the above acquired monitoring data are input into the calculation of secondary er and primary er then the evaluation level of each pump s operating state and the risk level of cargo pump system in every task are obtained on this basis making statistical analysis on the results and calculating the task risk level of different pump combinations and further proposing existing weakness and improvement measures 3 3 1 calculation of secondary er fusion through secondary er the belief degree of four evaluation levels of each cargo pump at 54 moments in 9 tasks are attained as shown in fig 7 fig 8 and fig 10 in sequence thereafter the overall statistical analysis of evaluation results is made and the abnormal situations are analyzed by combing with the equipment maintenance history records 1 1 cargo pump there are 9 tasks meanwhile task 4 o 4 is selected as an example to present step2 to step5 the operating parameters from moment 19 to 24 in fig 6 a are displayed in table 2 firstly calculating reliability weight and mixed weight ε x 1 k 4 the reliability of x 1 k in task 4 can be calculated from formula 1 to 4 and ω x 1 k 4 the weight of x 1 k in task 4 can be calculated from formula 5 to 7 further synthesizing ε x 1 k 4 and ω x 1 k 4 into formula 8 ϖ x 1 k 4 the comprehensive weight of x 1 k in task 4 is obtained the specific results are as following ε x 1 1 4 0 4483 ε x 1 2 4 0 5480 ε x 1 3 4 0 4195 ω x 1 1 4 0 0814 ω x 1 2 4 0 7979 ω x 1 3 4 0 1207 ϖ x 1 1 4 0 1286 ϖ x 1 2 4 0 6384 ϖ x 1 3 4 0 1721 secondly converting into belief degrees according to the technical information of the cargo pump and the experience and knowledge of the crew semantic value and the corresponding quantitative value are shown in table 3 according to table 3 and formula 10 the data in table 2 is converted into β j x 1 k 4 t which means belief degree of the j th j 1 2 3 4 semantic value of x 1 k at moment t in task 4 taking t 1 in table 2 as an example the belief degree corresponding to four semantic values are calculated indicated as below β 1 x 1 1 4 1 0 1533 β 2 x 1 1 4 1 0 8467 β 3 x 1 1 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 1 4 1 0 β 1 x 1 2 4 1 0 1467 β 2 x 1 2 4 1 0 8533 β 3 x 1 2 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 2 4 1 0 β 1 x 1 3 4 1 0 2267 β 2 x 1 3 4 1 0 7733 β 3 x 1 3 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 3 4 1 0 then based on the safety protection requirements in the tanker operation specification four reference grades are set for the operation state of cargo pump expressed as d d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 h e a l t h y q u a l i f i e d a b n o r m a l f a u l t by substituting the above results into formulas 12 and 13 the operational state evaluation belief degree of x 1 at t 1 in task 4 can be got listed hereafter β 1 x 1 4 1 0 8969 β 2 x 1 4 1 0 1031 β 3 x 1 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 4 1 0 so the belief distribution form shown in formula 9 can be described as s x 1 4 1 d 1 0 8969 d 2 0 1031 d 3 0 d 4 0 in light of the above the evaluation result of 1 cargo pump at t 1 in task 4 is h e a l t h y 0 8969 q u a l i f i e d 0 1031 a b n o r m a l 0 f a u l t 0 so according to the principle of maximum membership operating status is verbalized as h e a l t h y at last through repeating the above process the belief degree distribution and evaluation result of 1 cargo pump operating state at every moment in each task are calculated according to evaluation levels the belief degrees of 9 tasks are plotted as 4 column charts a b c and d shown in fig 7 in fig 7 the overall trend is to plateau decline and then recover the statistical result is h e a l t h y 48 88 89 q u a l i f i e d 4 7 41 a b n o r m a l 2 37 f a u l t 0 0 and nearly 90 is h e a l t h y specifically the statistical results of the 9 tasks are shown in table 4 among them the first 3 tasks were stable and in h e a l t h y but in tasks 4 and 5 the belief degree of h e a l t h y declined from 0 89 to 0 57 more seriously task 6 started with q u a l i f i e d then the operational performance deteriorated gradually over time and when t 5 6 it turned into a b n o r m a l by task 7 the operational performance was significantly improved and restored to h e a l t h y with low belief degree task 8 and 9 had been adjusted to h e a l t h y next the running data in fig 6 a and equipment maintenance records are analyzed for significant performance degradation in task 4 x 1 1 and x 1 3 increased sharply at t 1 respectively from 45 c to 55 c and from 40 c to 45 c and the temperatures continued to rise slightly in task 5 but inspection and maintenance had not been carried out after entering task 6 x 1 1 and x 1 3 continued to increase and reached a maximum of 58 2 c and 57 c respectively at t 4 after completing task 6 there were records of overhauling coupling and replacing journal universal joint so it is speculated that during tasks 4 to 6 the associated accessories of the pump shaft were seriously damaged resulting in a rapid increase in temperature after maintenance the performance of 1 pump was improved and by the grinding in of task 7 the operations of the subsequent two missions were restored 2 2 cargo pump the calculation process is the same as 1 cargo pump according to evaluation levels the belief degree of 9 tasks are plotted as 4 column charts a b c and d shown in fig 8 in fig 8 the state is on a downtrend the proportion of the four conditions at 54 moments is h e a l t h y 18 33 33 q u a l i f i e d 19 35 19 a b n o r m a l 15 27 78 f a u l t 2 3 7 firstly the proportions of the first three conditions are close but q u a l i f i e d are the highest and there are two faults indicating that the pump performed with risk secondly further analyzing every task the running performance had been gradually declining in 9 tasks and most of the other tasks were q u a l i f i e d and a b n o r m a l except task 1 in which the result sometimes even was f a u l t in one word 2 cargo pump had been running with degradation even failure to clarify the reason primarily the runtime of each pump in all tasks are stated by fig 9 in total 233 1h 275 3h and 260 4h respectively and even 2 is the longest additionally through consulting the operating data in fig 6 b x 2 1 x 2 2 and x 2 3 were all rising especially x 2 1 even as high as 77 8 c reaching the warning temperature then as the equipment maintenance history described during this period there were not only no maintenance history but also no periodic inspection records by comprehensive inference the managers usually formulated the discharging task based on experience so they did not reasonably allocate the using time of three pumps which caused working continuously for a long time simultaneously the operator had received that the temperature exceeded the alarm threshold but they ignored to report and take action to ascertain predicaments 3 3 cargo pump the calculation process is also the same as 1 cargo pump according to evaluation levels the belief degree of 9 tasks are plotted as 4 column charts a b c and d shown in fig 10 in fig 10 the overall trend is to keep working well to sum up the proportion at 54 moments is h e a l t h y 48 88 89 q u a l i f i e d 6 11 11 a b n o r m a l 0 0 f a u l t 0 0 and compared with 1 and 2 pump it remained in h e a l t h y for a long time and had no a b n o r m a l attention and f a u l t moments among them task 4 in a were all in h e a l t h y but the belief degree decreased lightly and then in task 5 increased to about 0 8 and remained until the end of task 8 finally the belief degree in task 9 declined below 0 4 in a and expanded to nearly 0 7 in b resulting in degenerating to q u a l i f i e d further to refer to the operation data in fig 6 c x 3 3 compared with the highest 39 4 c in task 3 increased significantly to 48 6 c at t 1 in task 4 then with the extension of running it reached as high as 50 3 c at t 6 and remained at about 50 c without further development in the subsequent tasks however in task 9 it exceeded 40 c and ended up at a maximum of 42 3 c eventually through reviewing equipment maintenance history 3 pump carried out the upper and lower bearing inspections subsequently replaced the mechanical seal and the o ring to restore pump performance ahead of degrading to failure 3 3 2 analyzing the reliability and weight initially the reliability and weight of every index are calculated in section 3 3 1 which are dynamically changed in different tasks of the same pump the values are listed hereafter in two groups of broken lines a and b in fig 11 then 1 pump is taken as an example when o 2 4 5 the operating parameters of x 1 2 in fig 6 are represented in table 5 and the values of maximum range are calculated on the one hand the reliability of x 1 2 in tasks 2 and 5 in figure a are respectively ε x 1 2 2 0 8503 and ε x 1 2 5 0 3333 maximum range change from 4 9 to 5 8 indicating that the reliability will alter with the difference of each group of input data on the other hand the weights of tasks 3 and 4 in figure b of x 1 1 x 1 2 and x 1 3 are severally ω x 1 1 3 0 2133 ω x 1 2 3 0 4527 ω x 1 3 3 0 3340 and ω x 1 1 4 0 0814 ω x 1 2 4 0 7979 ω x 1 3 4 0 1207 ω x 1 1 and ω x 1 3 have little change on the contrary ω x 1 2 4 increases by 0 3452 compared with ω x 1 2 3 the proportion of ω x 1 2 4 is about 80 far greater than that of others furthermore the operating parameters of x 1 1 x 1 2 and x 1 3 in task 4 are described in table 3 so the values of maximum range are 1 9 9 8 and 2 2 after comparison the fluctuation of x 1 2 is more massive than x 1 1 and x 1 3 that is the operational performance of 1 pump reflected by x 1 2 is unstable ergo the accuracy of evaluation results can be improved by adjusting weights 3 3 3 calculation of primary er fusion according to the severity of risk results the task security risk is divided from low to high into four levels d d 1 d 2 d 3 d 4 l o w r i s k a v e r a g e r i s k h i g h e r r i s k m a j o r r i s k in section3 3 1 the operating status belief degree of three cargo pumps has been obtained assuming that the operating states of the three main cargo oil pumps have the same impact on the operational safety of the cargo oil pump system so the weight is an average distribution of 1 as stated in fig 7 the results of the corresponding combination are substituted into the formula 12 and 13 for the first level fusion to get the belief degree taking task 4 at t 1 as an example the operating state belief degree of 1 2 and 3 are respectively presented as following β 1 x 1 4 1 0 8969 β 2 x 1 4 1 0 1031 β 3 x 1 4 1 0 β 4 x 1 4 1 0 β 1 x 2 4 1 0 2784 β 2 x 2 4 1 0 5114 β 3 x 2 4 1 0 2101 β 4 x 2 4 1 0 β 1 x 3 4 1 0 6813 β 2 x 3 4 1 0 3187 β 3 x 3 4 1 0 β 4 x 3 4 1 0 furthermore the weights are all 1 3 so the belief degree of 4 risk levels and the belief distribution form are as follows β 1 x 1 0 6351 β 2 x 1 0 2536 β 3 x 1 0 0501 β 4 x 1 0 0612 s x 1 d 1 0 6351 d 2 0 2536 d 3 0 0501 d 4 0 0612 the evaluation results of the cargo oil pump system are expressed as l o w r i s k 0 6351 a v e r a g e r i s k 0 2536 h i g h e r r i s k 0 0501 m a j o r r i s k 0 0612 so the operational safety risk level at t 1 in task 4 is l o w r i s k finally by repeating the above process the belief degree of safety risk assessment levels of cargo pump system in 16 unloading tasks are plotted as 4 column charts a b c and d presented in fig 12 in fig 12 the trend is fluctuated without a stable law additionally the distribution ratios of the four evaluation results at 96 moments obtained by classification calculation are l o w r i s k 79 82 29 a v e r a g e r i s k 8 8 33 h i g h e r r i s k 9 9 38 m a j o r r i s k 0 0 l o w r i s k and a v e r a g e r i s k were more likely to develop into h i g h e r r i s k moreover there was a tendency to turn into m a j o r r i s k in particular the first 7 tasks in a were l o w r i s k but the belief degree in tasks 8 and 12 were significantly higher in b than that in a and which in c extended to nearly 0 5 in the last 3 moments of task 12 by contrast the belief distribution in b c and d in task 14 h i g h e r r i s k was only slightly greater than m a j o r r i s k at t 1 2 besides h i g h e r r i s k exceeded 0 6 at t 4 5 6 which indicated that the system operation risk intensified from the above analysis of figs 10 and 2 pump had been running for ages with potential breakdown as stated in table 1 tasks 8 12 and 14 are all involved which leads to the poor operational safety of these tasks 3 3 4 evaluation results of different pump combinations different pump combinations could produce different evaluation results due to the limitation of cargo volume task time and port capacity there are seven modes of cargo oil pump system such as single pump two pumps or three pumps combination as shown in table 6 fig 12 illustrates that the operational safety of task 14 accomplished by 2 pump alone was very poor thus without considering other factors the belief distribution of 7 combinations are in fig 13 a b c and d where the data of three pumps presented from task 8 in fig 6 the order of the 7 combinations is 1 5 3 7 4 6 2 from high to low according to the results of operational safety evaluation the evaluation results of unloading task participated with 1 and 3 pump in the form of a single pump or double pump are l o w r i s k and the belief degree is 0 9 or above which would be better than the actual 2 pump so when formulating an unloading plan the optimal combination based on the evaluation results of each pump operational performance can reduce the risk of unloading task of the cargo oil pump system 3 3 5 weak links and improvement measures 1 with starving for extremely high safety requirements the hidden dangers of unloading task not only exist but also require strict attention to detect timely and take accurate actions although m a j o r r i s k is 0 and l o w r i s k accounts for 82 29 follow up work should strengthen the crew s various business ability training track the training effect guide and supervise the crew s standard operation and fortify education of the crew s responsibility 2 the management personnel didn t consider safer pump combinations when making a task plan therefore based on inputting operation data of the task comparing the output results of operational safety evaluation in actual and hypothetical pump combinations could be as an auxiliary decision

20182,to ensure the stability of buoy systems it is necessary to predict the buoy motion characteristics in different environment conditions unfortunately an accurate model is still not available for some unknown interaction between waves currents and winds in oceans modeling and designing a suitable buoy for further manufacture often encounters some challenges in practice in this work the least squares support vector regression lssvr method is proposed to predict buoy motion characteristics first some modeling data are collected from the data processing system of a buoy additionally an evaluation criterion is designed to automatically divide training data into two subsets corresponding to the normal and extreme conditions moreover two local lssvr models are constructed using the subsets respectively finally a suitable model is automatically selected for each new sample consequently with limited modeling samples different property in the normal and extreme conditions can be effectively captured experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method keywords ocean environment buoy motion characteristics support vector regression modeling and prediction 1 introduction buoys play an important role in the monitoring of the marine environment waves currents and winds have been shown to interact with one another to produce complex environment conditions draycott et al 2019 yao and wu 2005 pillai et al 2021 when modeling and designing a buoy these conditions must be considered to ensure its stability pillai et al 2021 berenjkoob et al 2021 however modeling and designing a suitable buoy for further manufacture is still difficult one main reason is that the relationship between multiple condition parameters and buoy motion characteristics is too complex to describe clearly the important information e g the maximum head rolling and pitch motion etc cannot be predicted to help the designers optimize the buoy structure berenjkoob et al 2021 shadman et al 2018 consequently the test is a primary method in acquiring accurate motion characteristics to verify the rationality of structure parameters nevertheless the conduction of experimental studies on samples with different structures is very time consuming and costly generally accurate modeling of the buoy motion characteristics using environment condition parameters is of utmost importance the problem has been widely studied in academia and industry various mechanism models have been developed based on the theory analysis pillai et al 2021 berenjkoob et al 2021 shadman et al 2018 oikonomou et al 2021 jahangir et al 2018 liu et al 2015 shi et al 2016 apel et al 2012 giorgi and ringwood 2018 kim et al 2021 sun et al 2021 ko et al 2020 the accumulated experiences can reduce the design time and costs however because of the complex marine environment the applications of established models still have several limitations in objects scopes and so on until now none of existing models can fully and satisfactorily describe the relationship between multiple condition parameters and buoy motion characteristics moreover the accuracy of theory analysis mostly depends on designers experience because many coefficients should be determined in theoretical formula to shorten the design cycle and reduce the design costs the traditionally repeated trial and error experiments have been replaced by the simulation analysis pillai et al 2021 berenjkoob et al 2021 shadman et al 2018 giorgi and ringwood 2018 kim et al 2021 sun et al 2021 ko et al 2020 wu et al 2021 campos et al 2021 palm and eskilssonb 2020 most simulation models assumed that the buoy follows the wave induced particle trajectories but not that of the current pillai et al 2021 berenjkoob et al 2021 shadman et al 2018 giorgi and ringwood 2018 kim et al 2021 sun et al 2021 ko et al 2020 wu et al 2021 campos et al 2021 the mooring system station is often supposed not to provide a restoring force observed at the wave frequencies pillai et al 2021 kim et al 2021 campos et al 2021 palm and eskilssonb 2020 additionally the linear wave theory is adopted the radiation and diffraction effects are negligible pillai et al 2021 berenjkoob et al 2021 shadman et al 2018 giorgi and ringwood 2018 kim et al 2021 sun et al 2021 ko et al 2020 wu et al 2021 campos et al 2021 palm and eskilssonb 2020 moreover only the heave motion of the buoy is considered while neglecting surge and pitch motion wu et al 2021 campos et al 2021 it is insufficient to describe the buoy behavior in complex environment conditions therefore the relationship of multiple condition parameters and buoy motion characteristics needs to be investigated for further simulation process design and optimization with the rapid development of computer and communication technologies a great amount of historical data is usually acquired for monitoring purposes as a result increasing data driven empirical modeling methods have been widely applied in oceanography fields song et al 2021 zaugg et al 2010 roch et al 2008 qiu et al 2019 malfante et al 2018 baidai et al 2020 they can generally be constructed without substantial understanding of the process and requiring much experience of designers to handle the time varying and nonlinear behaviours some representative nonlinear data driven models have been proposed such as least squares support vector regression lssvr artificial neural networks ann and gaussian process regression gpr for good global optimization and generalization performance the lssvr model has been adopted to predict complex and nonlinear performance with limited training samples suykens et al 2002 kadlec et al 2011 ibitoye et al 2016 deng et al 2017 liu et al 2012 another advantage of lssvr model is that it is insensitivity to dimension for its simple structure hence the lssvr model can improve prediction accuracy and reduce buoy design difficulty by increasing the quantity of condition parameters additionally the complex nonlinearity relationship between multiple condition parameters and buoy motion characteristics can be approximately captured not needing the complete description of the buoy mechanism these properties make lssvr more suitable as an empirical model for buoy motion characteristics using condition parameters moreover the buoy motion characteristics is especially complex in extreme conditions it presents different property from the normal conditions therefore only using a single model is insufficient to capture all motion characteristics in the normal and extreme conditions to enhance prediction performance with limited data two local lssvr models are established for the normal and extreme conditions respectively consequently as shown in fig 1 a novel lssvr based learning method is developed first the modeling data are collected from the data processing system of a buoy then the training data are automatically divided into two subsets corresponding to the normal and extreme conditions additionally two local lssvr models are respectively constructed for the description of the interaction mechanism between the motion characteristics and condition parameters finally the buoy motion characteristics in different condition parameters is predicted online by the selected lssvr model the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the methodology of the whole work the experimental system is presented in section 3 in section 4 the proposed local lssvr model is applied to predict the buoy motion characteristics then the prediction results are compared with the experiment data to show the advantage of the proposed model finally the work is summarized in section 5 2 theory and methodology 2 1 input and output variables selection the related input variables are critical to the setup of good models the environment condition parameters including the wind velocity v the maximal wind velocity v m the wind direction α the maximal wind direction α m the current velocity u the current direction θ the wave height h the maximal wave height h m the wave direction β the wave period t are important factors for buoy motion characteristics draycott et al 2019 pillai et al 2021 palm and eskilssonb 2020 for this case they are selected as the input variables i e x i v i v m i α i α m i u i θ i h i h m i β i t i t the head the rolling and pitch motion are the output variables i e y i ψ h i ψ r i ψ p i t consequently the modeling data set of a buoy can be denoted as s x y x i y i i 1 n and n is the number of sampling data 2 2 sample grouping method considering limited modeling samples and different properties in normal and extreme conditions a suitable sample grouping method should be elaborately built to obtain good prediction performance for each test sample as an example 5 modeling samples numbered 1 to 5 in normal conditions and 5 ones numbered 6 to 10 in extreme conditions are tabulated in table 1 it indicates that there is large deviation from the parameter of the extreme and normal conditions consequently the traditional elimination method of abnormal data can be referred to divide dataset s into 2 subsets s 1 and s 2 corresponding to the normal and extreme conditions for the ith input vector x i x i l l 1 l l 1 l the sample grouping method can be represented as 1 δ x i l x i l x l λ σ l where δx i l and x l 1 n i 1 n x i l are the residual error and mean value of x i l respectively and σ l i 1 n x i l x l 2 n is the standard deviation the weighting parameter is λ 0 a relatively large value of λ means less data selected for extreme conditions in this study λ is adjusted based on σ l if δ x i l λ σ l s i x i y i i 1 n is adopted as s 2 otherwise s i is treated as s 1 like eq 1 the following criterion also can judge which prediction model is its most suitable one for a new test sample x t 2 δ x t l x t l x l λ σ l if δ x t l λ σ l x t is predicted by lssvr2 trained using s 2 otherwise x t is predicted by lssvr1 trained using s 1 2 3 local lssvr modeling method as aforementioned the modeling samples of a buoy are s x y for the ith group of condition parameters x i and corresponding buoy motion characteristics y i a lssvr model can be formulated as 3 y i f w c x i e i w t ϕ x i c e i i 1 n to describe their relationship suykens et al 2002 deng et al 2017 liu et al 2012 where f is the wanted model ϕ is a feature map the symbols w and c c 1 c 2 c 3 t denote the model parameter vector and the bias term respectively e i is the approximation error of the ith sample in the lssvr modeling process the following optimization problem is proposed suykens et al 2002 deng et al 2017 liu et al 2012 4 min j w c e 1 2 w 2 γ 2 e 2 s t y i w t ϕ x i c e i 0 i 1 n where e e 1 e n t is the approximation error w 2 2 can be defined as a form of capacity control to avoid an overly complex model the regularization parameter γ 0 determines the trade off between model complexity and approximation accuracy a suitable choice of γ can prevent the over fitting problem the model parameters can be expressed as suykens et al 2002 deng et al 2017 liu et al 2012 cawley and talbot 2007 5 b g y 1 1 t g y 1 t g 1 c 1 t g y 1 t g 1 where b b 1 b n t is lagrange multiplier and 1 1 1 t r n is a column vector of ones g is regarded as g k i γ 1 i r n n is a unit matrix k is a kernel matrix with its elements κ i j ϕ x i ϕ x j i j 1 n finally for a new test input x t the estimation y t of the lssvr model can be obtained 6 y ˆ t b t k t c where k t i ϕ x i ϕ x t i 1 n is a kernel vector for estimation of test samples the regularization parameter γ and the parameter σ of the kernel function e g the gaussian kernel k x i x j exp x i x j σ with the width parameter σ 0 should be carefully selected for the construction of a good lssvr model in this paper a simple fast leave one out floo cross validation criterion is utilized for parameter selection the floo criterion can avoid the over fitting problem of lssvr with limited modeling samples consequently based on the floo criterion γ σ can be selected when the floo prediction error is the smallest the floo prediction error of the lssvr model with n samples can be obtained deng et al 2017 liu et al 2012 cawley and talbot 2007 7 e n floo i 1 n e i floo i 1 n b i g i i z i 2 o where g ii is the item at the ith row and ith column of g z g 1 z 1 z n t and o 1 t g 1 in summary the main implementations of the proposed local lssvr modeling method is illustrated in fig 2 the step by step procedures are described as follows step 1 the dataset s x y for a buoy in different environment conditions is collected step 2 to enhance prediction performance with limited data the dataset s is automatically divided into 2 subsets s 1 and s 2 corresponding to the normal and extreme conditions eq 1 step 3 lssvr1 and lssvr2 prediction models are trained using s 1 and s 2 eqs 3 5 respectively their parameters are determined using the efficient floo training strategy eq 7 step 4 finally a suitable model can be automatically selected from lssvr1 and lssvr2 for each new sample eq 2 and the prediction y ˆ t can be obtained eq 6 2 4 model statistical performance criteria because the output value may be zero the relative error is infinity thus three traditional performance indices including the absolute error ae the maximum absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse are used to assess the prediction performance of lssvr models for the tth predicted output y ˆ t y ˆ t q q 1 q t 1 t q 1 q they are defined as follows 8 ae t q y ˆ t q y t q 9 mae q max y ˆ t q y t q 10 rmse q t 1 t y ˆ t q y t q 2 t where t and q is the number of test data and output variables respectively 3 experimental system description the buoy as the experiment object is applied to evaluate the local lssvr prediction model the material object of the buoy with data acquisition system is shown in fig 3 a the modeling data of different environment conditions were collected from the data processing system shown in fig 3 b the condition parameters can be measured online by the sensor module the data of wind direction wind velocity temperature air pressure and humidity are from a meteorological sensor the current direction and current velocity can be gained from an acoustic doppler current profiler the wave height and wave period are measured by a wave sensor meanwhile the buoy motion parameters also can be obtained online from an electronic compass by gprs module communication terminal and related software these data are periodically returned to the data acquisition module and data receiving center for further processing including storage analysis display and upload a total of 540 samples were collected as s from the data processing system of the buoy shown in fig 3 according to the process knowledge of the marine environment monitoring the wind velocity v current velocity u and wave height h are most important factors for buoy motion characteristics consequently their standard deviation σ 1 σ 5 and σ 7 are firstly considered in selecting λ value here λ value is chosen as 1 5 the samples are divided into two sets s 1 and s 2 the 378 samples in normal conditions are selected as s 1 the rest of 162 samples in extreme conditions are adopted as s 2 the first 252 samples in s 1 are treated as training samples and the remaining are for testing the first 122 samples in s 2 are chosen as training samples and the remaining are for testing to show the effectiveness of the proposed method the global lssvr is constructed using all training samples of s 1 and s 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation results and discussion of normal conditions the prediction results of the global lssvr and local lssvr1 models for all test samples in normal conditions are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the mae and rmse values of three output variables are tabulated in table 2 it can be found that lssvr1 model obtains better regression performance for the smaller mae and rmse indices it reduces the mae values of the head rolling and pitch motion by 131 050 13 796 and 13 081 compared to those of the global lssvr the detailed learning results shown in fig 4 also illustrate the global lssvr method cannot capture the main motion characteristics of the normal conditions in particular the global lssvr is not perfect for the description of the buoy head it is mainly because the buoy head presents more complicated behavior in different conditions additionally as shown in fig 5 and table 2 the mae values of the head rolling and pitch motion for lssvr1 model are 27 050 1 864 and 1 339 respectively the input variables of three samples with the mae values are x 22 1 9 3 63 65 0 469 104 4 0 41 0 93 230 1 4 9 t x 113 5 4 7 7 30 41 0 618 194 0 0 37 0 9 122 3 4 0 t and x 12 1 6 2 3 87 1 126 0 045 151 2 0 47 1 06 135 4 11 8 t it can be found that the wave direction β 230 1 of x 22 is relatively large in normal conditions also the current velocity u 0 618 m s of x 113 and the wave period t 11 8 s of x 12 is relatively large it implies that x 22 x 113 and x 12 in the transitional region between the normal and extreme conditions their operating conditions are unsimilar to the training samples in normal conditions nevertheless the absolute relative error of x 22 x 113 and x 12 can be calculated as 12 415 6 398 and 12 960 within the allowable engineering errors moreover the rmse values listed in table 2 also are relatively small it indicates that the lssvr1 model can achieve a good prediction performance for all test samples in normal conditions 4 2 simulation results and discussion of extreme conditions the detailed results of all test samples in extreme conditions by the global lssvr and local lssvr2 model are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the corresponding errors of the head the rolling and pitch motion are tabulated in table 3 the relatively large mae and rmse indices listed in table 3 show that the global lssvr is poor for the prediction of all test samples in extreme conditions this means that buoy motion characteristics is more complex in extreme conditions and an effective and practical method should be explored for better prediction quality fortunately the prediction results shown in fig 7 illustrate that the lssvr2 model obviously improves the prediction performance the mae values of the head rolling and pitch motion are decreased by 173 900 6 208 and 6 543 with the lssvr2 model respectively additionally the absolute relative errors of three test samples with the mae are 13 762 21 203 and 22 779 which is still within the allowable engineering errors moreover the relatively small mae and rmse values of the lssvr2 model listed in table 3 also validate a good distribution of the prediction errors for the rolling and pitch motion it indicates that the lssvr2 prediction model can track the main characteristics in extreme conditions it should be mentioned that compared with the prediction results of the lssvr1 model the larger mae and rmse indices of lssvr2 show its little inferior for the head of some test samples this problem is usually caused by complex extreme conditions additionally it is because the data of extreme conditions from the data processing system contain the instrument error from all the prediction results shown in figs 4 7 and listed in tables 2 and 3 the proposed local lssvr model can perform better than the global lssvr for all test samples in normal and extreme conditions additionally compared with the prediction results of the normal conditions the larger mae and rmse indices of the extreme conditions show its little inferior nevertheless for three test samples with the mae in extreme conditions their absolute relative errors are still within the allowable engineering errors also the relatively small rmse values indicate that the selected prediction model can track the main characteristics of extreme conditions moreover the proposed method can be implemented in a simple and efficient manner for practical applications consequently it is necessary to develop two local lssvr models trained by automatically selected modeling data to enhance the prediction performance 5 conclusion this paper addresses the topic of developing two local lssvr based empirical models with limited modeling samples for complex and nonlinear buoy motion characteristics in different environment conditions one main advantage of the lssvr model is that it can be trained efficiently by increasing the quantity of condition parameters and using valid training samples not requiring the complete description of buoy mechanism additionally to better capture the different motion characteristics in normal and extreme conditions an evaluation criterion is designed to automatically divide training data into two subsets consequently a suitable lssvr model can be selected for a new test sample the feasibility and simplicity of local lssvr model is demonstrated through experimental results in comparison with global lssvr model the prediction performance of all test samples is obviously improved both in normal and extreme conditions moreover much human effort can be saved on optimizing the buoy structure by reducing the traditionally repeated trial and error experiments it should be mentioned that compared with the rolling and pitch motion the prediction results of the head show larger mae and rmse indices especially for the extreme conditions the prediction performance should be further strengthened via an empirical study or a new method credit authorship contribution statement xintian li methodology software formal analysis writing review editingwriting original draft yujian bian

carefully selected for the construction of a good lssvr model in this paper a simple fast leave one out floo cross validation criterion is utilized for parameter selection the floo criterion can avoid the over fitting problem of lssvr with limited modeling samples consequently based on the floo criterion γ σ can be selected when the floo prediction error is the smallest the floo prediction error of

column of g z g 1 z 1 z n t and o 1 t g 1 in summary the main implementations of the proposed local lssvr modeling method is illustrated in fig 2 the step by step procedures are described as follows step 1 the dataset s x y for a buoy in different environment conditions is collected step 2 to enhance prediction performance with limited data the dataset s is automatically divided into 2 subsets s 1 and s 2 corresponding to the normal and extreme conditions eq 1 step 3 lssvr1 and lssvr2 prediction models are trained using s 1 and s 2 eqs 3 5 respectively their parameters are determined using the efficient floo training strategy eq 7 step 4 finally a suitable model can be automatically selected from lssvr1 and lssvr2 for each new sample eq 2 and the prediction y ˆ t can be obtained eq 6 2 4 model statistical performance criteria because the output value may be zero the relative error is infinity thus three traditional performance indices including the absolute error ae the maximum absolute error mae and the root mean square error rmse are used to assess the prediction performance of lssvr models for the tth predicted output y ˆ t y ˆ t q q 1 q t 1 t q 1 q they are defined as follows 8 ae t q y ˆ t q y t q 9 mae q max y ˆ t q y t q 10 rmse q t 1 t y ˆ t q y t q 2 t where t and q is the number of test data and output variables respectively 3 experimental system description the buoy as the experiment object is applied to evaluate the local lssvr prediction model the material object of the buoy with data acquisition system is shown in fig 3 a the modeling data of different environment conditions were collected from the data processing system shown in fig 3 b the condition parameters can be measured online by the sensor module the data of wind direction wind velocity temperature air pressure and humidity are from a meteorological sensor the current direction and current velocity can be gained from an acoustic doppler current profiler the wave height and wave period are measured by a wave sensor meanwhile the buoy motion parameters also can be obtained online from an electronic compass by gprs module communication terminal and related software these data are periodically returned to the data acquisition module and data receiving center for further processing including storage analysis display and upload a total of 540 samples were collected as s from the data processing system of the buoy shown in fig 3 according to the process knowledge of the marine environment monitoring the wind velocity v current velocity u and wave height h are most important factors for buoy motion characteristics consequently their standard deviation σ 1 σ 5 and σ 7 are firstly considered in selecting λ value here λ value is chosen as 1 5 the samples are divided into two sets s 1 and s 2 the 378 samples in normal conditions are selected as s 1 the rest of 162 samples in extreme conditions are adopted as s 2 the first 252 samples in s 1 are treated as training samples and the remaining are for testing the first 122 samples in s 2 are chosen as training samples and the remaining are for testing to show the effectiveness of the proposed method the global lssvr is constructed using all training samples of s 1 and s 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 simulation results and discussion of normal conditions the prediction results of the global lssvr and local lssvr1 models for all test samples in normal conditions are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively the mae and rmse values of three output variables are tabulated in table 2 it can be found that lssvr1 model obtains better regression performance for the smaller mae and rmse indices it reduces the mae values of the head rolling and pitch motion by 131 050 13 796 and 13 081 compared to those of the global lssvr the detailed learning results shown in fig 4 also illustrate the global lssvr method cannot capture the main motion characteristics of the normal conditions in particular the global lssvr is not perfect for the description of the buoy head it is mainly because the buoy head presents more complicated behavior in different conditions additionally as shown in fig 5 and table 2 the mae values of the head rolling and pitch motion for lssvr1 model are 27 050 1 864 and 1 339 respectively the input variables of three samples with the mae values are x 22 1 9 3 63 65 0 469 104 4 0 41 0 93 230 1 4 9 t x 113 5 4 7 7 30 41 0 618 194 0 0 37 0 9 122 3 4 0 t and x 12 1 6 2 3 87 1 126 0 045 151 2 0 47 1 06 135 4 11 8 t it can be found that the wave direction β 230 1 of x 22 is relatively large in normal conditions also the current velocity u 0 618 m s of x 113 and the wave period t 11 8 s of x 12 is relatively large it implies that x 22 x 113 and x 12 in the transitional region between the normal and extreme conditions their operating conditions are unsimilar to the training samples in normal conditions nevertheless the absolute relative error of x 22 x 113 and x 12 can be calculated as 12 415 6 398 and 12 960 within the allowable engineering errors moreover the rmse values listed in table 2 also are relatively small it indicates that the lssvr1 model can achieve a good prediction performance for all test samples in normal conditions 4 2 simulation results and discussion of extreme conditions the detailed results of all test samples in extreme conditions by the global lssvr and local lssvr2 model are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 the corresponding errors of the head the rolling and pitch motion are tabulated in table 3 the relatively large mae and rmse indices listed in table 3 show that the global lssvr is poor for the prediction of all test samples in extreme conditions this means that buoy motion characteristics is more complex in extreme conditions and an effective and practical method should be explored for better prediction quality fortunately the prediction results shown in fig 7 illustrate that the lssvr2 model obviously improves the prediction performance the mae values of the head rolling and pitch motion are decreased by 173 900 6 208 and 6 543 with the lssvr2 model respectively additionally the absolute relative errors of three test samples with the mae are 13 762 21 203 and 22 779 which is still within the allowable engineering errors moreover the relatively small mae and rmse values of the lssvr2 model listed in table 3 also validate a good distribution of the prediction errors for the rolling and pitch motion it indicates that the lssvr2 prediction model can track the main characteristics in extreme conditions it should be mentioned that compared with the prediction results of the lssvr1 model the larger mae and rmse indices of lssvr2 show its little inferior for the head of some test samples this problem is usually caused by complex extreme conditions additionally it is because the data of extreme conditions from the data processing system contain the instrument error from all the prediction results shown in figs 4 7 and listed in tables 2 and 3 the proposed local lssvr model can perform better than the global lssvr for all test samples in normal and extreme conditions additionally compared with the prediction results of the normal conditions the larger mae and rmse indices of the extreme conditions show its little inferior nevertheless for three test samples with the mae in extreme conditions their absolute relative errors are still within the allowable engineering errors also the relatively small rmse values indicate that the selected prediction model can track the main characteristics of extreme conditions moreover the proposed method can be implemented in a simple and efficient manner for practical applications consequently it is necessary to develop two local lssvr models trained by automatically selected modeling data to enhance the prediction performance 5 conclusion this paper addresses the topic of developing two local lssvr based empirical models with limited modeling samples for complex and nonlinear buoy motion characteristics in different environment conditions one main advantage of the lssvr model is that it can be trained efficiently by increasing the quantity of condition parameters and using valid training samples not requiring the complete description of buoy mechanism additionally to better capture the different motion characteristics in normal and extreme conditions an evaluation criterion is designed to automatically divide training data into two subsets consequently a suitable lssvr model can be selected for a new test sample the feasibility and simplicity of local lssvr model is demonstrated through experimental results in comparison with global lssvr model the prediction performance of all test samples is obviously improved both in normal and extreme conditions moreover much human effort can be saved on optimizing the buoy structure by reducing the traditionally repeated trial and error experiments it should be mentioned that compared with the rolling and pitch motion the prediction results of the head show larger mae and rmse indices especially for the extreme conditions the prediction performance should be further strengthened via an empirical study or a new method credit authorship contribution statement xintian li methodology software formal analysis writing review editingwriting original draft yujian bian

20183,the evaluation of maritime waterway risk is required to take further advance measure for reduction of ship collision accident in general a risk assessment of ship collision can be estimated by

density of vessel traffic busy waterways are areas with high potential for accidents in comparison with open sea areas which are associated with more significant risks although in most waterways the overall accident probability is known their spatial distribution is not commonly available as a detailed map early detection of such risk situations provides critical time to take appropriate action with possibly before potential problems occur wiersma 2010 accident probability assessment is one of the most important steps for deciding preventive actions the traditional waterways risk analysis is usually conducted by means of ship traffic surveys including visual observations radar observations as well as airborne photography zhang et al 2019b the first ship traffic survey was conducted in japan in 1963 fujii and tanaka 1971 nowadays the advanced ship traffic data collection methods such as vessel traffic services vts and automatic identification system ais are developed to guarantee the high reliability of ship traffic information in port waters ais data has been used for estimating the accident probability map of a waterway kujala et al 2009 and harbor entrances mou et al 2010 these studies have been followed by ship collision risk off the coast of portugal silveira et al 2013 accident risk in the malacca strait maimun et al 2014 zaman et al 2013 ship sinking frequencies in madura strait indonesia mulyadi et al 2013 near miss detection in singapore port anchorages debnath and chin 2016 northern baltic sea zhang et al 2016 and collision probability in the strait of messina cucinotta et al 2017 the ship traffic analysis based on ais data has become extremely promising to precisely achieve ship navigation activities and understand maritime traffic in high density waters in order to support decision making and ship traffic control willems et al 2009 transferred the ais data to the geographical visualization based on the density fields the visualization of ship trajectory and density map of tsou 2010 merely showed in arcgis without any further quantitative ship traffic analysis ais data was used to obtain the fundamental ship traffic statistics and estimate navigation patterns in the restricted waters in aarsaether and moan 2009 in order to improve navigational safety some researchers have focused on visualization model of navigation in the water area silveira et al 2013 plotted the ship traffic pattern off the coast of portugal using ais data algorithms were developed to calculate the number of collision candidates by predicting the future distances between ships weng and xue 2015 estimate the ship collision frequency in port waterways and presents the spatial distributions of dangerous ship encounters in the five fairways shelmerdine 2015 uses ais data to visualize the marine traffic around shetland such as ais pings map vessel density map vessel track map vessel length map etc breithaupt et al 2017 graphically showed ship routes between ports along the atlantic coast of the us by ais data in 2 years wu et al 2017 mapped the global ship and traffic density indicated the distribution of ships and traffic using a very large amount of ais data from 2012 to 2015 using a systematic investigation for the collision risk parameters of a vessel pair weibin zhang et al 2017 evaluated and analyzed the navigation risk of ships and the scope of ship safety in the narrow northern baltic sea zhen et al 2017 proposed a framework of real time multi vessel collision assessment that combines a spatial clustering process for detecting clusters of encounter vessels and a multi vessel collision risk index model for encounter vessels within each cluster from the large amounts of monitored vessels in a surveyed sea area the model of yoo 2018 was to depict the near miss density using rgb color and enable the identification of relatively dangerous locations where the relative frequency of near misses increases as the colors tends to red the spatial distribution of the encounter probability within the strait of istanbul is determined using long term ais data in altan and otay 2018 zhang et al 2019a proposed a model of regional risk assessment for open waters to provide an intuitive picture of the collision risk between ships within a certain area using the ais data of the maritime traffic off the coast of portugal rong et al 2021 applied the moran s i and getis ord gi spatial auto correlation methods to find out hot spots in this area with relatively high of density of ship near collisions in this study different ship types and ship lengths encounters situations are considered to calculate local spatial auto correlation of near collision zhang et al 2021 developed avoidance behavior based collision detection model abcd m to quantify collision risk indices by analyzing a big data from ais this model shows an ability to detect potential collision scenarios these maps are useful for marine environment management and can ensure the navigational safety in marine spatial and development plans despite of the help in maritime traffic analysis these above models are not available for instantaneous moment and it is hard to apply in real time monitoring most of these visualization methods only mapped the traffic density or finding traffic route the parameters considered for mapping traffic density are normally ship position and time stamp which are relatively limited in reflecting the risk of collision traffic hazard was identified by dividing the zones mainly corresponding to the route and using the past traffic volume data therefore it is not easy to grasp traffic risk in areas other than the route the ability to achieve the current real time traffic risk in entire port area is lack moreover these map frameworks only show the risk in large scale areas not be able to indicate the detail value of small hot spots there are still limitations highlighted in the literature specifically the accurate dynamic level of risk in particular areas for the port operation management and planning however it is important to deeply examine the spatial temporal dynamics of the collision risk state in small and particular areas thus there are still research gaps to be filled further in several regions around the world there are significant industrial regulatory and academic efforts being dedicated to the development of maritime autonomous surface ships mass goerlandt 2020 wrobel et al 2020 reviewed scientific and technical papers to perform a preliminary safety analysis to identify existing and future research directions in the field of autonomous merchant vessels this framework pointed out that most of researches have focused on technical aspects of mass operations and design the effect of human factors to the safety of mass has been studied in wrobel et al 2021 by collecting expert elicited data to enhance the understanding of the development of potential accidents because of the recent emergence of research for the mass there is a need for port control of unmanned ships in the future one of the requirements for mass is that they should at least be as safe as conventional ships fan et al 2020 when an autonomous ship enters a port or navigates coastal waterways stress risk is imposed due to other ships and obstacles because of restricted maneuvering space however it is difficult to determine how much risk or the danger level for certain ships and small areas in the coastal waterways until now thus there is a present need to develop a marine traffic assessment model to represent the degrees of navigation danger to prevent or reduce ship collision in advance in the congested waters this model is able to quantify the dynamic level of risk of multiple ships as the research target within a particular sea area and determine the geographical distribution of traffic hazard by applying the model to ais information this paper aims to introduce a quantifiable framework for maritime waterway risk model called harbour traffic hazard map this map is to display dynamic risk level in the entire port area based on the value of marine traffic hazard index the proposed framework is dramatically effective to estimate level of traffic hazard and to identify the dangerous area in a particular sea area in real time it can provide a reference for the evaluation of ship collisions and other traffic accidents and for the supervision of vts centers as well as mass operations the main contributions of the paper are propose marine traffic hazard index for dynamic level of marine traffic hazard developed using the influence function to calculate the impact of ships to area in the entire waters displayed on the entire port in order to show a harbor traffic hazard map this index has the advantage of presenting the dynamic navigation risk in real time and can be used this for traffic management in the era of mass technology propose habour traffic hazard map in a particular sea area that using marine traffic hazard index assessing regional hazard this model considers spatial and temporal features of ship positions in a high traffic area and assesses danger probabilities and possible locations of collision it can be used to identify and display small high risk hot spots which allow mariners to have evasive decision for collision avoidance by observing this map the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a construction of marine traffic hazard index and the validation by comparison with traffic congestion rate in an area section 3 illustrates the effectiveness of habour traffic hazard map by showing dynamic value of matha index in busan port area in section 4 the advantages of proposed habour traffic hazard map is discussed and compared with some previous visualization methods finally concluding remarks are provided in section 5 2 marine traffic hazard index modeling in this section the methodological approach to construct marine traffic hazard index is described including the introduction of definition and formula of influence function in section 2 1 applying gaussian influence function for marine traffic hazard index modeling in section 2 2 section 2 3 presented the validation of marine traffic hazard index by comparison with another index 2 1 influence function any data point in the neighborhood will affect other points surround it in order to describe the influence of a data point within its neighborhood a mathematical function called influence function is used hinneburg and keim 1998 this point will be also affected by other points in the vicinity an estimated impact to this data point is the sum of the influence function of all other data points the more points around it the more impact it receives some popular influence functions are parabolic functions square wave function or the gaussian function the influence function is applied to each data point an estimate of the overall density of the data space is the sum of the influence function of all data points hinneburg and keim 2003 the kernel functions are a mathematical description of the influence a data object has within its neighborhood f d is denoted for the d dimensional feature space a point x f d will suffer an impact as the sum of the influence functions of all data objects at that point the influence function of a data object y f d is a function f b y given n data objects described by a set of feature vectors d x 1 n the sum of the influence functions of all data points to one point is defined as 1 f b y x i 1 n f b x i x gaussian influence function is as follows 2 f g a u s s x y e d x y 2 2 σ 2 thus the sum of the influence function which results from a gaussian influence function is as follows 3 f g a u s s x y i 1 n e d x y 2 2 σ 2 fig 1 shows an example of a set of data points in 2d space together with the corresponding overall impacts by gaussian influence function the value of influence is greater at the area between these points it is in line with requirement of principle of waterway risk assessment therefore gaussian influence function would be suitable for construction of the new index 2 2 marine traffic hazard index modeling some studies of ship collision risk models of ren et al 2011 mou et al 2010 pointed out that real time risk assessment has played a more and more important role in the field of automatic collision avoidance bukhari et al 2013 goerlandt et al 2015 highlighted that there is a strong motivation to develop a smart system which can take the distance at closest point of approach d c p a and time to closest point of approach t c p a to calculate the degree of collision risk among all vessels provide warnings of the collision risk in a real time operational environment from the vts center an approach to investigate the traffic hazard by an index has been proposed in zhang et al 2015 in which the value of vessel conflict ranking operator vcro is used to detect and rank the possible near miss ship ship collisions from ais data resulted in the image of spatial clusters in a certain area but the covered area by this value is too large leading to the difficulty in assessment an application of lensu and goerlandt 2019 using big maritime data to show spatial traffic statistics for the baltic sea but it is useful for maritime traffic analysis and makes few contribution to collision risk representation since the motion between the encountered ships is always changing and in turn causing changes in risk level it is clear that risk assessment from only one side is not sufficient during the process of risk assessment for encounters the ships encounters can be described by ship movement parameters which change dynamically thus the level of risk is continuously assessed in changing conditions this dynamic nature of marine hazard requires that the identification of dynamic states should be measured continuously then can be transformed to hazard map the dynamic hazard can provide initial decision on collision avoidance and keep ship avoid all other target ships in encounter situation to investigate waterway risk the density complexity in wen et al 2015 and masalonis et al 2003 is one of popular approaches to estimate the traffic conditions for certain water area there will be plenty of ships at the same time however the level of risk in the water not only depends on the number of ships but also is determined by the size and the motion included speed and direction of the ships in im and luong 2019 the gaussian function was used to construct potential risk ship domain prsd for real time potential collision risk assessment between two ships because the gaussian influence function meets the requirement that the closer to the ship the larger the influence is and the higher the collision risk is potential collision risk pcr is used as the value to reflect the potential collision risk distribution of the ship of one point in its surrounding environment suppose the position of the own ship is x y with ship length l speed v and the heading φ and point p x p y p d c p a and t c p a are two parameters usually to determine the degree of risk of ship collision at sea for the calculation of d c p a and t c p a between own ship and point p a perpendicular from point p is drawn to the heading line of the own ship having c p a when approaching point p d c p a is the shortest distance between the own ship and point p while t c p a is the time needed to reach the closest point of approach consequently in the ship motion simulation system the ship motion parameters can be expressed in fig 2 the p c r index at any point p x p y p around the ship which means the influence of the ship to this point can be calculated as follows 4 p c r f p o i n t p e r i 2 2 σ 2 where r is he risk diameter which is the combination of d c p a and t c p a can be found based on the model of kearon 1977 as follows 5 r λ d c p a 2 t c p a 2 where σ longitudinal influence parameter λ lateral influence parameter by applying prsd model the area around the ship can be digitally generated based on value of p c r the ship heading determines the direction of the longitudinal axis of the ship domain the ship speed determines the degree of extension of the fore side the coverage of the ship domain is decided by the influence parameters the dynamic nature of the marine traffic hazard requires the identification of dynamic states which can be continuously measured therefore it is necessary to define an index to provide such a continuous measurement for dynamic waterway risk in this study marine traffic hazard index matha index is developed to describe the dynamic waterway risk matha index refers to the degree of risk of one point in certain water area this index changes dynamically and can be measured in a time series therefore matha index can represent a dynamic waterway risk and it changes if the ships motions are changing during an encounter matha index of each point at one moment is sum of influence of all ships to this point as follows 6 m a t h a i n d e x p o i n t r i 2 2 σ 2 where i is the number of ships have influence on the point as we can see in fig 3 every point in the neighborhood of the ships has a value of matha index and points with same value of matha index will be shown as contour lines matha index can be graphically shown as a type of ship domain the core idea is that when the ships are moving closer to each other their respective ship domains contour lines of matha index will have an overlap the overlapped area which can be understood as the potential collision area is the collision position this area will vary at different moments and the changes of the overlapped area also demonstrate the degree of the collision probability in a moment of encounter situation in case of a multi ship encounter at each moment when ships are approaching each other values of matha index of points between these ships increase according to their positions to ships the influence of these ships to this area is higher than to other areas due to the change of matha index the color describes the area with a probability of the happening of collision accident changes from cool to hot one as can be seen in fig 3 a and fig 3 b matha index is a cost like value it tends to be higher for the higher of the collision risk the points with high values of matha index indicate that there will probably be a collision there if the ships involved do not perform the evasive action and the magnitude of the action required to clear the situation with matha index the entire levels of risk in certain water area can be identified by calculating the level of risk of every single location in this area it can be understood that the danger is assessed in both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives the proposed index also can be used to map the geographical distribution of risk as a visual heat map named habour traffic hazard map this map can help maritime surveillance operators recognize the risk level of certain water and understand the distribution of risk by exact value of matha index 2 3 marine traffic hazard index validation in order to validate the effectiveness of matha index a comparison is carried out in this section to carry out this comparison with matha index another index should be selected the algorithms or models adopted in probabilistic risk analysis are known as vessel conflict ranking operator e g zhang et al 2015 2020 ship safety domain e g szlapczynski et al 2018a b velocity obstacle e g chen et al 2018 2020 in this study traffic congestion rate t c r is employed t c r is a measure of the actual marine traffic volume as a percentage of the maritime traffic volume capacity for a certain fairway fujii et al 1981 fujii claimed that the concept of ship domain can be used to determine the maximum traffic density of a waterway montewka et al 2020 the result of fujii s model shows the spatial variation in where collision risk is perceived to be highest rawson and brito 2021 therefore it is suitable to be selected for comparison with matha index which also has a function of showing high potential collision risk area if the marine traffic capacity is equal to the actual marine traffic volume the marine traffic congestion value of the fairway becomes 100 which is considered to have reached the theoretical limit allowable for traffic capacity t c r has shown its usefulness and success as an indicator that represents the relative marine traffic capacity of the fairway and the congestion situation of the fairway on an average in korea waters it also has taken account of ship length which is one of most important factors when evaluating marine traffic of waterway the ship size plays a key role during encounters mainly because larger ships need larger space to maneuver therefore t c r is suitable for the validation of matha index the study area encompasses busan port bounded by the latitudes 35 02 n 35 13 n and longitudes 128 98 e 129 17 e the axes are converted to nautical miles n m as shown on fig 4 which is a typical busy waterway in south korea the observing period took place from 8 to 9 june 2018 the variables that are used as input are the ship position speed over ground s o g course over ground c o g and ship length which can be obtained from the ais data given the recent explosion of ais that enable the collection of high temporal frequency ship tracking data there is an opportunity to explore ship movements and space use patterns to demonstrate the validity of matha index the comparison with t c r is carried out in the survey cell black square in fig 4 the ship traffic volume in this cell is particularly high because the area contains many piers and berths according to previous researches in the proposed method the research area is divided into a number of grids along latitude and longitude the grid is composed of two dimensional interlaced straight lines the intersections of these lines are featured with different values of matha index the grid is usually divided in many ways depends on surveyed area and research purposes thus the distance between the intersections are different the smaller the grid the more intersections there are with many intersections habour traffic hazard map can show more detail level of danger in area with smooth contour lines with the length of the standard ship is 70 m the surveyed are is divided by sector with size 0 05 0 05 nm around 90 90 m the values of matha index of points in the survey cell in each hour are calculated with the input from ais data then divided by t as interval of time all the points are assigned with an matha index per time to plot the habour traffic hazard map 7 m a t h a i n d e x p o i n t 1 t r i 2 2 σ 2 to assess marine traffic congestion in different time of the same water area or in different water area at the same time the ships in a certain scale are often selected as the standard ships for conversion a specific ship size is selected as the standard ship and ships of other sizes are converted by different conversion factor in this way the marine traffic congestion based on standard ship can indicate the danger level of the ship in the waterway more comprehensively and accurately the standard ship was defined as a ship with a total gross tonnage g t of 1 000 tons and l o a of 70 m which is close to the average coastal vessel of korea table 1 is the ship conversion coefficient factors when assess maritime traffic congestion the equation for calculating the marine traffic congestion is in fujii et al 1981 and park et al 2013 as follows 8 q 1 γ ς w v 9 q p 0 25 q 10 t c r q t q p where q is basic traffic volume of fairway ships h γ is occupied area s longest diameter km ς is occupied area s shortest diameter km w is width of fairway km v is ship speed km h t c r is traffic congestion rate q t is l 2 converted traffic volume per hour q p is practical traffic volume in this research considering the narrow channel in the port the congestion value was assessed by using the occupied area 6 l 1 6 l in the narrow channel and port based on the size of ship domain of fujii and tanaka 1971 fujii 1971 the effect of size of the ship s domain to the congestion was investigated the results showed that each area with different fairway width will have it owns setting for the size of the occupied area for example 3 5 l 1 5 l in japan 5 9 l 2 2 l in shanghai 4 l 5 b park and jeong 2014 in case of busan port current safety audit system has selected 6 l 1 6 l as the appropriate size of the occupied area in the busan port no 1 fairway ships are not allowed proceeding over the limit speed by regulation so that the difference of speed is not big the speed for calculation was set as average speed the width of the busan port no 1 fairway is about 340 m and an average of about 196 vessels are in and out of the port per day with an average of 10 vessels per hour the basic traffic capacity of busan north port is 133 86 ships per hour and practical traffic capacity is 33 46 vessels per hour because the marine traffic congestion is calculated for one waterway these values will be applied for whole route no 1 the red area in fig 4 included the survey cell using the ships lengths obtained from ais in both days ships sizes were assigned by conversion factors for each ship length if ship size data was not available the standard ship length was used l 2 factors of ships through busan no 1 route are calculated per hour in 2 days as shown in figs 5 and 6 the practical traffic capacity is represented by the red line as a result the l 2 converted traffic volume per hour of the no 1 fairway was significantly high in both days it shows that the large number of ships are going through no 1 fairway each hour in a day and it can indicate the degree of crowding and the risk of collision the greater the number of ship is the higher the collision risk would be then the traffic congestion rates of busan no 1 route for each hour are calculated by eq 11 as mentioned above each point will have its own value of matha index thus the matha indexes in survey cell will be shown as the range m i n m a x the comparison of matha index and t c r in the survey cell in both days is shown in figs 7 and 8 it can be observed that there is an obvious relationship between matha index and t c r of the area selected in each day the results point out that the trend of range of matha index values is following the tendency of t c r values with such busy traffic the marine hazard in this survey cell would certainly be higher which is the same as the indication of proposed dynamic matha index another should be mentioned here is that when the number of ships passing the survey cell from 6 to 23 on 8th was greater than those on 9th the range of matha index on 8th was around 2 4 5 and only 0 3 5 on 9th for the times of relatively large amount of ships indicated by tcr such as 6 to 23 on 8th the values of matha index are also relatively high compared with the low risk region such as 3 to 4 on 9th therefore it can be proved that the higher values of matha index are well matched with the reality of the traffic indicated by the traffic congestion rate for further illustrating and validating proposed matha index the average values of matha index in each hour are compared with tcr the mean minimum maximum values of matha index and pcr in two days are presented in table 2 pearson correlation coefficient can also be used for the validation of the proposed matha index pearson s correlation coefficient is the co variance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations which is calculated as follows 11 r n a b a b n a 2 a 2 n b 2 b 2 applying pearson correlation coefficient formula for mean matha index and t c r value of 2 days we have r 08 0 9642 and r 09 0 9615 these coefficients indicated the large positive correlation of two indexes it is revealed by fig 9 that the relatively higher values of mean matha index is also in accordance with the high t c r of survey cell at the same time as well as the low values therefore it can be proved that the proposed dynamic matha index can reflect the overall marine traffic hazard in waterway effectively and reasonably 3 application of habour traffic hazard map due to the fact that the sea of korea is one of the most important shipping areas of the world connecting major economies such as china japan russia and south korea the rise in foreign trade in this region has led to an increase in port traffic the ship traffic volume through this area is extremely high because the area contains large ports such as the busan port which is among the world s top ten container ports song and lee 2006 it is appeared that marine accidents in korea were more frequent on the southern sea than on the eastern and western seas tribunal 2016 busan port ranked as one of the largest waterways in korea which has a relatively large amount of traffic the busy water area creates a favorable condition for the information of waterway risk assessment in section 2 3 only matha index in the survey cell of busan port no 1 route was calculated but this experiment considered whole busan port area for the purpose of mapping the habour traffic hazard map geographically the studied water area is positioned between latitudes 35 02 n 35 13 n and longitudes 128 98 e 129 17 e the source ais data in 8th and 9th june 2018 were utilized the ais message of surveyed area including the information on position speed course time and mmsi were extracted in csv format raw ais data do not contain ship characteristics such as type and size these characteristics can be found from a ship database since each ship has a unique mmsi number the ship characteristics were extracted from the ship database by means of the corresponding mmsi number ais information can be incorrect due to various technical shortcomings ais data are not continuous for each vessel and present unequal receiving intervals in addition there are several records with inaccurate speed information though the majority of collected ais records are accurate it is inappropriate to abandon these records in view of the real time data integrity hence the method of interpolation was applied each data point is checked for position heading speed and course the average speed can be calculated as the ratio of journey distance and traveling time therefore the location records and the acceleration deceleration abilities of vessels can be used to check whether the speed records are within the reasonable range or not the incorrect speed related will be replaced with the corresponding mean speed spatial distribution of ship positions at certain period in busan port is shown in fig 10 by observing this spatial distribution map of ship positions the water area with high ship density could be inferred with higher possibility of marine hazard the denser positions could reveal that this area is suffering the great amount of ships passing through and the chance for the complicated traffic situation is higher than other area moreover in this kind of busy waterway all of the encountering types can be formed it can be seen that there is a main traffic flows in busan port which is no 1 route most of the ships sail in through this route however from this kind of density map only the locations where ships gathered are observed but the level of danger or marine hazard of such locations cannot be achieved any points in the area cannot be presented by any index therefore there is a need to establish a new map for visualize the marine traffic hazard by exact value of each point the spatial distribution of the marine traffic hazard within busan port area which is a grid of 0 05 0 05 nm divided according to the latitude and longitude direction is determined using ais data the required maritime traffic data for eq 7 and the matha index value are updated for each point in whole area the final outcome of this experiment is habour traffic hazard map showing the spatial distribution of encounter probability the samples of resulting maps can be presented in 2d and 3d that is given in figs 11 12 13 14 habour traffic hazard map in each hour is established based on the values of matha index of all points to identify the hotspots to be specific after adopting the proposed framework the matha index value at each intersection of grid can be obtained this dynamic matha index is changing with the changes of data from all ships in the area the calculated hourly matha index values are mainly concentrated between 0 5 the contour lines of matha index help to enhance visualization of the areas with similar level of risk the set of contour lines are shown as heat map the redder the color is the greater the possibility of risk will be in survey period the value of matha index distributed over the area increases towards traffic intersection area along the waterway at the beginning of the waterway the matha index started to increase and mainly reached the maximum at the intersection area this is mainly due to the transit ships traveling in and out the waterway it can be found out that the matha index in area along route no 1 significantly higher than other areas suggesting that the risk in is relatively higher to some extent this is consistent with the high traffic density as indicated by the ship trajectory map to ensure safe navigation the ships in the waterway should maintain a safe distance between each other the most dangerous location around the area at 5 nm 5 nm on june 8th where the highest matha index is 4 5 it is observed that the water area with relatively low matha index lower than 1 distributes outside the no 1 route and in open waters the range of matha index around 1 5 2 5 appeared many times during survey period while the range 3 4 5 only happened at area with encounters of ships moving closer to each other the results of habour traffic hazard map can be shown in both 2d and 3d in comparison with 2d the visualization of 3d can show more detail about the area with low values of matha index which cannot be shown in 2d map by contour lines the higher the matha index is the more possibility of risk there is 4 discussion this paper proposes a novel framework to map the geographical distribution of marine traffic hazard based on the value of new developed index name marine traffic hazard index matha index assuming that one ship has its own influence to the vicinity and all area around it will be affect by it the overall impact at one point is sum of all influences of all ships to it based on this theory the matha index is constructed to reflect the level of risk at one point the higher value of matha index is the chance of risk happen at that point is higher then the value of matha index was utilized to establish the habour traffic hazard map this is the dynamic map which can continuously identify the changing geographical distribution of risk in the water area by inputting the real time dynamic information extracted from ais data such as position speed course dimension etc into the model the dynamic traffic hazard map of the water area can be plotted the summary of the proposed habour traffic hazard map s contribution when compared with past methods in mapping collision risk in the water area is given in table 3 in silveira et al 2013 van iperen 2015 zhang et al 2015 2016 and yoo 2018 the factor of ship s particular was not mentioned thus the ships which have different sizes and maneuverability have the same value this does not reflect reality in most cases especially risk assessment will become significantly less effective when the sizes of encountered ships have a large difference as opposed to a fairly accurate assessment when the difference between their sizes is much smaller these models did not take account of ship size which may affect the distance at which they pass each other therefore the difference in ship sizes cannot be ignored the basic idea of goerlandt et al 2011 weng and xue 2015 van iperen 2015 and wu et al 2016 is to scan the database for events where the ships domains are violated to determine conflict or near collisions in the above models ship domains in use are static invariable of ship speed regardless of the dynamic features one of the most important factors affecting the safety of a ship is the speed in fact the level of risk will be much greater for higher speed ships it is reasonable to be changed with different ship speed wang et al 2017 to model a dynamic map it is key point to form the shape which fully consider with ship s specific speed there is clearly distinctive difference between previous models and the proposed habour traffic hazard map which accounts for dynamic changes in speeds the level of risk of each zone dynamically changes throughout the navigational process according to the change of values of matha index similar with most of previous mapping models the data included matha index and map by habour traffic hazard map can be stored for analysis and research for one area marine traffic data of whole area by these methods except zhen et al 2017 is visualized from months to years such data would facilitate the exercise of precaution in passing through dangerous or high traffic areas opposing with previous frameworks not focus on real time monitoring by using habour traffic hazard map matha index which reflects dynamic degree navigation risk has advantage in instantaneous calculation with the value of matha index is instantaneously updated mariners as well as vts operators can control the situation in real time and have fast and reasonable actions for collision avoidance due to the high traffic in the waterway there is not much time for making decisions thus this function can better assist to assess the traffic situation and detect possible critical situations in the waterway the possibility of multi ships happening to be close to others is really high nevertheless the risk assessed by goerlandt et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 zhen et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019a is determined between a pair of ships this presents a possible weakness in using these techniques to evaluate maritime traffic safety the habour traffic hazard map recognizes the complexity of multi ship encounter matha index of one point in waters can be calculated by all ships involved in the encounters the area of high values of matha index can be predicted as area of collision accidents that are occurring during the approaching and departing maneuvers in silveira et al 2013 the collision risk map is constructed from the assessment of the number of collision candidates by estimating future distances between ships based on their previous positions courses and speeds and comparing those distances with a defined collision diameter goerlandt et al 2011 weng and xue 2015 wu et al 2016 aimed to evaluate the ship collision frequency in port waterways therefore the exact values of collision risk are not obtained it is easier to observe the difference in level of risk between different locations by habour traffic hazard map another question that remains is the size of the spatial resolution in the process of establish the heat map of risk different spatial resolution will be selected according to the purpose of research or the survey area if the area covered is too large the assessment in small zone in this would be inaccurate for example in the models of zhang et al 2016 2019a the collision risk is computed and ranked for 6 nm x 6 nm squares it means that each square will have same value in yoo 2018 a near miss density map for the safe navigation of ships in the sea off the south coast of korea did not represent in cell or sector however the result showed that the busan port had the similar value leading to the difficult in identification of the collision risks in port area in the experiment carried out in proposed study the dimension of survey area is around 9 nm x 6 nm and the distance between points is only 0 05 nm thus the amount of calculation will increase sharply and the result could be more detail for each part of area the proposed model succeeds in quickly evaluating the situation especially in high traffic water area through habour traffic hazard map ship navigator and maritime surveillance operator can study the spatial distribution of collision risk in the water area in real time or in a period of time they also can make a judge the level of danger of encounter situation and predict the area with high opportunity of the happening of collision accident by observing the value of matha index and keep other ships not to enter this area the short term anticipation of the high risk area can enhance their working efficiency help decision making and may reduce the risk of collision a potential application of proposed framework is to create a collision avoidance algorithm for mass it could be also used in maritime traffic monitoring and risk assessment prediction of near miss collisions in the short term with sufficient ship kinematics data which are usually obtained from ais data and anticipations of ship manoeuvres the habour traffic hazard map with the dynamic matha index can be inferred so that the mass takes early collision avoidance action in any situation accordingly it could secure more time for to take suitable collision prevention action if an autonomous vts center is formed it is considering a system that evaluates the risk of the entire port area and notifies individual ships of the risk so that the unmanned ship can be guided according to the risk in other words the vts center in the era of unmanned ships automatically evaluates the risk of the entire port and considers the system that can share this with each ship as utility however the proposed model still has some limitations only kinetics factors such as ship s speed course and ship s length are taken into consideration for modeling matha index and habour traffic hazard map other factors like climate weather condition human operations or regulations in the water area should be researched further to improve the accuracy of the framework in addition the spatial distribution of matha index shown on habour traffic hazard map may be not clear enough in larger area where the ships have no impacts each other and there is no overlapped area by the contour lines of matha index of these ships however it can be overcome by analyzing more data of various situations encounters to optimize the model parameters more encounter scenarios and additional ship movement data during before and after encounters and the possibility of ship manoeuvres are necessary 5 conclusion in this research a new waterway risk assessment model by provide a spatial distribution of risk was proposed which is based on the new developed new marine traffic hazard index matha index for modeling the function of matha index the influence function is utilized this index represents the influence of all ships in the neighborhood to it and reflect the level of risk by exact value in order to validate the effectiveness of matha index a comparison with traffic congestion rate was carried out the consistent of the tendency of the two indexes showed that the matha index can reflect the overall marine traffic hazard in waterway effectively by using the proposed marine traffic hazard index the dynamic traffic hazard map for the water area named habour traffic hazard map can be depicted observing the habour traffic hazard map applied for busan port area it reveals that the new map overcomes the limitations and shows improvements over other models it could show the dynamic level of risk since the present analysis is based on ais records which are continuously available for any time period it also shows the ability to predict the potential collision locations that will be able to occur during the approaching and departing maneuvers it succeeds in identification of high risk collision areas which allow reliable and accurate analysis to aid implementation of safety measures assist surveillance operators in order to assist them in their monitoring work it also can be reference for research of the mass in the future credit authorship contribution statement tu nam luong

20183,the evaluation of maritime waterway risk is required to take further advance measure for reduction of ship collision accident in general a risk assessment of ship collision can be estimated by

density of vessel traffic busy waterways are areas with high potential for accidents in comparison with open sea areas which are associated with more significant risks although in most waterways the overall accident probability is known their spatial distribution is not commonly available as a detailed map early detection of such risk situations provides critical time to take appropriate action with possibly before potential problems occur wiersma 2010 accident probability assessment is one of the most important steps for deciding preventive actions the traditional waterways risk analysis is usually conducted by means of ship traffic surveys including visual observations radar observations as well as airborne photography zhang et al 2019b the first ship traffic survey was conducted in japan in 1963 fujii and tanaka 1971 nowadays the advanced ship traffic data collection methods such as vessel traffic services vts and automatic identification system ais are developed to guarantee the high reliability of ship traffic information in port waters ais data has been used for estimating the accident probability map of a waterway kujala et al 2009 and harbor entrances mou et al 2010 these studies have been followed by ship collision risk off the coast of portugal silveira et al 2013 accident risk in the malacca strait maimun et al 2014 zaman et al 2013 ship sinking frequencies in madura strait indonesia mulyadi et al 2013 near miss detection in singapore port anchorages debnath and chin 2016 northern baltic sea zhang et al 2016 and collision probability in the strait of messina cucinotta et al 2017 the ship traffic analysis based on ais data has become extremely promising to precisely achieve ship navigation activities and understand maritime traffic in high density waters in order to support decision making and ship traffic control willems et al 2009 transferred the ais data to the geographical visualization based on the density fields the visualization of ship trajectory and density map of tsou 2010 merely showed in arcgis without any further quantitative ship traffic analysis ais data was used to obtain the fundamental ship traffic statistics and estimate navigation patterns in the restricted waters in aarsaether and moan 2009 in order to improve navigational safety some researchers have focused on visualization model of navigation in the water area silveira et al 2013 plotted the ship traffic pattern off the coast of portugal using ais data algorithms were developed to calculate the number of collision candidates by predicting the future distances between ships weng and xue 2015 estimate the ship collision frequency in port waterways and presents the spatial distributions of dangerous ship encounters in the five fairways shelmerdine 2015 uses ais data to visualize the marine traffic around shetland such as ais pings map vessel density map vessel track map vessel length map etc breithaupt et al 2017 graphically showed ship routes between ports along the atlantic coast of the us by ais data in 2 years wu et al 2017 mapped the global ship and traffic density indicated the distribution of ships and traffic using a very large amount of ais data from 2012 to 2015 using a systematic investigation for the collision risk parameters of a vessel pair weibin zhang et al 2017 evaluated and analyzed the navigation risk of ships and the scope of ship safety in the narrow northern baltic sea zhen et al 2017 proposed a framework of real time multi vessel collision assessment that combines a spatial clustering process for detecting clusters of encounter vessels and a multi vessel collision risk index model for encounter vessels within each cluster from the large amounts of monitored vessels in a surveyed sea area the model of yoo 2018 was to depict the near miss density using rgb color and enable the identification of relatively dangerous locations where the relative frequency of near misses increases as the colors tends to red the spatial distribution of the encounter probability within the strait of istanbul is determined using long term ais data in altan and otay 2018 zhang et al 2019a proposed a model of regional risk assessment for open waters to provide an intuitive picture of the collision risk between ships within a certain area using the ais data of the maritime traffic off the coast of portugal rong et al 2021 applied the moran s i and getis ord gi spatial auto correlation methods to find out hot spots in this area with relatively high of density of ship near collisions in this study different ship types and ship lengths encounters situations are considered to calculate local spatial auto correlation of near collision zhang et al 2021 developed avoidance behavior based collision detection model abcd m to quantify collision risk indices by analyzing a big data from ais this model shows an ability to detect potential collision scenarios these maps are useful for marine environment management and can ensure the navigational safety in marine spatial and development plans despite of the help in maritime traffic analysis these above models are not available for instantaneous moment and it is hard to apply in real time monitoring most of these visualization methods only mapped the traffic density or finding traffic route the parameters considered for mapping traffic density are normally ship position and time stamp which are relatively limited in reflecting the risk of collision traffic hazard was identified by dividing the zones mainly corresponding to the route and using the past traffic volume data therefore it is not easy to grasp traffic risk in areas other than the route the ability to achieve the current real time traffic risk in entire port area is lack moreover these map frameworks only show the risk in large scale areas not be able to indicate the detail value of small hot spots there are still limitations highlighted in the literature specifically the accurate dynamic level of risk in particular areas for the port operation management and planning however it is important to deeply examine the spatial temporal dynamics of the collision risk state in small and particular areas thus there are still research gaps to be filled further in several regions around the world there are significant industrial regulatory and academic efforts being dedicated to the development of maritime autonomous surface ships mass goerlandt 2020 wrobel et al 2020 reviewed scientific and technical papers to perform a preliminary safety analysis to identify existing and future research directions in the field of autonomous merchant vessels this framework pointed out that most of researches have focused on technical aspects of mass operations and design the effect of human factors to the safety of mass has been studied in wrobel et al 2021 by collecting expert elicited data to enhance the understanding of the development of potential accidents because of the recent emergence of research for the mass there is a need for port control of unmanned ships in the future one of the requirements for mass is that they should at least be as safe as conventional ships fan et al 2020 when an autonomous ship enters a port or navigates coastal waterways stress risk is imposed due to other ships and obstacles because of restricted maneuvering space however it is difficult to determine how much risk or the danger level for certain ships and small areas in the coastal waterways until now thus there is a present need to develop a marine traffic assessment model to represent the degrees of navigation danger to prevent or reduce ship collision in advance in the congested waters this model is able to quantify the dynamic level of risk of multiple ships as the research target within a particular sea area and determine the geographical distribution of traffic hazard by applying the model to ais information this paper aims to introduce a quantifiable framework for maritime waterway risk model called harbour traffic hazard map this map is to display dynamic risk level in the entire port area based on the value of marine traffic hazard index the proposed framework is dramatically effective to estimate level of traffic hazard and to identify the dangerous area in a particular sea area in real time it can provide a reference for the evaluation of ship collisions and other traffic accidents and for the supervision of vts centers as well as mass operations the main contributions of the paper are propose marine traffic hazard index for dynamic level of marine traffic hazard developed using the influence function to calculate the impact of ships to area in the entire waters displayed on the entire port in order to show a harbor traffic hazard map this index has the advantage of presenting the dynamic navigation risk in real time and can be used this for traffic management in the era of mass technology propose habour traffic hazard map in a particular sea area that using marine traffic hazard index assessing regional hazard this model considers spatial and temporal features of ship positions in a high traffic area and assesses danger probabilities and possible locations of collision it can be used to identify and display small high risk hot spots which allow mariners to have evasive decision for collision avoidance by observing this map the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a construction of marine traffic hazard index and the validation by comparison with traffic congestion rate in an area section 3 illustrates the effectiveness of habour traffic hazard map by showing dynamic value of matha index in busan port area in section 4 the advantages of proposed habour traffic hazard map is discussed and compared with some previous visualization methods finally concluding remarks are provided in section 5 2 marine traffic hazard index modeling in this section the methodological approach to construct marine traffic hazard index is described including the introduction of definition and formula of influence function in section 2 1 applying gaussian influence function for marine traffic hazard index modeling in section 2 2 section 2 3 presented the validation of marine traffic hazard index by comparison with another index 2 1 influence function any data point in the neighborhood will affect other points surround it in order to describe the influence of a data point within its neighborhood a mathematical function called influence function is used hinneburg and keim 1998 this point will be also affected by other points in the vicinity an estimated impact to this data point is the sum of the influence function of all other data points the more points around it the more impact it receives some popular influence functions are parabolic functions square wave function or the gaussian function the influence function is applied to each data point an estimate of the overall density of the data space is the sum of the influence function of all data points hinneburg and keim 2003 the kernel functions are a mathematical description of the influence a data object has within its neighborhood f d is denoted for the d dimensional feature space a point x f d will suffer an impact as the sum of the influence functions of all data objects at that point the influence function of a data object y f d is a function f b y given n data objects described by a set of feature vectors d x 1 n the sum of the influence functions of all data points to one point is defined as 1 f b y x i 1 n f b x i x gaussian influence function is as follows 2 f g a u s s x y e d x y 2 2 σ 2 thus the sum of the influence function which results from a gaussian influence function is as follows 3 f g a u s s x y i 1 n e d x y 2 2 σ 2 fig 1 shows an example of a set of data points in 2d space together with the corresponding overall impacts by gaussian influence function the value of influence is greater at the area between these points it is in line with requirement of principle of waterway risk assessment therefore gaussian influence function would be suitable for construction of the new index 2 2 marine traffic hazard index modeling some studies of ship collision risk models of ren et al 2011 mou et al 2010 pointed out that real time risk assessment has played a more and more important role in the field of automatic collision avoidance bukhari et al 2013 goerlandt et al 2015 highlighted that there is a strong motivation to develop a smart system which can take the distance at closest point of approach d c p a and time to closest point of approach t c p a to calculate the degree of collision risk among all vessels provide warnings of the collision risk in a real time operational environment from the vts center an approach to investigate the traffic hazard by an index has been proposed in zhang et al 2015 in which the value of vessel conflict ranking operator vcro is used to detect and rank the possible near miss ship ship collisions from ais data resulted in the image of spatial clusters in a certain area but the covered area by this value is too large leading to the difficulty in assessment an application of lensu and goerlandt 2019 using big maritime data to show spatial traffic statistics for the baltic sea but it is useful for maritime traffic analysis and makes few contribution to collision risk representation since the motion between the encountered ships is always changing and in turn causing changes in risk level it is clear that risk assessment from only one side is not sufficient during the process of risk assessment for encounters the ships encounters can be described by ship movement parameters which change dynamically thus the level of risk is continuously assessed in changing conditions this dynamic nature of marine hazard requires that the identification of dynamic states should be measured continuously then can be transformed to hazard map the dynamic hazard can provide initial decision on collision avoidance and keep ship avoid all other target ships in encounter situation to investigate waterway risk the density complexity in wen et al 2015 and masalonis et al 2003 is one of popular approaches to estimate the traffic conditions for certain water area there will be plenty of ships at the same time however the level of risk in the water not only depends on the number of ships but also is determined by the size and the motion included speed and direction of the ships in im and luong 2019 the gaussian function was used to construct potential risk ship domain prsd for real time potential collision risk assessment between two ships because the gaussian influence function meets the requirement that the closer to the ship the larger the influence is and the higher the collision risk is potential collision risk pcr is used as the value to reflect the potential collision risk distribution of the ship of one point in its surrounding environment suppose the position of the own ship is x y with ship length l speed v and the heading φ and point p x p y p d c p a and t c p a are two parameters usually to determine the degree of risk of ship collision at sea for the calculation of d c p a and t c p a between own ship and point p a perpendicular from point p is drawn to the heading line of the own ship having c p a when approaching point p d c p a is the shortest distance between the own ship and point p while t c p a is the time needed to reach the closest point of approach consequently in the ship motion simulation system the ship motion parameters can be expressed in fig 2 the p c r index at any point p x p y p around the ship which means the influence of the ship to this point can be calculated as follows 4 p c r f p o i n t p e r i 2 2 σ 2 where r is he risk diameter which is the combination of d c p a and t c p a can be found based on the model of kearon 1977 as follows 5 r λ d c p a 2 t c p a 2 where σ longitudinal influence parameter λ lateral influence parameter by applying prsd model the area around the ship can be digitally generated based on value of p c r the ship heading determines the direction of the longitudinal axis of the ship domain the ship speed determines the degree of extension of the fore side the coverage of the ship domain is decided by the influence parameters the dynamic nature of the marine traffic hazard requires the identification of dynamic states which can be continuously measured therefore it is necessary to define an index to provide such a continuous measurement for dynamic waterway risk in this study marine traffic hazard index matha index is developed to describe the dynamic waterway risk matha index refers to the degree of risk of one point in certain water area this index changes dynamically and can be measured in a time series therefore matha index can represent a dynamic waterway risk and it changes if the ships motions are changing during an encounter matha index of each point at one moment is sum of influence of all ships to this point as follows 6 m a t h a i n d e x p o i n t r i 2 2 σ 2 where i is the number of ships have influence on the point as we can see in fig 3 every point in the neighborhood of the ships has a value of matha index and points with same value of matha index will be shown as contour lines matha index can be graphically shown as a type of ship domain the core idea is that when the ships are moving closer to each other their respective ship domains contour lines of matha index will have an overlap the overlapped area which can be understood as the potential collision area is the collision position this area will vary at different moments and the changes of the overlapped area also demonstrate the degree of the collision probability in a moment of encounter situation in case of a multi ship encounter at each moment when ships are approaching each other values of matha index of points between these ships increase according to their positions to ships the influence of these ships to this area is higher than to other areas due to the change of matha index the color describes the area with a probability of the happening of collision accident changes from cool to hot one as can be seen in fig 3 a and fig 3 b matha index is a cost like value it tends to be higher for the higher of the collision risk the points with high values of matha index indicate that there will probably be a collision there if the ships involved do not perform the evasive action and the magnitude of the action required to clear the situation with matha index the entire levels of risk in certain water area can be identified by calculating the level of risk of every single location in this area it can be understood that the danger is assessed in both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives the proposed index also can be used to map the geographical distribution of risk as a visual heat map named habour traffic hazard map this map can help maritime surveillance operators recognize the risk level of certain water and understand the distribution of risk by exact value of matha index 2 3 marine traffic hazard index validation in order to validate the effectiveness of matha index a comparison is carried out in this section to carry out this comparison with matha index another index should be selected the algorithms or models adopted in probabilistic risk analysis are known as vessel conflict ranking operator e g zhang et al 2015 2020 ship safety domain e g szlapczynski et al 2018a b velocity obstacle e g chen et al 2018 2020 in this study traffic congestion rate t c r is employed t c r is a measure of the actual marine traffic volume as a percentage of the maritime traffic volume capacity for a certain fairway fujii et al 1981 fujii claimed that the concept of ship domain can be used to determine the maximum traffic density of a waterway montewka et al 2020 the result of fujii s model shows the spatial variation in where collision risk is perceived to be highest rawson and brito 2021 therefore it is suitable to be selected for comparison with matha index which also has a function of showing high potential collision risk area if the marine traffic capacity is equal to the actual marine traffic volume the marine traffic congestion value of the fairway becomes 100 which is considered to have reached the theoretical limit allowable for traffic capacity t c r has shown its usefulness and success as an indicator that represents the relative marine traffic capacity of the fairway and the congestion situation of the fairway on an average in korea waters it also has taken account of ship length which is one of most important factors when evaluating marine traffic of waterway the ship size plays a key role during encounters mainly because larger ships need larger space to maneuver therefore t c r is suitable for the validation of matha index the study area encompasses busan port bounded by the latitudes 35 02 n 35 13 n and longitudes 128 98 e 129 17 e the axes are converted to nautical miles n m as shown on fig 4 which is a typical busy waterway in south korea the observing period took place from 8 to 9 june 2018 the variables that are used as input are the ship position speed over ground s o g course over ground c o g and ship length which can be obtained from the ais data given the recent explosion of ais that enable the collection of high temporal frequency ship tracking data there is an opportunity to explore ship movements and space use patterns to demonstrate the validity of matha index the comparison with t c r is carried out in the survey cell black square in fig 4 the ship traffic volume in this cell is particularly high because the area contains many piers and berths according to previous researches in the proposed method the research area is divided into a number of grids along latitude and longitude the grid is composed of two dimensional interlaced straight lines the intersections of these lines are featured with different values of matha index the grid is usually divided in many ways depends on surveyed area and research purposes thus the distance between the intersections are different the smaller the grid the more intersections there are with many intersections habour traffic hazard map can show more detail level of danger in area with smooth contour lines with the length of the standard ship is 70 m the surveyed are is divided by sector with size 0 05 0 05 nm around 90 90 m the values of matha index of points in the survey cell in each hour are calculated with the input from ais data then divided by t as interval of time all the points are assigned with an matha index per time to plot the habour traffic hazard map 7 m a t h a i n d e x p o i n t 1 t r i 2 2 σ 2 to assess marine traffic congestion in different time of the same water area or in different water area at the same time the ships in a certain scale are often selected as the standard ships for conversion a specific ship size is selected as the standard ship and ships of other sizes are converted by different conversion factor in this way the marine traffic congestion based on standard ship can indicate the danger level of the ship in the waterway more comprehensively and accurately the standard ship was defined as a ship with a total gross tonnage g t of 1 000 tons and l o a of 70 m which is close to the average coastal vessel of korea table 1 is the ship conversion coefficient factors when assess maritime traffic congestion the equation for calculating the marine traffic congestion is in fujii et al 1981 and park et al 2013 as follows 8 q 1 γ ς w v 9 q p 0 25 q 10 t c r q t q p where q is basic traffic volume of fairway ships h γ is occupied area s longest diameter km ς is occupied area s shortest diameter km w is width of fairway km v is ship speed km h t c r is traffic congestion rate q t is l 2 converted traffic volume per hour q p is practical traffic volume in this research considering the narrow channel in the port the congestion value was assessed by using the occupied area 6 l 1 6 l in the narrow channel and port based on the size of ship domain of fujii and tanaka 1971 fujii 1971 the effect of size of the ship s domain to the congestion was investigated the results showed that each area with different fairway width will have it owns setting for the size of the occupied area for example 3 5 l 1 5 l in japan 5 9 l 2 2 l in shanghai 4 l 5 b park and jeong 2014 in case of busan port current safety audit system has selected 6 l 1 6 l as the appropriate size of the occupied area in the busan port no 1 fairway ships are not allowed proceeding over the limit speed by regulation so that the difference of speed is not big the speed for calculation was set as average speed the width of the busan port no 1 fairway is about 340 m and an average of about 196 vessels are in and out of the port per day with an average of 10 vessels per hour the basic traffic capacity of busan north port is 133 86 ships per hour and practical traffic capacity is 33 46 vessels per hour because the marine traffic congestion is calculated for one waterway these values will be applied for whole route no 1 the red area in fig 4 included the survey cell using the ships lengths obtained from ais in both days ships sizes were assigned by conversion factors for each ship length if ship size data was not available the standard ship length was used l 2 factors of ships through busan no 1 route are calculated per hour in 2 days as shown in figs 5 and 6 the practical traffic capacity is represented by the red line as a result the l 2 converted traffic volume per hour of the no 1 fairway was significantly high in both days it shows that the large number of ships are going through no 1 fairway each hour in a day and it can indicate the degree of crowding and the risk of collision the greater the number of ship is the higher the collision risk would be then the traffic congestion rates of busan no 1 route for each hour are calculated by eq 11 as mentioned above each point will have its own value of matha index thus the matha indexes in survey cell will be shown as the range m i n m a x the comparison of matha index and t c r in the survey cell in both days is shown in figs 7 and 8 it can be observed that there is an obvious relationship between matha index and t c r of the area selected in each day the results point out that the trend of range of matha index values is following the tendency of t c r values with such busy traffic the marine hazard in this survey cell would certainly be higher which is the same as the indication of proposed dynamic matha index another should be mentioned here is that when the number of ships passing the survey cell from 6 to 23 on 8th was greater than those on 9th the range of matha index on 8th was around 2 4 5 and only 0 3 5 on 9th for the times of relatively large amount of ships indicated by tcr such as 6 to 23 on 8th the values of matha index are also relatively high compared with the low risk region such as 3 to 4 on 9th therefore it can be proved that the higher values of matha index are well matched with the reality of the traffic indicated by the traffic congestion rate for further illustrating and validating proposed matha index the average values of matha index in each hour are compared with tcr the mean minimum maximum values of matha index and pcr in two days are presented in table 2 pearson correlation coefficient can also be used for the validation of the proposed matha index pearson s correlation coefficient is the co variance of the two variables divided by the product of their standard deviations which is calculated as follows 11 r n a b a b n a 2 a 2 n b 2 b 2 applying pearson correlation coefficient formula for mean matha index and t c r value of 2 days we have r 08 0 9642 and r 09 0 9615 these coefficients indicated the large positive correlation of two indexes it is revealed by fig 9 that the relatively higher values of mean matha index is also in accordance with the high t c r of survey cell at the same time as well as the low values therefore it can be proved that the proposed dynamic matha index can reflect the overall marine traffic hazard in waterway effectively and reasonably 3 application of habour traffic hazard map due to the fact that the sea of korea is one of the most important shipping areas of the world connecting major economies such as china japan russia and south korea the rise in foreign trade in this region has led to an increase in port traffic the ship traffic volume through this area is extremely high because the area contains large ports such as the busan port which is among the world s top ten container ports song and lee 2006 it is appeared that marine accidents in korea were more frequent on the southern sea than on the eastern and western seas tribunal 2016 busan port ranked as one of the largest waterways in korea which has a relatively large amount of traffic the busy water area creates a favorable condition for the information of waterway risk assessment in section 2 3 only matha index in the survey cell of busan port no 1 route was calculated but this experiment considered whole busan port area for the purpose of mapping the habour traffic hazard map geographically the studied water area is positioned between latitudes 35 02 n 35 13 n and longitudes 128 98 e 129 17 e the source ais data in 8th and 9th june 2018 were utilized the ais message of surveyed area including the information on position speed course time and mmsi were extracted in csv format raw ais data do not contain ship characteristics such as type and size these characteristics can be found from a ship database since each ship has a unique mmsi number the ship characteristics were extracted from the ship database by means of the corresponding mmsi number ais information can be incorrect due to various technical shortcomings ais data are not continuous for each vessel and present unequal receiving intervals in addition there are several records with inaccurate speed information though the majority of collected ais records are accurate it is inappropriate to abandon these records in view of the real time data integrity hence the method of interpolation was applied each data point is checked for position heading speed and course the average speed can be calculated as the ratio of journey distance and traveling time therefore the location records and the acceleration deceleration abilities of vessels can be used to check whether the speed records are within the reasonable range or not the incorrect speed related will be replaced with the corresponding mean speed spatial distribution of ship positions at certain period in busan port is shown in fig 10 by observing this spatial distribution map of ship positions the water area with high ship density could be inferred with higher possibility of marine hazard the denser positions could reveal that this area is suffering the great amount of ships passing through and the chance for the complicated traffic situation is higher than other area moreover in this kind of busy waterway all of the encountering types can be formed it can be seen that there is a main traffic flows in busan port which is no 1 route most of the ships sail in through this route however from this kind of density map only the locations where ships gathered are observed but the level of danger or marine hazard of such locations cannot be achieved any points in the area cannot be presented by any index therefore there is a need to establish a new map for visualize the marine traffic hazard by exact value of each point the spatial distribution of the marine traffic hazard within busan port area which is a grid of 0 05 0 05 nm divided according to the latitude and longitude direction is determined using ais data the required maritime traffic data for eq 7 and the matha index value are updated for each point in whole area the final outcome of this experiment is habour traffic hazard map showing the spatial distribution of encounter probability the samples of resulting maps can be presented in 2d and 3d that is given in figs 11 12 13 14 habour traffic hazard map in each hour is established based on the values of matha index of all points to identify the hotspots to be specific after adopting the proposed framework the matha index value at each intersection of grid can be obtained this dynamic matha index is changing with the changes of data from all ships in the area the calculated hourly matha index values are mainly concentrated between 0 5 the contour lines of matha index help to enhance visualization of the areas with similar level of risk the set of contour lines are shown as heat map the redder the color is the greater the possibility of risk will be in survey period the value of matha index distributed over the area increases towards traffic intersection area along the waterway at the beginning of the waterway the matha index started to increase and mainly reached the maximum at the intersection area this is mainly due to the transit ships traveling in and out the waterway it can be found out that the matha index in area along route no 1 significantly higher than other areas suggesting that the risk in is relatively higher to some extent this is consistent with the high traffic density as indicated by the ship trajectory map to ensure safe navigation the ships in the waterway should maintain a safe distance between each other the most dangerous location around the area at 5 nm 5 nm on june 8th where the highest matha index is 4 5 it is observed that the water area with relatively low matha index lower than 1 distributes outside the no 1 route and in open waters the range of matha index around 1 5 2 5 appeared many times during survey period while the range 3 4 5 only happened at area with encounters of ships moving closer to each other the results of habour traffic hazard map can be shown in both 2d and 3d in comparison with 2d the visualization of 3d can show more detail about the area with low values of matha index which cannot be shown in 2d map by contour lines the higher the matha index is the more possibility of risk there is 4 discussion this paper proposes a novel framework to map the geographical distribution of marine traffic hazard based on the value of new developed index name marine traffic hazard index matha index assuming that one ship has its own influence to the vicinity and all area around it will be affect by it the overall impact at one point is sum of all influences of all ships to it based on this theory the matha index is constructed to reflect the level of risk at one point the higher value of matha index is the chance of risk happen at that point is higher then the value of matha index was utilized to establish the habour traffic hazard map this is the dynamic map which can continuously identify the changing geographical distribution of risk in the water area by inputting the real time dynamic information extracted from ais data such as position speed course dimension etc into the model the dynamic traffic hazard map of the water area can be plotted the summary of the proposed habour traffic hazard map s contribution when compared with past methods in mapping collision risk in the water area is given in table 3 in silveira et al 2013 van iperen 2015 zhang et al 2015 2016 and yoo 2018 the factor of ship s particular was not mentioned thus the ships which have different sizes and maneuverability have the same value this does not reflect reality in most cases especially risk assessment will become significantly less effective when the sizes of encountered ships have a large difference as opposed to a fairly accurate assessment when the difference between their sizes is much smaller these models did not take account of ship size which may affect the distance at which they pass each other therefore the difference in ship sizes cannot be ignored the basic idea of goerlandt et al 2011 weng and xue 2015 van iperen 2015 and wu et al 2016 is to scan the database for events where the ships domains are violated to determine conflict or near collisions in the above models ship domains in use are static invariable of ship speed regardless of the dynamic features one of the most important factors affecting the safety of a ship is the speed in fact the level of risk will be much greater for higher speed ships it is reasonable to be changed with different ship speed wang et al 2017 to model a dynamic map it is key point to form the shape which fully consider with ship s specific speed there is clearly distinctive difference between previous models and the proposed habour traffic hazard map which accounts for dynamic changes in speeds the level of risk of each zone dynamically changes throughout the navigational process according to the change of values of matha index similar with most of previous mapping models the data included matha index and map by habour traffic hazard map can be stored for analysis and research for one area marine traffic data of whole area by these methods except zhen et al 2017 is visualized from months to years such data would facilitate the exercise of precaution in passing through dangerous or high traffic areas opposing with previous frameworks not focus on real time monitoring by using habour traffic hazard map matha index which reflects dynamic degree navigation risk has advantage in instantaneous calculation with the value of matha index is instantaneously updated mariners as well as vts operators can control the situation in real time and have fast and reasonable actions for collision avoidance due to the high traffic in the waterway there is not much time for making decisions thus this function can better assist to assess the traffic situation and detect possible critical situations in the waterway the possibility of multi ships happening to be close to others is really high nevertheless the risk assessed by goerlandt et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 zhen et al 2017 and zhang et al 2019a is determined between a pair of ships this presents a possible weakness in using these techniques to evaluate maritime traffic safety the habour traffic hazard map recognizes the complexity of multi ship encounter matha index of one point in waters can be calculated by all ships involved in the encounters the area of high values of matha index can be predicted as area of collision accidents that are occurring during the approaching and departing maneuvers in silveira et al 2013 the collision risk map is constructed from the assessment of the number of collision candidates by estimating future distances between ships based on their previous positions courses and speeds and comparing those distances with a defined collision diameter goerlandt et al 2011 weng and xue 2015 wu et al 2016 aimed to evaluate the ship collision frequency in port waterways therefore the exact values of collision risk are not obtained it is easier to observe the difference in level of risk between different locations by habour traffic hazard map another question that remains is the size of the spatial resolution in the process of establish the heat map of risk different spatial resolution will be selected according to the purpose of research or the survey area if the area covered is too large the assessment in small zone in this would be inaccurate for example in the models of zhang et al 2016 2019a the collision risk is computed and ranked for 6 nm x 6 nm squares it means that each square will have same value in yoo 2018 a near miss density map for the safe navigation of ships in the sea off the south coast of korea did not represent in cell or sector however the result showed that the busan port had the similar value leading to the difficult in identification of the collision risks in port area in the experiment carried out in proposed study the dimension of survey area is around 9 nm x 6 nm and the distance between points is only 0 05 nm thus the amount of calculation will increase sharply and the result could be more detail for each part of area the proposed model succeeds in quickly evaluating the situation especially in high traffic water area through habour traffic hazard map ship navigator and maritime surveillance operator can study the spatial distribution of collision risk in the water area in real time or in a period of time they also can make a judge the level of danger of encounter situation and predict the area with high opportunity of the happening of collision accident by observing the value of matha index and keep other ships not to enter this area the short term anticipation of the high risk area can enhance their working efficiency help decision making and may reduce the risk of collision a potential application of proposed framework is to create a collision avoidance algorithm for mass it could be also used in maritime traffic monitoring and risk assessment prediction of near miss collisions in the short term with sufficient ship kinematics data which are usually obtained from ais data and anticipations of ship manoeuvres the habour traffic hazard map with the dynamic matha index can be inferred so that the mass takes early collision avoidance action in any situation accordingly it could secure more time for to take suitable collision prevention action if an autonomous vts center is formed it is considering a system that evaluates the risk of the entire port area and notifies individual ships of the risk so that the unmanned ship can be guided according to the risk in other words the vts center in the era of unmanned ships automatically evaluates the risk of the entire port and considers the system that can share this with each ship as utility however the proposed model still has some limitations only kinetics factors such as ship s speed course and ship s length are taken into consideration for modeling matha index and habour traffic hazard map other factors like climate weather condition human operations or regulations in the water area should be researched further to improve the accuracy of the framework in addition the spatial distribution of matha index shown on habour traffic hazard map may be not clear enough in larger area where the ships have no impacts each other and there is no overlapped area by the contour lines of matha index of these ships however it can be overcome by analyzing more data of various situations encounters to optimize the model parameters more encounter scenarios and additional ship movement data during before and after encounters and the possibility of ship manoeuvres are necessary 5 conclusion in this research a new waterway risk assessment model by provide a spatial distribution of risk was proposed which is based on the new developed new marine traffic hazard index matha index for modeling the function of matha index the influence function is utilized this index represents the influence of all ships in the neighborhood to it and reflect the level of risk by exact value in order to validate the effectiveness of matha index a comparison with traffic congestion rate was carried out the consistent of the tendency of the two indexes showed that the matha index can reflect the overall marine traffic hazard in waterway effectively by using the proposed marine traffic hazard index the dynamic traffic hazard map for the water area named habour traffic hazard map can be depicted observing the habour traffic hazard map applied for busan port area it reveals that the new map overcomes the limitations and shows improvements over other models it could show the dynamic level of risk since the present analysis is based on ais records which are continuously available for any time period it also shows the ability to predict the potential collision locations that will be able to occur during the approaching and departing maneuvers it succeeds in identification of high risk collision areas which allow reliable and accurate analysis to aid implementation of safety measures assist surveillance operators in order to assist them in their monitoring work it also can be reference for research of the mass in the future credit authorship contribution statement tu nam luong

20184,initial ship design necessitates the evaluation of main ship parameters to obtain a feasible design solution satisfying the objectives traditionally relationship between main dimensions and design parameters of proven designs provides a safe solution this approach restrains the designer from improving the design with respect to conflicting design criteria pareto frontier technique has widely been utilized in the design of ships mainly at advanced design stages for optimization problems as the principal dimensions of a ship are also vital on the performance of the vessel major improvements in performance may be achieved by selecting better principal dimensions this paper proposes to integrate the pareto technique to the design cycle at an early stage as a decision making process for selection of better main dimensions with respect to multiple conflicting criteria a pareto front has been observed for two case studies a destroyer and a planing craft indicating a technological barrier for performance with respect to main dimensions as the design process begins with main dimensions along the technological barrier performance is improved with respect to conflicting design criteria at the beginning of the design process which serves as a better basis for further optimization studies to be conducted at advanced stages keywords ship design main

traditionally ship design was based on the duplication of the features of successful ships that have already proven their better performance this was mainly true during the times of sailing ships gradually other concepts of design such as design cycle advanced as described in modern textbooks the design cycle in fact describes that the ship design is a nonlinear process and in general it is expected to converge to a reasonable solution so that the ship floats and will have sufficient stability power speed and structural integrity however the first phase of the design cycle is still initiated with obtaining the main dimensions and certain hull form parameters such as the block coefficient cb based on a regression analysis of successful proven designs with a rather traditional approach as explained above it is a challenge for the designer to improve the design with respect to multiple conflicting criteria at early stages of design a common case that designers may encounter is to try to improve seakeeping characteristics of the design whilst also aiming to lower the fuel consumed by the vessel this case is the norm for designers of naval ships fishing vessels special work boats etc the priority of the commercial ship designer is to increase the deadweight capacity of the ship and lower the fuel consumption a fast craft designer should ensure optimum weight distribution and simultaneously ensure safe operation at high speeds with reduced motion and acceleration levels without compromising for fuel efficiency with the tools and techniques readily available to the practicing ship designer a compromised solution or in other words a balanced solution may be achieved satisfying the design objectives for all the ship types mentioned before self sustaining ships that float and have sufficient stability are added to the fleet as proven designs these proven designs are then added to the databases of designers for prospective regression analysis for new designs it may even be claimed that a spiral is created lacking innovation and improvement the main aim of the proposed pareto based decision making approach is to enable the designer to achieve a much broader perspective on the influence of key initial design parameters such as ship main dimensions and underwater volume distribution on numerous conflicting design criteria as mentioned above at a very early stage in ship design with particular emphasis on improving the design with respect to both conflicting criteria this may be achieved with the assessment of multitudinous design alternatives from a few hundred to a couple thousand depending on the nature of the design there exist numerous applications of pareto technique to engineering problems in literature several examples may be found in the area of ship design kasprzak and lewis 2001 have studied vehicle dynamics utilizing a pareto approach a pareto optimal solution has been achieved by using collinearity theorem to estimate the weighting of relative objectives by fitting polynomials the whole mapping of the pareto set results into the relative objective weighting guarantees a huge quantity of data as well as an easily applicable approach to the problem gierson 2006 has published general guidelines for utilizing pareto approach for engineering problems with multiple design criteria the proposed pareto approach has been based on basic economics providing trade offs between design parameters and this paper explains the engineering application of pareto approach clearly a simple example has been shown on a structural plate design it is shown that multiple conflicting design criteria may be jointly improved in engineering problems with the utilization of pareto approach a holistic ship design process has been implemented by papanikolaou 2010 and in general utilization of pareto frontiers has been considered as the possible output of multi objective optimization studies wave wash and total resistance have been selected to form the pareto frontiers for a monohull vessel several pareto optimum designs have been obtained and selection of the desired one has been left to the designer also during systematic case studies on a sample ro ro passenger ship pareto diagrams have been widely used between the parameters structural weight lane length and attained subdivision index diez and peri 2010 have proposed a robust optimization approach for a bulk carrier at concept design phase considering operational profiles involving uncertainties and external effects arising due to the environment a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm has been utilized to provide solutions for the single objective optimization problem which is minimizing the cost of transportation per unit multi objective deterministic pso method modpso has been used to also minimize the standard deviation of transportation cost pareto principle has been used for cross checking purpose the numerical results show that the robust formulation for an optimized design enables reaching to the finalized solutions comprising of least rate for the cost and the lowest standard deviation from the mean rigo and caprace 2011 have published findings on an approach that decreases greenhouse gas ghg emissions via ship scantling optimization the design objective is lowering weight of steel while maintaining the cost of production at a tolerable level the pareto front has been mapped by using the repeated weighted sum solutions method and 3 pareto optimum designs are obtained as a result of weight optimization cost optimization and min max solution the weight optimized design has 12 72 saving on steel weight and 0 88 saving on production cost on the other hand the cost optimized design has 4 52 saving on production cost but the steel weight increases by 5 1 min max solution has 11 3 saving on steel weight and 1 58 saving on production cost a joint research effort within the nato rto task group has been conducted by diez et al 2015 joining cnr insean university of iowa roma tre university itu ntua and ecn the overall idea of the project is to compare various methodologies in terms of optimization and improving the resistance and the seakeeping characteristics of dtmb 5415 these methods provide hull variants and optimization of each variants hydrodynamic performance combining low and high fidelity solvers design modification tools and multi objective optimization algorithms insean iu itu and ntua have used low fidelity solvers ecn has verified the hull which is the optimum hull of insean iu study by using a high fidelity solver the results have provided significant optimization achievements with an average improvement for calm water resistance of 10 and seakeeping performance of 9 the high fidelity solver results indicate an overall 0 2 reduction for calm water resistance kim and paik 2017 studied on a multi objective design methodology for merchant cargo ships with a trade off between structural weight and structural safety by using pareto method instead of conventional comparative approach which is mostly in use nowadays mentioned procedure has been applied to a very large crude oil carrier vlcc the reference ship and new design has been compared and according to this study new procedure lightened the structural weight by 3 while improving the safety factors for crucial structural parts from 3 to 5 and also reduced required man hours by 20 during the design stage the proposed pareto frontier approach has been successfully applied to a fast containership design case by priftis et al 2018 the aim of 6500 teu container ship concept design optimization study has been stated as demonstrating that the modern ship design optimization techniques may enable the minimization of the capacity ratio the required freight rate eedi ship resistance and the maximization of stowage ratio within a holistic design approach the techniques utilized are sobol sequence for hull generation and a genetic algorithm with pareto front for optimization the improvement of the attained eedi is 3 29 and the rfr is 13 87 an example of pareto application for a structural design of ships has been demonstrated by na and karr 2016 the optimization techniques are based on the size of step the limit of convergence and a search conducted in a random fashion in this study pareto strategy has been verified by comparing the results obtained to the results of other optimization techniques as evolutionary strategy and random search by means of superiority and effectiveness the study has been performed on the design of the double bottom structure of a double hull tanker and the results show that pareto strategy is the best method in the viewpoint of accuracy and the success rate minimization of the required power and the optimum wake field of a chemical tanker hull form has been studied by veldhuis et al 2016 the calculation has been completed with a viscous flow solver a pareto front has been used in the optimization process to speed up the process design of experiment approach has been implemented hull forms have been generated by lackenby shifts and froude mode changes the results show that the generic basis hull shapes give a sufficient initial design exploration a multi objective optimization of the dtmb 5415 have been studied by wu and others by using an optimization tool named optship sjtu wu et al 2016 as a parametric hull modification free form deformation ffd has been used and new hull surfaces have been generated under geometric constraints both the resistance and seakeeping have been optimized and the neumann michell nm theory and an extension of bales seakeeping ranking method have been integrated for wave making drag and bales seakeeping rank factor r respectively pareto fronts have been produced with a multi objective genetic algorithm an optimization of a hull form for container ships have been studied by liu et al 2017 the optimization tool consists of three modules which are hull deformation hydrodynamic performance estimation and optimization the modification of hull forms globally and locally has been performed by using the free form deformation ffd and radial basis function rbf methods the neumann michell nm theory and an approximation model have been adapted to reduce the optimization cost the effect of each variable on other has been represented by the analysis of variance anova method the resistance coefficient has been minimized at three different speeds a pareto optimum solution has been verified by using the nm theory and rans based cfd solver esmailian 2017 have studied the ship propeller hull optimization with the design parameters lifetime fuel consumption lfc and a function based on the cost calculation including thrust torque and open water efficiency ngsa ii an evolutionary algorithm has been employed to optimize parameters that can find the pareto front and the results have concluded that the lfc and the cost have been minimized efficiently calisal 2017 has applied the pareto approach to fishing vessel design the approach was to account for resistance and motions in an algorithmic fashion and assess the effect of varying the ship main dimensions on the performance parameters within a simulation environment the study has proven that while aiming for a fuel efficient design performance measures may also be incorporated into the design process without compromising from fuel efficiency another multi objective optimization problem with the objective functions of minimization of oil outflow parameter maximizing the cargo capacity and minimizing longitudinal bending moment have been studied by jafaryeganeh et al 2019 the internal layout of a tanker ship has been optimized with considering positions of the watertight members as a design variable pareto frontier have been obtained with multi objective genetic algorithm and the optimal solution have been determined by using the utility function nowacki 2019 has emphasized the use of pareto approach in a multi objective design in which he contributed the literature with a book chapter he gives examples of pareto illustrations and scatters from the studies of papanikolaou 2010 2011 and mentions the benefits of pareto curves or surfaces throughout multi objective models section a packing approach developed by van oers 2011 improves the early stage ship design by exploring and generating a 3d design sets with conflicting requirements the packing approach is briefly based on the description of a novel parametric ship to handle the 3d design changes search algorithm to generate a set of ship design developing most promising feasible designs considering conflicting criteria and the selection process having reviewed the literature on the utilization of pareto method on ship design with particular emphasis on the design of the hull shape and its influence on performance it is evident that majority of the research effort has been concentrated on obtaining the optimized final hull shape with respect to certain single or multiple optimization criteria pawling et al 2017 have investigated the relationship between the ship size and the cost using the design building block approach and spotted non linear relationships between these parameters another example of a novel approach in determining main dimensions is proposed by jianping 2017 where fuzzy logic has been used to obtain main dimensions for enhanced economic performance previous effort of calisal 2017 is seen as another novel example of using pareto approach as it has been implemented at the very early stages of ship design aiming at achieving better main dimensions and form parameters when compared to standard regression approach the proposal of calisal 2017 for the selection of better dimensions should be regarded as a decision making process for selecting ship main dimensions that uses pareto frontier solutions rather than a multi criteria optimization problem with objective functions and constraints the present research campaign aims to extend the application of the pareto based decision making process for selection of better main dimensions to a broader range of ships with different operating profiles an initial design procedure for this decision making process enabling the evaluation of a substantially enlarged design space is proposed and applied to the improvement of performance of a destroyer design and a planing craft the objective of the study is to aim for identifying a pareto frontier which indicates a technological barrier for performance with respect to the conflicting performance criteria identifying the technological barrier and narrowing the design space toward a smaller zone around the technological barrier at early stages of design would serve as a better initial condition to local and global optimization studies which would be conducted at advanced stages of design in both cases a better design with improved main dimensions and hull parameters is sought that would have enhanced the seakeeping performance whilst also lowering the fuel consumption 2 workflow of proposed design approach the process is initiated by the definition of the design space according to the design constraints when selecting the range of the main dimensions for exploration and subsequently the combinations of these dimensions to generate design alternatives a quasi random approach may come in as handy since the designer has a certain level of control over the design space and at the same time the generation process of design alternatives exhibits a fair degree of randomness the design space is usually constrained either for the usage of the machine or technical reasons in ship application a constraint may be the depth of the water she must sail on or the dimensions of the harbour berths a good example could the beam of the ship to use the panama canal these dimensions will reduce the design space in smaller zones where the acceptable design parameters must reside in this research campaign the proposed approach is applied to existing designs therefore constraints have been defined for the main dimensions and the form parameters as percentages of the initial dimensions of the ships in consideration this would yield alternative combinations of parameters in a pre determined interval based on the initial design and random algorithms pre defined algorithm in matlab and sobol sequence have been used for the definition of the design space for application to new designs the process may be initiated from principal dimensions obtained from traditional regression analysis sobol sequence is a type of quasi random low discrepancy sequence the details of its algorithm are well defined by bretley and fox bretley and fox 1988 when the sobol algorithm is applied on creating a design space the created design space is uniform and randomly generated the sequence generates the numbers as binary fraction from a set in comparison to the random distribution this method is avoiding the production of clusters or voids this smart space samples and uniform distribution makes the sequence more efficient for the optimization process turan et al 2016 the sobol sequence also avoids the generation of grid lines this provides a stable basis for following steps such as an optimization fassardi and hochkirch 2006 following the design space definition the performance criteria that will be driving the decision making process needs to be defined a ship like any other machine must have performance criteria for ships such criteria are determined by the owner and the regulatory agencies these parameters may be the payload speed for the owner fuel consumption and pollution or wake quality for a naval ship survivability speed power demand reduced motions and signature may be demanded with equal importance a planing craft would need to consume little fuel while motions would need to be restricted it is evident that the performance criteria set by the owner operator regulatory body or end user are conflicting with one other improvement of the performance with respect to one parameter would normally yield degradation according to the other such as high payload vs low fuel consumption or low power vs lowered motions in this study multiple design performance criteria that are naturally conflicting with each other are aimed for improvement for both considered cases simultaneously as soon as the design space and performance parameters are defined the candidate designs will need to be analysed with respect to the performance criteria by suitable methods and tools experimental analytical or numerical tools provide now to the designers excellent ways to make such analyses the choice for utilization of specific tools for the studies depends on the ship type and the phase of the design as well as time and budget constraints at initial phases of design algorithmic methods and tools with lower fidelity that provide quicker turnaround time when compared to high fidelity alternatives may be utilized enabling exploration of a substantially enlarged design space there is a trade off between accuracy and exploration of enlarged design spaces during this selection and if necessary hybrid approaches may be adopted where the performance of the initial and final and maybe a few intermediate candidates may also be assessed by the higher fidelity methods for further verification in this study two different approaches such as algorithmic methods and low fidelity solvers have been utilized for two case studies pareto procedure requires some statistical data or possible simulations and algorithms as pointed above there may be multiple design alternatives competing in the design the designer must have a decision procedure to recommend the better hull the pareto frontier seems to define a technical barrier which identifies a performance boundary for that design the pareto design procedure used in this study is a combination of the pareto design procedures described by gierson 2006 and kasprzak and lewis 2001 the challenge for pareto approach is the minimization of the variables in a conflicting criteria space called as x the conflicting criteria can be denoted by f i and j a vector solution x may be stated to dominate another solution x if das and dennis 1998 1 f i x f i x for all i є 1 2 n 2 f j x f j x for some j є 1 2 n the discretization of the design space gives the efficient pareto frontier a polynomial description of the frontier can be obtained from this pareto curve the determination of the optimum depends on the selection of the utopia point utopia point is the point that satisfies both criteria ideally and simultaneously there are some other methods to choose the optimum point from pareto set as well as this procedure is considered to be a decision based design theory to choose the best matched point with the criteria is seen as the most efficient method the smallest distance from the utopia point to the candidate design could also be sought in the search of the better design çalışal 2017 utopia point could be an unreachable limit in the design but could be considered as an ideal performance or dimension for the design in the current studies no fuel consumption and no acceleration were usually taken as the utopia point however any point away from the pareto frontier may be selected in principle as a perfect target design point the search for the best candidate is not a well defined process even if there is a pareto front in general equal weight could be given for the performances used for the selection criteria however one may possibly argue that one performance criteria could have a relatively higher weight the procedure used allows for such a weight assignment in the current studies equal weights are assumed for the considered criteria 3 case studies with the proposed design approach 3 1 uscg 5628 based planing vessel in this part of the work a design procedure as described in chapter 2 is implemented on the design study of a planing craft case the conceptual design of a planing craft owing to the nature of its design is more suitable to algorithmic analyses when compared to other types of marine craft such as naval ships and commercial ships the ease of defining a planing craft s shape and linking its performance to its main dimensions deadrise angle and lcg makes it easier to utilize the pareto based design procedure that could enable the investigation of considerably higher number of candidate designs in a design office environment initially a review on procedures and algorithms for planing craft performance prediction is presented followed by the validation study for this procedure the amount of energy required to maintain a planing or semi planing speed or the effective power demand should be quantified for this purpose the procedure described in faltinsen 2005 has been used faltinsen assumes four steps for the calculation of the horizontal component of the total resistance therefore of the ehp faltinsen 2005 first the average wetted length λ w is calculated solving the nonlinear equation below 3 l c g λ w b 0 75 1 5 21 f n 2 λ w 2 2 39 0 in the second step the trim angle is calculated trim angle τ is obtained using the two equations below 4 0 067 c l 0 0 0065 β c l 0 0 6 0 5 c l 0 τ 0 012 λ w 2 5 0 0055 λ w 2 5 f n β 2 f l 0 0 5 ρ v 2 b 2 in the third step chine wetted length l c and keel wetted length l k are calculated 6 λ w 0 5 l k l c b 0 5 x s 2 l c b where 7 x s l k l c effective horse power is then calculated by using speed viscous drag and pressure drag wetted area is seen in two parts 8 s 1 tan 2 β sin β b 2 4 1 z m a x v t τ 9 s 2 b cos β l c horizontal component of the viscous resistance is calculated using the sum of above values for wetted surface and the ittc 57 formula pressure resistance rp is calculated from 10 r p f l β τ a matlab based code developed for this purpose was validated using the data provided in the above reference and other published algorithms by taunton 2010 and the university of naples planing hull series nss by luca de f 2017 for the range of accuracy and trend in the calculations reasonable estimates of the effective power dynamic trim and dynamic waterline length are obtained for a preliminary design stage even though the design algorithm by faltinsen does not include advanced features of these series such as steps or variable deadrise angle figs 1 and 2 below show example comparisons of the predicted effective power and the dynamic trim angle τ by the algorithms provided for the hull c3 of the naples systematic series and the faltinsen s procedure the seakeeping analysis of planing hulls is rather complicated as the dynamic lift characteristics are changing due to ship motions rather advanced tests are reported by bagovic 2014 on the head sea motion of planing crafts such as that of the napoli series nss the algorithmic development for this series is understood to be continuing taunton et al 2011 provide an algorithm for the acceleration levels of their own series they show a nonlinear dependence of acceleration on the significant waves for simplicity a simple acceleration algorithm provided by savitsky 2003 is used for the early development of this design procedure for the testing of the overall procedure outlined above a case study is defined based on the us coast guard motor life boat mlb 5628 series as given in table 1 for the design alternatives the beam interval was set to be between 4 to 8 m dead rise angle between 10 and 20 and the speed range was restricted between 26 and 30 knots for input to the design program in this case the speed of the vessel has been considered as a design variable as ship resistance and acceleration in waves are functions of the encounter frequency therefore are functions of the speed it should be noted that as the design procedure is flexible one can narrow the speed to a much smaller interval or keep it as a constant the interval for speed was linear and the interval for beam and dead rise angle were randomized a total of 1000 hulls were generated randomly within the design space by matlab within the developed approach the design mass and the location of the initial the center of gravity of the hull and the length of the hull in still water are required as inputs the algorithmic resistance and acceleration level of the hull at the centroid of mass are then calculated the hull dimensions and speed range foreseen by the algorithms are then checked against the speed to length ratio for semi planing and planing hulls in this study speed to beam ratio v b is set for the interval of 1 6 4 when this length ratio is not satisfied that specific design is not included in the design population and in the final selection or suitability as a better hull another issue for suitability of the planing hull is a dynamic property of the hull identified as porpoising the prediction of porpoising was studied by day j p haag r j 1952 celano 1998 and a critical trim angle algorithm is provided in this study against the speed coefficient v gb the relationship includes the dead rise angle and the lift coefficient of the hull the critical trim angle at the design speed coefficient is then compared with the trim of the designed hull at the same speed coefficient the porpoising and nonlinear sea keeping of planing hulls make the additional calculations seemingly not reliable at this stage of the design and more work is possibly justifiable in this area the experience gained from this study suggests that major hull parameters for a better planing hull could be identified with the help of existing algorithms and a design logic based on the pareto front concept the likelihood of porpoising could also be included in the selection of the main parameters with the identification of a critical trim angle the work done confirms that additional research needs to be done for the better understanding of planing hull performance in regular and irregular waves as depicted in chapter 2 the process is initiated with the definition of a relatively large number of principal dimensions of boats in a random fashion the design criteria have been set as minimum effective power requirement minimum acceleration level at the center of gravity at this step an additional porpoising check is necessarily added to the sequence to be able to observe the existence of the pareto front analyses have been conducted for the effective power and the acceleration levels as explained previously all algorithms have been coded in matlab the resistance and trim simulation for a planing hull start with an assigned location of the center of gravity and the mass of the load and follows the step by step procedure outlined by faltinsen 2005 the total resistance is converted into a more practical easily conceivable effective horsepower value this study the fuel consumption is assumed to be proportional to effective power demanded by the ship the calculated effective power is then used as one of the performance parameters in the definition and search of pareto front the algorithm used in this study for the simulation of the acceleration at the center of gravity is from savitsky 2003 the average acceleration at the center of gravity is formulated as 11 n c g 0 0104 h 1 3 b 0 084 τ 4 5 3 β 30 v k l 2 l b c δ from more general algorithms such as a response spectrum one can of course calculate additional statistical values for an assigned sea state one can possibly use the assumptions in jensen 2004 to calculate the combined motion at the bow of the ship and the relative bow motion with respect to the wave elevation the main assumption in jensen 2004 is that the interactions between different modes of motions can be neglected and or ignored in this study the sea state is taken as sea state 3 one thousand combinations of beam values hull speeds and dead rise angles are used to obtain a design population for this planing hull study after the completion of the calculations the existence of a specific pareto front is sought this front is seen as technological barrier in the design in this case 1000 design points are plotted as in fig 3 as the units of the design parameter such as acceleration and effective power are not the same these design parameters as in fig 3 are non dimensionalized that is each value of the elements of a set is divided by the maximum value of the elements of that set in this case the maximum value of a variable such as ehp is non dimensionalized by the maximum value obtained for ehp in the search this provides a non dimensional decision space of one unit in each direction however some weights may be given by the designer as to provide the order of magnitude of importance seen by the designer or included in the owner s requirements if necessary in this study it was observed that such a front indeed exists for planing hulls the displacement type ships moving at relatively slow speeds are eliminated from the population of ships fig 3 suggests that the set of minimized acceleration levels at a constant effective power can be seen as a pareto front the utopic point in this study is taken as the origin of the design space the zero acceleration and the zero effective power point is defined as the utopic point in this study the design with minimum distance from the utopic point to the candidate design is defined as the better ship the suitable number of designs on the pareto front are then located by a numerical search method fig 3 shows the performance space and the better design is shown with a quadrilateral marker all the computer based study and the programming are done in matlab and it takes about 20 s to run the program including the graphical work table 2 below shows some of the design parameters calculated for the better point and 4 other points near the better point the frontier also depicts a clear technological barrier for the given design constraints it is seen that existing designs may be improved up to the technological barrier with the proposed procedure the applied procedure suggests that the importance of the two performance criteria studied by the method is of equal importance however as recommended by kasprzak et al 2001 if one criterion is more important than the other one by a factor n the coordinate of the candidate designs could be increased in that direction by the same factor reflecting the increased importance of that criteria or that objective table 2 suggests that increased deadrise angle and slightly decreased beam provides a better compromise solution when both effective power demand and accelerations are aimed for improvement best design best1 has 6 less effective power requirement as well as 6 less acceleration at lcg the critical degree to avoid porpoising suggested by day et al 1952 as 12 τ c r i t 0 1197 β 0 7651 exp 15 7132 c l 2 β 0 2629 where 13 c l δ 0 5 ρ v 2 b 2 savitsky 1993 provides a figure for the critical angle a curve fit to those curves expressed as 14 τ c r i t 16 47 c a 2 14 97 c a 2 38 0 010 β 1 where 15 c a c l 2 celano 1998 has extended day et al s studies with larger models and higher deadrise angles as seen in recent designs analysing the extensive test data followed by a regression study resulted with the below formulation for critical trim angle 16 τ c r i t 0 1197 β 0 7651 e x p 15 7132 c l 2 β 0 2629 celano s algorithm was utilized in this study to identify if the design is in or near a critical area fig 4 shows that the designs and specifically the better hull has a trim less than the critical trim given by the algorithms in the figure trim angles are plotted against cv which is obtained with the below formulation 17 c v v g b 3 2 dtmb 5415 based destroyer this case study considers the dtmb 5415 hull which is a ship model tested at david taylor model basin based on an early ddg 51 arleigh burke class destroyer as the initial hull form for seeking better main dimensions and form parameters as this hull has been considered as an initial conceptual design that has been dimensionalized for some pre determined set of performance criteria it is evident that setting a new pair of design criteria that may be said to be conflicting with each other would possibly yield a different trade off solution than that of the initial hull in this study a new set of improved main dimensions and form parameters based on the dtmb 5415 hull are sought with respect to the following criteria minimization of effective power demand minimization of the pitch acceleration at the bridge in contrast to the planing craft case presented in section 3 1 above this case study required the use of dedicated solvers for resistance and seakeeping calculations the handling of all the creation of the geometry the meshing the performance calculations and the post processing of the data for an enlarged design space required the use of dedicated software for linking all the components that are utilized in the process in this study opti slang has been used as the control platform of the procedure opti slang is an optimization platform that has principally been established for reliability analysis and is competent to be used for optimization problems and robustness evaluation it allows the link of different solvers and the construing of the input and the output parameters bucher et al 2001 it has previously been used for the optimization problems of the variable speed turbine designs tengs et al 2018 and the derivation of the mechanical properties of bonded joints bernardin et al 2013 a sobol sequence as defined by bretley and fox 1988 has been implemented on matlab for obtaining the design space 30 parent ships with varying length and beams have been developed with the above mentioned sequence the variation of length and beam has been restricted to 10 compared to the initial hull even though 10 variation may be considered to be a large range when seeking improved design alternatives keeping the variation range reasonably large enables the designer to detect outside the box better designs if any that would normally not be considered unless randomness is involved in the process the developed ships all have the same payload capacity the lightship weight has been assumed to be varying with the product of the main dimensions length beam and depth and the payload of the parent ship has been added to the lightship of each candidate ship to obtain its displacement and draft a total number of 270 ships define the design space that are variants of 30 parent ships the length beam variation of the parent ships obtained with the sobol algorithm are given in fig 5 all ships are generated from the parent ships with variations given below lcb 50 51 52 c p 0 59 0 607 0 624 the main dimensions and the lcb values created by the sobol algorithm are used to modify the initial dtmb 5415 hull in maxsurf modeller main dimensions are modified by scaling and parametric transformation has been used to vary lcb position this process is carried out in batch mode following the generation of candidate hulls they have been exported in iges format and fed into the meshing software gid software has been used for meshing a structured meshing strategy has been adopted a sample mesh is depicted in fig 6 the effective power demand of the ships has been estimated with a potential flow solver nushallo at 18 knots of speed nushallo is a non linear free surface potential flow solver that incorporates the methodology presented by jensen et al 1986 in terms of capturing the free surface the ship hull is discretized by triangular and rectangular cells the mesh of the hull is blended to the obtained free surface at every iteration loop leading to an improved numerical accuracy the trim and the sinkage of the hull are also accounted for during the calculations marzi 2003 the validation study for nushallo has been based on an extrapolation from the resistance test results of the dtmb 5415 olivieri et al 2001 which is the initial hull utilized in this study fig 7 shows the effective power results obtained from nushallo in comparison to the experiment based data a good agreement is observed for the desired speed range as the aim of this study is to explore an enlarged design space at an early design stage with reasonable effort and sufficient accuracy it is anticipated that utilization of a potential solver is a sensible approach the acceleration values at the bridge location have been obtained from maxsurf motions that utilizes a strip theory based solver for the calculation of the motions and the accelerations seakeeping calculation conditions and crucial modelling parameters are given in table 3 the utilized seakeeping software for the optimization process needs to have sufficient capability for capturing the differences in responses of the alternative hulls in the heave the pitch motions and in the more comprehensive evaluations in the added resistance due to wave action for the currently utilized seakeeping software three validation cases are presented in the user manual formation design systems 2011 namely for npl round bilge series series 60 and a fast freight vessel of sa van der stel the limitations and assumptions of the utilized strip theory approach is presented as well additionally a validation study has been conducted with the utilized software for the vessel in consideration for this purpose experimental data for the subject vessel has been utilized from olivieriet al 2001 cited in cakici et al 2017 the considered case is at a speed corresponding to fr 0 41 and the heave and the pitch responses at the center of gravity are obtained for the head seas condition results obtained from the computations in maxsurf are presented along with the experimental data in fig 8 it is seen that there is good agreement between the predictions and the experimental data for the speed and the heading combination the method is capable of predicting the trend in the variation of the rao s across the wave frequency range results of the potential flow and the seakeeping analysis indicate the formation of a pareto front for this case as well the acceleration and the effective power values are non dimensionalized by dividing with maximum value fig 9 shows the obtained pareto front the dimensions the effective power and the acceleration values of the initial and the better hull are given in table 4 in this case a larger and a slightly narrower hull has shown better performance when the multiple criteria are considered for the decision of the main dimensions a reduction of 1 in effective power has been obtained while also improving the pitch induced acceleration by 9 the chosen main dimensions of the destroyer influence both the seakeeping performance and the effective power demand however the effect of choosing of the different main dimensions is more pronounced on the seakeeping responses when compared to the power demand local refinement of the hull shape could lead to further reductions in resistance as the derived hull forms may still be keeping certain features of the initial hull which have not been adjusted to the variants diez et al 2015 therefore there is further potential of improvement by single or multi criteria optimization studies which may be conducted at the progressive stages of design where the hull form could be varied locally with a suitable algorithm at this stage it can be concluded that the proposed approach for the selection of the main dimensions is not a replacement for single or multi criteria optimization studies but a supplementary approach that may be adopted at the very early stage of the design when the improvements obtained by this study are compared with the optimization studies cited in chapter 1 diez et al 2015 and wu et al 2016 it is seen that the improvement in the seakeeping performance achieved by selecting better dimensions is comparable to that of the optimization studies the seakeeping improvements varied between 3 and 13 5 in the studies the reduction in the resistance is significantly higher for the optimization studies as the local hull form is more influential on the resistance characteristics current modification of the main dimensions and the underwater volume distribution has a certain effect on the resistance as well a significant improvement in seakeeping performance has been achieved while also reducing effective power demand by 1 by altering the main dimensions lcb and cp 4 conclusions a pareto based decision making approach for the selection of the ship main dimensions has been proposed the aim of this approach is to enable the designers to explore their design space in such a way that they may see the influence of ship main parameters on multiple performance criteria enabling them to optimize or improve the design and most importantly give the designers the opportunity of thinking outside of the box by utilizing the proposed methodology the designer would have the chance to push the design towards the technological barrier instead of relying on a particular design solution balancing the design objectives traditional design approach usually dictates the minimization of the power demand this study was aimed to see if a better hull could be designed by including more design objectives and still save some fuel it is seen that the initial designs in both case studies could be improved up to the technological barrier the efficacy of the proposed process required to enhance the initial design up to the technological barrier is notable and useful results may be obtained in a cost effective fashion if the utilized tools are sufficiently quick and have satisfactory fidelity it is evident from the results presented above that the ship main dimensions the distribution of weight and the distribution of underwater volume have notable effect on the performance of the vessel in terms of the fuel consumption and the ship motions in the seaway the additional effort that would be put in the early design process to evaluate an enlarged design space with different main dimensions and form parameters is found to be worthwhile for the tested cases this approach should be regarded as a supplementary effort at the very initial phase of the design and it should be noted that it is not an alternative to local or global optimization studies that would be conducted at the progressive stages involving single or multiple criteria combining the two by selecting better main dimension by the proposed method and performing the necessary optimization studies thereafter could enable the actual potential of the design to be unveiled two case studies have been presented using the proposed approach that are based on dtmb 5415 and a planing craft a pareto frontier has been observed for all the cases considered this finding is beneficial for the proof of the universality of the proposed pareto approach however it should be noted that further diversified evaluation of the proposed approach for different ship types would be beneficial for generalizing its universality the proposed method is shown to find rather efficiently a technological barrier for the performance criteria such as the fuel efficiency and the acceleration levels of designs in both presented cases the technological barrier could easily be achieved with the proposed approach of course the results are limited with today s knowledge on the type of a ship in terms of the independent variables the designer has control of such as the main dimensions with this knowledge of the technological barrier which is limited by the information side of the design process a design decision is still needed this selection decision needs a design criterion which is the selection of the utopic point for different usage of the hull as for a passenger ship or for a naval ship different utopic points or maximum levels could be considered as an owner requirement the existence of the technological barrier also suggests that new technologies are needed to further improve this barrier by changes such as the ventilated hulls stepped hulls for planing craft and by bulbs or parabolized waterlines for displacement type ships the proposed approach may be used for selecting the main dimensions in a more refined fashion compared to traditional approaches the introduced randomness enables the assessment of combinations that may generally be considered outside of the regular design alternatives that would otherwise not be considered in the current study the process was based on improving the main dimensions for two basic performance requirements namely the effective power at one speed and the seakeeping performance which was assumed to be represented by the acceleration in head seas evidently there are many more important performance aspects that may be driving the process of the selection of main dimensions and certain initial hull parameters the selection of the performance parameters that are said to be driving the process is dependent on the operation profile the performance requirements the type of vessel and the relevant ranking of the importance defined by either the designer or the owner or the operator of the vessel therefore the designer using this procedure could easily and freely choose other hull parameters for progressing with and obtaining better main dimensions although the procedure shows a potential as a prospective approach for use in a design office environment further improvements are beneficial currently the importance of each design parameter has been assumed as equal the design criteria or the importance of weights of design performance measures could be changed by the owner or the designers other measures or combination of measures could be added into the design study the procedure developed for two performance objectives could be extended into multiple performance objectives in a systematic

20184,initial ship design necessitates the evaluation of main ship parameters to obtain a feasible design solution satisfying the objectives traditionally relationship between main dimensions and design parameters of proven designs provides a safe solution this approach restrains the designer from improving the design with respect to conflicting design criteria pareto frontier technique has widely been utilized in the design of ships mainly at advanced design stages for optimization problems as the principal dimensions of a ship are also vital on the performance of the vessel major improvements in performance may be achieved by selecting better principal dimensions this paper proposes to integrate the pareto technique to the design cycle at an early stage as a decision making process for selection of better main dimensions with respect to multiple conflicting criteria a pareto front has been observed for two case studies a destroyer and a planing craft indicating a technological barrier for performance with respect to main dimensions as the design process begins with main dimensions along the technological barrier performance is improved with respect to conflicting design criteria at the beginning of the design process which serves as a better basis for further optimization studies to be conducted at advanced stages keywords ship design main

traditionally ship design was based on the duplication of the features of successful ships that have already proven their better performance this was mainly true during the times of sailing ships gradually other concepts of design such as design cycle advanced as described in modern textbooks the design cycle in fact describes that the ship design is a nonlinear process and in general it is expected to converge to a reasonable solution so that the ship floats and will have sufficient stability power speed and structural integrity however the first phase of the design cycle is still initiated with obtaining the main dimensions and certain hull form parameters such as the block coefficient cb based on a regression analysis of successful proven designs with a rather traditional approach as explained above it is a challenge for the designer to improve the design with respect to multiple conflicting criteria at early stages of design a common case that designers may encounter is to try to improve seakeeping characteristics of the design whilst also aiming to lower the fuel consumed by the vessel this case is the norm for designers of naval ships fishing vessels special work boats etc the priority of the commercial ship designer is to increase the deadweight capacity of the ship and lower the fuel consumption a fast craft designer should ensure optimum weight distribution and simultaneously ensure safe operation at high speeds with reduced motion and acceleration levels without compromising for fuel efficiency with the tools and techniques readily available to the practicing ship designer a compromised solution or in other words a balanced solution may be achieved satisfying the design objectives for all the ship types mentioned before self sustaining ships that float and have sufficient stability are added to the fleet as proven designs these proven designs are then added to the databases of designers for prospective regression analysis for new designs it may even be claimed that a spiral is created lacking innovation and improvement the main aim of the proposed pareto based decision making approach is to enable the designer to achieve a much broader perspective on the influence of key initial design parameters such as ship main dimensions and underwater volume distribution on numerous conflicting design criteria as mentioned above at a very early stage in ship design with particular emphasis on improving the design with respect to both conflicting criteria this may be achieved with the assessment of multitudinous design alternatives from a few hundred to a couple thousand depending on the nature of the design there exist numerous applications of pareto technique to engineering problems in literature several examples may be found in the area of ship design kasprzak and lewis 2001 have studied vehicle dynamics utilizing a pareto approach a pareto optimal solution has been achieved by using collinearity theorem to estimate the weighting of relative objectives by fitting polynomials the whole mapping of the pareto set results into the relative objective weighting guarantees a huge quantity of data as well as an easily applicable approach to the problem gierson 2006 has published general guidelines for utilizing pareto approach for engineering problems with multiple design criteria the proposed pareto approach has been based on basic economics providing trade offs between design parameters and this paper explains the engineering application of pareto approach clearly a simple example has been shown on a structural plate design it is shown that multiple conflicting design criteria may be jointly improved in engineering problems with the utilization of pareto approach a holistic ship design process has been implemented by papanikolaou 2010 and in general utilization of pareto frontiers has been considered as the possible output of multi objective optimization studies wave wash and total resistance have been selected to form the pareto frontiers for a monohull vessel several pareto optimum designs have been obtained and selection of the desired one has been left to the designer also during systematic case studies on a sample ro ro passenger ship pareto diagrams have been widely used between the parameters structural weight lane length and attained subdivision index diez and peri 2010 have proposed a robust optimization approach for a bulk carrier at concept design phase considering operational profiles involving uncertainties and external effects arising due to the environment a particle swarm optimization pso algorithm has been utilized to provide solutions for the single objective optimization problem which is minimizing the cost of transportation per unit multi objective deterministic pso method modpso has been used to also minimize the standard deviation of transportation cost pareto principle has been used for cross checking purpose the numerical results show that the robust formulation for an optimized design enables reaching to the finalized solutions comprising of least rate for the cost and the lowest standard deviation from the mean rigo and caprace 2011 have published findings on an approach that decreases greenhouse gas ghg emissions via ship scantling optimization the design objective is lowering weight of steel while maintaining the cost of production at a tolerable level the pareto front has been mapped by using the repeated weighted sum solutions method and 3 pareto optimum designs are obtained as a result of weight optimization cost optimization and min max solution the weight optimized design has 12 72 saving on steel weight and 0 88 saving on production cost on the other hand the cost optimized design has 4 52 saving on production cost but the steel weight increases by 5 1 min max solution has 11 3 saving on steel weight and 1 58 saving on production cost a joint research effort within the nato rto task group has been conducted by diez et al 2015 joining cnr insean university of iowa roma tre university itu ntua and ecn the overall idea of the project is to compare various methodologies in terms of optimization and improving the resistance and the seakeeping characteristics of dtmb 5415 these methods provide hull variants and optimization of each variants hydrodynamic performance combining low and high fidelity solvers design modification tools and multi objective optimization algorithms insean iu itu and ntua have used low fidelity solvers ecn has verified the hull which is the optimum hull of insean iu study by using a high fidelity solver the results have provided significant optimization achievements with an average improvement for calm water resistance of 10 and seakeeping performance of 9 the high fidelity solver results indicate an overall 0 2 reduction for calm water resistance kim and paik 2017 studied on a multi objective design methodology for merchant cargo ships with a trade off between structural weight and structural safety by using pareto method instead of conventional comparative approach which is mostly in use nowadays mentioned procedure has been applied to a very large crude oil carrier vlcc the reference ship and new design has been compared and according to this study new procedure lightened the structural weight by 3 while improving the safety factors for crucial structural parts from 3 to 5 and also reduced required man hours by 20 during the design stage the proposed pareto frontier approach has been successfully applied to a fast containership design case by priftis et al 2018 the aim of 6500 teu container ship concept design optimization study has been stated as demonstrating that the modern ship design optimization techniques may enable the minimization of the capacity ratio the required freight rate eedi ship resistance and the maximization of stowage ratio within a holistic design approach the techniques utilized are sobol sequence for hull generation and a genetic algorithm with pareto front for optimization the improvement of the attained eedi is 3 29 and the rfr is 13 87 an example of pareto application for a structural design of ships has been demonstrated by na and karr 2016 the optimization techniques are based on the size of step the limit of convergence and a search conducted in a random fashion in this study pareto strategy has been verified by comparing the results obtained to the results of other optimization techniques as evolutionary strategy and random search by means of superiority and effectiveness the study has been performed on the design of the double bottom structure of a double hull tanker and the results show that pareto strategy is the best method in the viewpoint of accuracy and the success rate minimization of the required power and the optimum wake field of a chemical tanker hull form has been studied by veldhuis et al 2016 the calculation has been completed with a viscous flow solver a pareto front has been used in the optimization process to speed up the process design of experiment approach has been implemented hull forms have been generated by lackenby shifts and froude mode changes the results show that the generic basis hull shapes give a sufficient initial design exploration a multi objective optimization of the dtmb 5415 have been studied by wu and others by using an optimization tool named optship sjtu wu et al 2016 as a parametric hull modification free form deformation ffd has been used and new hull surfaces have been generated under geometric constraints both the resistance and seakeeping have been optimized and the neumann michell nm theory and an extension of bales seakeeping ranking method have been integrated for wave making drag and bales seakeeping rank factor r respectively pareto fronts have been produced with a multi objective genetic algorithm an optimization of a hull form for container ships have been studied by liu et al 2017 the optimization tool consists of three modules which are hull deformation hydrodynamic performance estimation and optimization the modification of hull forms globally and locally has been performed by using the free form deformation ffd and radial basis function rbf methods the neumann michell nm theory and an approximation model have been adapted to reduce the optimization cost the effect of each variable on other has been represented by the analysis of variance anova method the resistance coefficient has been minimized at three different speeds a pareto optimum solution has been verified by using the nm theory and rans based cfd solver esmailian 2017 have studied the ship propeller hull optimization with the design parameters lifetime fuel consumption lfc and a function based on the cost calculation including thrust torque and open water efficiency ngsa ii an evolutionary algorithm has been employed to optimize parameters that can find the pareto front and the results have concluded that the lfc and the cost have been minimized efficiently calisal 2017 has applied the pareto approach to fishing vessel design the approach was to account for resistance and motions in an algorithmic fashion and assess the effect of varying the ship main dimensions on the performance parameters within a simulation environment the study has proven that while aiming for a fuel efficient design performance measures may also be incorporated into the design process without compromising from fuel efficiency another multi objective optimization problem with the objective functions of minimization of oil outflow parameter maximizing the cargo capacity and minimizing longitudinal bending moment have been studied by jafaryeganeh et al 2019 the internal layout of a tanker ship has been optimized with considering positions of the watertight members as a design variable pareto frontier have been obtained with multi objective genetic algorithm and the optimal solution have been determined by using the utility function nowacki 2019 has emphasized the use of pareto approach in a multi objective design in which he contributed the literature with a book chapter he gives examples of pareto illustrations and scatters from the studies of papanikolaou 2010 2011 and mentions the benefits of pareto curves or surfaces throughout multi objective models section a packing approach developed by van oers 2011 improves the early stage ship design by exploring and generating a 3d design sets with conflicting requirements the packing approach is briefly based on the description of a novel parametric ship to handle the 3d design changes search algorithm to generate a set of ship design developing most promising feasible designs considering conflicting criteria and the selection process having reviewed the literature on the utilization of pareto method on ship design with particular emphasis on the design of the hull shape and its influence on performance it is evident that majority of the research effort has been concentrated on obtaining the optimized final hull shape with respect to certain single or multiple optimization criteria pawling et al 2017 have investigated the relationship between the ship size and the cost using the design building block approach and spotted non linear relationships between these parameters another example of a novel approach in determining main dimensions is proposed by jianping 2017 where fuzzy logic has been used to obtain main dimensions for enhanced economic performance previous effort of calisal 2017 is seen as another novel example of using pareto approach as it has been implemented at the very early stages of ship design aiming at achieving better main dimensions and form parameters when compared to standard regression approach the proposal of calisal 2017 for the selection of better dimensions should be regarded as a decision making process for selecting ship main dimensions that uses pareto frontier solutions rather than a multi criteria optimization problem with objective functions and constraints the present research campaign aims to extend the application of the pareto based decision making process for selection of better main dimensions to a broader range of ships with different operating profiles an initial design procedure for this decision making process enabling the evaluation of a substantially enlarged design space is proposed and applied to the improvement of performance of a destroyer design and a planing craft the objective of the study is to aim for identifying a pareto frontier which indicates a technological barrier for performance with respect to the conflicting performance criteria identifying the technological barrier and narrowing the design space toward a smaller zone around the technological barrier at early stages of design would serve as a better initial condition to local and global optimization studies which would be conducted at advanced stages of design in both cases a better design with improved main dimensions and hull parameters is sought that would have enhanced the seakeeping performance whilst also lowering the fuel consumption 2 workflow of proposed design approach the process is initiated by the definition of the design space according to the design constraints when selecting the range of the main dimensions for exploration and subsequently the combinations of these dimensions to generate design alternatives a quasi random approach may come in as handy since the designer has a certain level of control over the design space and at the same time the generation process of design alternatives exhibits a fair degree of randomness the design space is usually constrained either for the usage of the machine or technical reasons in ship application a constraint may be the depth of the water she must sail on or the dimensions of the harbour berths a good example could the beam of the ship to use the panama canal these dimensions will reduce the design space in smaller zones where the acceptable design parameters must reside in this research campaign the proposed approach is applied to existing designs therefore constraints have been defined for the main dimensions and the form parameters as percentages of the initial dimensions of the ships in consideration this would yield alternative combinations of parameters in a pre determined interval based on the initial design and random algorithms pre defined algorithm in matlab and sobol sequence have been used for the definition of the design space for application to new designs the process may be initiated from principal dimensions obtained from traditional regression analysis sobol sequence is a type of quasi random low discrepancy sequence the details of its algorithm are well defined by bretley and fox bretley and fox 1988 when the sobol algorithm is applied on creating a design space the created design space is uniform and randomly generated the sequence generates the numbers as binary fraction from a set in comparison to the random distribution this method is avoiding the production of clusters or voids this smart space samples and uniform distribution makes the sequence more efficient for the optimization process turan et al 2016 the sobol sequence also avoids the generation of grid lines this provides a stable basis for following steps such as an optimization fassardi and hochkirch 2006 following the design space definition the performance criteria that will be driving the decision making process needs to be defined a ship like any other machine must have performance criteria for ships such criteria are determined by the owner and the regulatory agencies these parameters may be the payload speed for the owner fuel consumption and pollution or wake quality for a naval ship survivability speed power demand reduced motions and signature may be demanded with equal importance a planing craft would need to consume little fuel while motions would need to be restricted it is evident that the performance criteria set by the owner operator regulatory body or end user are conflicting with one other improvement of the performance with respect to one parameter would normally yield degradation according to the other such as high payload vs low fuel consumption or low power vs lowered motions in this study multiple design performance criteria that are naturally conflicting with each other are aimed for improvement for both considered cases simultaneously as soon as the design space and performance parameters are defined the candidate designs will need to be analysed with respect to the performance criteria by suitable methods and tools experimental analytical or numerical tools provide now to the designers excellent ways to make such analyses the choice for utilization of specific tools for the studies depends on the ship type and the phase of the design as well as time and budget constraints at initial phases of design algorithmic methods and tools with lower fidelity that provide quicker turnaround time when compared to high fidelity alternatives may be utilized enabling exploration of a substantially enlarged design space there is a trade off between accuracy and exploration of enlarged design spaces during this selection and if necessary hybrid approaches may be adopted where the performance of the initial and final and maybe a few intermediate candidates may also be assessed by the higher fidelity methods for further verification in this study two different approaches such as algorithmic methods and low fidelity solvers have been utilized for two case studies pareto procedure requires some statistical data or possible simulations and algorithms as pointed above there may be multiple design alternatives competing in the design the designer must have a decision procedure to recommend the better hull the pareto frontier seems to define a technical barrier which identifies a performance boundary for that design the pareto design procedure used in this study is a combination of the pareto design procedures described by gierson 2006 and kasprzak and lewis 2001 the challenge for pareto approach is the minimization of the variables in a conflicting criteria space called as x the conflicting criteria can be denoted by f i and j a vector solution x may be stated to dominate another solution x if das and dennis 1998 1 f i x f i x for all i є 1 2 n 2 f j x f j x for some j є 1 2 n the discretization of the design space gives the efficient pareto frontier a polynomial description of the frontier can be obtained from this pareto curve the determination of the optimum depends on the selection of the utopia point utopia point is the point that satisfies both criteria ideally and simultaneously there are some other methods to choose the optimum point from pareto set as well as this procedure is considered to be a decision based design theory to choose the best matched point with the criteria is seen as the most efficient method the smallest distance from the utopia point to the candidate design could also be sought in the search of the better design çalışal 2017 utopia point could be an unreachable limit in the design but could be considered as an ideal performance or dimension for the design in the current studies no fuel consumption and no acceleration were usually taken as the utopia point however any point away from the pareto frontier may be selected in principle as a perfect target design point the search for the best candidate is not a well defined process even if there is a pareto front in general equal weight could be given for the performances used for the selection criteria however one may possibly argue that one performance criteria could have a relatively higher weight the procedure used allows for such a weight assignment in the current studies equal weights are assumed for the considered criteria 3 case studies with the proposed design approach 3 1 uscg 5628 based planing vessel in this part of the work a design procedure as described in chapter 2 is implemented on the design study of a planing craft case the conceptual design of a planing craft owing to the nature of its design is more suitable to algorithmic analyses when compared to other types of marine craft such as naval ships and commercial ships the ease of defining a planing craft s shape and linking its performance to its main dimensions deadrise angle and lcg makes it easier to utilize the pareto based design procedure that could enable the investigation of considerably higher number of candidate designs in a design office environment initially a review on procedures and algorithms for planing craft performance prediction is presented followed by the validation study for this procedure the amount of energy required to maintain a planing or semi planing speed or the effective power demand should be quantified for this purpose the procedure described in faltinsen 2005 has been used faltinsen assumes four steps for the calculation of the horizontal component of the total resistance therefore of the ehp faltinsen 2005 first the average wetted length λ w is calculated solving the nonlinear equation below 3 l c g λ w b 0 75 1 5 21 f n 2 λ w 2 2 39 0 in the second step the trim angle is calculated trim angle τ is obtained using the two equations below 4 0 067 c l 0 0 0065 β c l 0 0 6 0 5 c l 0 τ 0 012 λ w 2 5 0 0055 λ w 2 5 f n β 2 f l 0 0 5 ρ v 2 b 2 in the third step chine wetted length l c and keel wetted length l k are calculated 6 λ w 0 5 l k l c b 0 5 x s 2 l c b where 7 x s l k l c effective horse power is then calculated by using speed viscous drag and pressure drag wetted area is seen in two parts 8 s 1 tan 2 β sin β b 2 4 1 z m a x v t τ 9 s 2 b cos β l c horizontal component of the viscous resistance is calculated using the sum of above values for wetted surface and the ittc 57 formula pressure resistance rp is calculated from 10 r p f l β τ a matlab based code developed for this purpose was validated using the data provided in the above reference and other published algorithms by taunton 2010 and the university of naples planing hull series nss by luca de f 2017 for the range of accuracy and trend in the calculations reasonable estimates of the effective power dynamic trim and dynamic waterline length are obtained for a preliminary design stage even though the design algorithm by faltinsen does not include advanced features of these series such as steps or variable deadrise angle figs 1 and 2 below show example comparisons of the predicted effective power and the dynamic trim angle τ by the algorithms provided for the hull c3 of the naples systematic series and the faltinsen s procedure the seakeeping analysis of planing hulls is rather complicated as the dynamic lift characteristics are changing due to ship motions rather advanced tests are reported by bagovic 2014 on the head sea motion of planing crafts such as that of the napoli series nss the algorithmic development for this series is understood to be continuing taunton et al 2011 provide an algorithm for the acceleration levels of their own series they show a nonlinear dependence of acceleration on the significant waves for simplicity a simple acceleration algorithm provided by savitsky 2003 is used for the early development of this design procedure for the testing of the overall procedure outlined above a case study is defined based on the us coast guard motor life boat mlb 5628 series as given in table 1 for the design alternatives the beam interval was set to be between 4 to 8 m dead rise angle between 10 and 20 and the speed range was restricted between 26 and 30 knots for input to the design program in this case the speed of the vessel has been considered as a design variable as ship resistance and acceleration in waves are functions of the encounter frequency therefore are functions of the speed it should be noted that as the design procedure is flexible one can narrow the speed to a much smaller interval or keep it as a constant the interval for speed was linear and the interval for beam and dead rise angle were randomized a total of 1000 hulls were generated randomly within the design space by matlab within the developed approach the design mass and the location of the initial the center of gravity of the hull and the length of the hull in still water are required as inputs the algorithmic resistance and acceleration level of the hull at the centroid of mass are then calculated the hull dimensions and speed range foreseen by the algorithms are then checked against the speed to length ratio for semi planing and planing hulls in this study speed to beam ratio v b is set for the interval of 1 6 4 when this length ratio is not satisfied that specific design is not included in the design population and in the final selection or suitability as a better hull another issue for suitability of the planing hull is a dynamic property of the hull identified as porpoising the prediction of porpoising was studied by day j p haag r j 1952 celano 1998 and a critical trim angle algorithm is provided in this study against the speed coefficient v gb the relationship includes the dead rise angle and the lift coefficient of the hull the critical trim angle at the design speed coefficient is then compared with the trim of the designed hull at the same speed coefficient the porpoising and nonlinear sea keeping of planing hulls make the additional calculations seemingly not reliable at this stage of the design and more work is possibly justifiable in this area the experience gained from this study suggests that major hull parameters for a better planing hull could be identified with the help of existing algorithms and a design logic based on the pareto front concept the likelihood of porpoising could also be included in the selection of the main parameters with the identification of a critical trim angle the work done confirms that additional research needs to be done for the better understanding of planing hull performance in regular and irregular waves as depicted in chapter 2 the process is initiated with the definition of a relatively large number of principal dimensions of boats in a random fashion the design criteria have been set as minimum effective power requirement minimum acceleration level at the center of gravity at this step an additional porpoising check is necessarily added to the sequence to be able to observe the existence of the pareto front analyses have been conducted for the effective power and the acceleration levels as explained previously all algorithms have been coded in matlab the resistance and trim simulation for a planing hull start with an assigned location of the center of gravity and the mass of the load and follows the step by step procedure outlined by faltinsen 2005 the total resistance is converted into a more practical easily conceivable effective horsepower value this study the fuel consumption is assumed to be proportional to effective power demanded by the ship the calculated effective power is then used as one of the performance parameters in the definition and search of pareto front the algorithm used in this study for the simulation of the acceleration at the center of gravity is from savitsky 2003 the average acceleration at the center of gravity is formulated as 11 n c g 0 0104 h 1 3 b 0 084 τ 4 5 3 β 30 v k l 2 l b c δ from more general algorithms such as a response spectrum one can of course calculate additional statistical values for an assigned sea state one can possibly use the assumptions in jensen 2004 to calculate the combined motion at the bow of the ship and the relative bow motion with respect to the wave elevation the main assumption in jensen 2004 is that the interactions between different modes of motions can be neglected and or ignored in this study the sea state is taken as sea state 3 one thousand combinations of beam values hull speeds and dead rise angles are used to obtain a design population for this planing hull study after the completion of the calculations the existence of a specific pareto front is sought this front is seen as technological barrier in the design in this case 1000 design points are plotted as in fig 3 as the units of the design parameter such as acceleration and effective power are not the same these design parameters as in fig 3 are non dimensionalized that is each value of the elements of a set is divided by the maximum value of the elements of that set in this case the maximum value of a variable such as ehp is non dimensionalized by the maximum value obtained for ehp in the search this provides a non dimensional decision space of one unit in each direction however some weights may be given by the designer as to provide the order of magnitude of importance seen by the designer or included in the owner s requirements if necessary in this study it was observed that such a front indeed exists for planing hulls the displacement type ships moving at relatively slow speeds are eliminated from the population of ships fig 3 suggests that the set of minimized acceleration levels at a constant effective power can be seen as a pareto front the utopic point in this study is taken as the origin of the design space the zero acceleration and the zero effective power point is defined as the utopic point in this study the design with minimum distance from the utopic point to the candidate design is defined as the better ship the suitable number of designs on the pareto front are then located by a numerical search method fig 3 shows the performance space and the better design is shown with a quadrilateral marker all the computer based study and the programming are done in matlab and it takes about 20 s to run the program including the graphical work table 2 below shows some of the design parameters calculated for the better point and 4 other points near the better point the frontier also depicts a clear technological barrier for the given design constraints it is seen that existing designs may be improved up to the technological barrier with the proposed procedure the applied procedure suggests that the importance of the two performance criteria studied by the method is of equal importance however as recommended by kasprzak et al 2001 if one criterion is more important than the other one by a factor n the coordinate of the candidate designs could be increased in that direction by the same factor reflecting the increased importance of that criteria or that objective table 2 suggests that increased deadrise angle and slightly decreased beam provides a better compromise solution when both effective power demand and accelerations are aimed for improvement best design best1 has 6 less effective power requirement as well as 6 less acceleration at lcg the critical degree to avoid porpoising suggested by day et al 1952 as 12 τ c r i t 0 1197 β

010 β 1 where 15 c a c l 2 celano 1998 has extended day et al s studies with larger models and higher deadrise angles as seen in recent designs analysing the extensive test data followed by a regression study resulted with the below formulation for critical trim angle 16 τ c r i t 0 1197 β 0 7651 e x p 15 7132 c l 2 β 0 2629 celano s algorithm was utilized in this study to identify if the design is in or near a critical area fig 4 shows that the designs and specifically the better hull has a trim less than the critical trim given by the algorithms in the figure trim angles are plotted against cv which is obtained with the below formulation 17 c v v g b 3 2 dtmb 5415 based destroyer this case study considers the dtmb 5415 hull which is a ship model tested at david taylor model basin based on an early ddg 51 arleigh burke class destroyer as the initial hull form for seeking better main dimensions and form parameters as this hull has been considered as an initial conceptual design that has been dimensionalized for some pre determined set of performance criteria it is evident that setting a new pair of design criteria that may be said to be conflicting with each other would possibly yield a different trade off solution than that of the initial hull in this study a new set of improved main dimensions and form parameters based on the dtmb 5415 hull are sought with respect to the following criteria minimization of effective power demand minimization of the pitch acceleration at the bridge in contrast to the planing craft case presented in section 3 1 above this case study required the use of dedicated solvers for resistance and seakeeping calculations the handling of all the creation of the geometry the meshing the performance calculations and the post processing of the data for an enlarged design space required the use of dedicated software for linking all the components that are utilized in the process in this study opti slang has been used as the control platform of the procedure opti slang is an optimization platform that has principally been established for reliability analysis and is competent to be used for optimization problems and robustness evaluation it allows the link of different solvers and the construing of the input and the output parameters bucher et al 2001 it has previously been used for the optimization problems of the variable speed turbine designs tengs et al 2018 and the derivation of the mechanical properties of bonded joints bernardin et al 2013 a sobol sequence as defined by bretley and fox 1988 has been implemented on matlab for obtaining the design space 30 parent ships with varying length and beams have been developed with the above mentioned sequence the variation of length and beam has been restricted to 10 compared to the initial hull even though 10 variation may be considered to be a large range when seeking improved design alternatives keeping the variation range reasonably large enables the designer to detect outside the box better designs if any that would normally not be considered unless randomness is involved in the process the developed ships all have the same payload capacity the lightship weight has been assumed to be varying with the product of the main dimensions length beam and depth and the payload of the parent ship has been added to the lightship of each candidate ship to obtain its displacement and draft a total number of 270 ships define the design space that are variants of 30 parent ships the length beam variation of the parent ships obtained with the sobol algorithm are given in fig 5 all ships are generated from the parent ships with variations given below lcb 50 51 52 c p 0 59 0 607 0 624 the main dimensions and the lcb values created by the sobol algorithm are used to modify the initial dtmb 5415 hull in maxsurf modeller main dimensions are modified by scaling and parametric transformation has been used to vary lcb position this process is carried out in batch mode following the generation of candidate hulls they have been exported in iges format and fed into the meshing software gid software has been used for meshing a structured meshing strategy has been adopted a sample mesh is depicted in fig 6 the effective power demand of the ships has been estimated with a potential flow solver nushallo at 18 knots of speed nushallo is a non linear free surface potential flow solver that incorporates the methodology presented by jensen et al 1986 in terms of capturing the free surface the ship hull is discretized by triangular and rectangular cells the mesh of the hull is blended to the obtained free surface at every iteration loop leading to an improved numerical accuracy the trim and the sinkage of the hull are also accounted for during the calculations marzi 2003 the validation study for nushallo has been based on an extrapolation from the resistance test results of the dtmb 5415 olivieri et al 2001 which is the initial hull utilized in this study fig 7 shows the effective power results obtained from nushallo in comparison to the experiment based data a good agreement is observed for the desired speed range as the aim of this study is to explore an enlarged design space at an early design stage with reasonable effort and sufficient accuracy it is anticipated that utilization of a potential solver is a sensible approach the acceleration values at the bridge location have been obtained from maxsurf motions that utilizes a strip theory based solver for the calculation of the motions and the accelerations seakeeping calculation conditions and crucial modelling parameters are given in table 3 the utilized seakeeping software for the optimization process needs to have sufficient capability for capturing the differences in responses of the alternative hulls in the heave the pitch motions and in the more comprehensive evaluations in the added resistance due to wave action for the currently utilized seakeeping software three validation cases are presented in the user manual formation design systems 2011 namely for npl round bilge series series 60 and a fast freight vessel of sa van der stel the limitations and assumptions of the utilized strip theory approach is presented as well additionally a validation study has been conducted with the utilized software for the vessel in consideration for this purpose experimental data for the subject vessel has been utilized from olivieriet al 2001 cited in cakici et al 2017 the considered case is at a speed corresponding to fr 0 41 and the heave and the pitch responses at the center of gravity are obtained for the head seas condition results obtained from the computations in maxsurf are presented along with the experimental data in fig 8 it is seen that there is good agreement between the predictions and the experimental data for the speed and the heading combination the method is capable of predicting the trend in the variation of the rao s across the wave frequency range results of the potential flow and the seakeeping analysis indicate the formation of a pareto front for this case as well the acceleration and the effective power values are non dimensionalized by dividing with maximum value fig 9 shows the obtained pareto front the dimensions the effective power and the acceleration values of the initial and the better hull are given in table 4 in this case a larger and a slightly narrower hull has shown better performance when the multiple criteria are considered for the decision of the main dimensions a reduction of 1 in effective power has been obtained while also improving the pitch induced acceleration by 9 the chosen main dimensions of the destroyer influence both the seakeeping performance and the effective power demand however the effect of choosing of the different main dimensions is more pronounced on the seakeeping responses when compared to the power demand local refinement of the hull shape could lead to further reductions in resistance as the derived hull forms may still be keeping certain features of the initial hull which have not been adjusted to the variants diez et al 2015 therefore there is further potential of improvement by single or multi criteria optimization studies which may be conducted at the progressive stages of design where the hull form could be varied locally with a suitable algorithm at this stage it can be concluded that the proposed approach for the selection of the main dimensions is not a replacement for single or multi criteria optimization studies but a supplementary approach that may be adopted at the very early stage of the design when the improvements obtained by this study are compared with the optimization studies cited in chapter 1 diez et al 2015 and wu et al 2016 it is seen that the improvement in the seakeeping performance achieved by selecting better dimensions is comparable to that of the optimization studies the seakeeping improvements varied between 3 and 13 5 in the studies the reduction in the resistance is significantly higher for the optimization studies as the local hull form is more influential on the resistance characteristics current modification of the main dimensions and the underwater volume distribution has a certain effect on the resistance as well a significant improvement in seakeeping performance has been achieved while also reducing effective power demand by 1 by altering the main dimensions lcb and cp 4 conclusions a pareto based decision making approach for the selection of the ship main dimensions has been proposed the aim of this approach is to enable the designers to explore their design space in such a way that they may see the influence of ship main parameters on multiple performance criteria enabling them to optimize or improve the design and most importantly give the designers the opportunity of thinking outside of the box by utilizing the proposed methodology the designer would have the chance to push the design towards the technological barrier instead of relying on a particular design solution balancing the design objectives traditional design approach usually dictates the minimization of the power demand this study was aimed to see if a better hull could be designed by including more design objectives and still save some fuel it is seen that the initial designs in both case studies could be improved up to the technological barrier the efficacy of the proposed process required to enhance the initial design up to the technological barrier is notable and useful results may be obtained in a cost effective fashion if the utilized tools are sufficiently quick and have satisfactory fidelity it is evident from the results presented above that the ship main dimensions the distribution of weight and the distribution of underwater volume have notable effect on the performance of the vessel in terms of the fuel consumption and the ship motions in the seaway the additional effort that would be put in the early design process to evaluate an enlarged design space with different main dimensions and form parameters is found to be worthwhile for the tested cases this approach should be regarded as a supplementary effort at the very initial phase of the design and it should be noted that it is not an alternative to local or global optimization studies that would be conducted at the progressive stages involving single or multiple criteria combining the two by selecting better main dimension by the proposed method and performing the necessary optimization studies thereafter could enable the actual potential of the design to be unveiled two case studies have been presented using the proposed approach that are based on dtmb 5415 and a planing craft a pareto frontier has been observed for all the cases considered this finding is beneficial for the proof of the universality of the proposed pareto approach however it should be noted that further diversified evaluation of the proposed approach for different ship types would be beneficial for generalizing its universality the proposed method is shown to find rather efficiently a technological barrier for the performance criteria such as the fuel efficiency and the acceleration levels of designs in both presented cases the technological barrier could easily be achieved with the proposed approach of course the results are limited with today s knowledge on the type of a ship in terms of the independent variables the designer has control of such as the main dimensions with this knowledge of the technological barrier which is limited by the information side of the design process a design decision is still needed this selection decision needs a design criterion which is the selection of the utopic point for different usage of the hull as for a passenger ship or for a naval ship different utopic points or maximum levels could be considered as an owner requirement the existence of the technological barrier also suggests that new technologies are needed to further improve this barrier by changes such as the ventilated hulls stepped hulls for planing craft and by bulbs or parabolized waterlines for displacement type ships the proposed approach may be used for selecting the main dimensions in a more refined fashion compared to traditional approaches the introduced randomness enables the assessment of combinations that may generally be considered outside of the regular design alternatives that would otherwise not be considered in the current study the process was based on improving the main dimensions for two basic performance requirements namely the effective power at one speed and the seakeeping performance which was assumed to be represented by the acceleration in head seas evidently there are many more important performance aspects that may be driving the process of the selection of main dimensions and certain initial hull parameters the selection of the performance parameters that are said to be driving the process is dependent on the operation profile the performance requirements the type of vessel and the relevant ranking of the importance defined by either the designer or the owner or the operator of the vessel therefore the designer using this procedure could easily and freely choose other hull parameters for progressing with and obtaining better main dimensions although the procedure shows a potential as a prospective approach for use in a design office environment further improvements are beneficial currently the importance of each design parameter has been assumed as equal the design criteria or the importance of weights of design performance measures could be changed by the owner or the designers other measures or combination of measures could be added into the design study the procedure developed for two performance objectives could be extended into multiple performance objectives in a systematic
