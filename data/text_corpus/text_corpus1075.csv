5375,low impact development is to restore natural hydrology in the urban environment thus hydrologic characterization and hydrologic restoration measurement are crucial to low impact development research the present study uses runoff frequency spectrum to present years of daily runoff events for characterizing flow regime and develops a method to quantify similarity between runoff frequency spectra for measuring hydrologic restoration the method was applied to case study of rainwater harvesting of a roof across five climate patterns with annual precipitation from 465 1 to 1807 9 mm y 26 30 years of daily runoff data were obtained by continuous mass balance simulation at daily time step that considered stochastic end use water demand usage of tanks for comparison similarity of total runoff amounts s t and similarity of runoff frequency spectra s d between undeveloped and developed scenarios were computed to measure hydrologic restoration maximum s t 1 was found to be always achievable and only attained by a single rainwater tank size maximum s d 0 34 0 78 which could be achieved by a size range larger than that with s t 1 compared with natural condition total cumulative frequencies of rainwater tank with maximum s d were declined by 59 2 84 3 the proposed method solves the problem of quantitative comparison of runoff frequency spectra with different frequencies and lengths which has advantages of 1 quantifying the extent of hydrologic restoration at daily temporal resolution 2 finding a trade off between reduction of roof runoff intensity and maintenance of natural runoff frequency and 3 supporting decision making on strategies to restore natural flow regime in the urban environment as much as possible keywords urban hydrology low impact development

roads and roofs from 2006 to 2016 for example the impervious surface area in guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area china increased from 12127 69 km2 to 20188 87 km2 with an annual growth rate of 806 12 km2 feng and fan 2018 the hardening destroys natural hydrologic regime promoting flash floods wang et al 2019 and polluted runoff that damage aquatic ecosystem walsh et al 2005b low impact development lid has gain momentum worldwide in efforts to solve these problems lid is to mimic natural hydrology mohurd of china 2015 u s environmental protection agency 2009 u s green building council 2014 through capturing stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces and providing some combination of detention infiltration evapotranspiration and utilization to it bressy et al 2014 davis 2008 2005 fletcher et al 2015 ghadim and hin 2017 gold et al 2018 hamel et al 2013 hunt et al 2008 petrucci et al 2013 petrucci and tassin 2015 walsh et al 2016 2015 2005a therefore the question of how to return hydrology of the impervious surface as close as possible to the natural state is a fundamental issue in lid research while measurement of hydrologic restoration is crucial to finding the answer currently two kinds of data are used to characterize runoff behavior and assess hydrologic restoration short term hydrograph and long term data short term hydrograph is well suited to capture flow changes at a fine temporal resolution and short term data can be easily obtained thus event based metrics derived from a short term hydrograph are popularly used which involve peak flow rate lag time runoff volume runoff coefficient etc damodaram et al 2010 burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 qin et al 2013 liao et al 2015 palla and gnecco 2015 wang et al 2018a shortcoming of event based metrics is that they do not take climate uncertainty into consideration effectiveness of lid controls is substantially influenced by uncertain factors such as free storage volume before the rainy day and rainfall over the day yang et al 2015 wang and wang 2018 long term data contain uncertainty but pose more challenges of data mining than short duration data most associated assessment metrics are developed based on annual water balance askarizadeh et al 2015 such as average annual runoff reduction average annual runoff days etc kertesz et al 2014 schifman et al 2018 these annual value based metrics lose the details that long term data actually contain a relatively new approach of assessing hydrologic restoration is to compare runoff frequency spectra between undeveloped and developed scenarios rossman 2013 many years of daily runoff events are generally needed for characterizing the pattern of a catchment s flow quantity frequency and variability that is its flow regime blythe and schmidt 2018 fang and shen 2017 poff et al 1997 runoff frequency spectrum presents many years of daily runoff events which are effective in determining the effect of hydrologic restoration with regard to flow regime wang et al 2018b however there is a lack of an appropriate method for quantitatively comparing runoff frequency spectra which largely limits the usage of runoff frequency spectrum in practical assessment therefore the goals of the present study are 1 to develop a method to quantify similarity between runoff frequency spectra under different development and runoff control scenarios and 2 to use the newly developed method to measure the extent of hydrologic restoration in case study of rainwater harvesting across five climate patterns and to examine features of the method 2 methods and case study 2 1 method development 2 1 1 runoff frequency spectrum in lid design 30 years of daily rainfall data are used to generate daily rainfall depth percentile distribution termed rainfall frequency spectrum for determining design storm hirschman and kosco 2008 u s environmental protection agency 2009 climate models can be used to determine possible changes in the rainfall frequency spectrum to adequately prepare lid installations sylvester et al 2016 runoff frequency spectrum is created in the same way often runoff discharge data are expressed as m3 d they can be divided by the catchment area and expressed as mm d and further rounded to 0 1 decimal place because precision of rainfall and evaporation record are generally limited to 0 1 mm d this processing probably added duplicated daily runoff values runoff frequency density is defined as how many days have runoff discharge equal to a given value for example on x in fig 1 a frequency density was 78 days for the minimum value 0 1 mm d and only one day for the maximum value 147 2 mm d all daily runoff values are sorted from lowest to highest to generate runoff frequency spectrum as shown in fig 1 b in which percentile is a measure at or below which a certain percentage of daily rainfall events lies taking x in fig 1 b for example 18 8 mm d corresponds to the 90th percentile runoff event which means 18 8 mm d is greater than 90 of all runoff values on x axis percentiles of x and y respectively range from 8 86 to 100 and 0 88 100 which do not reveal the difference in frequency thus percentile is replaced by cumulative exceedance frequency as shown in fig 1 c in which cumulative frequency means how many times per year on average a given daily value is exceeded on x axis cumulative frequencies of x and y respectively range from 0 037 32 59 and 0 037 16 85 d y which reveal the difference in frequency however the numbers descending on x axis is abnormal to the habit of expression to make the plot easier to interpret fig 1 d is obtained by rotating fig 1 c 90 degrees clockwise and using logarithmic coordinates on y axis fig 1 b c and d are different forms of runoff frequency spectrums the present study uses fig 1 d to refer to runoff frequency spectrum it can be simply generated by ordering daily runoff values from highest to lowest and then counting how many days have runoff higher than a given value without through fig 1 b and c runoff frequency spectrum presents the complete range of daily runoff events in an ordered arrangement of cumulative frequency representing flow regime 2 1 2 computation of runoff frequency sequences similarity if x and y respectively denote undeveloped or restoration objective and developed scenarios the similarity between x and y is a metric measuring hydrologic restoration usually hydrologic frequency spectra are plotted into curves in that way the similarity between x and y is the similarity between the curves in fact line segments connecting the points do not exist which will introduce errors to similarity the similarity between x and y is the similarity between the two series of data points thus x and y in fig 1 d are expressed as follows 1 x x 1 t x i t x n t 2 y y 1 t y i t y m t where x and y are daily values mm d from highest to lowest subscript denotes cumulative frequency n and m represent total days with runoff d and t is the number of years analyzed y such sequence is termed runoff frequency sequence n t and m t are total cumulative frequency which is defined as sequence length for example sequence lengths of x and y in fig 1 d were 32 59 and 16 85 d y respectively runoff frequency spectra similarity is equal to runoff frequency sequences similarity the difficulty in quantifying runoff frequency sequences similarity is that the values in x and y often correspond to different frequencies and lengths which means x and y are not directly comparable this study first proposes a method of frequency alignment to align runoff values in x and y to the same frequency positions and then computes similarity between the aligned x and y the method is decomposed into 5 steps as follows 1 sequence y alignment the match function in microsoft excel is used for each frequency in y to search exact match in most case or next smallest frequency in x as the frequency position to be aligned then the values with the same frequency position to be aligned are merged into a new value by using weighted average method the weight is frequency density i e duplicated days frequency density of the new value is the sum of frequency density of the merged values as a result the length of the aligned y remains unchanged m t 2 sequence x alignment after step 1 all frequencies in the aligned y can be found in x however there may be redundant frequencies in x that do not exist in the aligned y thus the same alignment procedure is used to align frequencies in x to exact match or next smallest frequency position in the aligned y the part of x that exceeds the length of the aligned y is retained directly these directly retained frequencies can be considered to also exist in the aligned y while corresponding runoff values are all zero after the two steps the aligned x and y have the same frequencies and length 3 dissimilarity of comparable pair runoff values from the aligned x and y with the same frequency position are termed a comparable pair which are directly compared absolute dissimilarity y i t x i t and relative dissimilarity y i t x i t x i t 4 dissimilarity of x and y weighted average of relative dissimilarities of all comparable pairs is defined as runoff frequency sequences dissimilarity the weight is calculated based on the aligned x it is equal to the ratio of runoff amount at a given frequency to total amount of runoff w e i g h t d a i l y r u n o f f v a l u e d u p l i c a t e d d a y s t o t a l a m o u n t o f r u n o f f the weight determines the contribution of dissimilarity of a comparable pair to the sequences dissimilarity 5 similarity of x and y dissimilarity is opposite to similarity thus similarity of x and y formulates as follows 3 s d 1 r u n o f f f r e q u e n c y s e q u e n c e s d i s s i m i l a r i t y where s d is runoff frequency sequences similarity the closer to 1 the s d the more similar the two sequences s d 1 means that the two sequences are exactly the same note x is a reference sequence and y is the one to be compared if there are more than two sequences to compare together x should be the longest one this is because step 3 needs runoff values from x to be denominators and step 4 needs x to compute the weights the longest x ensures that denominators in step 3 are always greater than zero and the weights obtained from step 4 are the same for all sequences to be compared 2 1 3 computation examples a microsoft excel worksheet illustrating the above 5 steps can be seen in appendix b which computes the similarity between x and y in fig 1 the results are shown in fig 2 a as cumulative frequency increases absolute dissimilarity consequently decreases while relative dissimilarity initially increases then decreases increases again and finally maintains at one when relative dissimilarity is equal to 1 runoff values are zero in y while greater than zero in x the weight of relative dissimilarity generally decreases with the increase of cumulative frequency fig 2 b two examples are presented herein to explain how the weights influence sequences dissimilarity in fig 2 a at leftmost point on orange curve cumulative frequency is minimum 0 037 d y and its relative dissimilarity is 0 26 runoff value in x corresponding to this point reaches maximum 147 2 mm d with frequency density being one day thus its weight is 0 0216 and its weighted relative dissimilarity is 0 26 0 0216 0 0057 at the rightmost point on orange curve cumulative frequency is maximum 32 59 d y and its relative dissimilarity is 1 runoff value in x corresponding to this point is minimum 0 1 mm d with frequency density being 78 days thus its weight is 0 0011 and its weighted relative dissimilarity is 0 0011 1 0 0011 the sum of weighted relative dissimilarities at all frequencies is 0 48 the runoff frequency sequences similarity is accordingly 1 0 48 0 52 2 2 case study this study chose rainwater harvesting for case study to test and examine the proposed method the study catchment was a roof of 5500 m2 located in nanchang china rainwater running off the roof was harvested and stored in a tank for adjacent lawn irrigation and ground cleaning rather than directly allowing it to off site discharge thus runoff discharge of the roof depended on discharge of the rainwater tank both lawn and ground area were two times of roof area the proposed method was used to measure the extent to which rainwater harvesting returned hydrology of the roof area to natural state and to determine optimal size of rainwater tank 2 2 1 climate conditions in order to understand the effect of climatic condition on hydrologic restoration the study site was assumed to be also located in other four cities in china map can be seen in appendix fig a 1 that is to say hydrologic restoration of the roof was assessed under five climatic conditions the five cities were nominated to represent 5 climate patterns urumqi temperate continental climate kunming subtropical plateau monsoon climate shanghai subtropical monsoon climate nanchang subtropical monsoon humid climate and haikou tropical monsoon climate we collected 26 30 years of daily precipitation and evaporation data from china meteorological data service center table 1 for different cities the ranges of mean precipitation and mean evaporation were 465 1 1807 9 and 954 9 1313 3 mm y respectively among the five climates urumqi climate had the driest climate with the least precipitation and its evaporation being 2 38 times higher than its precipitation for the same city precipitation and evaporation annually varied the maximum annual precipitation was 1 90 2 67 times higher than the minimum and the highest annual evaporation was 1 42 2 24 times greater than the lowest one regional disparity and fluctuation of climatic conditions over time suggested contrastive and uncertainty analysis to be highly essential 2 2 2 estimation of roof runoff this study used a widely accepted method to estimate roof runoff in order to avoid arguments on data acquisition rather than the proposed method itself runoff curve number cn method is often used to estimate direct runoff from storm rainfall in small watersheds u s department of agriculture 1986 and it is introduced by national engineering handbook u s department of agriculture 2004 the method has an advantage over runoff coefficient method of variable rainfall runoff ratios that can estimate runoff from a wide range of rainfall events rather than a single design storm formulae of cn method and graphical solution can be seen in appendix eq a 1 eq a 2 and fig a 2 it uses cn to reflect the synthesized effect of soil texture cover type land treatment and other hydrologic conditions which is divided into four hydrologic soil groups hsg a b c and d as shown in table 2 under undeveloped scenario the catchment had soil texture belonged to hsg d cn 84 while under developed scenario it was a roof with cn 98 hsg c b and a cn 79 69 and 49 respectively were taken into account as well in order to compare runoff behaviors between different natural conditions 2 2 3 estimation of off site runoff discharge estimation of off site runoff discharge of rainwater tank consisted of three parts collected roof runoff end use water demand and off site runoff discharge fig 3 the framework included a continuous mass balance simulation at daily time step that considered antecedent rainfall and stochastic end use water demand usage of tanks and predicted the available storage prior to each storm event and following runoff discharge the estimation is briefly introduced as follows details of the algorithms can be seen in appendix a 1 1 collected roof runoff the roof got dust dirt and debris from the environment over time since the first roof runoff carried most of the dirt a first flush device was used to divert it away from the storage tank the remaining was collected roof runoff going straight to the rainwater tank 2 water demand collected roof runoff was used to meet non potable water demands ground cleaning and lawn irrigation they are very common usages of harvested rainwater ground cleaning consumed 2 mm water m2 every time and twice in a month lawn irrigation was automatic and its water consumption was unfixed when evaporation was greater than precipitation irrigation was started automatically to supply the evaporation 3 off site runoff discharge because collected roof runoff and water demand daily varied volume of roof runoff stored in storage tank roof runoff reused and off site runoff discharge i e overflow from the tank consequently varied every day as well the three parts were continuously computed at daily time step over 26 30 years i e 9490 10950 days of historical precipitation and evaporation records in order to improve computing efficiency the present study coded the algorithms and executed the computation by using microsoft excel 2 2 4 assessment scenarios and metrics since the study site located in nanchang was assumed to be also located in other four cities assessment scenarios involved three variables climatic condition development state undeveloped or developed and rainwater tank size for a given location runoff were estimated based on the same meteorological input thus runoff results represented undeveloped and developed scenarios rather than before and after development stages four assessment metrics were proposed to assess hydrologic restoration and techno economic rationality as follows 1 runoff frequency spectra similarity this metric is s d as given by eq 3 it was used to measure hydrologic restoration at daily time resolution 2 total amount similarity 4 s t 1 i 1 m d i f r o o f i 1 n d i f r o o f i 1 n d i f r o o f where s t is total amount similarity i 1 m d i f r o o f represents total runoff amount of sequence y or developed scenario mm y i 1 n d i f r o o f denotes total runoff amount of sequence x or undeveloped scenario mm y s t 1 means that total amounts of the two scenarios are exactly the same s t was used to measure hydrologic restoration with regard to total runoff amounts 3 capture ratio of total rainfall 5 α 1 i 1 t d i f r o o f i 1 t p i where α is capture ratio of total rainfall t denotes total days analyzed d i 1 t d i f r o o f represents total runoff amount mm i 1 t p i is total rainfall amount mm α can be also calculated by average annual runoff total runoff amount divided by the number of years and average annual rainfall total rainfall amount divided by the number of years and the result will not change α was used to assess the efficiency of the site in retaining rainwater 4 average annual utilization of rainwater tank 6 β i 1 t w i t v where β represents average annual utilization rate of rainwater tank y i 1 t w i t is average annual volume of reused roof runoff m3 y and v denotes volume of storage tank m3 β was used to assess techno economic rationality of the rainwater tank 3 results 3 1 runoff frequency spectrum reveals detail information typical runoff frequency spectra are shown in fig 4 which visually present different long term datasets by intensity frequency distributions for undeveloped condition orange curve maximum runoff intensity was 147 2 mm d and total cumulative frequency was 32 59 d y as the catchment became a roof without rainwater harvesting grey curve maximum runoff intensity was 189 2 mm d and total cumulative frequency was 85 15 d y grey curve was on the right of orange curve indicating that the hardening significantly increased runoff intensity and frequency with the increase of the volume of rainwater tank runoff frequency spectra moved left and became short for simplification cumulative frequency of 0 3 d y was referred to low frequency that ranged from 0 3 to 6 d y was referred to mid frequency and the rest of 6 d y was referred to high frequency when the volume of rainwater tank reached 47 m3 yellow curve runoff intensities at most frequencies were still larger than natural condition however its total cumulative frequency 27 63 d y became less than natural condition when the volume of rainwater tank reached 238 m3 blue curve mid frequency runoff was close to natural condition whereas total cumulative frequency decreased to 9 66 d y high frequency runoff was significantly attenuated compared with natural condition when the volume of rainwater tank reached 598 m3 green curve low frequency runoff was close to natural condition while mid frequency runoff was smaller than natural condition and high frequency runoff was substantially eliminated total cumulative frequency decreased to 3 22 d y and the smallest daily runoff value increased to 0 5 mm d once the volume of rainwater tank reached 801 m3 purple curve runoff were smaller than natural condition at almost all frequencies and total cumulative frequency was only 2 37 d y indicating that surface runoff discharge was seriously insufficient compared with natural condition 3 2 similarity metrics measure hydrologic restoration and determine optimal size as shown in fig 4 hydrologic restoration effects were different between different frequencies optimal rainwater tank size needs a trade off between these effects both total amount similarity s t and runoff frequency spectra similarity s d are the options for determining the optimal size fig 5 compares the two metrics under different climates and lid scenarios with the increase of rainwater tank size utilization rate of rainwater tank β decreased monotonically while both s t and s d increased first and then decreased maximum s t 1 was found to be always achievable and only attained by a single rainwater tank size this can be explained by fig 5 f capture ratios of annual rainfall α of undeveloped scenarios were as follows 97 1 urumqi 84 3 kunming 79 5 shanghai 76 3 nanchang and 66 8 haikou with the increase of size of rainwater tank α rose monotonically and went beyond the reference values of undeveloped scenarios because there was only one crossover point of the rising curve and the reference s t 1 was achievable and it was only attained by a single tank size s t 1 indicates natural hydrology with regard to total runoff amount could be restored unlike s t maximum values of s d were 0 78 haikou 0 69 nanchang 0 66 shanghai 0 73 kunming and 0 34 urumqi respectively which means the maximum extent of hydrologic restoration in terms of flow regime was 0 34 0 78 besides the maximum s d could be achieved by a range of tank size for instances under haikou climate maximum s d value was corresponded to tank size of 296 358 m3 and β of 10 39 11 68 y under shanghai climate maximum s d value was corresponded to tank size of 238 288 m3 and β of 9 39 10 69 y of course the smallest size in the range had better techno economic performance the smallest size with maximum s d was larger than the size with maximum s t they were respectively as follows 111 1 versus 92 4 m3 urumqi 267 4 versus 214 5 m3 kunming 238 0 versus 201 4 shanghai 453 5 versus 322 1 m3 nanchang and 296 0 versus 279 4 m3 haikou this can be explained by fig 2 b s t 1 was fulfilled through retaining high and mid frequency small and midsize roof runoff which were corresponded to relatively small weights in calculating s d therefore the tank size with s t 1 was smaller than the size with maximum s d 3 3 how maximum s d was attained the proposed method considered both greater and less than natural condition as dissimilarity calculation of dissimilarity returned absolute value negative value was converted to positive one and positive value was unaffected therefore two very different volumes of tank could achieve the same s d fig 5 appendix fig a 3 shows three examples of runoff frequency spectra of rainwater tanks corresponding to the same s d value while with two different tank volumes they were respectively on the left and right sides of natural reference spectrum the one on the right side revealed that the tank was undersized for reducing roof runoff intensity while that was on the left side indicated that the tank was oversized for maintaining natural runoff discharge runoff frequency spectra of rainwater tank with the maximum s d are depicted in fig 6 runoff frequency spectra of undeveloped scenario were remarkable different under different climates orange curves because in the assessment undeveloped sites were the same under the five climates the difference shows the effect of climatic condition on natural runoff flow regime blue curves show runoff frequency spectra of the smallest tanks with maximum s d generally the optimal rainwater tank was suited to retain mid frequency midsize runoff whereas it was undersized for low frequency large runoff and oversized for high frequency small runoff it was inevitable for a rainwater tank with fixed volume to reduce or eliminate small runoff therefore the maximum s d represents a trade off between reduction of roof runoff intensity and maintenance of natural runoff frequency compared with natural flow regime total cumulative frequencies i e days with runoff per year with maximum s d declined by 59 2 haikou 69 4 nanchang 70 3 shanghai 68 7 kunming and 84 3 urumqi under urumqi climate maximum s d was the lowest 0 34 and runoff frequency decline was the most 84 3 indicating that it was the most difficult for rainwater harvesting to restore natural flow regime under the driest climate 3 4 validity and applicable range of the proposed method because s t was computed without any data processing its validity was self evident validity of the proposed method was examined by observing relationship between s d and s t as shown in fig 4 when rainwater tanks were too small e g yellow curve or too big e g purple curve the trade off between different lid effects did not matter under the circumstances s d was close to s t fig 5 this study also computed s d between other natural conditions cn 49 69 and 79 and the reference condition cn 84 with the decrease of cn frequency and intensity of runoff simultaneously decreased as a result the frequency spectra did not cross and the trade off was not therefore required appendix fig a 4 under these circumstances s d value was equal to s t value regardless of climatic conditions appendix fig a 5 s d value was found to be close or equal to s t under these circumstances indirectly proved validity of the proposed method the proposed method was valid till the length of reference sequence was 28 6 times higher than that of the compared one as shown in fig 5 with the increase of size of rainwater tank s d initially increased and then decreased there was only one exception in the trend under urumqi climate as illustrated in fig 5 e the next rightmost point was tank size 167 8 m3 s d 0 13 and the rightmost point was 193 8 m3 0 14 as size of tank increased from 167 8 to 193 8 m3 s d did not decrease while slightly increased as mentioned earlier under urumqi climate the decline of total cumulative frequency caused by rainwater harvesting was the most as the volume of rainwater tank reached 167 8 m3 the frequency sequence consisted of only 8 values and hence the length of reference sequence was 28 6 times higher than its length as the size of rainwater tank reached 193 8 m3 the frequency sequence consisted of 4 values and the length of reference sequence was therefore 57 6 times higher than its length appendix fig a 6 this countertrend indicated that the rightmost point was beyond applicable range of the method nevertheless 28 6 times of difference have covered most circumstances 4 discussion 4 1 limitation of the present case study for a given study area with a given climatic condition quantitative assessment of hydrologic restoration can be divided into three steps 1 physical characteristics analysis 2 data acquisition and 3 data mining this paper is aimed to develop a data mining tool for quantitative assessment of hydrologic restoration rather than hydrologic restoration itself in order to avoid arguments not on the method simple case study was chosen and thus physical characteristics analysis and data acquisition were relatively simple for a given climatic condition rainwater tank size was the only variable to physical characteristics roof runoff was estimated by a simple but widely accepted method and then off site runoff discharge was estimated by continuous estimation at daily time step runoff estimation did not consider maintenance of rainwater harvesting system e g cleaning inside rainwater tank because its maintenance was simple which could be done in a short time without substantiality affecting facility operation in reality however the first two steps can be very complicated in case specific 4 2 application of the proposed method to complicated cases physical characteristics involve land use building design soil texture area shape topography slope drainage network and especially types sizes and layout of lid controls the extent of lid effectiveness depends on physical characteristics at site scale the proposed method can be used to determine how much intervention is needed as in how much lid controls are needed to restore natural hydrology of impervious surface the issue of hydrologic restoration assessment will be more complicated at larger spatial scales that is to say the question becomes how to return the catchment scale hydrology and stream flow regime in urban catchments as close as possible to the natural state this question originates from the hypothesis of restoring stream in urban catchments through implementing lid walsh et al 2005a li et al 2017 have published a detailed review on this topic affirming whether the hypothesis is true remains elusive the proposed method provides an evaluation tool for testing this hypothesis if the dataset that represent sub catchment observation point is located at a discharge outlet of storm sewer or constructed channel or catchment observation point is located in a waterway are available long term datasets are a prerequisite to the proposed method long term data can be used to describe and classify catchments to assess hydrologic effects and to study extreme flow events e g high flows and low flows for the purpose of water resource management hydrologic engineering and environmental flow management li et al 2017 long term data can be obtained by modeling or monitoring studies while they both face challenges monitoring studies can provide real hydrologic information and reveal physical mechanisms that cannot necessarily be simulated through modeling however long term monitoring studies are costly and rare for example walsh et al 2015 conduct an ongoing long term monitoring the little stringybark creek project which took them seven years 2005 2011 to raise sufficient funds to implement the works because long term monitoring data are not available modeling studies are often used to generate long term data all models are a simplification of reality and simulate a limited number of major known processes thus models require calibration and validation which reinforce the needs of monitoring data combined monitoring and modeling study i e using calibrated and validated model is a feasible approach to generate long term data in order to get closer to reality simulation scenarios should include functional decline e g decrease in hydraulic conductivity over time due to clogging in infiltration trenches and porous pavements and maintenance of lid controls e g clogged matrix renewal and sediment cleaning li et al 2017 summarized three main strategies on direct comparison of long term datasets in the literature 1 build a statistical relationship on flow datasets and then use the change in this relationship to reflect the effect of lid 2 compare the datasets without developing any metrics and then infer the likely effect of lid 3 develop a implementation metric to enable specific statistical tests or modeling on the relationship between the implementation of lid controls and observed changes in hydrology different from these strategies the proposed method uses runoff frequency spectrum to present long term data for representing flow regime and breakthroughs the bottleneck of quantification of similarity between runoff frequency spectra it has three advantages as follows 1 measuring the extent of hydrologic restoration at daily temporal resolution 2 finding a trade off between reduction of urban runoff intensity and maintenance of natural runoff frequency and 3 supporting decision making on development and runoff control strategies to restore to the maximum extent technically feasible the natural flow regime advantages are promising suggesting the proposed method could assist in the promotion of runoff frequency spectrum in lid research leading to hydrologic restoration in the urban environment 5 conclusions this paper introduces a new tool for quantitative assessment of hydrologic restoration attributed to lid the method was applied to and illustrated by case study of rainwater harvesting across five climate patterns with annual precipitation from 465 1 to 1807 9 mm y 26 30 years of daily runoff data were obtained by a continuous mass balance simulation at daily time step that considered antecedent rainfall and stochastic end use water demand and predicted the available storage prior to each day and runoff discharge on the day the main conclusions are as follows 1 this study used runoff frequency spectrum or sequence to present years of daily runoff events for representing flow regime the extent of hydrologic restoration was quantified by computing similarity between runoff frequency sequences under undeveloped and developed scenarios s d the difficulty in computing s d was that the sequences had different frequencies and lengths this study proposed a data processing method for frequency alignment to compute s d which was proved to be valid till the length of reference sequence was 28 6 times higher than that of the other one 2 for comparison hydrologic restoration was also measured by similarity between total runoff amounts s t maximum s t 1 was found to be always achievable and only attained by a single rainwater tank size with regard to flow regime the maximum extent of hydrologic restoration was at the range of 0 34 0 78 maximum s d could be achieved by a size range which was larger than that with maximum s t while rainwater harvesting reduced roof runoff intensity total cumulative frequencies of rainwater tank with maximum s d were declined by 59 2 84 3 compared with natural condition 3 the proposed method breakthroughs the bottleneck of quantifying dissimilarity similarity between runoff frequency spectra which is useful in 1 quantifying the extent of hydrologic restoration at daily temporal resolution 2 finding a trade off between reduction of urban runoff intensity and maintenance of natural runoff frequency 3 supporting decision making on development and runoff control

5375,low impact development is to restore natural hydrology in the urban environment thus hydrologic characterization and hydrologic restoration measurement are crucial to low impact development research the present study uses runoff frequency spectrum to present years of daily runoff events for characterizing flow regime and develops a method to quantify similarity between runoff frequency spectra for measuring hydrologic restoration the method was applied to case study of rainwater harvesting of a roof across five climate patterns with annual precipitation from 465 1 to 1807 9 mm y 26 30 years of daily runoff data were obtained by continuous mass balance simulation at daily time step that considered stochastic end use water demand usage of tanks for comparison similarity of total runoff amounts s t and similarity of runoff frequency spectra s d between undeveloped and developed scenarios were computed to measure hydrologic restoration maximum s t 1 was found to be always achievable and only attained by a single rainwater tank size maximum s d 0 34 0 78 which could be achieved by a size range larger than that with s t 1 compared with natural condition total cumulative frequencies of rainwater tank with maximum s d were declined by 59 2 84 3 the proposed method solves the problem of quantitative comparison of runoff frequency spectra with different frequencies and lengths which has advantages of 1 quantifying the extent of hydrologic restoration at daily temporal resolution 2 finding a trade off between reduction of roof runoff intensity and maintenance of natural runoff frequency and 3 supporting decision making on strategies to restore natural flow regime in the urban environment as much as possible keywords urban hydrology low impact development

roads and roofs from 2006 to 2016 for example the impervious surface area in guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area china increased from 12127 69 km2 to 20188 87 km2 with an annual growth rate of 806 12 km2 feng and fan 2018 the hardening destroys natural hydrologic regime promoting flash floods wang et al 2019 and polluted runoff that damage aquatic ecosystem walsh et al 2005b low impact development lid has gain momentum worldwide in efforts to solve these problems lid is to mimic natural hydrology mohurd of china 2015 u s environmental protection agency 2009 u s green building council 2014 through capturing stormwater runoff from impervious surfaces and providing some combination of detention infiltration evapotranspiration and utilization to it bressy et al 2014 davis 2008 2005 fletcher et al 2015 ghadim and hin 2017 gold et al 2018 hamel et al 2013 hunt et al 2008 petrucci et al 2013 petrucci and tassin 2015 walsh et al 2016 2015 2005a therefore the question of how to return hydrology of the impervious surface as close as possible to the natural state is a fundamental issue in lid research while measurement of hydrologic restoration is crucial to finding the answer currently two kinds of data are used to characterize runoff behavior and assess hydrologic restoration short term hydrograph and long term data short term hydrograph is well suited to capture flow changes at a fine temporal resolution and short term data can be easily obtained thus event based metrics derived from a short term hydrograph are popularly used which involve peak flow rate lag time runoff volume runoff coefficient etc damodaram et al 2010 burszta adamiak and mrowiec 2013 qin et al 2013 liao et al 2015 palla and gnecco 2015 wang et al 2018a shortcoming of event based metrics is that they do not take climate uncertainty into consideration effectiveness of lid controls is substantially influenced by uncertain factors such as free storage volume before the rainy day and rainfall over the day yang et al 2015 wang and wang 2018 long term data contain uncertainty but pose more challenges of data mining than short duration data most associated assessment metrics are developed based on annual water balance askarizadeh et al 2015 such as average annual runoff reduction average annual runoff days etc kertesz et al 2014 schifman et al 2018 these annual value based metrics lose the details that long term data actually contain a relatively new approach of assessing hydrologic restoration is to compare runoff frequency spectra between undeveloped and developed scenarios rossman 2013 many years of daily runoff events are generally needed for characterizing the pattern of a catchment s flow quantity frequency and variability that is its flow regime blythe and schmidt 2018 fang and shen 2017 poff et al 1997 runoff frequency spectrum presents many years of daily runoff events which are effective in determining the effect of hydrologic restoration with regard to flow regime wang et al 2018b however there is a lack of an appropriate method for quantitatively comparing runoff frequency spectra which largely limits the usage of runoff frequency spectrum in practical assessment therefore the goals of the present study are 1 to develop a method to quantify similarity between runoff frequency spectra under different development and runoff control scenarios and 2 to use the newly developed method to measure the extent of hydrologic restoration in case study of rainwater harvesting across five climate patterns and to examine features of the method 2 methods and case study 2 1 method development 2 1 1 runoff frequency spectrum in lid design 30 years of daily rainfall data are used to generate daily rainfall depth percentile distribution termed rainfall frequency spectrum for determining design storm hirschman and kosco 2008 u s environmental protection agency 2009 climate models can be used to determine possible changes in the rainfall frequency spectrum to adequately prepare lid installations sylvester et al 2016 runoff frequency spectrum is created in the same way often runoff discharge data are expressed as m3 d they can be divided by the catchment area and expressed as mm d and further rounded to 0 1 decimal place because precision of rainfall and evaporation record are generally limited to 0 1 mm d this processing probably added duplicated daily runoff values runoff frequency density is defined as how many days have runoff discharge equal to a given value for example on x in fig 1 a frequency density was 78 days for the minimum value 0 1 mm d and only one day for the maximum value 147 2 mm d all daily runoff values are sorted from lowest to highest to generate runoff frequency spectrum as shown in fig 1 b in which percentile is a measure at or below which a certain percentage of daily rainfall events lies taking x in fig 1 b for example 18 8 mm d corresponds to the 90th percentile runoff event which means 18 8 mm d is greater than 90 of all runoff values on x axis percentiles of x and y respectively range from 8 86 to 100 and 0 88 100 which do not reveal the difference in frequency thus percentile is replaced by cumulative exceedance frequency as shown in fig 1 c in which cumulative frequency means how many times per year on average a given daily value is exceeded on x axis cumulative frequencies of x and y respectively range from 0 037 32 59 and 0 037 16 85 d y which reveal the difference in frequency however the numbers descending on x axis is abnormal to the habit of expression to make the plot easier to interpret fig 1 d is obtained by rotating fig 1 c 90 degrees clockwise and using logarithmic coordinates on y axis fig 1 b c and d are different forms of runoff frequency spectrums the present study uses fig 1 d to refer to runoff frequency spectrum it can be simply generated by ordering daily runoff values from highest to lowest and then counting how many days have runoff higher than a given value without through fig 1 b and c runoff frequency spectrum presents the complete range of daily runoff events in an ordered arrangement of cumulative frequency representing flow regime 2 1 2 computation of runoff frequency sequences similarity if x and y respectively denote undeveloped or restoration objective and developed scenarios the similarity between x and y is a metric measuring hydrologic restoration usually hydrologic frequency spectra are plotted into curves in that way the similarity between x and y is the similarity between the curves in fact line segments connecting the points do not exist which will introduce errors to similarity the similarity between x and y is the similarity between the two series of data points thus x and y in fig 1 d are expressed as follows 1 x x 1 t x i t x n t 2 y y 1 t y i t y m t where x and y are daily values mm d from highest to lowest subscript denotes cumulative frequency n and m represent total days with runoff d and t is the number of years analyzed y such sequence is termed runoff frequency sequence n t and m t are total cumulative frequency which is defined as sequence length for example sequence lengths of x and y in fig 1 d were 32 59 and 16 85 d y respectively runoff frequency spectra similarity is equal to runoff frequency sequences similarity the difficulty in quantifying runoff frequency sequences similarity is that the values in x and y often correspond to different frequencies and lengths which means x and y are not directly comparable this study first proposes a method of frequency alignment to align runoff values in x and y to the same frequency positions and then computes similarity between the aligned x and y the method is decomposed into 5 steps as follows 1 sequence y alignment the match function in microsoft excel is used for each frequency in y to search exact match in most case or next smallest frequency in x as the frequency position to be aligned then the values with the same frequency position to be aligned are merged into a new value by using weighted average method the weight is frequency density i e duplicated days frequency density of the new value is the sum of frequency density of the merged values as a result the length of the aligned y remains unchanged m t 2 sequence x alignment after step 1 all frequencies in the aligned y can be found in x however there may be redundant frequencies in x that do not exist in the aligned y thus the same alignment procedure is used to align frequencies in x to exact match or next smallest frequency position in the aligned y the part of x that exceeds the length of the aligned y is retained directly these directly retained frequencies can be considered to also exist in the aligned y while corresponding runoff values are all zero after the two steps the aligned x and y have the same frequencies and length 3 dissimilarity of comparable pair runoff values from the aligned x and y with the same frequency position are termed a comparable pair which are directly compared absolute dissimilarity y i t x i t and relative dissimilarity y i t x i t x i t 4 dissimilarity of x and y weighted average of relative dissimilarities of all comparable pairs is defined as runoff frequency sequences dissimilarity the weight is calculated based on the aligned x it is equal to the ratio of runoff amount at a given frequency to total amount of runoff w e i g h t d a i l y r u n o f f v a l u e d u p l i c a t e d d a y s t o t a l a m o u n t o f r u n o f f the weight determines the contribution of dissimilarity of a comparable pair to the sequences dissimilarity 5 similarity of x and y dissimilarity is opposite to similarity thus similarity of x and y formulates as follows 3 s d 1 r u n o f f f r e q u e n c y s e q u e n c e s d i s s i m i l a r i t y where s d is runoff frequency sequences similarity the closer to 1 the s d the more similar the two sequences s d 1 means that the two sequences are exactly the same note x is a reference sequence and y is the one to be compared if there are more than two sequences to compare together x should be the longest one this is because step 3 needs runoff values from x to be denominators and step 4 needs x to compute the weights the longest x ensures that denominators in step 3 are always greater than zero and the weights obtained from step 4 are the same for all sequences to be compared 2 1 3 computation examples a microsoft excel worksheet illustrating the above 5 steps can be seen in appendix b which computes the similarity between x and y in fig 1 the results are shown in fig 2 a as cumulative frequency increases absolute dissimilarity consequently decreases while relative dissimilarity initially increases then decreases increases again and finally maintains at one when relative dissimilarity is equal to 1 runoff values are zero in y while greater than zero in x the weight of relative dissimilarity generally decreases with the increase of cumulative frequency fig 2 b two examples are presented herein to explain how the weights influence sequences dissimilarity in fig 2 a at leftmost point on orange curve cumulative frequency is minimum 0 037 d y and its relative dissimilarity is 0 26 runoff value in x corresponding to this point reaches maximum 147 2 mm d with frequency density being one day thus its weight is 0 0216 and its weighted relative dissimilarity is 0 26 0 0216 0 0057 at the rightmost point on orange curve cumulative frequency is maximum 32 59 d y and its relative dissimilarity is 1 runoff value in x corresponding to this point is minimum 0 1 mm d with frequency density being 78 days thus its weight is 0 0011 and its weighted relative dissimilarity is 0 0011 1 0 0011 the sum of weighted relative dissimilarities at all frequencies is 0 48 the runoff frequency sequences similarity is accordingly 1 0 48 0 52 2 2 case study this study chose rainwater harvesting for case study to test and examine the proposed method the study catchment was a roof of 5500 m2 located in nanchang china rainwater running off the roof was harvested and stored in a tank for adjacent lawn irrigation and ground cleaning rather than directly allowing it to off site discharge thus runoff discharge of the roof depended on discharge of the rainwater tank both lawn and ground area were two times of roof area the proposed method was used to measure the extent to which rainwater harvesting returned hydrology of the roof area to natural state and to determine optimal size of rainwater tank 2 2 1 climate conditions in order to understand the effect of climatic condition on hydrologic restoration the study site was assumed to be also located in other four cities in china map can be seen in appendix fig a 1 that is to say hydrologic restoration of the roof was assessed under five climatic conditions the five cities were nominated to represent 5 climate patterns urumqi temperate continental climate kunming subtropical plateau monsoon climate shanghai subtropical monsoon climate nanchang subtropical monsoon humid climate and haikou tropical monsoon climate we collected 26 30 years of daily precipitation and evaporation data from china meteorological data service center table 1 for different cities the ranges of mean precipitation and mean evaporation were 465 1 1807 9 and 954 9 1313 3 mm y respectively among the five climates urumqi climate had the driest climate with the least precipitation and its evaporation being 2 38 times higher than its precipitation for the same city precipitation and evaporation annually varied the maximum annual precipitation was 1 90 2 67 times higher than the minimum and the highest annual evaporation was 1 42 2 24 times greater than the lowest one regional disparity and fluctuation of climatic conditions over time suggested contrastive and uncertainty analysis to be highly essential 2 2 2 estimation of roof runoff this study used a widely accepted method to estimate roof runoff in order to avoid arguments on data acquisition rather than the proposed method itself runoff curve number cn method is often used to estimate direct runoff from storm rainfall in small watersheds u s department of agriculture 1986 and it is introduced by national engineering handbook u s department of agriculture 2004 the method has an advantage over runoff coefficient method of variable rainfall runoff ratios that can estimate runoff from a wide range of rainfall events rather than a single design storm formulae of cn method and graphical solution can be seen in appendix eq a 1 eq a 2 and fig a 2 it uses cn to reflect the synthesized effect of soil texture cover type land treatment and other hydrologic conditions which is divided into four hydrologic soil groups hsg a b c and d as shown in table 2 under undeveloped scenario the catchment had soil texture belonged to hsg d cn 84 while under developed scenario it was a roof with cn 98 hsg c b and a cn 79 69 and 49 respectively were taken into account as well in order to compare runoff behaviors between different natural conditions 2 2 3 estimation of off site runoff discharge estimation of off site runoff discharge of rainwater tank consisted of three parts collected roof runoff end use water demand and off site runoff discharge fig 3 the framework included a continuous mass balance simulation at daily time step that considered antecedent rainfall and stochastic end use water demand usage of tanks and predicted the available storage prior to each storm event and following runoff discharge the estimation is briefly introduced as follows details of the algorithms can be seen in appendix a 1 1 collected roof runoff the roof got dust dirt and debris from the environment over time since the first roof runoff carried most of the dirt a first flush device was used to divert it away from the storage tank the remaining was collected roof runoff going straight to the rainwater tank 2 water demand collected roof runoff was used to meet non potable water demands ground cleaning and lawn irrigation they are very common usages of harvested rainwater ground cleaning consumed 2 mm water m2 every time and twice in a month lawn irrigation was automatic and its water consumption was unfixed when evaporation was greater than precipitation irrigation was started automatically to supply the evaporation 3 off site runoff discharge because collected roof runoff and water demand daily varied volume of roof runoff stored in storage tank roof runoff reused and off site runoff discharge i e overflow from the tank consequently varied every day as well the three parts were continuously computed at daily time step over 26 30 years i e 9490 10950 days of historical precipitation and evaporation records in order to improve computing efficiency the present study coded the algorithms and executed the computation by using microsoft excel 2 2 4 assessment scenarios and metrics since the study site located in nanchang was assumed to be also located in other four cities assessment scenarios involved three variables climatic condition development state undeveloped or developed and rainwater tank size for a given location runoff were estimated based on the same meteorological input thus runoff results represented undeveloped and developed scenarios rather than before and after development stages four assessment metrics were proposed to assess hydrologic restoration and techno economic rationality as follows 1 runoff frequency spectra similarity this metric is s d as given by eq 3 it was used to measure hydrologic restoration at daily time resolution 2 total amount similarity 4 s t 1 i 1 m d i f r o o f i 1 n d i f r o o f i 1 n d i f r o o f where s t is total amount similarity i 1 m d i f r o o f represents total runoff amount of sequence y or developed scenario mm y i 1 n d i f r o o f denotes total runoff amount of sequence x or undeveloped scenario mm y s t 1 means that total amounts of the two scenarios are exactly the same s t was used to measure hydrologic restoration with regard to total runoff amounts 3 capture ratio of total rainfall 5 α 1 i 1 t d i f r o o f i 1 t p i where α is capture ratio of total rainfall t denotes total days analyzed d i 1 t d i f r o o f represents total runoff amount mm i 1 t p i is total rainfall amount mm α can be also calculated by average annual runoff total runoff amount divided by the number of years and average annual rainfall total rainfall amount divided by the number of years and the result will not change α was used to assess the efficiency of the site in retaining rainwater 4 average annual utilization of rainwater tank 6 β i 1 t w i t v where β represents average annual utilization rate of rainwater tank y i 1 t w i t is average annual volume of reused roof runoff m3 y and v denotes volume of storage tank m3 β was used to assess techno economic rationality of the rainwater tank 3 results 3 1 runoff frequency spectrum reveals detail information typical runoff frequency spectra are shown in fig 4 which visually present different long term datasets by intensity frequency distributions for undeveloped condition orange curve maximum runoff intensity was 147 2 mm d and total cumulative frequency was 32 59 d y as the catchment became a roof without rainwater harvesting grey curve maximum runoff intensity was 189 2 mm d and total cumulative frequency was 85 15 d y grey curve was on the right of orange curve indicating that the hardening significantly increased runoff intensity and frequency with the increase of the volume of rainwater tank runoff frequency spectra moved left and became short for simplification cumulative frequency of 0 3 d y was referred to low frequency that ranged from 0 3 to 6 d y was referred to mid frequency and the rest of 6 d y was referred to high frequency when the volume of rainwater tank reached 47 m3 yellow curve runoff intensities at most frequencies were still larger than natural condition however its total cumulative frequency 27 63 d y became less than natural condition when the volume of rainwater tank reached 238 m3 blue curve mid frequency runoff was close to natural condition whereas total cumulative frequency decreased to 9 66 d y high frequency runoff was significantly attenuated compared with natural condition when the volume of rainwater tank reached 598 m3 green curve low frequency runoff was close to natural condition while mid frequency runoff was smaller than natural condition and high frequency runoff was substantially eliminated total cumulative frequency decreased to 3 22 d y and the smallest daily runoff value increased to 0 5 mm d once the volume of rainwater tank reached 801 m3 purple curve runoff were smaller than natural condition at almost all frequencies and total cumulative frequency was only 2 37 d y indicating that surface runoff discharge was seriously insufficient compared with natural condition 3 2 similarity metrics measure hydrologic restoration and determine optimal size as shown in fig 4 hydrologic restoration effects were different between different frequencies optimal rainwater tank size needs a trade off between these effects both total amount similarity s t and runoff frequency spectra similarity s d are the options for determining the optimal size fig 5 compares the two metrics under different climates and lid scenarios with the increase of rainwater tank size utilization rate of rainwater tank β decreased monotonically while both s t and s d increased first and then decreased maximum s t 1 was found to be always achievable and only attained by a single rainwater tank size this can be explained by fig 5 f capture ratios of annual rainfall α of undeveloped scenarios were as follows 97 1 urumqi 84 3 kunming 79 5 shanghai 76 3 nanchang and 66 8 haikou with the increase of size of rainwater tank α rose monotonically and went beyond the reference values of undeveloped scenarios because there was only one crossover point of the rising curve and the reference s t 1 was achievable and it was only attained by a single tank size s t 1 indicates natural hydrology with regard to total runoff amount could be restored unlike s t maximum values of s d were 0 78 haikou 0 69 nanchang 0 66 shanghai 0 73 kunming and 0 34 urumqi respectively which means the maximum extent of hydrologic restoration in terms of flow regime was 0 34 0 78 besides the maximum s d could be achieved by a range of tank size for instances under haikou climate maximum s d value was corresponded to tank size of 296 358 m3 and β of 10 39 11 68 y under shanghai climate maximum s d value was corresponded to tank size of 238 288 m3 and β of 9 39 10 69 y of course the smallest size in the range had better techno economic performance the smallest size with maximum s d was larger than the size with maximum s t they were respectively as follows 111 1 versus 92 4 m3 urumqi 267 4 versus 214 5 m3 kunming 238 0 versus 201 4 shanghai 453 5 versus 322 1 m3 nanchang and 296 0 versus 279 4 m3 haikou this can be explained by fig 2 b s t 1 was fulfilled through retaining high and mid frequency small and midsize roof runoff which were corresponded to relatively small weights in calculating s d therefore the tank size with s t 1 was smaller than the size with maximum s d 3 3 how maximum s d was attained the proposed method considered both greater and less than natural condition as dissimilarity calculation of dissimilarity returned absolute value negative value was converted to positive one and positive value was unaffected therefore two very different volumes of tank could achieve the same s d fig 5 appendix fig a 3 shows three examples of runoff frequency spectra of rainwater tanks corresponding to the same s d value while with two different tank volumes they were respectively on the left and right sides of natural reference spectrum the one on the right side revealed that the tank was undersized for reducing roof runoff intensity while that was on the left side indicated that the tank was oversized for maintaining natural runoff discharge runoff frequency spectra of rainwater tank with the maximum s d are depicted in fig 6 runoff frequency spectra of undeveloped scenario were remarkable different under different climates orange curves because in the assessment undeveloped sites were the same under the five climates the difference shows the effect of climatic condition on natural runoff flow regime blue curves show runoff frequency spectra of the smallest tanks with maximum s d generally the optimal rainwater tank was suited to retain mid frequency midsize runoff whereas it was undersized for low frequency large runoff and oversized for high frequency small runoff it was inevitable for a rainwater tank with fixed volume to reduce or eliminate small runoff therefore the maximum s d represents a trade off between reduction of roof runoff intensity and maintenance of natural runoff frequency compared with natural flow regime total cumulative frequencies i e days with runoff per year with maximum s d declined by 59 2 haikou 69 4 nanchang 70 3 shanghai 68 7 kunming and 84 3 urumqi under urumqi climate maximum s d was the lowest 0 34 and runoff frequency decline was the most 84 3 indicating that it was the most difficult for rainwater harvesting to restore natural flow regime under the driest climate 3 4 validity and applicable range of the proposed method because s t was computed without any data processing its validity was self evident validity of the proposed method was examined by observing relationship between s d and s t as shown in fig 4 when rainwater tanks were too small e g yellow curve or too big e g purple curve the trade off between different lid effects did not matter under the circumstances s d was close to s t fig 5 this study also computed s d between other natural conditions cn 49 69 and 79 and the reference condition cn 84 with the decrease of cn frequency and intensity of runoff simultaneously decreased as a result the frequency spectra did not cross and the trade off was not therefore required appendix fig a 4 under these circumstances s d value was equal to s t value regardless of climatic conditions appendix fig a 5 s d value was found to be close or equal to s t under these circumstances indirectly proved validity of the proposed method the proposed method was valid till the length of reference sequence was 28 6 times higher than that of the compared one as shown in fig 5 with the increase of size of rainwater tank s d initially increased and then decreased there was only one exception in the trend under urumqi climate as illustrated in fig 5 e the next rightmost point was tank size 167 8 m3 s d 0 13 and the rightmost point was 193 8 m3 0 14 as size of tank increased from 167 8 to 193 8 m3 s d did not decrease while slightly increased as mentioned earlier under urumqi climate the decline of total cumulative frequency caused by rainwater harvesting was the most as the volume of rainwater tank reached 167 8 m3 the frequency sequence consisted of only 8 values and hence the length of reference sequence was 28 6 times higher than its length as the size of rainwater tank reached 193 8 m3 the frequency sequence consisted of 4 values and the length of reference sequence was therefore 57 6 times higher than its length appendix fig a 6 this countertrend indicated that the rightmost point was beyond applicable range of the method nevertheless 28 6 times of difference have covered most circumstances 4 discussion 4 1 limitation of the present case study for a given study area with a given climatic condition quantitative assessment of hydrologic restoration can be divided into three steps 1 physical characteristics analysis 2 data acquisition and 3 data mining this paper is aimed to develop a data mining tool for quantitative assessment of hydrologic restoration rather than hydrologic restoration itself in order to avoid arguments not on the method simple case study was chosen and thus physical characteristics analysis and data acquisition were relatively simple for a given climatic condition rainwater tank size was the only variable to physical characteristics roof runoff was estimated by a simple but widely accepted method and then off site runoff discharge was estimated by continuous estimation at daily time step runoff estimation did not consider maintenance of rainwater harvesting system e g cleaning inside rainwater tank because its maintenance was simple which could be done in a short time without substantiality affecting facility operation in reality however the first two steps can be very complicated in case specific 4 2 application of the proposed method to complicated cases physical characteristics involve land use building design soil texture area shape topography slope drainage network and especially types sizes and layout of lid controls the extent of lid effectiveness depends on physical characteristics at site scale the proposed method can be used to determine how much intervention is needed as in how much lid controls are needed to restore natural hydrology of impervious surface the issue of hydrologic restoration assessment will be more complicated at larger spatial scales that is to say the question becomes how to return the catchment scale hydrology and stream flow regime in urban catchments as close as possible to the natural state this question originates from the hypothesis of restoring stream in urban catchments through implementing lid walsh et al 2005a li et al 2017 have published a detailed review on this topic affirming whether the hypothesis is true remains elusive the proposed method provides an evaluation tool for testing this hypothesis if the dataset that represent sub catchment observation point is located at a discharge outlet of storm sewer or constructed channel or catchment observation point is located in a waterway are available long term datasets are a prerequisite to the proposed method long term data can be used to describe and classify catchments to assess hydrologic effects and to study extreme flow events e g high flows and low flows for the purpose of water resource management hydrologic engineering and environmental flow management li et al 2017 long term data can be obtained by modeling or monitoring studies while they both face challenges monitoring studies can provide real hydrologic information and reveal physical mechanisms that cannot necessarily be simulated through modeling however long term monitoring studies are costly and rare for example walsh et al 2015 conduct an ongoing long term monitoring the little stringybark creek project which took them seven years 2005 2011 to raise sufficient funds to implement the works because long term monitoring data are not available modeling studies are often used to generate long term data all models are a simplification of reality and simulate a limited number of major known processes thus models require calibration and validation which reinforce the needs of monitoring data combined monitoring and modeling study i e using calibrated and validated model is a feasible approach to generate long term data in order to get closer to reality simulation scenarios should include functional decline e g decrease in hydraulic conductivity over time due to clogging in infiltration trenches and porous pavements and maintenance of lid controls e g clogged matrix renewal and sediment cleaning li et al 2017 summarized three main strategies on direct comparison of long term datasets in the literature 1 build a statistical relationship on flow datasets and then use the change in this relationship to reflect the effect of lid 2 compare the datasets without developing any metrics and then infer the likely effect of lid 3 develop a implementation metric to enable specific statistical tests or modeling on the relationship between the implementation of lid controls and observed changes in hydrology different from these strategies the proposed method uses runoff frequency spectrum to present long term data for representing flow regime and breakthroughs the bottleneck of quantification of similarity between runoff frequency spectra it has three advantages as follows 1 measuring the extent of hydrologic restoration at daily temporal resolution 2 finding a trade off between reduction of urban runoff intensity and maintenance of natural runoff frequency and 3 supporting decision making on development and runoff control strategies to restore to the maximum extent technically feasible the natural flow regime advantages are promising suggesting the proposed method could assist in the promotion of runoff frequency spectrum in lid research leading to hydrologic restoration in the urban environment 5 conclusions this paper introduces a new tool for quantitative assessment of hydrologic restoration attributed to lid the method was applied to and illustrated by case study of rainwater harvesting across five climate patterns with annual precipitation from 465 1 to 1807 9 mm y 26 30 years of daily runoff data were obtained by a continuous mass balance simulation at daily time step that considered antecedent rainfall and stochastic end use water demand and predicted the available storage prior to each day and runoff discharge on the day the main conclusions are as follows 1 this study used runoff frequency spectrum or sequence to present years of daily runoff events for representing flow regime the extent of hydrologic restoration was quantified by computing similarity between runoff frequency sequences under undeveloped and developed scenarios s d the difficulty in computing s d was that the sequences had different frequencies and lengths this study proposed a data processing method for frequency alignment to compute s d which was proved to be valid till the length of reference sequence was 28 6 times higher than that of the other one 2 for comparison hydrologic restoration was also measured by similarity between total runoff amounts s t maximum s t 1 was found to be always achievable and only attained by a single rainwater tank size with regard to flow regime the maximum extent of hydrologic restoration was at the range of 0 34 0 78 maximum s d could be achieved by a size range which was larger than that with maximum s t while rainwater harvesting reduced roof runoff intensity total cumulative frequencies of rainwater tank with maximum s d were declined by 59 2 84 3 compared with natural condition 3 the proposed method breakthroughs the bottleneck of quantifying dissimilarity similarity between runoff frequency spectra which is useful in 1 quantifying the extent of hydrologic restoration at daily temporal resolution 2 finding a trade off between reduction of urban runoff intensity and maintenance of natural runoff frequency 3 supporting decision making on development and runoff control

5376,how urbanization associated land use land cover change lulcc affects the ecohydrological cycle through altering evapotranspiration et processes is not clear for rice paddy dominated watersheds the purpose of this study was to understand long term 2000 2013 spatial and temporal variations of et over the qinhuai river basin in a humid region southern china we revised the soil and water assessment tool swat by incorporating new algorithms describing hydrological processes of rice paddies using the improved swat model driven by remote sensing derived lulcc and local climatic data we separated the effects of lulcc on et from climate at the watershed scale we showed that the modified swat model significantly improved monthly streamflow estimates the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse was 0 86 and coefficient of determination r 2 was 0 88 for the calibration period 1990 1994 while the nse was 0 65 and r 2 was 0 71 for the validation period 1995 1999 we also found good agreements between modelled daily et and lysimeter based measurements for an experimental rice paddy field r 2 0 75 p less than 0 01 for areas with little land cover change et rates increased over time due to the increase in potential et pet during 2000 2013 however the contribution from rice paddy to the watershed level et decreased over time coincident with a period of rapid urbanization and loss of rice paddy field dynamic attribution analysis indicated that the negative contribution of lulcc to change in et increased from 53 in 2000 to 61 in 2013 while the positive contribution of climate variability decreased from 47 in 2000 to 39 in 2013 we concluded that factors affecting et varied with spatial scale conversion of rice paddy field to urban use directly resulted in significant et reduction at the watershed scale despite the rise in the air temperature and potential et in the study region the improved swat model provides a better integrated method for understanding et processes and assessing the impacts of environmental change on ecosystem services in a rapidly urbanizing region keywords urbanization associated land cover change climate warming swat model ecohydrological processes rice paddy watershed 1 introduction urbanization and associated land use and land cover change lulcc has been widely recognized to have negative influences on ecosystems by altering watershed hydrology paul and meyer 2011 sun and lockaby 2012 lulcc and associated anthropogenic activities cause losses of ecosystem functions fan et al 2016 through altering flood frequency brath et al 2006 crooks and davies 2001 gao and sang 2017 and seasonal streamflow patterns guo et al 2008 impairing water quality sun and lockaby 2012 and aggravating urban heat island hao et al 2015a zhao et al 2014 and urban dry island hao et al 2018 climate change is also becoming a major threat to natural resources such as water supply and crop production in many parts of the world piao et al 2010 kim et al 2015 cao et al 2011 martin et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a b for example the average air temperature in china has increased gao et al 2002 and precipitation significantly increased in southern china affecting regional evaporation and transpiration rates merritt et al 2006 however the regional hydrologic impacts of climate variability may be completely different those from lulcc due to the contrasting underlying physical and biological processes martin et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zhao et al 2020a b separating the individual effects of climate change and land use land cover change is not only essential for interpreting ecohydrological change and its drivers eum et al 2016 but also for watershed management decision making rice paddy field a major land use for agricultural food production in southern china provides similar ecosystem service benefits like other wetlands such as water quality improvement kang et al 2006 and climate moderation hao et al 2015a hao et al 2018 however growing rice consumes a large amount of water due to its irrigation needs thus converting rice paddy to urban uses in the process of urbanization is projected to have profound impacts on the watershed hydrological cycle hao et al 2015a our previous study hao et al 2015a found that urbanization and climate warming qin et al 2019 in a rapidly urbanizing rice paddy dominated watershed in eastern china collectively elevated streamflow by 58 due to a decrease in et by 23 during 1986 2013 however we know little about the effects of individual and combined changes in lulcc and climate change on watershed hydrological processes due to the complexity of rice paddy management in watersheds with mixed land uses amid climate change hao et al 2015a hydrological response to disturbances is scale dependent a watershed modelling study in a rice paddy dominated region in southern china suggests that converting rice paddies to urban area reduces overall water consumption tsai 2002 the hydrological processes of rice paddy dominated watersheds are extremely complex due to the mixed compositions of lulcc for example xu et al 2017 found that simulated et by the traditional penman monteith model for rice paddy overestimated or underestimated et because of large daily variations in net radiation soil heat flux and soil moisture in kunshan region of china the dominated controlling factors for et vary across spatial scales mauser and schädlich 1998 xu and yang 2010 cristiano et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 amatya et al 2014 suggest that soil plant type and regional weather conditions are important for explaining et response to land management at a landscape scale while et is dominated by climatic conditions at a regional scale similarly zhou et al 2013 concludes that et is controlled by water availability at a plot scale but is sensitive to energy available as well as surface temperature at a regional scale process based simulation models are useful tools to quantify the influence of climate e g precipitation relative humidity temperature and radiation and human activities e g irrigation urbanization and drainage operations on watershed hydrology xie and cui 2011 du et al 2012 hao et al 2015b among many existing hydrological models the soil water assessment tool swat has been widely used because of its versatility and open sources sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a b wu et al 2016 swat as a process based watershed model describes the essential hydrological processes and is capable for assessing the impacts of agricultural practices on water quality providing an effective tool for environmental assessment and watershed management fan et al 2016 laurent and ruelland 2011 however swat has not been applied widely in modelling hydrological processes in rice paddy dominated watersheds previous modification of the swat model simply treats rice field as a pothole or an impoundment the original pothole module in swat assumes that the water surface evaporation is actual et in rice field sakaguchi et al 2014 developed a modified paddy module in swat and modelled the hydrological processes in a 3 km2 paddy field xie and cui 2011 incorporated a new irrigation scheme to swat for simulating streamflow in zhanghe irrigation district of southern china kang et al 2006 incorporated the total maximum daily load system within the swat model to evaluate water balance and water quality in irrigated rice paddy region in south korea however these studies rarely examined model performance in modelling et a major hydrological component in a humid region and one of the most uncertain hydrologic variables that plays a key role in determining watershed water balance assessing effects of lulcc on local and climate scheduling agricultural irrigation aouissi et al 2016 abdullah et al 2014 chirouze et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 liu et al 2017a and assessing climate change impacts falamarzi et al 2014 shiri et al 2012 wang and liang 2008 we chose the qinhuai river basin qrb for this case study to understand hydrological response et in particular to urbanization and climate change at spatial multiple scales the qrb represents a typical watershed on the yangtze river delta yrd one of the most developed and highly populated regions in china hao et al 2018 the region is facing serious environmental challenges such as flood risk and water quality deterioration zhou et al 2013 local climate change such as urban heat islands uhis hao et al 2015a and urban dry islands udi hao et al 2018 and global warming gu et al 2011 understanding the impacts of climate change and lulcc on watershed hydrology is essential to mitigating global climate change and local lulcc and most importantly offering scientific principles to guide watershed ecosystem restoration efforts zhou et al 2013 chien et al 2013 we hypothesized that the dominated driving factors for et change varied across spatial scales and lulcc was the main cause of et reduction in the study basin the overall goal of this modelling study was to understand the individual and combined impacts of lulcc and climate change on ecohydrological processes et in particular the specific objectives were 1 to modify calibrate and validate an improved swat model for estimating et at different temporal and spatial scales 2 to examine the response of et to disturbance by land cover type and 3 to quantify the individual contributions of climate and lulcc to et variations over a 14 year period at a watershed scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qrb one of the tributaries of the yangtze river covers most of the administrative area of nanjing city the capital of jiangsu province 118 39 119 21 e longitudes and 31 30 32 10 n latitudes fig 1 as a highly human impacted watershed the qrb has two main flow outlets wuding and inner qinhuai sluice gates flat topography characterizes most part of the watershed except the northeast the basin has an area of approximately 2 631 km2 with an elevation ranging from 0 to 410 m the study region is dominated by the east asia summer monsoon climate gu et al 2011 with an average annual temperature and total precipitation of 15 4 c and 1116 mm respectively the qrb has experienced global warming with mean air temperature increased at a rate of 0 44 c per decade and thus an increasing evaporative potential during the past two decades hao et al 2015a nearly 75 of the annual precipitation falls during april to october as the rainy season the dominant land cover type in this watershed is rice paddy rice followed by urban area urhd water body watr forests frst and dry agricultural land agrc the qrb has experienced a rapid urbanization since 2002 hao et al 2015a at the expense of rice paddies and other land types du et al 2013 during the past decade the area of rice paddies has significantly reduced by 7 6 followed by agricultural land 2 4 water body 0 6 and forests 0 5 in contrast to the notable increase in urban area of 11 3 2 2 swat model the swat model was selected in this study for assessing the hydrological impacts of lulcc and climate change and variability on watershed qrb et for three different periods 2000 2003 2004 2008 2009 2013 our previous empirical studies indicated that the qrb had been significantly impacted by urbanization and climate change in both hydrology i e streamflow and et and local meteorology hao et al 2015a qin et al 2019 hao et al 2018 the swat model is a semi distributed continuous hydrologic model operated in a geographic information system gis environment arnold et al 2012 the entire watershed simulation domain is divided into sub basins which are further subdivided into uniform hydrological response units hrus with homogeneous soil land cover and slope characteristics about 300 hrus in 54 sub basins were used in the present study simulations of hydrological processes such as et and percolation occur at the hrus level arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 the model parameters are distributed across hrus and are finalized during model calibration and validation by comparing simulated and measured hydrologic fluxes including both streamflow and et in this study we use the scs method and penman monteith equation for estimating surface runoff and pet respectively for estimating total actual et at the hrus level swat first calculates plant canopy interception then simulates the maximum amount of transpiration and soil evaporation and computes the actual soil evaporation last 2 3 improved swat model the original swat model treats a rice paddy as an impounded area xie and cui 2011 in this study to represent flow patterns of a rice paddy landscape we modified the swat wetland pothole module that is originally introduced by sakaguchi et al 2014 and xie and cui 2011 additional modifications to swat include algorithms for estimating wetland surface area irrigation schedules and the evaporation process of pothole fig 2 more supporting information see appendix a figs a 1 a 3 2 3 1 calculation of the surface area of rice paddy field the surface area sa of the original pothole module is computed as a cone shaped wetland which varies with the volume of water stored in the impoundment the improved rice paddy model assumes that the surface area of rice paddy in the pothole module as a cuboid shape according to sakaguchi et al 2014 thus the surface area of water would not decrease with the decrease of water level the equation of the surface area has been changed as follows 1 s a a h r u s a a h r u where ahru is the surface area of the hru ha dominated by rice paddies 2 3 2 irrigation algorithms the actual amount of irrigation is difficult to estimate since the timing of irrigation operations is often irregular thus the original pothole module assumes enough water for irrigation without considering unused water therefore this algorithm does not reflect the reality of the irrigation system in the study area when the water storage in paddy field reaches its maximum after irrigation the irrigation water becomes overflow therefore this study assumes that the daily water need of irrigation by a rice paddy is equal to the rate of flow in the irrigation canal the improved model for rice paddy field takes unused water into account by adding an irrigation formula preventing irrigation water overflowing the modelled impoundment 2 i f v pot i r r v mxpot irr pot v mxpot v pot 3 if v pot i r r v mxpot i r r pot i r r where irrpot is the amount of water added to the impoundment on a given day m3 vpot is the current volume of water stored in the impoundment m3 vmxpot is the maximum volume of water which can be stored in the impoundment m3 irr is the amount of water added through an irrigation operation on a given day m3 accordingly the drainage process has been modified as 4 i f v pot i r r v mxpot q out q surf v pot i r r v mxpot 10 a hru 5 if v pot i r r v mxpot q out q surf where qout is the volume of water flowing out of a hru to the main channel on a given day mm qsurf is the volume of the surface runoff released from a hru to the main channel which does not include the irrigation water overflow from the impoundment on a given day mm 2 3 3 water evaporation algorithms for modelling et for rice paddies we adopted findings from miyazaki et al 2005 and sakaguchi et al 2014 that water evaporation is limited when leaf area index lai of rice crop exceeds 4 0 in this case more than 90 of the total et is transpiration for rice paddy this model modification ensures that rice transpiration depends on lai and dominates et in addition the evaporation coefficient η was introduced to estimate actual water evaporation based on pet thus the et equations were modified as 6 iflai 4 q u o t e v e v a p 10 η 1 l a i 4 p e t s a i f l a i 4 v e v a p 10 η 1 l a i 4 p e t s a i f l a i 4 7 iflai 4 q u o t e v e v a p 0 i f l a i 4 v e v a p 0 i f l a i 4 where vevap is the volume of water removed from the water body by evaporation per day m3 pet is the daily potential evapotranspiration mm in this study we set η as 0 6 based on the evaporation process of the rice paddies neitsch et al 2002 2 4 model input data the data required to run swat consist of digital elevation model dem land cover soil and daily meteorological data e g precipitation relative air humidity maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and near surface wind speed the 30 m 30 m resolution dem was obtained from the international scientific data platform of the chinese academy of sciences we examined land use data for three distinct periods of 2000 2004 and 2011 these spatial data were derived from landsat thematic mapper tm and etm images with a 30 m 30 m pixel resolution http glovis usgs gov fig 3 the digital soil data at a 1 5 000 000 scale from the harmonized world soil database hwsd updated by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations and the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa were used to extract soil information the daily meteorological data for 27 years 1987 2013 were acquired from weather stations in or near qrb and were interpolated to the dem grids 2 5 parametrization for reservoir and irrigation management swat provides several options related to water management practices that allow users to choose based on data availability such as irrigation tile drainage and consumptive water use water for irrigation in a hru is obtained from one of the five main water sources river reach reservoir shallow aquifer deep aquifer or a source outside the watershed reservoirs are impoundments located on the main channel network of the watershed in this study we added five reservoirs based on the reservoir information obtained from nanjing water resources bureau table 1 for rice paddy phonology we set jun 16th as the beginning day of the growing season october 20th as the harvest day in addition november 2nd was set as the planting day and may 20th as the harvest day of winter wheat rotation in the following year the parameters for rice paddy irrigation operations were derived from local knowledge hao et al 2015b huang et al 2015 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2006 and the irrigation dates are listed in table 2 more information see appendix b table b 1 2 6 model performance evaluation and uncertainty analysis actual et rates for a rice paddy field were measured by a weighing lysimeter at a research site with an area of 300 km2 managed by the agro meteorological experimental station 32 21 n 118 71 e on the nanjing university of information science and technology nuist campus about 10 km from the qrb the measurement period spanned from july 1st to november 2ndin 2007 the weather conditions at the nuist station are similar to the lishui research station dominated by rice paddy fields in the qrb therefore the measured lysimeter et rates were used to validate the simulated et for rice paddy land covers the precision of the et measurements was estimated to be 0 1 mm day 1 the effective et area of the lysimeter was 4 0 m2 measured et data in heavy rainy days were removed from the data sets due to potential estimation errors of the lysimeter method we used the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 based on swat cup for parameter calibration and uncertainty analysis a total of 10 parameters were chosen for calibration according to the sensitivity analysis method output uncertainty was calculated by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu which was defined as the interval between 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of simulated results zhao et al 2015 the parameter uncertainty is one of the major sources of simulation uncertainty in modelling studies zhang et al 2014 two variables p factor and r factor were applied for defining parameter uncertainty the p factor was the percentage of observed data enveloped by the 95ppu and r factor indicated simulation accuracy theoretically the p factor ranges from 0 to 1 and r factor ranges from 0 to infinity when the p factor is close to 0 7 and r factor around 1 for discharge simulation outcomes are close to satisfactions the years of 1987 1989 were selected as a warm up period before the calibration period 1990 1994 and 1995 1999 was set as model validation the land cover maps of 2000 2004 and 2011 were used to represent three time periods of 2000 2003 2004 2008 and 2009 2013 respectively the stream flow data were compiled from hydrologic records for the wuding sluice gate hydrological station which controlled the outflows from the qinhuai river and back flows from the yangtze river fig 1 the monthly stream flow data 1990 1999 used for model calibration and validation were the sum of daily flow measured at the wuding sluice gate station the monthly data preprocessing and quality control were carried out by the local jiangsu bureau of hydrology and water resources we applied three criteria to evaluate the model s performance in simulating streamflow nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and coefficient of determination r 2 immerzeel et al 2008 see appendix c values for r2 range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect linear relationship and 0 indicating no linear relationship values for nse between 0 and 1 are generally acceptable values for swat models moriasi et al 2007 the optimal pbias value is 0 with lower values indicating accurate model simulation gupta et al 1999 paul et al 2017 2 7 separating contributions of climate and lulcc to et we used the method developed by eum et al 2016 to estimate the individual contributions of lulcc and climate variability to the changes in et the period 1987 1999 was selected as the reference period with climate data from 1987 to 1999 changes in et were evaluated for three time periods of 2000 2003 2004 2008 and 2009 2013 with climate data from 2000 to 2013 and lulcc representing three periods in 2000 2004 and 2011 respectively the effects of both lulcc and climate variability were determined from modelling results when changing lulcc from 2000 simulated et of 2000 2003 to 2004 simulated et of 2004 2008 then to 2011 simulated et of 2009 2011 with the entire weather data series 2000 2013 the individual contributions of lulcc or climate are calculated by computing deviation of accumulated et from the reference of lulcc or climate contribution of climate variability ec during 2000 2013 was derived from et values modelled by using fixed lulcc of 2000 contribution of lulcc el represents et derivation from the reference climate period 1987 1999 the accumulated et deviation resulting from lulcc eal climate variability eac and combined effects of climate change and lulcc eacl were calculated as 8 e c l t e t e r e c l t e t e r 9 e c t e n t e r e

2004 0 2013 using actual climate and lulc of the three representative periods in particular em t rates in 2003 were estimated using lulcc of 2000 while em t rates for 2004 2008 and 2009 2013 were simulated with lulcc of 2004 and 2011 respectively e r is the mean et for the reference period of 1990 2002 with lulcc set as year 2000 and climate of the reference period ecl t represents the combined et effects of climate and lulcc for year t en t is modelled annual et for year t during 2003 2013 with a fixed lulcc set as 2000 therefore ec t represents the sole effects of climate on et

3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis five iterations were used in model calibration to match simulated daily streamflow with measured at wuding sluice gate and each iteration was run for 500 times the ten most sensitive parameters as ranked according to model sensitivity from high to low were identified table 3 in this study the value of p factor that represents the percentage of observed streamflow falling within the 95ppu of the simulated values was 0 78 in the calibration period 1990 1994 in the meantime the r factor is 1 07 implying that the model results are acceptable abbaspour et al 2007 3 2 model calibration and validation with measured streamflow and et when the original swat model was first tested negative correlations between the observed and simulated streamflow were found suggesting poor model performance of the default model nse values were lower than 0 both in 1990 1994 nse 3 28 and 1995 1999 nse 8 42 and the simulated value were much higher than the observations fig 4 however the improved swat model showed much better performance after model calibration and validation both nse and r 2 exceeded 0 8 nse 0 86 r 2 0 88 and pbias is less than 5 1 5 on calibration period 1990 1994 as for validation period 1995 1999 nse and r 2 for monthly streamflow simulation were 0 65 and 0 71 respectively while pbias was only 0 07 furthermore the simulated mean annual streamflow was 15 8 m3 s 1 and 13 3 m3 s 1 during calibration and validation period respectively the simulated high flows were compared well with measurements during spring and summer periods except in 1990 and 1994 underestimates were noticed during winter and overestimates were obvious during autumn months except in 1993 overall the model performance indicators and simulated streamflow patterns suggested that the improved model performance was suitable for simulating major components of water balance for this watershed the daily measured and modelled et rates showed a good agreement as determined by a regression model with a slope of 0 75 and a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 75 fig 5 the average of the et measurement is 4 0 mm during the observation period from may 2007 to november 2007 the estimated et is 3 8 mm and its relative error is 5 8 on average this was an improvement when compared with the original modelling results r 2 0 49 negative slope 3 3 monthly variations and temporal trend of pet vpd and et at watershed scale at the monthly scale modelled et and pet as well as vapour pressure deficit vpd showed consistent variations fig 6 the pattern was mainly attributed to the combination of temperature and precipitation variations the et and pet rates peaked in august and july due to high precipitation and air temperature during this period relative low values of et and pet occurred in june were mostly attributed to increased relative humidity in the plum rainy season lasting for about 30 40 days from the end of may to early july in general variations of et pet and vpd follow similar seasonal patterns at the monthly scale the slopes of the et trend lines for the growing season spring summer autumn and winter were all negative with values of 2 68 0 36 1 01 2 03 and 1 30 respectively et rates decreased in all seasons and annual et reduction mostly occurred during the growing season fig 7 a however the slopes of the trend regression lines for pet had all positive values of 5 50 4 47 4 22 2 32 and 1 57 for the growing season spring summer autumn and winter respectively pet increased significantly in all seasons especially the growing season spring and summer vpd showed an increasing trend during the 14 year study period consistent with pet trend but with an opposite trend of et 3 4 annual trend of et at watershed scale and contributions of lulcc overall simulated annual actual et at the watershed scale decreased from 2000 to 2013 this was in contrary to simulated pet pet increased due to an increase in air temperature fig 7b annual et rates decreased from 700 mm in 2000 to 627 mm in 2004 3 4 reduction and then dropped to a minimum value of 524 mm in 2011 19 4 reduction while annual watershed level pet increased from 942 mm to 1034 mm 9 6 increase and further jumped to 1164 mm 20 4 increase subsequently meanwhile precipitation p increased from 2000 to 2010 contrary to the observably decrease trend of et during the same period runoff coefficient of q p increased from 0 40 2000 to 0 52 2013 while the ratio of et p reduced by 14 2000 2011 rice paddy field rice contributed most to watershed et volume m3 ranging from 46 up to 56 followed by agricultural land agrc 27 31 fig 8 an obvious increasing trend of et contribution by urban lands urhd 9 agreed with urban area expansion that mainly involved land conversion from crop land especially rice paddy decreased by 6 8 in area while forest frst et remained unchanged owing to the small change only 1 2 in total area 3 5 contrasting trend of et and pet by lulcc at field hru level hrus with little changes in lulcc fig 9 showed that et rates in agricultural land agrc urban use urhd forest frst and rice paddy rice increased by 7 3 12 9 26 4 and 12 5 respectively the findings were consistent with the increasing trend of pet due to global warming pet with urban use was much higher than that of other land cover types forests showed higher et than other land cover types followed by rice paddy fields and agricultural land and et rates in urban areas were the lowest 3 6 relative contributions of climate change and lulcc to long term total et variations our previous study has identified a streamflow break point of 2003 showing a dramatic increase in streamflow during 2003 2013 due to lulcc hao et al 2015a thus the period of 2003 2013 was selected to separate the contributions of lulcc and climate change to total et change the accumulated contributions of lulcc eal and climate variability eac to the simulated et change appeared to be in opposite directions fig 10 the contribution of climate to change in et was positive 29 while the contribution of lulcc was negative 50 overall the combined accumulated contributions of climate and lulcc caused the annual et to decrease by 21 eacl fig 10 dynamic attribution analysis indicated that the negative contribution of lulcc rl to change in et increased from 53 in 2000 to 61 in 2013 while the positive contribution of climate variability rc decreased from 47 in 2000 to 39 in 2013 this demonstrated that land cover change was the main driver of change in watershed level et during the study period insert in fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of climate change on pet et our study results were consistent with the literature regarding the relationship among et pet and climate warming for humid regions because temperature and relative humidity are the two key factors effecting pet and et variation yang 2014 mcleod et al 2004 yang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 gong et al 2006 feng et al 2017 especially in humid areas feng et al 2016 liu et al 2010 any rise in air temperature is likely to increase pet our previous studies hao et al 2015a qin et al 2019 and gong et al 2006 suggested that the increase in pet is mainly due to the increase in air temperature or global warming followed by the increase in vpd and decrease in relative humidity rh vpd is an important factor determining et process by affecting canopy level evaporation and leaf level transpiration wu et al 2015 silva et al 2016 we showed that pet and vpd had an upward tendency contrary to the notable decreasing trend of actual et over the past 14 years we also found that precipitation increased during this period from 2000 to 2010 however et decreased at the watershed level the increasing trends of pet and precipitation indicated that the decrease in et trend was not likely to be caused by climate change at the watershed scale 4 2 impacts of land use and land cover change lulcc on et the relative contributions of lulcc and climate fig 10 showed that watershed level et reduction was not only influenced by climate change but also was strongly affected by lulcc this was consistent with our previous streamflow attribution analysis based on two empirical models in the same watershed hao et al 2015a we found that lulcc contributed about 85 of the observed increase in streamflow and climate variability of precipitation contributed about only 15 therefore the current method is acceptable to separate the hydrological impacts of climate variability from land use land cover change with the aid of the swat model the results support our hypothesis that land use land cover change is the main driver to et variations 4 3 factors affecting change in et at different spatial scales most previous studies on the qrb focused on temporal variations in streamflow du et al 2012 du et al 2013 liu et al 2012 and recently on et hao et al 2015a zheng et al 2020 at the watershed level the current study focused on the spatial distribution of et of different land cover types in our study at hru scale et of all land cover types is increasing significantly especially for forest and rice paddy field fig 9 the et increase patterns were similar to increasing pet which was mainly influenced by increasing air temperature vpd and rh from 2000 to 2013 among all land covers et rates from forests were highest due to their high canopy interception and transpiration rates therefore et variations were dominated by meteorological factors and plant types at the hru scale however for watershed scale the volume of et for rice paddy and agricultural lands were decreasing causing overall decrease in et at the watershed level therefore lulcc plays a critical role in affecting the hydrology at the watershed scale 4 4 impacts of lulcc on streamflow as a result of reduction of et numerous studies show that urbanization leads to increase in water yield as a result of increase in direct runoff from impervious surfaces oudin et al 2018 li et al 2020 and decrease in et boggs and sun 2011 due to reduction in canopy interception lower soil percolation rate and soil moisture storage capacity locatelli et al 2017 xu et al 2017 barron et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 nguyen and kappas 2015 lin et al 2015 baker and miller 2013 nie et al 2011 zhu and li 2014 our simulated results support these findings lulcc during 2000 2013 in the qrb increased annual total streamflow when calculated as q p et with a decrease in et and a slight increase in p the reduction of watershed level annual et is mostly resulted from converting rice paddy to urban uses the rice paddy represents the largest area of the whole watershed and contributes most to et comparing with other land cover types fig 8 the relatively high level of r 2 and low p value in growing season fig 7 also show agreement with the fact that reduced et in rice paddy is the main contributor to total et decrease du et al 2012 reported that annual runoff as well as flood volume would increase with increase in impervious area by urbanization in the qrb other studies xu et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 pointed out that land cover change would alter soil property which dramatically change the soil moisture storage capacity and infiltration rate kim et al 2014 applied the hspf paddy model in bochung watershed of korea and found that runoff depth and et from rice paddy field were higher than other land cover types attributed to amounts of water irrigation feng and liu 2015 indicated that soil moisture change is mainly controlled by land cover types in humid area of poyang lake basin china 4 5 implications of urbanization to watershed ecosystem services and climate feedback paddy wetlands are the main land use type across the humid southern china our study shows that lulcc reduction of paddy rice field due to urbanization in particular alters the watershed hydrological cycle such hydrologic changes have important implications to flooding risks due to increase in storm runoff and water quality degradation from sediment and urban runoff sun and lockaby 2012 because the water and energy is tightly coupled reduction in wetlands including rice paddies is likely to aggravate urban heat island effect zhou et al 2013 and urban dry island effect hao et al 2018 in the study region thus paddy field not only provide abundant agricultural resources but also play a key role in local climate regulation soil and water conservation water storage and flood regulation groundwater supply water purification and local and global geochemical cycle e g greenhouse gas emission that depends in hydrology the feedbacks of the ecohydrological cycle to urbanization associated land cover change are particularly evident in subtropical humid regions such as southern china that are dominated by water bodies and wetlands including rice paddy fields or extensive wetlands and forests however the ecosystem service functions of these artificial wetlands are being threatened by massive urbanization in southern humid china tsai 2002 he et al 2009 in this study the traditional watershed ecohydrological simulation model swat was improved and adapted for the paddy field dominated basin the present watershed level study advances our understanding of the combined and individual impacts of land use land cover change and climate change on watershed ecohydrological processes at multiple spatial scales the process based study at multiple scales offers insight of hydrological response to urbanization and our findings have important environmental implications for integrated watershed management i e both climate and lulcc the improved model provides a better integrated method for ecosystem services assessment in the highly urbanized regions in humid southern china and east asia 4 6 uncertainties and limitations parameter uncertainty is one of the major sources resulting in the hydrological simulation uncertainty zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 monthly streamflow during 1990 1999 from wuding sluice gate is the only data used for model calibration and validation thus leading to range of deviation in parameters for the subbasins a lack of the observed streamflow and et in subbasins can result in bias in calibrated parameters studies by xie and cui 2011 have incorporated with new paddy module in swat by introducing three critical water depths designed for irrigation and drainage management during the rice paddy growing period in china indicating that simulated results showed a good agreement with the measurements however the improved irrigation algorithm of the pothole module is not able to completely represent actual irrigation process because the volume of irrigation varies with different growth stage of rice paddy and is affected by local artificial irrigation plans in addition the modified model does not account for the infiltration as affected by soil types kang et al 2006 and ground water level of the drainage channel sakaguchi et al 2014 combining with physically based ground water models with surface water processes will likely to improve the swat model further for application in a humid region kim et al 2008 similar to previous work sakaguchi et al 2014 our study provides critical information and strategies for improving rice paddy module for understanding hydrological process in a rice paddy dominated region the improved swat model still needs to be evaluated in other watersheds for et in similar landscape in the future when field data such as fluxnet liu et al 2017b become available at different spatial scales the impacts of shallow groundwater on et and streamflow should be explicitly modeled in future studies this is important for humid regions where et is closely couple with surface and groundwater systems and wetland dynamics lu et al 2009 dai et al 2010 5 conclusions we quantified the response of et to lulcc associated with rapid urbanization and climate change over a 14 year period in the qinhuai river basin southern china we conclude that the driving factors to et change vary with spatial scale conversion of cropland to urban use directly results in significant et reduction and increase in runoff at a watershed scale in spite of a warming climate and rise of water evaporation demand replacing the original wetland and irrigation algorithms with new models describing the hydrological processes for rice paddy greatly improved swat model performance integrating multiple methods and techniques of ecohydrological model ground observation and remote sensing to study the effects of land use land cover change on ecological processes e g et is essential and beneficial for explaining the mechanisms regulating of hydrological processes in a rapidly urbanizing watershed to mitigate the environmental effects of urbanization such as flooding water quality degradation urban heat island and urban dry island in southern china future impacts from changes in global climate and land use change must be managed together along with ecosystem conservation measures the improved swat provides a useful modelling tool for ecosystem service impact assessment and land planning in the rapidly urbanizing regions in southern china credit authorship

5376,how urbanization associated land use land cover change lulcc affects the ecohydrological cycle through altering evapotranspiration et processes is not clear for rice paddy dominated watersheds the purpose of this study was to understand long term 2000 2013 spatial and temporal variations of et over the qinhuai river basin in a humid region southern china we revised the soil and water assessment tool swat by incorporating new algorithms describing hydrological processes of rice paddies using the improved swat model driven by remote sensing derived lulcc and local climatic data we separated the effects of lulcc on et from climate at the watershed scale we showed that the modified swat model significantly improved monthly streamflow estimates the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse was 0 86 and coefficient of determination r 2 was 0 88 for the calibration period 1990 1994 while the nse was 0 65 and r 2 was 0 71 for the validation period 1995 1999 we also found good agreements between modelled daily et and lysimeter based measurements for an experimental rice paddy field r 2 0 75 p less than 0 01 for areas with little land cover change et rates increased over time due to the increase in potential et pet during 2000 2013 however the contribution from rice paddy to the watershed level et decreased over time coincident with a period of rapid urbanization and loss of rice paddy field dynamic attribution analysis indicated that the negative contribution of lulcc to change in et increased from 53 in 2000 to 61 in 2013 while the positive contribution of climate variability decreased from 47 in 2000 to 39 in 2013 we concluded that factors affecting et varied with spatial scale conversion of rice paddy field to urban use directly resulted in significant et reduction at the watershed scale despite the rise in the air temperature and potential et in the study region the improved swat model provides a better integrated method for understanding et processes and assessing the impacts of environmental change on ecosystem services in a rapidly urbanizing region keywords urbanization associated land cover change climate warming swat model ecohydrological processes rice paddy watershed 1 introduction urbanization and associated land use and land cover change lulcc has been widely recognized to have negative influences on ecosystems by altering watershed hydrology paul and meyer 2011 sun and lockaby 2012 lulcc and associated anthropogenic activities cause losses of ecosystem functions fan et al 2016 through altering flood frequency brath et al 2006 crooks and davies 2001 gao and sang 2017 and seasonal streamflow patterns guo et al 2008 impairing water quality sun and lockaby 2012 and aggravating urban heat island hao et al 2015a zhao et al 2014 and urban dry island hao et al 2018 climate change is also becoming a major threat to natural resources such as water supply and crop production in many parts of the world piao et al 2010 kim et al 2015 cao et al 2011 martin et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a b for example the average air temperature in china has increased gao et al 2002 and precipitation significantly increased in southern china affecting regional evaporation and transpiration rates merritt et al 2006 however the regional hydrologic impacts of climate variability may be completely different those from lulcc due to the contrasting underlying physical and biological processes martin et al 2017 sun et al 2019 zhao et al 2020a b separating the individual effects of climate change and land use land cover change is not only essential for interpreting ecohydrological change and its drivers eum et al 2016 but also for watershed management decision making rice paddy field a major land use for agricultural food production in southern china provides similar ecosystem service benefits like other wetlands such as water quality improvement kang et al 2006 and climate moderation hao et al 2015a hao et al 2018 however growing rice consumes a large amount of water due to its irrigation needs thus converting rice paddy to urban uses in the process of urbanization is projected to have profound impacts on the watershed hydrological cycle hao et al 2015a our previous study hao et al 2015a found that urbanization and climate warming qin et al 2019 in a rapidly urbanizing rice paddy dominated watershed in eastern china collectively elevated streamflow by 58 due to a decrease in et by 23 during 1986 2013 however we know little about the effects of individual and combined changes in lulcc and climate change on watershed hydrological processes due to the complexity of rice paddy management in watersheds with mixed land uses amid climate change hao et al 2015a hydrological response to disturbances is scale dependent a watershed modelling study in a rice paddy dominated region in southern china suggests that converting rice paddies to urban area reduces overall water consumption tsai 2002 the hydrological processes of rice paddy dominated watersheds are extremely complex due to the mixed compositions of lulcc for example xu et al 2017 found that simulated et by the traditional penman monteith model for rice paddy overestimated or underestimated et because of large daily variations in net radiation soil heat flux and soil moisture in kunshan region of china the dominated controlling factors for et vary across spatial scales mauser and schädlich 1998 xu and yang 2010 cristiano et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 amatya et al 2014 suggest that soil plant type and regional weather conditions are important for explaining et response to land management at a landscape scale while et is dominated by climatic conditions at a regional scale similarly zhou et al 2013 concludes that et is controlled by water availability at a plot scale but is sensitive to energy available as well as surface temperature at a regional scale process based simulation models are useful tools to quantify the influence of climate e g precipitation relative humidity temperature and radiation and human activities e g irrigation urbanization and drainage operations on watershed hydrology xie and cui 2011 du et al 2012 hao et al 2015b among many existing hydrological models the soil water assessment tool swat has been widely used because of its versatility and open sources sun et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a b wu et al 2016 swat as a process based watershed model describes the essential hydrological processes and is capable for assessing the impacts of agricultural practices on water quality providing an effective tool for environmental assessment and watershed management fan et al 2016 laurent and ruelland 2011 however swat has not been applied widely in modelling hydrological processes in rice paddy dominated watersheds previous modification of the swat model simply treats rice field as a pothole or an impoundment the original pothole module in swat assumes that the water surface evaporation is actual et in rice field sakaguchi et al 2014 developed a modified paddy module in swat and modelled the hydrological processes in a 3 km2 paddy field xie and cui 2011 incorporated a new irrigation scheme to swat for simulating streamflow in zhanghe irrigation district of southern china kang et al 2006 incorporated the total maximum daily load system within the swat model to evaluate water balance and water quality in irrigated rice paddy region in south korea however these studies rarely examined model performance in modelling et a major hydrological component in a humid region and one of the most uncertain hydrologic variables that plays a key role in determining watershed water balance assessing effects of lulcc on local and climate scheduling agricultural irrigation aouissi et al 2016 abdullah et al 2014 chirouze et al 2014 qiu et al 2015 liu et al 2017a and assessing climate change impacts falamarzi et al 2014 shiri et al 2012 wang and liang 2008 we chose the qinhuai river basin qrb for this case study to understand hydrological response et in particular to urbanization and climate change at spatial multiple scales the qrb represents a typical watershed on the yangtze river delta yrd one of the most developed and highly populated regions in china hao et al 2018 the region is facing serious environmental challenges such as flood risk and water quality deterioration zhou et al 2013 local climate change such as urban heat islands uhis hao et al 2015a and urban dry islands udi hao et al 2018 and global warming gu et al 2011 understanding the impacts of climate change and lulcc on watershed hydrology is essential to mitigating global climate change and local lulcc and most importantly offering scientific principles to guide watershed ecosystem restoration efforts zhou et al 2013 chien et al 2013 we hypothesized that the dominated driving factors for et change varied across spatial scales and lulcc was the main cause of et reduction in the study basin the overall goal of this modelling study was to understand the individual and combined impacts of lulcc and climate change on ecohydrological processes et in particular the specific objectives were 1 to modify calibrate and validate an improved swat model for estimating et at different temporal and spatial scales 2 to examine the response of et to disturbance by land cover type and 3 to quantify the individual contributions of climate and lulcc to et variations over a 14 year period at a watershed scale 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qrb one of the tributaries of the yangtze river covers most of the administrative area of nanjing city the capital of jiangsu province 118 39 119 21 e longitudes and 31 30 32 10 n latitudes fig 1 as a highly human impacted watershed the qrb has two main flow outlets wuding and inner qinhuai sluice gates flat topography characterizes most part of the watershed except the northeast the basin has an area of approximately 2 631 km2 with an elevation ranging from 0 to 410 m the study region is dominated by the east asia summer monsoon climate gu et al 2011 with an average annual temperature and total precipitation of 15 4 c and 1116 mm respectively the qrb has experienced global warming with mean air temperature increased at a rate of 0 44 c per decade and thus an increasing evaporative potential during the past two decades hao et al 2015a nearly 75 of the annual precipitation falls during april to october as the rainy season the dominant land cover type in this watershed is rice paddy rice followed by urban area urhd water body watr forests frst and dry agricultural land agrc the qrb has experienced a rapid urbanization since 2002 hao et al 2015a at the expense of rice paddies and other land types du et al 2013 during the past decade the area of rice paddies has significantly reduced by 7 6 followed by agricultural land 2 4 water body 0 6 and forests 0 5 in contrast to the notable increase in urban area of 11 3 2 2 swat model the swat model was selected in this study for assessing the hydrological impacts of lulcc and climate change and variability on watershed qrb et for three different periods 2000 2003 2004 2008 2009 2013 our previous empirical studies indicated that the qrb had been significantly impacted by urbanization and climate change in both hydrology i e streamflow and et and local meteorology hao et al 2015a qin et al 2019 hao et al 2018 the swat model is a semi distributed continuous hydrologic model operated in a geographic information system gis environment arnold et al 2012 the entire watershed simulation domain is divided into sub basins which are further subdivided into uniform hydrological response units hrus with homogeneous soil land cover and slope characteristics about 300 hrus in 54 sub basins were used in the present study simulations of hydrological processes such as et and percolation occur at the hrus level arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 the model parameters are distributed across hrus and are finalized during model calibration and validation by comparing simulated and measured hydrologic fluxes including both streamflow and et in this study we use the scs method and penman monteith equation for estimating surface runoff and pet respectively for estimating total actual et at the hrus level swat first calculates plant canopy interception then simulates the maximum amount of transpiration and soil evaporation and computes the actual soil evaporation last 2 3 improved swat model the original swat model treats a rice paddy as an impounded area xie and cui 2011 in this study to represent flow patterns of a rice paddy landscape we modified the swat wetland pothole module that is originally introduced by sakaguchi et al 2014 and xie and cui 2011 additional modifications to swat include algorithms for estimating wetland surface area irrigation schedules and the evaporation process of pothole fig 2 more supporting information see appendix a figs a 1 a 3 2 3 1 calculation of the surface area of rice paddy field the surface area sa of the original pothole module is computed as a cone shaped wetland which varies with the volume of water stored in the impoundment the improved rice paddy model assumes that the surface area of rice paddy in the pothole module as a cuboid shape according to sakaguchi et al 2014 thus the surface area of water would not decrease with the decrease of water level the equation of the surface area has been changed as follows 1 s a a h r u s a a h r u where ahru is the surface area of the hru ha dominated by rice paddies 2 3 2 irrigation algorithms the actual amount of irrigation is difficult to estimate since the timing of irrigation operations is often irregular thus the original pothole module assumes enough water for irrigation without considering unused water therefore this algorithm does not reflect the reality of the irrigation system in the study area when the water storage in paddy field reaches its maximum after irrigation the irrigation water becomes overflow therefore this study assumes that the daily water need of irrigation by a rice paddy is equal to the rate of flow in the irrigation canal the improved model for rice paddy field takes unused water into account by adding an irrigation formula preventing irrigation water overflowing the modelled impoundment 2 i f v pot i r r v mxpot irr pot v mxpot v pot 3 if v pot i r r v mxpot i r r pot i r r where irrpot is the amount of water added to the impoundment on a given day m3 vpot is the current volume of water stored in the impoundment m3 vmxpot is the maximum volume of water which can be stored in the impoundment m3 irr is the amount of water added through an irrigation operation on a given day m3 accordingly the drainage process has been modified as 4 i f v pot i r r v mxpot q out q surf v pot i r r v mxpot 10 a hru 5 if v pot i r r v mxpot q out q surf where qout is the volume of water flowing out of a hru to the main channel on a given day mm qsurf is the volume of the surface runoff released from a hru to the main channel which does not include the irrigation water overflow from the impoundment on a given day mm 2 3 3 water evaporation algorithms for modelling et for rice paddies we adopted findings from miyazaki et al 2005 and sakaguchi et al 2014 that water evaporation is limited when leaf area index lai of rice crop exceeds 4 0 in this case more than 90 of the total et is transpiration for rice paddy this model modification ensures that rice transpiration depends on lai and dominates et in addition the evaporation coefficient η was introduced to estimate actual water evaporation based on pet thus the et equations were modified as 6 iflai 4 q u o t e v e v a p 10 η 1 l a i 4 p e t s a i f l a i 4 v e v a p 10 η 1 l a i 4 p e t s a i f l a i 4 7 iflai 4 q u o t e v e v a p 0 i f l a i 4 v e v a p 0 i f l a i 4 where vevap is the volume of water removed from the water body by evaporation per day m3 pet is the daily potential evapotranspiration mm in this study we set η as 0 6 based on the evaporation process of the rice paddies neitsch et al 2002 2 4 model input data the data required to run swat consist of digital elevation model dem land cover soil and daily meteorological data e g precipitation relative air humidity maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation and near surface wind speed the 30 m 30 m resolution dem was obtained from the international scientific data platform of the chinese academy of sciences we examined land use data for three distinct periods of 2000 2004 and 2011 these spatial data were derived from landsat thematic mapper tm and etm images with a 30 m 30 m pixel resolution http glovis usgs gov fig 3 the digital soil data at a 1 5 000 000 scale from the harmonized world soil database hwsd updated by the food and agriculture organization fao of the united nations and the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa were used to extract soil information the daily meteorological data for 27 years 1987 2013 were acquired from weather stations in or near qrb and were interpolated to the dem grids 2 5 parametrization for reservoir and irrigation management swat provides several options related to water management practices that allow users to choose based on data availability such as irrigation tile drainage and consumptive water use water for irrigation in a hru is obtained from one of the five main water sources river reach reservoir shallow aquifer deep aquifer or a source outside the watershed reservoirs are impoundments located on the main channel network of the watershed in this study we added five reservoirs based on the reservoir information obtained from nanjing water resources bureau table 1 for rice paddy phonology we set jun 16th as the beginning day of the growing season october 20th as the harvest day in addition november 2nd was set as the planting day and may 20th as the harvest day of winter wheat rotation in the following year the parameters for rice paddy irrigation operations were derived from local knowledge hao et al 2015b huang et al 2015 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2006 and the irrigation dates are listed in table 2 more information see appendix b table b 1 2 6 model performance evaluation and uncertainty analysis actual et rates for a rice paddy field were measured by a weighing lysimeter at a research site with an area of 300 km2 managed by the agro meteorological experimental station 32 21 n 118 71 e on the nanjing university of information science and technology nuist campus about 10 km from the qrb the measurement period spanned from july 1st to november 2ndin 2007 the weather conditions at the nuist station are similar to the lishui research station dominated by rice paddy fields in the qrb therefore the measured lysimeter et rates were used to validate the simulated et for rice paddy land covers the precision of the et measurements was estimated to be 0 1 mm day 1 the effective et area of the lysimeter was 4 0 m2 measured et data in heavy rainy days were removed from the data sets due to potential estimation errors of the lysimeter method we used the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2007 based on swat cup for parameter calibration and uncertainty analysis a total of 10 parameters were chosen for calibration according to the sensitivity analysis method output uncertainty was calculated by the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu which was defined as the interval between 2 5 and 97 5 levels of the cumulative distribution of simulated results zhao et al 2015 the parameter uncertainty is one of the major sources of simulation uncertainty in modelling studies zhang et al 2014 two variables p factor and r factor were applied for defining parameter uncertainty the p factor was the percentage of observed data enveloped by the 95ppu and r factor indicated simulation accuracy theoretically the p factor ranges from 0 to 1 and r factor ranges from 0 to infinity when the p factor is close to 0 7 and r factor around 1 for discharge simulation outcomes are close to satisfactions the years of 1987 1989 were selected as a warm up period before the calibration period 1990 1994 and 1995 1999 was set as model validation the land cover maps of 2000 2004 and 2011 were used to represent three time periods of 2000 2003 2004 2008 and 2009 2013 respectively the stream flow data were compiled from hydrologic records for the wuding sluice gate hydrological station which controlled the outflows from the qinhuai river and back flows from the yangtze river fig 1 the monthly stream flow data 1990 1999 used for model calibration and validation were the sum of daily flow measured at the wuding sluice gate station the monthly data preprocessing and quality control were carried out by the local jiangsu bureau of hydrology and water resources we applied three criteria to evaluate the model s performance in simulating streamflow nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 moriasi et al 2007 percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 and coefficient of determination r 2 immerzeel et al 2008 see appendix c values for r2 range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating a perfect linear relationship and 0 indicating no linear relationship values for nse between 0 and 1 are generally acceptable values for swat models moriasi et al 2007 the optimal pbias value is 0 with lower values indicating accurate model simulation gupta et al 1999 paul et al 2017 2 7 separating contributions of climate and lulcc to et we used the method developed by eum et al 2016 to estimate the individual contributions of lulcc and climate variability to the changes in et the period 1987 1999 was selected as the reference period with climate data from 1987 to 1999 changes in et were evaluated for three time periods of 2000 2003 2004 2008 and 2009 2013 with climate data from 2000 to 2013 and lulcc representing three periods in 2000 2004 and 2011 respectively the effects of both lulcc and climate variability were determined from modelling results when changing lulcc from 2000 simulated et of 2000 2003 to 2004 simulated et of 2004 2008 then to 2011 simulated et of 2009 2011 with the entire weather data series 2000 2013 the individual contributions of lulcc or climate are calculated by computing deviation of accumulated et from the reference of lulcc or climate contribution of climate variability ec during 2000 2013 was derived from et values modelled by using fixed lulcc of 2000 contribution of lulcc el represents et derivation from the reference climate period 1987 1999 the accumulated et deviation resulting from lulcc eal climate variability eac and combined effects of climate change and lulcc eacl were calculated as 8 e c l t e t e r e c l t e t e r 9 e c t e n t e r e

2004 0 2013 using actual climate and lulc of the three representative periods in particular em t rates in 2003 were estimated using lulcc of 2000 while em t rates for 2004 2008 and 2009 2013 were simulated with lulcc of 2004 and 2011 respectively e r is the mean et for the reference period of 1990 2002 with lulcc set as year 2000 and climate of the reference period ecl t represents the combined et effects of climate and lulcc for year t en t is modelled annual et for year t during 2003 2013 with a fixed lulcc set as 2000 therefore ec t represents the sole effects of climate on et

3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis five iterations were used in model calibration to match simulated daily streamflow with measured at wuding sluice gate and each iteration was run for 500 times the ten most sensitive parameters as ranked according to model sensitivity from high to low were identified table 3 in this study the value of p factor that represents the percentage of observed streamflow falling within the 95ppu of the simulated values was 0 78 in the calibration period 1990 1994 in the meantime the r factor is 1 07 implying that the model results are acceptable abbaspour et al 2007 3 2 model calibration and validation with measured streamflow and et when the original swat model was first tested negative correlations between the observed and simulated streamflow were found suggesting poor model performance of the default model nse values were lower than 0 both in 1990 1994 nse 3 28 and 1995 1999 nse 8 42 and the simulated value were much higher than the observations fig 4 however the improved swat model showed much better performance after model calibration and validation both nse and r 2 exceeded 0 8 nse 0 86 r 2 0 88 and pbias is less than 5 1 5 on calibration period 1990 1994 as for validation period 1995 1999 nse and r 2 for monthly streamflow simulation were 0 65 and 0 71 respectively while pbias was only 0 07 furthermore the simulated mean annual streamflow was 15 8 m3 s 1 and 13 3 m3 s 1 during calibration and validation period respectively the simulated high flows were compared well with measurements during spring and summer periods except in 1990 and 1994 underestimates were noticed during winter and overestimates were obvious during autumn months except in 1993 overall the model performance indicators and simulated streamflow patterns suggested that the improved model performance was suitable for simulating major components of water balance for this watershed the daily measured and modelled et rates showed a good agreement as determined by a regression model with a slope of 0 75 and a coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 75 fig 5 the average of the et measurement is 4 0 mm during the observation period from may 2007 to november 2007 the estimated et is 3 8 mm and its relative error is 5 8 on average this was an improvement when compared with the original modelling results r 2 0 49 negative slope 3 3 monthly variations and temporal trend of pet vpd and et at watershed scale at the monthly scale modelled et and pet as well as vapour pressure deficit vpd showed consistent variations fig 6 the pattern was mainly attributed to the combination of temperature and precipitation variations the et and pet rates peaked in august and july due to high precipitation and air temperature during this period relative low values of et and pet occurred in june were mostly attributed to increased relative humidity in the plum rainy season lasting for about 30 40 days from the end of may to early july in general variations of et pet and vpd follow similar seasonal patterns at the monthly scale the slopes of the et trend lines for the growing season spring summer autumn and winter were all negative with values of 2 68 0 36 1 01 2 03 and 1 30 respectively et rates decreased in all seasons and annual et reduction mostly occurred during the growing season fig 7 a however the slopes of the trend regression lines for pet had all positive values of 5 50 4 47 4 22 2 32 and 1 57 for the growing season spring summer autumn and winter respectively pet increased significantly in all seasons especially the growing season spring and summer vpd showed an increasing trend during the 14 year study period consistent with pet trend but with an opposite trend of et 3 4 annual trend of et at watershed scale and contributions of lulcc overall simulated annual actual et at the watershed scale decreased from 2000 to 2013 this was in contrary to simulated pet pet increased due to an increase in air temperature fig 7b annual et rates decreased from 700 mm in 2000 to 627 mm in 2004 3 4 reduction and then dropped to a minimum value of 524 mm in 2011 19 4 reduction while annual watershed level pet increased from 942 mm to 1034 mm 9 6 increase and further jumped to 1164 mm 20 4 increase subsequently meanwhile precipitation p increased from 2000 to 2010 contrary to the observably decrease trend of et during the same period runoff coefficient of q p increased from 0 40 2000 to 0 52 2013 while the ratio of et p reduced by 14 2000 2011 rice paddy field rice contributed most to watershed et volume m3 ranging from 46 up to 56 followed by agricultural land agrc 27 31 fig 8 an obvious increasing trend of et contribution by urban lands urhd 9 agreed with urban area expansion that mainly involved land conversion from crop land especially rice paddy decreased by 6 8 in area while forest frst et remained unchanged owing to the small change only 1 2 in total area 3 5 contrasting trend of et and pet by lulcc at field hru level hrus with little changes in lulcc fig 9 showed that et rates in agricultural land agrc urban use urhd forest frst and rice paddy rice increased by 7 3 12 9 26 4 and 12 5 respectively the findings were consistent with the increasing trend of pet due to global warming pet with urban use was much higher than that of other land cover types forests showed higher et than other land cover types followed by rice paddy fields and agricultural land and et rates in urban areas were the lowest 3 6 relative contributions of climate change and lulcc to long term total et variations our previous study has identified a streamflow break point of 2003 showing a dramatic increase in streamflow during 2003 2013 due to lulcc hao et al 2015a thus the period of 2003 2013 was selected to separate the contributions of lulcc and climate change to total et change the accumulated contributions of lulcc eal and climate variability eac to the simulated et change appeared to be in opposite directions fig 10 the contribution of climate to change in et was positive 29 while the contribution of lulcc was negative 50 overall the combined accumulated contributions of climate and lulcc caused the annual et to decrease by 21 eacl fig 10 dynamic attribution analysis indicated that the negative contribution of lulcc rl to change in et increased from 53 in 2000 to 61 in 2013 while the positive contribution of climate variability rc decreased from 47 in 2000 to 39 in 2013 this demonstrated that land cover change was the main driver of change in watershed level et during the study period insert in fig 10 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of climate change on pet et our study results were consistent with the literature regarding the relationship among et pet and climate warming for humid regions because temperature and relative humidity are the two key factors effecting pet and et variation yang 2014 mcleod et al 2004 yang et al 2014 wang et al 2016 gong et al 2006 feng et al 2017 especially in humid areas feng et al 2016 liu et al 2010 any rise in air temperature is likely to increase pet our previous studies hao et al 2015a qin et al 2019 and gong et al 2006 suggested that the increase in pet is mainly due to the increase in air temperature or global warming followed by the increase in vpd and decrease in relative humidity rh vpd is an important factor determining et process by affecting canopy level evaporation and leaf level transpiration wu et al 2015 silva et al 2016 we showed that pet and vpd had an upward tendency contrary to the notable decreasing trend of actual et over the past 14 years we also found that precipitation increased during this period from 2000 to 2010 however et decreased at the watershed level the increasing trends of pet and precipitation indicated that the decrease in et trend was not likely to be caused by climate change at the watershed scale 4 2 impacts of land use and land cover change lulcc on et the relative contributions of lulcc and climate fig 10 showed that watershed level et reduction was not only influenced by climate change but also was strongly affected by lulcc this was consistent with our previous streamflow attribution analysis based on two empirical models in the same watershed hao et al 2015a we found that lulcc contributed about 85 of the observed increase in streamflow and climate variability of precipitation contributed about only 15 therefore the current method is acceptable to separate the hydrological impacts of climate variability from land use land cover change with the aid of the swat model the results support our hypothesis that land use land cover change is the main driver to et variations 4 3 factors affecting change in et at different spatial scales most previous studies on the qrb focused on temporal variations in streamflow du et al 2012 du et al 2013 liu et al 2012 and recently on et hao et al 2015a zheng et al 2020 at the watershed level the current study focused on the spatial distribution of et of different land cover types in our study at hru scale et of all land cover types is increasing significantly especially for forest and rice paddy field fig 9 the et increase patterns were similar to increasing pet which was mainly influenced by increasing air temperature vpd and rh from 2000 to 2013 among all land covers et rates from forests were highest due to their high canopy interception and transpiration rates therefore et variations were dominated by meteorological factors and plant types at the hru scale however for watershed scale the volume of et for rice paddy and agricultural lands were decreasing causing overall decrease in et at the watershed level therefore lulcc plays a critical role in affecting the hydrology at the watershed scale 4 4 impacts of lulcc on streamflow as a result of reduction of et numerous studies show that urbanization leads to increase in water yield as a result of increase in direct runoff from impervious surfaces oudin et al 2018 li et al 2020 and decrease in et boggs and sun 2011 due to reduction in canopy interception lower soil percolation rate and soil moisture storage capacity locatelli et al 2017 xu et al 2017 barron et al 2013 zhou et al 2013 nguyen and kappas 2015 lin et al 2015 baker and miller 2013 nie et al 2011 zhu and li 2014 our simulated results support these findings lulcc during 2000 2013 in the qrb increased annual total streamflow when calculated as q p et with a decrease in et and a slight increase in p the reduction of watershed level annual et is mostly resulted from converting rice paddy to urban uses the rice paddy represents the largest area of the whole watershed and contributes most to et comparing with other land cover types fig 8 the relatively high level of r 2 and low p value in growing season fig 7 also show agreement with the fact that reduced et in rice paddy is the main contributor to total et decrease du et al 2012 reported that annual runoff as well as flood volume would increase with increase in impervious area by urbanization in the qrb other studies xu et al 2017 zhou et al 2013 pointed out that land cover change would alter soil property which dramatically change the soil moisture storage capacity and infiltration rate kim et al 2014 applied the hspf paddy model in bochung watershed of korea and found that runoff depth and et from rice paddy field were higher than other land cover types attributed to amounts of water irrigation feng and liu 2015 indicated that soil moisture change is mainly controlled by land cover types in humid area of poyang lake basin china 4 5 implications of urbanization to watershed ecosystem services and climate feedback paddy wetlands are the main land use type across the humid southern china our study shows that lulcc reduction of paddy rice field due to urbanization in particular alters the watershed hydrological cycle such hydrologic changes have important implications to flooding risks due to increase in storm runoff and water quality degradation from sediment and urban runoff sun and lockaby 2012 because the water and energy is tightly coupled reduction in wetlands including rice paddies is likely to aggravate urban heat island effect zhou et al 2013 and urban dry island effect hao et al 2018 in the study region thus paddy field not only provide abundant agricultural resources but also play a key role in local climate regulation soil and water conservation water storage and flood regulation groundwater supply water purification and local and global geochemical cycle e g greenhouse gas emission that depends in hydrology the feedbacks of the ecohydrological cycle to urbanization associated land cover change are particularly evident in subtropical humid regions such as southern china that are dominated by water bodies and wetlands including rice paddy fields or extensive wetlands and forests however the ecosystem service functions of these artificial wetlands are being threatened by massive urbanization in southern humid china tsai 2002 he et al 2009 in this study the traditional watershed ecohydrological simulation model swat was improved and adapted for the paddy field dominated basin the present watershed level study advances our understanding of the combined and individual impacts of land use land cover change and climate change on watershed ecohydrological processes at multiple spatial scales the process based study at multiple scales offers insight of hydrological response to urbanization and our findings have important environmental implications for integrated watershed management i e both climate and lulcc the improved model provides a better integrated method for ecosystem services assessment in the highly urbanized regions in humid southern china and east asia 4 6 uncertainties and limitations parameter uncertainty is one of the major sources resulting in the hydrological simulation uncertainty zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 monthly streamflow during 1990 1999 from wuding sluice gate is the only data used for model calibration and validation thus leading to range of deviation in parameters for the subbasins a lack of the observed streamflow and et in subbasins can result in bias in calibrated parameters studies by xie and cui 2011 have incorporated with new paddy module in swat by introducing three critical water depths designed for irrigation and drainage management during the rice paddy growing period in china indicating that simulated results showed a good agreement with the measurements however the improved irrigation algorithm of the pothole module is not able to completely represent actual irrigation process because the volume of irrigation varies with different growth stage of rice paddy and is affected by local artificial irrigation plans in addition the modified model does not account for the infiltration as affected by soil types kang et al 2006 and ground water level of the drainage channel sakaguchi et al 2014 combining with physically based ground water models with surface water processes will likely to improve the swat model further for application in a humid region kim et al 2008 similar to previous work sakaguchi et al 2014 our study provides critical information and strategies for improving rice paddy module for understanding hydrological process in a rice paddy dominated region the improved swat model still needs to be evaluated in other watersheds for et in similar landscape in the future when field data such as fluxnet liu et al 2017b become available at different spatial scales the impacts of shallow groundwater on et and streamflow should be explicitly modeled in future studies this is important for humid regions where et is closely couple with surface and groundwater systems and wetland dynamics lu et al 2009 dai et al 2010 5 conclusions we quantified the response of et to lulcc associated with rapid urbanization and climate change over a 14 year period in the qinhuai river basin southern china we conclude that the driving factors to et change vary with spatial scale conversion of cropland to urban use directly results in significant et reduction and increase in runoff at a watershed scale in spite of a warming climate and rise of water evaporation demand replacing the original wetland and irrigation algorithms with new models describing the hydrological processes for rice paddy greatly improved swat model performance integrating multiple methods and techniques of ecohydrological model ground observation and remote sensing to study the effects of land use land cover change on ecological processes e g et is essential and beneficial for explaining the mechanisms regulating of hydrological processes in a rapidly urbanizing watershed to mitigate the environmental effects of urbanization such as flooding water quality degradation urban heat island and urban dry island in southern china future impacts from changes in global climate and land use change must be managed together along with ecosystem conservation measures the improved swat provides a useful modelling tool for ecosystem service impact assessment and land planning in the rapidly urbanizing regions in southern china credit authorship

5377,this work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities voids located within two harbour quays in le havre harbourg normandy france an u a v unmanned aerial vehicle was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle from 7 a m to 5 p m the visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method while the thermal infrared tir images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures the obtained 3d model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays the analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are 1 not correlated to surface properties and 2 spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions using a 2d conductive radiative model we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air filled area finally we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones keywords remote sensing thermal infrared photogrammetry infiltration subsurface cavity natural hazards uav 1 introduction subsurface cavities voids are important safety and economical issues for land use planning in this context the identification characterization of these objects remains an important challenge for stakeholders as well as for scientists recently in situ measurements techniques made important progress to detect anthropic or natural subsurface cavities kaufmann et al 2011 vadillo et al 2012 kaufmann and romanov 2016 benavente et al 2017 kolesnikov and fedin 2018 vargemezis et al 2019 rahnema et al 2020 for instance artugyan et al 2020 combined ground penetrating radar gpr and electrical resistivity imagery eri to detect and characterize a karst massif in romania rock stratification and orientation sections of these caves galleries and level of karstification martnez moreno et al 2018 located a cave in mira de aire santo antonio range portugal using micro gravity and eri 3d inversions de giorgi and leucci 2014 imaged shallow subsurface structures including karstic features below a road in the salento peninsula apulia region south italy carrying out a seismic refraction tomography and gpr survey integrated interpretation led to the delineation of hazard zone rich with karstic features and cavities mochales et al 2008 proposed a methodology based on the sequential application of magnetic gpr and microgravity techniques to detect underground cavities and dolines cardarelli et al 2009 used the joint interpretation of eri and seismic refraction tomography to map artificial cavities in the city of rome finally in situ soil temperature sensors were also deployed to detect subsurface cavities interestingly mosciki 2006 shown that thermal anomalies associated to underground cavities can reach up to 1 c from field measurements and numerical modelling although in situ measurements are very useful on a local scale they remain difficult to implement on important surfaces and thus are economically unviable remote sensing have also adressed the problem of subsurface cavities for many years using aerial or satellite observations ruth and degner 1963 peters et al 1996 youssef et al 2012 lee et al 2016 kim et al 2019 jeffery et al 2020 for instance youssef et al 2020 integrated remote sensing landsat imagery with eri to characterize the role of agriculture in the formation of sinkholes in saudi arabia chang and hanssen 2014 characterized the deformations associated to the upward migration of underground cavities under the city of heerlen the netherlands using satellite radar interferometry edmonds et al 1987 demonstrated the potentialies of detection of collapse and subsidence features in chalk and other limestone rocks with an airborne multispectral scanner and thermal infrared tir data this last method allows to map the surface temperatures of a soil using a camera several teams in the world have shown the importance of tir method to map geological structures watson 1975 sabins 2007 nasipuri et al 2005 hydrothermal systems antoine et al 2009 gaudin et al 2013 to characterize water ressources in arid zones leblanc et al 2007 lopez et al 2016 or to detect underground burning coal vasterling and meyer 2013 campbell et al 1996 used airborne tir method to locate hydrological features in karst watersheds gunn et al 2008 detected abandoned mineshafts in former mining areas after a tir survey in great britain to our knowledge although several studies have assessed the potentiality of the tir method for the characterization of subsurface cavities rinker 1975 wynne et al 2008 lee et al 2016 few is known about the origin of the observed thermal anomalies especially when slight subsidence is observed as a consequence the methodology to adopt to detect these objects before a collapse event remains unclear in 2014 a tir and visible survey was performed above two parts of the joannes couvert platform le havre harbour the west and east quays hereafter named as wq and eq respectively these structures were selected because of the continuous formation of subsurface voids for each area the observations were acquired with an uav during a semi diurnal cycle allowing the tir monitoring of the surface temperatures from sunrise to late afternoon and the acquisition of visible images after a presentation of the geotechnical context and the methodology used for this survey the surface temperatures and the altimetric map obtained by photogrammetry are shown for the wq and eq cold areas associated to surface deformations are detected on both quays with a temperature contrast of 2 4 c compared to the surrounding environment the effect of the surface properties thermal inertia albedo on the thermal signal are first investigated as they represent the main factors affecting the surface temperatures of the soil then a simplified 2d conductive radiative model of heat transfer is developped within one quay namely the eq in order to evaluate the direct thermal influence of a subsurface cavity on the surface temperatures finally the last section is dedicated to the analysis of the role of potential fluid flow on the measured signal accross the deformed quays 2 geotechnical context le havre harbour is built in the northern part of the estuary of the seine river in le havre city normandy and is essentially composed of heterogeneous materials resulting from the world war 2 bombing the study sites the west and east quays hereafter named the wqand eq are located at the center of the harbour and is part of the joannes couvert quay fig 1 this kilometric size platform was part of the famous transatlantic cruise terminal in the 1930s the building plan of the quays is known and in particular the backfills are massively composed of the war debris stones and fines materials over the years the infiltration of salted water associated to storms and tides within the structure lead to the withdrawal of the fine particules from the quays and generated the formation of subsurface cavities as well as local surface subsidences fig 2 the fig 3 shows the structure of the wq and the eq respectively the wq is mainly composed of concrete backfill a concrete slab and backfill between 0 m and 9 50 m interestingly the internal structure of the eq is very different and essentially constituted of limestone masonry in its lower part under 0 m a m s l a concrete pile and a coarse concrete wall between 0 m and 9 50 m a backside backfill forming the major part of the quay volume above 0 m both quays are covered with pavement having an approximate thickness of 10 cm fig 1a and b various indices can be observed at the surface of the structures pavement the main constituant of the quay metallic materials such as railways unconsolidated backfills employed to fill previous subsidences dark asphalt patches sparce local vegetation 3 field survey and methodology 3 1 photogrammetric survey here our first objective is to detect surface deformations associated to potential subsurface voids using altimetric data to do so a photogrammetric survey of the eq and wq was performed on october 2014 we used a drone equipped with a sony nex 5r digital camera verticaally positionned and acquiring images 4912 3264 px the focal lenght of the camera is 16 mm 35 mm equivalent 24 mm and the sensor size is 23 4 x 15 6 mm the survey was realized along a pre defined flight plan with a longitudinal acquisition at a height above ground of 20 m fig 4 this lead to a surface image footprint of 30 20 m and a resolution of about 5 mm the uav flew at a speed of 1 m s 1 with longitudinal and transversal overlaps of the images of 80 finally a total of 194 and 165 images was acquired for the eq and the wq respectively the altimetric maps of the quays were calculated using the photogrammetric approach the 3d reconstruction of a scene is realized from photographs taken at arbitrary angles quinn 1948 for this purpose the open source apero micmac code developped by the french national geographical institute ign was used deseilligny and cléry 2011 the processing of the data follows three steps detection of keypoints and matching between images using the sift algorithm lowe 2004 tapioca module calibration of the camera s internal parameters and determination of the 3d positions and orientations of the viewpoints snavely et al 2008 this step also allows the user to georeference manually the model using ground control points gcps at this stage a 3d undensified point cloud is produced tapas module dense matching densification of the point cloud calculated during the tapas processing furukawa and ponce 2010 malt module the tapioca processing leads to the detection of an average value of 10000 keypoints per image and for each quay after this step the model was georeferenced thanks to ground control points gcps within the tapas module for this purpose we used 29 and 31 gcps visible targets from the uav on the eq and wq respectively figure these points were georeferenced using a d rtk gnss receptor and were homogeneously placed on the quays the quality of the measurements was quantified by comparing these data with those obtained using the leveling network of le havre harbour the comparison was realized on 19 and 15 points for the wq and eq respectively as a result for the wq the mean error is 0 008 m 0 007 m in the x direction 0 018 m 0 012 m in the y direction and 0 043 m 0 018 m in the z direction for the eq the mean error is 0 007 m 0 007 cm in the x direction 0 021 m 0 007 m in the y direction and 0 027 m 0 017 cm in the z direction finally during the tapas processing the residual error for the 3d positioning and orientation of the tapas module is 0 8 pixel for both quays this value has to be lower than 1 pixel 3 2 tir survey the tir method allows to map the surface temperatures of a surface using a thermal camera for a given soil when no flow occurs many thermophysical and geometrical properties may control the diurnal cycle thermal signal the thermal inertia i j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 is the principal parameter controlling the amplitude and the shape of these thermal oscillations watson 1975 mellon et al 2000 putzig and mellon 2007 and albedo or reflectivity controls the average temperature fig 5 eventually when steep topography is present for instance with crest and valleys the surface temperatures may also be influenced by the geometry of the surfaces due to their orientation regarding the incident solar radiation whiteman et al 1989 khesin and eppelbaum 1994 eppelbaum et al 2014 in the case of the wq and eq the abscence of steep slopes prevents from the generation of important thermal gradients associated to topography thermal inertia represents the ability of the material to conduct and store the incident solar radiation at depth during the day and re emit this energy during the night it depends on the porosity and the pore size for instance rocks or compacted soils typically have high values of thermal inertia while loosely packed soils with fine grains exhibit lower values of thermal inertia thus when observed with a thermal camera compacted soils are warmer than loosely packed materials during daytime while the opposite situation is observed during nighttime this characteristic has been used for years with success for geological mapping sabins and floyd 1969 watson 1973 watson 1975 majumdar 2003 nasipuri et al 2005 using satellite and airborne thermal imagery thermal inertia is defined as a combination of the thermal conductivity k w m 1 k 1 the density ρ w m 3 and the heat capacity cp w kg 1 k 1 1 i k ρ c p as the volumetric heat capacity ρ c p has a low variability for soils and rocks mermoud 2006 the principal factor controlling the thermal inertia i is thus the thermal conductivity k in the presence of a flow the influence of surface properties thermal inertia and albedo on the temperature is reduced due to the mass movement of the fluid bringing or extracting heat from the soil the efficiency of the heat transfer depends on the nature of the fluid and the soil in fact their volumetric heat capacity ratio and their thermal conductivity and also on the darcy velocity of the fluid controlled by the permeability of the soil antoine et al 2009 thus we define a thermal anomaly as a thermal behavior which cannot be explained by surface properties such as thermal inertia or albedo this methodolody has already been successfully used in some of our works for hydrogeological applications from field works and satellite data antoine et al 2009 antoine et al 2017 lopez et al 2016 a thermal infrared campaign was realized at the same moment than the photogrammetric one i e in october 28th 2014 an optris pi400 lightweight thermal camera was used on board the uav to measure the surface temperature of the soil from 7h15 am to 16h30 pm sunrise around 7h30 during the survey this led to the acquisition a time series of 9 images for each quay during the survey the weather was clear thus allowing the flight of the drone with a small amount of rain and moderate precipitation was observed from october 20th to 24th on the harbour during this month the atmospheric temperature varied from 10 to 17 and the monthly mean temperature remained quasi stable the pi400 thermal camera uses an uncooled microbolometer technology to measure radiations in the range 7 14 μm and its thermal sensitivity is 0 08 the size of the sensor is 382 288 pixels sensor with a field of view fov value of 29 x 22 thus at a height of 150 m the camera is able to acquire a thermal scene of a whole quay with a pixel size of 40 cm the surface temperatures measured by the camera are corrected from the effects of the relative humidity of the air the atmospheric temperature and the distance of the target using the relationships provided by optris most of the building materials have emissivity parameter ranging from 0 90 to 0 96 thermoworks 2018 thus a mean emissivity of 0 93 was used to correct the surface temperature from the effect of emissivity the thermal images were then orthorectified using the arcgis software and georeferenced with the soil targets as well as remarquable objets on the thermal images rails quai borders etc 4 altimetry of the quays the fig 6 displays the altimetric maps obtained after the photogrammetric processing as well as longitudinal and tranverse profiles of the eq and wq respectively p1 and p2 figs 6b and d each map is overlaid with a simplified internal structural characteristics of the quay both quays exhibit an increase of the altitude towards land from 9 32 m to 9 90 m in the case of the eq and from 9 41 to 10 m for the wq the eq longitudinal profile shows the presence of four altimetric anomalies at the front of the quay e g depressions named aae1 to aae4 these depressions have a nearly similar morphology with the same depth over horizontal distance ratio the largest subsidence reaches up to 15 cm aae3 over a distance of 30 m the deepest one is aae1 with a vertical amplitude of 10 cm over a distance of 2 m in the transverse direction i e a slope of i e a slope of 3 interestingly the subsidences occur at the boundary between the backfill and the front concrete wall fig 3 for the wq two topographic depressions are observed at the back of the wq aaw1 and aaw2 with an amplitude reaching 10 cm over a distance of 2 m i e a slope of 3 here the subsidence occurs at the boundary between the quay and the land note that the depressions are not symmetric with the presence of a steep slope the southern one and a softer one northern slope this morphology may reflect the heterogeneous conditions within the quays from a lithological structural and geomechanical point of view 5 observation of surface temperatures in this section temperature maps of the wq and eq are presented as mentionned in section 3 2 a time series of 9 images was acquired for each quay for the sake of clarity we only show four snapshots acquired at 7h45 10h40 13 h and 16h30 fig 7 the first temperature map presented here was obtained at 7h45 it reveals temperatures with a minimum of 5 4 c and a maximum of 11 5 c for the quays fig 7a and b at that time the most distinguishable objects on the wq and eq are the railways yellow to red colored lineaments on the image with a temperature around 7 c at 10h40 more than 2 h after sunrise the soil is warming up fig 7c and d the surface temperature is observed in the range 7 5 c 14 5 c asphalt patches appear in red on the wq and eq warmer objects with temperatures between 10 c and 14 c indeed their very low albedo permits the absorption of an important amount of solar radiation during the morning and their quick warming surprisingly elongated cold areas appear on both quays taw1 taw2 and tae1 with a direction parallel to the structure and with a temperature around 9 c it is of note that this signal is not distinguishable in the early morning 7h45 during the afternoon 13 h and 16h30 fig 7e to h this cold zone become more and more noticeable on the wq with a temperature of about 14 c i e with a maximum temperature contrast reaching 2 3 c compared with the surrounding environment the same phenomenon is observed on the eq three cold areas tae1 to tae3 are perceptible at the front of the structure at 13 h with some of them parallel to the direction of the quay tae1 and tae2 they reach a similar temperature contrast than the wq with their surrounding environment i e about 2 3 c in the following sections we assess the influence of thermal inertia and albedo on the generation of the surface temperatures of the wq and eq and intent to explain the origin of the tae1 tae3 and taw1 taw2 cold zones it is of note that the size of these thermal anomalies is at least 2 m in the transverse direction i e easily analysable given the resolution of our temperature images 0 4 m 5 1 temperatures explained by surface properties fig 8 displays the altimetry data fig 8a and d the thermal images acquired at 13 h fig 8b and a classification of all indices present on the wq and eq fig 8c and f these images are superimposed with a simplified structural map of the quays as expected at the first order the essential part of the thermal patterns observed in section 5 can be explained by the presence of different materials on the quays i e asphalt backfill metal concrete or vegetation fig 8c and f the fig 9 displays several exemples of temperatures controlled by surface properties the influence of thermal inertia may be seen in fig 9a as shown theoretically in fig 5a due to their high thermal inertia compared to the pavement the railways appears warmer before sunrise and cooler during daytime with a contrast up to 1 5 c such observation is consistent with several previous results obtained using a tir camera watson 1975 sabins 2007 mellon et al 2000 antoine et al 2009 on the other hand dark colored material like asphalt having a low albedo a 0 07 may appear warmer than the pavement a 0 23 during the whole measurement time fig 9b as presented theoretically in fig 5b watson 1975 sabins 2007 finally vegetation also have a distinct thermal behavior as illustrated in fig 9c plants appear slightly cooler than the pavement during daytime from noon while being warmer during nightime in that case as described by sabins 2007 and whitehead et al 1986 transpiration lowers the leaf temperature and makes vegetation appearing cooler than soils during daytime during the night the insulating effect of air within the leaves and the important water content allow to retain heat resulting in warm nightime signature finally it is worth noting the conflicting effect of transpiration with thermal inertia in the vegetation surface temperature indeed plants have a lower thermal inertia than soils due to 1 lower densities and thermal conductivities of foliage compared to mineral constituents gates 1980 and hillel 1982 and 2 lower heat capacities for foliage compared to both mineral constituents and organic matter in soil hillel 1982 5 2 temperatures not explained by surface properties when closely analyzing the fig 8c and f tae1 tae2 taw1 and taw2 are all located on the same pavement thus thermal inertia variations can not be invoked to explain the important temperature constrasts of 2 3 c on the same material fig 9d and e display an exemple of temperature evolution for taw1 and tae1 these signals have a similar evolution being several degrees cooler than the pavement during nightime and daytime which is not consistent with a variation controlled by thermal conductivity the thermal behavior of tae3 is interesting fig 9f first it is characterized by a cold anomaly like the others but the material is different i e backfill fig 8e and f second tae3 is cooler than the surrounding pavement during daytime nevertheless unconsolidated loosely packed materials are known to have a lower thermal inertia than solid rocks like pavements due to a lower thermal conductivity and density mellon et al 2000 putzig and mellon 2007 as a consequence they may appear warmer than solid rocks during the day which is the opposite of our observation this last finding definitely rules out the role of thermal inertia on the signal variation the fig 10 presents a zoom on the surface at the locations of taw1 taw2 tae1 and tae2 it is clear that no particular contrast in color is observed on the pavement able to explain the thermal spatial variations moreover as the pavement is made with the same limestone material it is doubtful that emissivity variations may explain such thermal contrasts for both quays our data suggest a good correlation between the thermal anomalies and the topographic depressions present on both quays except for aae3 where no significant thermal contrast is observed within the backfill even though the material thermally evolves in the same way than tae3 the fig 11 presents an example of comparison between a transverse topographic profile and a thermal profile for the wq t1 fig 11a and b the eq t2 fig 11c and d interestingly the minimum of temperature appears to be spatially related with the flanck of the deformations for both cases this finding may not be justified by a thermal effet associated to the topography of these depressions for several reasons 1 because of the weak amplitude of the subsidences preventing for the occurence of shadows section 4 and 2 because of the e w orientation of the quays which may receive the same amount of energy on their whole surfaces during daytime this last idea is difficult to reconcile with the presence of e w elongated thermal anomalies on the quays finally together these observations are correlated with the structure of the quays as mentioned in section 4 and illustrated in figs 3 and 11 boundary between the internal concrete wall and the backfill for the eq and boundary between the quay and the land for the wq inducing elongated thermal anomalies such limits may represent fragile areas for the generation of subsurface voids in the next sections we investigate the influence of subsurface process on the thermal signal 6 thermal influence of an insulating subsurface cavity within the quays 2d conductive radiative numerical modelling the previous section shows that the observed taw1 taw2 tae1 and tae2 thermal anomalies 1 may not be explained neither by a contrast of thermal inertia associated to a different material nor by albedo contrasts and 2 are correlated with topographic depressions associated to potential subsurface cavities or decompressed areas as a consequence a subsurface process must be associated to this anomalous signal in order to show the influence of a thermally insulating body within the quay a 2d conductive radiative numerical simulation of the eq is realized our objective is to assess the first order surface temperature signal induced by a simplified air filled area at depth 6 1 equations and surface energy budget in the following we review the basic 2 d equations describing the diurnal temperature profile t x z t through the quay x designates the horizontal distance m z represents the depth m and t the time s respectively we solve the transient conductive heat equation with the finite elements scheme second order in time and space for a soil layer of thickness d 9 5 m with a spatial resolution of 1 cm and time step of 5 min the astronomical geographical and optical parameters of the model their assumed values and their units are summarized in table 1 this model is based on the equations published in antoine et al 2009 and extended in 2d in this study using the comsol multiphysics numerical suite heat transfer module the simulation were done for a transverse section of the quay to save computer time this assumption may be valid from a physical point of view as the lenght over width ratio of the quay is important the simulations performed for the eq take into account the geometry of the structure and a scheme of the numerical model is given in fig 12 the quay exibits a complex geotechnical configuration including backfill limestone rubles granite rubles limestone pavement coarse concrete wall fig 3 in order to simplify the modelling four categories of dry materials were considered limestone c1 c2 c5 in fig 12 concrete c3 granite c4 and backfill c6 the values of the physical parameters used for these materials thermal conductivity density heat constant are given in table 2 the transient temperature in the soil t x z t is solution of the equation 2 t x z t t κ 2 t x t x 2 2 t z t z 2 where x is the horizontal distance m z is the depth m t is the time s and κ is the thermal diffusivity of the soil which is related to the thermal conductivity k the heat capacity c p and the mass density ρ of the soil through 3 κ k nh s a zero heat flux condition is set at the lower boundary of the model for a flat surface the surface temperature during a diurnal cycle depends on the solar heat flux i s the soil radiative emission i e and the atmospheric radiative flux i l thus the boundary condition at the surface is given from

the maximum of the solar incident radiations and the maximum air temperature this model results in a minimum air temperature at the sunrise and a maximum air temperature at t ph after the zenith

see fig 3 where the ocean level is the lowest thus in this case the presence of unsaturated areas within the quay are the most probable with high thermal conductivity contrasts between the soil and air at this level the temperature of the lower boundary of the structure is considered as constant 10 c at a first approximation to simulate the presence of a cavity within the medium we introduce a simplified vertical air filled zone at the back of the concrete material fig 3 the implementation of this zone at such location may be understandable from a geotechnical point of view since the backfill is the most probable material subject to cavities voids or decompressed areas due to the withdrawal of fine grained materials when water enters the structure it is also consistent with the thermal observations as the tae1 and tae2 anomalies are found at the boundary between the concrete and the backfill and are elongated along this boundary figs 3 and 7b finally this air filled case represents a good candidate for the simulation of important spatial variations of temperature within the medium because the important contrast of thermal conductivity between air and rock 6 2 numerical results in this section we present several simulations for the eq and for 3 differents cases as the depth of the potential voids is not known 1 absence of cavity within the quay 2 presence of a cavity at 3 m depth 3 presence of a cavity at 1 m depth for each case we present the 2d thermal field within the eq fig 13 a c and e as well as a temperature profile at the surface fig 13 b d and f calculated at 13 h for more thermal contrasts the fig 13a presents the 2d temperature behavior of the eq in the absence of cavity as the result is presented at 13 h the surface is the hottest part of the medium the heat diffuses within the quay from the surface up to a depth of 2 m the isotherms are very slighly deformed at the front of the quay due to the thermal conductivity contrast between the concrete present at the front of the quay and the backfill fig 3 as the thermal conductivity is higher in the concrete material at depth a slight decrease of the surface temperature is generated in this part of the quay fig 16a and b such temperature difference between the concrete and the backfill here less than 0 5 c is obviously impossible to substract from the diurnal cycle finally the heterogeneous temperature field within the quay is illustrated by the vertical profile given in fig 14a where temperature variation up to 15 c can be encountered due to the thermal conductivity contrasts within the structure the second case represents the thermal behavior of the quay when a cavity is present at 3 m depth as said in the previous section it consists of a vertical zone having the thermal conductivity of the air located within the backfill just at the back of the concrete the general thermal pattern is similar to the first case but the isotherms are deformed within and above the cavity as it acts as a thermal insulator within the medium fig 13c at the surface the temperature decreases from the back to the front of the quay with a maximum temperature contrast of 0 5 c fig 13d but the temperature variation above the cavity is not significant nevertheless it is interesting to note that in comparison with the model without cavity the surface horizontal thermal gradient is more important in this case increase of temperature with a shorter wavelength this spatial variation may be due to the deformation of the isotherms associated with the insulating body at depth however such increase in temperature and variation in the shape of the temperature profile are likely difficult to observe with a thermal camera considering the amplitude of the diurnal cycle the vertical temperature profile shown in fig 14b is slightly shifted towards higher temperatures above the cavity although the general shape of the signal remains controlled by the thermal conductivities of the structure within the quay the temperature profile is clearly modified when penetrating within the air filled area such change is due to the high contrast between the air and the materials of the eq the last case displays the thermal behavior of the structure with a cavity located at 1 m depth fig 13e and f i e very close to the surface here the subsurface isotherms are strongly deformed due to the presence of the cavity fig 13e at the surface the temperature profile follows the general thermal trend of the previous case lowest temperatures at the front of the quay with a similar short wavelength but the maximum of temperature is found just above the cavity the maximum temperature contrast is 0 9 c with the front of the quay and less than 0 4 c with the back of the structure this result is consistent with the observations of eppelbaum 2007 who found a warm zone temperature anomaly of 0 3 c just above a 1 m depth underground cavity using 40 cm depth temperature sensors fig 15 our modelling tends to show that a cavity close to subsurface may produce a thermal signal by its own due to the 2 order magnitude difference between the thermal conductivities of the air and of the soil indeed the lowest is the depth the highest is the amplitude of the thermal anomaly it is of note that the thermal effect of such insulating zone for this given structure remains limited less that 1 c up to a depth of 1 m and probably not enough to be currently detected in that case the vertical temperature profile given in fig 14c is drastically modified by the air filled area interestingly in the first meter below the surface the shape of the signal is very different from the 3 m depth case as the thermal perturbation induced by the cavity interacts with the daily surface heat waves propagating through the pavement and the backfill then below one meter the air filled area generate a thermal anomaly but with a whole shape still controlled by the thermal behavior of the eq these three simulations show that an air filled cavity may directly influence the temperature pattern at the surface of the soil at depth the isotherms are deformed at the vicinities of the air filled cavity due to the high contrast of thermal conductivities between air and rock this situation may induce a variation of the surface temperature pattern in two ways 1 an increase of the thermal gradient here by one order of magnitude 0 02 c m 1 without cavity to 0 2 c m 1 for a location at 3 m depth and 2 the generation of a maximum of temperature reaching 0 4 to 0 9 c above the cavity at 1 m depth at mid day despite the high thermal sensitivity of the current thermal cameras 0 01 c m 1 such a signal clearly remains a challenge to discriminate from the variations associated to the diurnal cycle in addition our models were performed using the highest contrast between thermal conductivities air and rock inducing the maximum temperature contrast at the surface in the case of high tides potentially generating water filled voids with temperature contrasts between the rock and the liquid the situation may be more complex as 1 the thermal signal may be accordingly attenuated because of the reduced drop of thermal conductivity for water 0 02 w m 1 k 1 for air and 0 6 w m 1 k 1 for water and 2 the absence of thermal equilibrium between the water and rock may generate addionnal thermal gradients following turcotte and schubert 2002 a time l2 κ is required for temperature changes to propagate a distance l and for a thermal diffusivity κ thus taking a value κ in the range 10 7 m 2 s 1 10 6 m 2 s 1 for an unconsolidated material like backfill and a value l of 3 m the time needed for the temperature changes arriving at the surface is in the range 3 months 3 years for a value l of 1 m this time is reduced in the range 10 days 3 months such values shows that a thermal signal associated to water within the water may be mostly masked by seasonal temperature variations finally the results show that the generation of a warm area above the cavity is inconsistent with our observations on the wq and the eq in the next section an alternative physical phenomenon is suggested to explain the cold areas associated to the deformations of the quays 7 on the thermal influence of potential fluid flows within the wq and eq in the previous sections we have shown that most of the thermal signal of the eq and wq may be explained by surface indices surface properties however cool areas persist during daytime that can not be explained 1 by contrasts associated to thermal inertia albedo or topography and 2 nor by the direct thermal effect of a subsurface cavity located at shallow depth however surprisingly these observations are correlated with deformations as well as the structure of the quays other processes associated to the presence of a fluid have been searched to explain these temperature drops for instance water standing at the surface is cooler during the day and warmer during the night sabins 2007 nevertheless the presence of a slope at the location of the thermal anomaly prevents for any stay of water ruling out this hypothesis possible drainage of the fluids within the quays implies the generation of a preferential vertical permeability field in the case of the wq and eq thermal anomalies are located on the flancks of local subsidences fig 11 from a mechanical point of view it is known that the slopes of such depressions are subject to extensive stresses while the center topographic low may be rather under compressive forces fig 16 berenger et al 2014 al halbouni et al 2018 al halbouni et al 2019 yin et al 2019 consequently these extensive stresses tend to generate a preferential vertical permeability within the joints of the pavement through micro fracturation while the compressive forces may close the fractures at the center of the topographic depressions these micro fractures may not appear everywhere around the deformation as the medium constituting the quays is hightly heterogeneous with the presence of backfill and concrete we propose an alternative cooling mecanism induced by water infiltration through micro fractures in the pavement for tae1 tae2 taw1 and taw2 and within the backfill for tae3 to explain our observations indeed the analysis of meteorological data at stations close to le havre harbour cap de la heve and octeville indicates that the october month was particularly rainy with intermittent to continuous rainfall fig 17 important rainfall ocurred until october 16 h up to 24 mm while moderate precipitation was recorded from october 20th to october 24th for le havre city from 1 6 to 4 mm h during the following days the weather was strongly disturbed with a high humidity content on the atmosphere around 80 of relative humidity and an important decrease of the hourly solar radiation from 15 h of sunshine on october 22th to 7 h on october 28th and small rain on october 28th many works report changes in soil temperature caused by percolating water following rainfall or irrigation callendar 1895 franklin 1921 shul gin et al 1958 wierenga et al 1979 experimentally and numerically characterized the thermal effect of infiltration on the shallow subsurface he measured the temperatures of a soil irrigated with cool 4 c and warm 21 c water at different depths surface to 20 cm the author shown that irrigation whatever the temperature of the water results in lowering the soil temperature below those of non irrigated soil during several days due to darcy flow as displayed in fig 18 eventually the thermal anomaly can persist a longer time below 20 cm depth due to thermal diffusion wierenga et al 1979 explained this observation by heat tranfer between occuring by water movement the cooling of the soil during water infiltration is also described in the numerical results of lopez et al 2016 for water flow within a sedimentary basin in the case of le havre harbour we propose that the autumn rain in normandy penetrates the soil of the quays through micro fractures located on the flancks of the deformations this infiltration may induce a cooling of the medium by several degrees celcius wierenga et al 1979 due to the highest darcy velocity of the water within the fissures compared to the rest of the quay during infiltration the darcy velocity is controlled by the effective permeability k of the medium m 2 defined as k d3 12f where d is the fissure aperture m and f is the spacing between fissures m for an aperture of 0 1 mm and a spacing f 1 m k 10 13 m 2 while this value drops to 10 10 m 2 when d 1 mm i e a range comparable to the permeability of the sand heat transfer between rock and water is enhanced due to the downward movement of the fluid and its important volumetric thermal capacity ρ w cp w as illustrated in fig 18 this cooling may last several hours after the occurence of infiltration before equilibrium eventually during after the infiltration process the evaporation of the water remained stuck on the walls of the fissures by surface tension may also participate to the persistence of the cooling of the medium geiger 1965 van bavel and hillel 1976 depending on the incoming solar radiation the atmospheric water content and temperature the presence of wind and the amount of water available within the soil it is currently difficult for us to discriminate the relative influence of infiltration and evaporation on the surface temperatures besides the following elements may be highlighted the detection of cold anomalies located on the deformations was confirmed for both quays by a second campaign realized in march 2015 19 just after rainy days this is remarkable considering that the survey was performed during another season and thus different radiative meteorological and soil temperature conditions the 2015 survey emphasizes several points 1 the detection of thermal anomalies is repeatable using our methodology 2 their morphology is comparable to 2014 and 3 important thermal contrasts are observed similar to 2014 i e 3 c in that case it is proposed that evaporation may influence the surface temperatures to a lesser extent than infiltration considering the observed difference in the daily average solar radiation in october 138 w m 2 and march 219 w m 2 in le havre city see the irradiation geographical information system for europe for details as the evaporation rate directly depends on the incoming solar radiation a different evaporation rate may be induced at the surface and thus different temperature contrasts which is not what we observe obviously further investigations may lead with no doubt to a better evaluation of the role of these two components infiltration and evaporation on the thermal field numerical modelling may be improved in several ways 1 implementation of fluid flow in unsaturated media physics taking into account radiative surface boundary condition 2 integration of meteorologic radiative and optical albedo field data as input for the modelling for instance albedo maps may be obtained using pyranometers on board drones levy et al 2018 and considerably improve the description of the radiative surface boundary condition and 3 implementation of radiative processes for sloped surfaces to characterize the link between topography and surface temperatures finally analogical experiments may be realized on several soils types in a climatic chamber in order to characterize the link between infiltration evaporation and thermal infrared observations in this frame the combination of remote sensing and geophysical data measuring electric or dielectric parameters may be useful to quantify the relationships between water flow evaporation rates and soil temperatures 8 conclusions visible and thermal infrared observations obtained with a light uav are presented on two port quays photographies are used to calculate altimetric maps of the structures by means of the photogrammetric method while thermal images serve to monitor semi diurnal temperature variations of the surface the analysis of the altimetric data reveals several deformations at the surface of the wq and the eq and associated to potential subsurface cavities decompressed areas at depth the study of thermal maps show that the major part of surface temperatures observed on the wq and the eq may be explained by thermal inertia and albedo nevertheless five cold areas taw1 taw2 and tae1 to tae3 are revealed on the quays not explained by these parameters these anomalies appear in the morning and persist during the all day with a temperature contrast with the surrounding environment ranging from 2 to 4 c alongside this observation a clear correlation is found between thermal anomalies deformations identified on the altimetric data and the structure of the quays more precisely the minimum of temperature of the cold regions are located on the flancks of the deformations the origin of this correlation is then investigated a simplified 2d model is developped to quantify the direct surface thermal influence of a subsurface cavity when present at two different depths 3 m and 1 m below the surface these simulations show that 1 the gradient of the surface temperature may vary when a subsurface cavity decompressed area is present at depth 2 a hot thermal anomaly is induced at the surface by a cavity decompressed area at depth during the day which is inconsistent with our observations and 3 the amplitude of the anomaly less than 1 c may be too low to be detected by tir cameras given the amplitude of the diurnal cycle in this study we only made 2d simulations to assess the first order characteristics of the thermal pattern but 3d thermal patterns may clearly be present within the medium due to the complexity of the structures of the quays such consideration must be taken into account in future works we explain the cold anomalies and their correlation with the deformations by the cooling induced by infiltration and subsequent evaporation of water through micro fractures permitting the persistence of the anomaly several hours after rainfalls as a consequence we argue that the high permeability of the medium induced by stresses within the medium when a cavity decompressed soil is present may control the surface temperatures observed on both wq and eq to our knowledge this study is the first establishing a link between thermal anomalies and surface deformations associated to subsurface cavities decompressed areas such result is made possible given the new capabilities of u a vs able to monitor port quays and more broadly civil engineering structures at high resolution low cost and in a very flexible way finally these methods may also be very useful for the detection of subsurface voids in clayey soils where classical geophysical tools

5377,this work presents for the first time associated thermal anomalies and deformations over subsurface cavities voids located within two harbour quays in le havre harbourg normandy france an u a v unmanned aerial vehicle was used to acquire visible and thermal images over a diurnal cycle from 7 a m to 5 p m the visible images were processed to realize an altimetric model of the platforms by mean of the photogrammetric method while the thermal infrared tir images were used to study the evolution of their surface temperatures the obtained 3d model shows the location of five topographic depressions on both quays the analysis of the evolution of the surface thermal field leads to the detection of cold thermal anomalies that are 1 not correlated to surface properties and 2 spatially associated to the flanks of the five topographic depressions using a 2d conductive radiative model we show that these anomalies are not directly due to the thermally insulating effect of an air filled area finally we conclude that preferential infiltration and subsequent evaporation in the micro fracturation present within the flanks of the depressions may be responsible for the strong cooling of these zones keywords remote sensing thermal infrared photogrammetry infiltration subsurface cavity natural hazards uav 1 introduction subsurface cavities voids are important safety and economical issues for land use planning in this context the identification characterization of these objects remains an important challenge for stakeholders as well as for scientists recently in situ

portugal using micro gravity and eri 3d inversions de giorgi and leucci 2014 imaged shallow subsurface structures including karstic features below a road in the salento peninsula apulia region south italy carrying out a seismic refraction tomography and gpr survey integrated interpretation led to the delineation of hazard zone rich with karstic features and cavities mochales et al 2008 proposed a methodology based on the sequential application of magnetic gpr and microgravity techniques to detect underground cavities and dolines cardarelli et al 2009 used the joint interpretation of eri and seismic refraction tomography to map artificial cavities in the city of rome finally in situ soil temperature sensors were also deployed to detect subsurface cavities interestingly mosciki 2006 shown that thermal anomalies associated to underground cavities can reach up to 1 c from field measurements and numerical modelling although in situ measurements are very useful on a local scale they remain difficult to implement on important surfaces and thus are economically unviable remote sensing have also adressed the problem of subsurface cavities for many years using aerial or satellite observations ruth and degner 1963 peters et al 1996 youssef et al 2012 lee et al 2016 kim et al 2019 jeffery et al 2020 for instance youssef et al 2020 integrated remote sensing landsat imagery with

other limestone rocks with an airborne multispectral scanner and thermal infrared tir data this last method allows to map the surface temperatures of a soil using a camera several teams in the world have shown the importance of tir method to map geological structures watson 1975 sabins 2007 nasipuri et al 2005 hydrothermal systems antoine et al 2009 gaudin et al 2013 to characterize water

potentiality of the tir method for the characterization of subsurface cavities rinker 1975 wynne et al 2008 lee et al 2016 few is known about the origin of the observed thermal anomalies especially when slight subsidence is observed as a consequence the methodology to adopt to detect these objects before a collapse event remains unclear in 2014 a tir and visible survey was performed above two parts of the joannes couvert platform le havre harbour the west and east quays hereafter named as wq and eq respectively these structures were selected because of the continuous formation of subsurface voids for each area the observations were acquired with an uav during a semi diurnal cycle allowing the tir monitoring of the surface temperatures from sunrise to late afternoon and the acquisition of visible images after a presentation of the geotechnical context and the methodology used for this survey the surface temperatures and the altimetric map obtained by photogrammetry are shown for the wq and eq cold areas associated to surface deformations are detected on both quays with a temperature contrast of 2 4 c compared to the surrounding environment the effect of the surface properties thermal inertia albedo on the thermal signal are first investigated as they represent the main factors affecting the surface temperatures of the soil then a simplified 2d conductive radiative model of heat transfer is developped within one quay namely the eq in order to evaluate the direct thermal influence of a subsurface cavity on the surface temperatures finally the last section is dedicated to the analysis of the role of potential fluid flow on the measured signal accross the deformed quays 2 geotechnical context le havre harbour is built in the northern part of the estuary of the seine river in le havre city normandy and is essentially composed of heterogeneous materials resulting from the world war 2 bombing the study sites the west and east quays hereafter named the wqand eq are located at the center of the harbour and is part of the joannes couvert quay fig 1 this kilometric size platform was part of the famous transatlantic cruise terminal in the 1930s the building plan of the quays is known and in particular the backfills are massively composed of the war debris stones and fines materials over the years the infiltration of salted water associated to storms and tides within the structure lead to the withdrawal of the fine particules from the quays and generated the formation of subsurface cavities as well as local surface subsidences fig 2 the fig 3 shows the structure of the wq and the eq respectively the wq is mainly composed of concrete backfill a concrete slab and backfill between 0 m and 9 50 m interestingly the internal structure of the eq is very different and essentially constituted of limestone masonry in its lower part under 0 m a m s l a concrete pile and a coarse concrete wall between 0 m and 9 50 m a backside backfill forming the major part of the quay volume above 0 m both quays are covered with pavement having an approximate thickness of 10 cm fig 1a and b various indices can be observed at the surface of the structures pavement the main constituant of the quay metallic materials such as railways unconsolidated backfills employed to fill previous subsidences dark asphalt patches sparce local vegetation 3 field survey and methodology 3 1 photogrammetric survey here our first objective is to detect surface deformations associated to potential subsurface voids using altimetric data to do so a photogrammetric survey of the eq and wq was performed on october 2014 we used a drone equipped with a sony nex 5r digital camera verticaally positionned and acquiring images 4912 3264 px the focal lenght of the camera is 16 mm 35 mm equivalent 24 mm and the sensor size is 23 4 x 15 6 mm the survey was realized along a pre defined flight plan with a longitudinal acquisition at a height above ground of 20 m fig 4 this lead to a surface image footprint of 30 20 m and a resolution of about 5 mm the uav flew at a speed of 1 m s 1 with longitudinal and transversal overlaps of the images of 80 finally a total of 194 and 165 images was acquired for the eq and the wq respectively the altimetric maps of the quays were calculated using the photogrammetric approach the 3d reconstruction of a scene is realized from photographs taken at arbitrary angles quinn 1948 for this purpose the open source apero micmac code developped by the french national geographical institute ign was used deseilligny and cléry 2011 the processing of the data follows three steps detection of keypoints and matching between images using the sift algorithm lowe 2004 tapioca module calibration of the camera s internal parameters and determination of the 3d positions and orientations of the viewpoints snavely et al 2008 this step also allows the user to georeference manually the model using ground control points gcps at this stage a 3d undensified point cloud is produced tapas module dense matching densification of the point cloud calculated during the tapas processing furukawa and ponce 2010 malt module the tapioca processing leads to the detection of an average value of 10000 keypoints per image and for each quay after this step the model was georeferenced thanks to ground control points gcps within the tapas module for this purpose we used 29 and 31 gcps visible targets from the uav on the eq and wq respectively figure these points were georeferenced using a d rtk gnss receptor and were homogeneously placed on the quays the quality of the measurements was quantified by comparing these data with those obtained using the leveling network of le havre harbour the comparison was realized on 19 and 15 points for the wq and eq respectively as a result for the wq the mean error is 0 008 m 0 007 m in the x direction 0 018 m 0 012 m in the y direction and 0 043 m 0 018 m in the z direction for the eq the mean error is 0 007 m 0 007 cm in the x direction 0 021 m 0 007 m in the y direction and 0 027 m 0 017 cm in the z direction finally during the tapas processing the residual error for the 3d positioning and orientation of the tapas module is 0 8 pixel for both quays this value has to be lower than 1 pixel 3 2 tir survey the tir method allows to map the surface temperatures of a surface using a thermal camera for a given soil when no flow occurs many thermophysical and geometrical properties may control the diurnal cycle thermal signal the thermal inertia i j m 2 k 1 s 1 2 is the principal parameter controlling the amplitude and the shape of these thermal oscillations watson 1975 mellon et al 2000 putzig and mellon 2007 and albedo or reflectivity controls the average temperature fig 5 eventually when steep topography is present for instance with crest and valleys the surface temperatures may also be influenced by the geometry of the surfaces due to their orientation regarding the incident solar radiation whiteman et al 1989 khesin and eppelbaum 1994 eppelbaum et al 2014 in the case of the wq and eq the abscence of steep slopes prevents from the generation of important thermal gradients associated to topography thermal inertia represents the ability of the material to conduct and store the incident solar radiation at depth during the day and re emit this energy during the night it depends on the porosity and the pore size for instance rocks or compacted soils typically have high values of thermal inertia while loosely packed soils with fine grains exhibit lower values of thermal inertia thus when observed with a thermal camera compacted soils are warmer than loosely packed materials during daytime while the opposite situation is observed during nighttime this characteristic has been used for years with success for geological mapping sabins and floyd 1969 watson 1973 watson 1975 majumdar 2003 nasipuri et al 2005 using satellite and airborne thermal imagery thermal inertia is defined as a combination of the thermal conductivity k w m 1 k 1 the density ρ w m 3 and the heat capacity cp w kg 1 k 1 1 i k ρ c p as the volumetric heat capacity ρ c p has a low variability for soils and rocks mermoud 2006 the principal factor controlling the thermal inertia i is thus the thermal conductivity k in the presence of a flow the influence of surface properties thermal inertia and albedo on the temperature is reduced due to the mass movement of the fluid bringing or extracting heat from the soil the efficiency of the heat transfer depends on the nature of the fluid and the soil in fact their volumetric heat capacity ratio and their thermal conductivity and also on the darcy velocity of the fluid controlled by the permeability of the soil antoine et al 2009 thus we define a thermal anomaly as a thermal behavior which cannot be explained by surface properties such as thermal inertia or albedo this methodolody has already been successfully used in some of our works for hydrogeological applications from field works and satellite data antoine et al 2009 antoine et al 2017 lopez et al 2016 a thermal infrared campaign was realized at the same moment than the photogrammetric one i e in october 28th 2014 an optris pi400 lightweight thermal camera was used on board the uav to measure the surface temperature of the soil from 7h15 am to 16h30 pm sunrise around 7h30 during the survey this led to the acquisition a time series of 9 images for each quay during the survey the weather was clear thus allowing the flight of the drone with a small amount of rain and moderate precipitation was observed from october 20th to 24th on the harbour during this month the atmospheric temperature varied from 10 to 17 and the monthly mean temperature remained quasi stable the pi400 thermal camera uses an uncooled microbolometer technology to measure radiations in the range 7 14 μm and its thermal sensitivity is 0 08 the size of the sensor is 382 288 pixels sensor with a field of view fov value of 29 x 22 thus at a height of 150 m the camera is able to acquire a thermal scene of a whole quay with a pixel size of 40 cm the surface temperatures measured by the camera are corrected from the effects of the relative humidity of the air the atmospheric temperature and the distance of the target using the relationships provided by optris most of the building materials have emissivity parameter ranging from 0 90 to 0 96 thermoworks 2018 thus a mean emissivity of 0 93 was used to correct the surface temperature from the effect of emissivity the thermal images were then orthorectified using the arcgis software and georeferenced with the soil targets as well as remarquable objets on the thermal images rails quai borders etc 4 altimetry of the quays the fig 6 displays the altimetric maps obtained after the photogrammetric processing as well as longitudinal and tranverse profiles of the eq and wq respectively p1 and p2 figs 6b and d each map is overlaid with a simplified internal structural characteristics of the quay both quays exhibit an increase of the altitude towards land from 9 32 m to 9 90 m in the case of the eq and from 9 41 to 10 m for the wq the eq longitudinal profile shows the presence of four altimetric anomalies at the front of the quay e g depressions named aae1 to aae4 these depressions have a nearly similar morphology with the same depth over horizontal distance ratio the largest subsidence reaches up to 15 cm aae3 over a distance of 30 m the deepest one is aae1 with a vertical amplitude of 10 cm over a distance of 2 m in the transverse direction i e a slope of i e a slope of 3 interestingly the subsidences occur at the boundary between the backfill and the front concrete wall fig 3 for the wq two topographic depressions are observed at the back of the wq aaw1 and aaw2 with an amplitude reaching 10 cm over a distance of 2 m i e a slope of 3 here the subsidence occurs at the boundary between the quay and the land note that the depressions are not symmetric with the presence of a steep slope the southern one and a softer one northern slope this morphology may reflect the heterogeneous conditions within the quays from a lithological structural and geomechanical point of view 5 observation of surface temperatures in this section temperature maps of the wq and eq are presented as mentionned in section 3 2 a time series of 9 images was acquired for each quay for the sake of clarity we only show four snapshots acquired at 7h45 10h40 13 h and 16h30 fig 7 the first temperature map presented here was obtained at 7h45 it reveals temperatures with a minimum of 5 4 c and a maximum of 11 5 c for the quays fig 7a and b at that time the most distinguishable objects on the wq and eq are the railways yellow to red colored lineaments on the image with a temperature around 7 c at 10h40 more than 2 h after sunrise the soil is warming up fig 7c and d the surface temperature is observed in the range 7 5 c 14 5 c asphalt patches appear in red on the wq and eq warmer objects with temperatures between 10 c and 14 c indeed their very low albedo permits the absorption of an important amount of solar radiation during the morning and their quick warming surprisingly elongated cold areas appear on both quays taw1 taw2 and tae1 with a direction parallel to the structure and with a temperature around 9 c it is of note that this signal is not distinguishable in the early morning 7h45 during the afternoon 13 h and 16h30 fig 7e to h this cold zone become more and more noticeable on the wq with a temperature of about 14 c i e with a maximum temperature contrast reaching 2 3 c compared with the surrounding environment the same phenomenon is observed on the eq three cold areas tae1 to tae3 are perceptible at the front of the structure at 13 h with some of them parallel to the direction of the quay tae1 and tae2 they reach a similar temperature contrast than the wq with their surrounding environment i e about 2 3 c in the following sections we assess the influence of thermal inertia and albedo on the generation of the surface temperatures of the wq and eq and intent to explain the origin of the tae1 tae3 and taw1 taw2 cold zones it is of note that the size of these thermal anomalies is at least 2 m in the transverse direction i e easily analysable given the resolution of our temperature images 0 4 m 5 1 temperatures explained by surface properties fig 8 displays the altimetry data fig 8a and d the thermal images acquired at 13 h fig 8b and a classification of all indices present on the wq and eq fig 8c and f these images are superimposed with a simplified structural map of the quays as expected at the first order the essential part of the thermal patterns observed in section 5 can be explained by the presence of different materials on the quays i e asphalt backfill metal concrete or vegetation fig 8c and f the fig 9 displays several exemples of temperatures controlled by surface properties the influence of thermal inertia may be seen in fig 9a as shown theoretically in fig 5a due to their high thermal inertia compared to the pavement the railways appears warmer before sunrise and cooler during daytime with a contrast up to 1 5 c such observation is consistent with several previous results obtained using a tir camera watson 1975 sabins 2007 mellon et al 2000 antoine et al 2009 on the other hand dark colored material like asphalt having a low albedo a 0 07 may appear warmer than the pavement a 0 23 during the whole measurement time fig 9b as presented theoretically in fig 5b watson 1975 sabins 2007 finally vegetation also have a distinct thermal behavior as illustrated in fig 9c plants appear slightly cooler than the pavement during daytime from noon while being warmer during nightime in that case as described by sabins 2007 and whitehead et al 1986 transpiration lowers the leaf temperature and makes vegetation appearing cooler than soils during daytime during the night the insulating effect of air within the leaves and the important water content allow to retain heat resulting in warm nightime signature finally it is worth noting the conflicting effect of transpiration with thermal inertia in the vegetation surface temperature indeed plants have a lower thermal inertia than soils due to 1 lower densities and thermal conductivities of foliage compared to mineral constituents gates 1980 and hillel 1982 and 2 lower heat capacities for foliage compared to both mineral constituents and organic matter in soil hillel 1982 5 2 temperatures not explained by surface properties when closely analyzing the fig 8c and f tae1 tae2 taw1 and taw2 are all located on the same pavement thus thermal inertia variations can not be invoked to explain the important temperature constrasts of 2 3 c on the same material fig 9d and e display an exemple of temperature evolution for taw1 and tae1 these signals have a similar evolution being several degrees cooler than the pavement during nightime and daytime which is not consistent with a variation controlled by thermal conductivity the thermal behavior of tae3 is interesting fig 9f first it is characterized by a cold anomaly like the others but the material is different i e backfill fig 8e and f second tae3 is cooler than the surrounding pavement during daytime nevertheless unconsolidated loosely packed materials are known to have a lower thermal inertia than solid rocks like pavements due to a lower thermal conductivity and density mellon et al 2000 putzig and mellon 2007 as a consequence they may appear warmer than solid rocks during the day which is the opposite of our observation this last finding definitely rules out the role of thermal inertia on the signal variation the fig 10 presents a zoom on the surface at the locations of taw1 taw2 tae1 and tae2 it is clear that no particular contrast in color is observed on the pavement able to explain the thermal spatial variations moreover as the pavement is made with the same limestone material it is doubtful that emissivity variations may explain such thermal contrasts for both quays our data suggest a good correlation between the thermal anomalies and the topographic depressions present on both quays except for aae3 where no significant thermal contrast is observed within the backfill even though the material thermally evolves in the same way than tae3 the fig 11 presents an example of comparison between a transverse topographic profile and a thermal profile for the wq t1 fig 11a and b the eq t2 fig 11c and d interestingly the minimum of temperature appears to be spatially related with the flanck of the deformations for both cases this finding may not be justified by a thermal effet associated to the topography of these depressions for several reasons 1 because of the weak amplitude of the subsidences preventing for the occurence of shadows section 4 and 2 because of the e w orientation of the quays which may receive the same amount of energy on their whole surfaces during daytime this last idea is difficult to reconcile with the presence of e w elongated thermal anomalies on the quays finally together these observations are correlated with the structure of the quays as mentioned in section 4 and illustrated in figs 3 and 11 boundary between the internal concrete wall and the backfill for the eq and boundary between the quay and the land for the wq inducing elongated thermal anomalies such limits may represent fragile areas for the generation of subsurface voids in the next sections we investigate the influence of subsurface process on the thermal signal 6 thermal influence of an insulating subsurface cavity within the quays 2d conductive radiative numerical modelling the previous section shows that the observed taw1 taw2 tae1 and tae2 thermal anomalies 1 may not be explained neither by a contrast of thermal inertia associated to a different material nor by albedo contrasts and 2 are correlated with topographic depressions associated to potential subsurface cavities or decompressed areas as a consequence a subsurface process must be associated to this anomalous signal in order to show the influence of a thermally insulating body within the quay a 2d conductive radiative numerical simulation of the eq is realized our objective is to assess the first order surface temperature signal induced by a simplified air filled area at depth 6 1 equations and surface energy budget in the following we review the basic 2 d equations describing the diurnal temperature profile t x z t through the quay x designates the horizontal distance m z represents the depth m and t the time s respectively we solve the transient conductive heat equation with the finite elements scheme second order in time and space for a soil layer of thickness d 9 5 m with a spatial resolution of 1 cm and time step of 5 min the astronomical geographical and optical parameters of the model their assumed values and their units are summarized in table 1 this model is based on the equations published in antoine et al 2009 and extended in 2d in this study using the comsol multiphysics numerical suite heat transfer module the simulation were done for a transverse section of the quay to save computer time this assumption may be valid from a physical point of view as the lenght over width ratio of the quay is important the simulations performed for the eq take into account the geometry of the structure and a scheme of the numerical model is given in fig 12 the quay exibits a complex geotechnical configuration including backfill limestone rubles granite rubles limestone pavement coarse concrete wall fig 3 in order to simplify the modelling four categories of dry materials were considered limestone c1 c2 c5 in fig 12 concrete c3 granite c4 and backfill c6 the values of the physical parameters used for these materials thermal conductivity density heat constant are given in table 2 the transient temperature in the soil t x z t is solution of the equation 2 t x z t t κ 2 t x t x 2 2 t z t z 2 where x is the horizontal distance m z is the depth m t is the time s and κ is the thermal diffusivity of the soil which is related to the thermal conductivity k the heat capacity c p and the mass density ρ of the soil through 3 κ k nh s a zero heat flux condition is set at the lower boundary of the model for a flat surface the surface temperature during a diurnal cycle depends on the solar heat flux i s the soil radiative emission i e and the atmospheric radiative flux i l thus the boundary condition at the surface is given from the balance of solar atmospheric and emitted radiations watson 1973 4 k t z 0 t t i s i e i l the solar flux i s absorbed by the surface verifies 5 i s 1 a s 0 c cos z where a is the surface albedo

thermally emitted flux from the surface i e is given by 9 i e σ t 4 where is the soil emissivity averaged in the thermal infrared wavelengths and σ 5 67 10 8 jk 4 m 2 s 1 is the stefan boltzman

the diurnal cycle and t amp is the contrast of temperature between day and night as measured during the experiment p dc represents the duration of the diurnal cycle and t ph is the time shift between the maximum of the solar incident radiations and the maximum air temperature this model results in a minimum air temperature at the sunrise and a maximum air temperature at t ph after the zenith finally e a verifies the empirical law deffie and beckman 1980 12 e a 0 6108 exp 17 27 t a t t a t 237 3 the lower boundary of the modelling box is considered to be the mean lower low water level mllw see fig 3 where the ocean level is the lowest thus in this case the presence of unsaturated areas within the quay are the most probable with high thermal conductivity contrasts between the soil and air at this level the temperature of the lower boundary of the structure is considered as constant 10 c at a first approximation to simulate the presence of a cavity within the medium we introduce a simplified vertical air filled zone at the back of the concrete material fig 3 the implementation of this zone at such location may be understandable from a geotechnical point of view since the backfill is the most probable material subject to cavities voids or decompressed areas due to the withdrawal of fine grained materials when water enters the structure it is also consistent with the thermal observations as the tae1 and tae2 anomalies are found at the boundary between the concrete and the backfill and are elongated along this boundary figs 3 and 7b finally this air filled case represents a good candidate for the simulation of important spatial variations of temperature within the medium because the important contrast of thermal conductivity between air and rock 6 2 numerical results in this section we present several simulations for the eq and for 3 differents cases as the depth of the potential voids is not known 1 absence of cavity within the quay 2 presence of a cavity at 3 m depth 3 presence of a cavity at 1 m depth for each case we present the 2d thermal field within the eq fig 13 a c and e as well as a temperature profile at the surface fig 13 b d and f calculated at 13 h for more thermal contrasts the fig 13a presents the 2d temperature behavior of the eq in the absence of cavity as the result is presented at 13 h the surface is the hottest part of the medium the heat diffuses within the quay from the surface up to a depth of 2 m the isotherms are very slighly deformed at the front of the quay due to the thermal conductivity contrast between the concrete present at the front of the quay and the backfill fig 3 as the thermal conductivity is higher in the concrete material at depth a slight decrease of the surface temperature is generated in this part of the quay fig 16a and b such temperature difference between the concrete and the backfill here less than 0 5 c is obviously impossible to substract from the diurnal cycle finally the heterogeneous temperature field within the quay is illustrated by the vertical profile given in fig 14a where temperature variation up to 15 c can be encountered due to the thermal conductivity contrasts within the structure the second case represents the thermal behavior of the quay when a cavity is present at 3 m depth as said in the previous section it consists of a vertical zone having the thermal conductivity of the air located within the backfill just at the back of the concrete the general thermal pattern is similar to the first case but the isotherms are deformed within and above the cavity as it acts as a thermal insulator within the medium fig 13c at the surface the temperature decreases from the back to the front of the quay with a maximum temperature contrast of 0 5 c fig 13d but the temperature variation above the cavity is not significant nevertheless it is interesting to note that in comparison with the model without cavity the surface horizontal thermal gradient is more important in this case increase of temperature with a shorter wavelength this spatial variation may be due to the deformation of the isotherms associated with the insulating body at depth however such increase in temperature and variation in the shape of the temperature profile are likely difficult to observe with a thermal camera considering the amplitude of the diurnal cycle the vertical temperature profile shown in fig 14b is slightly shifted towards higher temperatures above the cavity although the general shape of the signal remains controlled by the thermal conductivities of the structure within the quay the temperature profile is clearly modified when penetrating within the air filled area such change is due to the high contrast between the air and the materials of the eq the last case displays the thermal behavior of the structure with a cavity located at 1 m depth fig 13e and f i e very close to the surface here the subsurface isotherms are strongly deformed due to the presence of the cavity fig 13e at the surface the temperature profile follows the general thermal trend of the previous case lowest temperatures at the front of the quay with a similar short wavelength but the maximum of temperature is found just above the cavity the maximum temperature contrast is 0 9 c with the front of the quay and less than 0 4 c with the back of the structure this result is consistent with the observations of eppelbaum 2007 who found a warm zone temperature anomaly of 0 3 c just above a 1 m depth underground cavity using 40 cm depth temperature sensors fig 15 our modelling tends to show that a cavity close to subsurface may produce a thermal signal by its own due to the 2 order magnitude difference between the thermal conductivities of the air and of the soil indeed the lowest is the depth the highest is the amplitude of the thermal anomaly it is of note that the thermal effect of such insulating zone for this given structure remains limited less that 1 c up to a depth of 1 m and probably not enough to be currently detected in that case the vertical temperature profile given in fig 14c is drastically modified by the air filled area interestingly in the first meter below the surface the shape of the signal is very different from the 3 m depth case as the thermal perturbation induced by the cavity interacts with the daily surface heat waves propagating through the pavement and the backfill then below one meter the air filled area generate a thermal anomaly but with a whole shape still controlled by the thermal behavior of the eq these three simulations show that an air filled cavity may directly influence the temperature pattern at the surface of the soil at depth the isotherms are deformed at the vicinities of the air filled cavity due to the high contrast of thermal conductivities between air and rock this situation may induce a variation of the surface temperature pattern in two ways 1 an increase of the thermal gradient here by one order of magnitude 0 02 c m 1 without cavity to 0 2 c m 1 for a location at 3 m depth and 2 the generation of a maximum of temperature reaching 0 4 to 0 9 c above the cavity at 1 m depth at mid day despite the high thermal sensitivity of the current thermal cameras 0 01 c m 1 such a signal clearly remains a challenge to discriminate from the variations associated to the diurnal cycle in addition our models were performed using the highest contrast between thermal conductivities air and rock inducing the maximum temperature contrast at the surface in the case of high tides potentially generating water filled voids with temperature contrasts between the rock and the liquid the situation may be more complex as 1 the thermal signal may be accordingly attenuated because of the reduced drop of thermal conductivity for water 0 02 w m 1 k 1 for air and 0 6 w m 1 k 1 for water and 2 the absence of thermal equilibrium between the water and rock may generate addionnal thermal gradients following turcotte and schubert 2002 a time l2 κ is required for temperature changes to propagate a distance l and for a thermal diffusivity κ thus taking a value κ in the range 10 7 m 2 s 1 10 6 m 2 s 1 for an unconsolidated material like backfill and a value l of 3 m the time needed for the temperature changes arriving at the surface is in the range 3 months 3 years for a value l of 1 m this time is reduced in the range 10 days 3 months such values shows that a thermal signal associated to water within the water may be mostly masked by seasonal temperature variations finally the results show that the generation of a warm area above the cavity is inconsistent with our observations on the wq and the eq in the next section an alternative physical phenomenon is suggested to explain the cold areas associated to the deformations of the quays 7 on the thermal influence of potential fluid flows within the wq and eq in the previous sections we have shown that most of the thermal signal of the eq and wq may be explained by surface indices surface properties however cool areas persist during daytime that can not be explained 1 by contrasts associated to thermal inertia albedo or topography and 2 nor by the direct thermal effect of a subsurface cavity located at shallow depth however surprisingly these observations are correlated with deformations as well as the structure of the quays other processes associated to the presence of a fluid have been searched to explain these temperature drops for instance water standing at the surface is cooler during the day and warmer during the night sabins 2007 nevertheless the presence of a slope at the location of the thermal anomaly prevents for any stay of water ruling out this hypothesis possible drainage of the fluids within the quays implies the generation of a preferential vertical permeability field in the case of the wq and eq thermal anomalies are located on the flancks of local subsidences fig 11 from a mechanical point of view it is known that the slopes of such depressions are subject to extensive stresses while the center topographic low may be rather under compressive forces fig 16 berenger et al 2014 al halbouni et al 2018 al halbouni et al 2019 yin et al 2019 consequently these extensive stresses tend to generate a preferential vertical permeability within the joints of the pavement through micro fracturation while the compressive forces may close the fractures at the center of the topographic depressions these micro fractures may not appear everywhere around the deformation as the medium constituting the quays is hightly heterogeneous with the presence of backfill and concrete we propose an alternative cooling mecanism induced by water infiltration through micro fractures in the pavement for tae1 tae2 taw1 and taw2 and within the backfill for tae3 to explain our observations indeed the analysis of meteorological data at stations close to le havre harbour cap de la heve and octeville indicates that the october month was particularly rainy with intermittent to continuous rainfall fig 17 important rainfall ocurred until october 16 h up to 24 mm while moderate precipitation was recorded from october 20th to october 24th for le havre city from 1 6 to 4 mm h during the following days the weather was strongly disturbed with a high humidity content on the atmosphere around 80 of relative humidity and an important decrease of the hourly solar radiation from 15 h of sunshine on october 22th to 7 h on october 28th and small rain on october 28th many works report changes in soil temperature caused by percolating water following rainfall or irrigation callendar 1895 franklin 1921 shul gin et al 1958 wierenga et al 1979 experimentally and numerically characterized the thermal effect of infiltration on the shallow subsurface he measured the temperatures of a soil irrigated with cool 4 c and warm 21 c water at different depths surface to 20 cm the author shown that irrigation whatever the temperature of the water results in lowering the soil temperature below those of non irrigated soil during several days due to darcy flow as displayed in fig 18 eventually the thermal anomaly can persist a longer time below 20 cm depth due to thermal diffusion wierenga et al 1979 explained this observation by heat tranfer between occuring by water movement the cooling of the soil during water infiltration is also described in the numerical results of lopez et al 2016 for water flow within a sedimentary basin in the case of le havre harbour we propose that the autumn rain in normandy penetrates the soil of the quays through micro fractures located on the flancks of the deformations this infiltration may induce a cooling of the medium by several degrees celcius wierenga et al 1979 due to the highest darcy velocity of the water within the fissures compared to the rest of the quay during infiltration the darcy velocity is controlled by the effective permeability k of the medium m 2 defined as k d3 12f where d is the fissure aperture m and f is the spacing between fissures m for an aperture of 0 1 mm and a spacing f 1 m k 10 13 m 2 while this value drops to 10 10 m 2 when d 1 mm i e a range comparable to the permeability of the sand heat transfer between rock and water is enhanced due to the downward movement of the fluid and its important volumetric thermal capacity ρ w cp w as illustrated in fig 18 this cooling may last several hours after the occurence of infiltration before equilibrium eventually during after the infiltration process the evaporation of the water remained stuck on the walls of the fissures by surface tension may also participate to the persistence of the cooling of the medium geiger 1965 van bavel and hillel 1976 depending on the incoming solar radiation the atmospheric water content and temperature the presence of wind and the amount of water available within the soil it is currently difficult for us to discriminate the relative influence of infiltration and evaporation on the surface temperatures besides the following elements may be highlighted the detection of cold anomalies located on the deformations was confirmed for both quays by a second campaign realized in march 2015 19 just after rainy days this is remarkable considering that the survey was performed during another season and thus different radiative meteorological and soil temperature conditions the 2015 survey emphasizes several points 1 the detection of thermal anomalies is repeatable using our methodology 2 their morphology is comparable to 2014 and 3 important thermal contrasts are observed similar to 2014 i e 3 c in that case it is proposed that evaporation may influence the surface temperatures to a lesser extent than infiltration considering the observed difference in the daily average solar radiation in october 138 w m 2 and march 219 w m 2 in le havre city see the irradiation geographical information system for europe for details as the evaporation rate directly depends on the incoming solar radiation a different evaporation rate may be induced at the surface and thus different temperature contrasts which is not what we observe obviously further investigations may lead with no doubt to a better evaluation of the role of these two components infiltration and evaporation on the thermal field numerical modelling may be improved in several ways 1 implementation of fluid flow in unsaturated media physics taking into account radiative surface boundary condition 2 integration of meteorologic radiative and optical albedo field data as input for the modelling for instance albedo maps may be obtained using pyranometers on board drones levy et al 2018 and considerably improve the description of the radiative surface boundary condition and 3 implementation of radiative processes for sloped surfaces to characterize the link between topography and surface temperatures finally analogical experiments may be realized on several soils types in a climatic chamber in order to characterize the link between infiltration evaporation and thermal infrared observations in this frame the combination of remote sensing and geophysical data measuring electric or dielectric parameters may be useful to quantify the relationships between water flow evaporation rates and soil temperatures 8 conclusions visible and thermal infrared observations obtained with a light uav are presented on two port quays photographies are used to calculate altimetric maps of the structures by means of the photogrammetric method while thermal images serve to monitor semi diurnal temperature variations of the surface the analysis of the altimetric data reveals several deformations at the surface of the wq and the eq and associated to potential subsurface cavities decompressed areas at depth the study of thermal maps show that the major part of surface temperatures observed on the wq and the eq may be explained by thermal inertia and albedo nevertheless five cold areas taw1 taw2 and tae1 to tae3 are revealed on the quays not explained by these parameters these anomalies appear in the morning and persist during the all day with a temperature contrast with the surrounding environment ranging from 2 to 4 c alongside this observation a clear correlation is found between thermal anomalies deformations identified on the altimetric data and the structure of the quays more precisely the minimum of temperature of the cold regions are located on the flancks of the deformations the origin of this correlation is then investigated a simplified 2d model is developped to quantify the direct surface thermal influence of a subsurface cavity when present at two different depths 3 m and 1 m below the surface these simulations show that 1 the gradient of the surface temperature may vary when a subsurface cavity decompressed area is present at depth 2 a hot thermal anomaly is induced at the surface by a cavity decompressed area at depth during the day which is inconsistent with our observations and 3 the amplitude of the anomaly less than 1 c may be too low to be detected by tir cameras given the amplitude of the diurnal cycle in this study we only made 2d simulations to assess the first order characteristics of the thermal pattern but 3d thermal patterns may clearly be present within the medium due to the complexity of the structures of the quays such consideration must be taken into account in future works we explain the cold anomalies and their correlation with the deformations by the cooling induced by infiltration and subsequent evaporation of water through micro fractures permitting the persistence of the anomaly several hours after rainfalls as a consequence we argue that the high permeability of the medium induced by stresses within the medium when a cavity decompressed soil is present may control the surface temperatures observed on both wq and eq to our knowledge this study is the first establishing a link between thermal anomalies and surface deformations associated to subsurface cavities decompressed areas such result is made possible given the new capabilities of u a vs able to monitor port quays and more broadly civil engineering structures at high resolution low cost and in a very flexible way finally these methods may also be very useful for the detection of subsurface voids in clayey soils where classical geophysical tools

5378,septic systems are often cited as an important contributor to rural watershed nutrient loads despite limited quantitative evidence regarding their actual contribution the measurement of the artificial sweetener acesulfame in streams to quantify upstream inputs of septic system effluent has recently been proposed however there is a lack of detailed study on this application including temporal variability influence of dry and wet weather conditions and disentangling the contributions from functioning versus failing septic systems further this approach has not been applied to assess the relative contribution of septic systems to nutrient watershed loads here we conducted artificial sweetener and nutrient stream measurements in three watersheds with no other identified sources of acesulfame e g no municipal wastewater treatment plants landfills over a 10 month period measured acesulfame stream concentrations varied from below detection 2 ng l to 87 ng l with acesulfame stream loads revealing that septic system inputs to streams vary considerably between low and high stream discharge conditions positive acesulfame concentration stream discharge relationships for all three watersheds reveal the potentially important contributions from failing septic systems and surface flow pathways i e effluent breakout from septic drain field under high discharge conditions further they indicate that contrary to conventional thinking sampling under low discharge conditions may underestimate septic effluent delivery to streams the estimated contribution of septic systems to measured total phosphorus stream loads on a given sampling day varied widely 1 36 considering attenuation between the septic tank and stream but typically septic system contributions to nitrate stream loads were low 2 the findings provide guidance on the application of this new tool for managing septic effluent contributions of nutrients and other wastewater contaminants to rural watershed streams keywords onsite wastewater treatment systems phosphorus nutrients tracer field measurements 1 introduction surface water eutrophication caused by excessive nutrient phosphorus p and nitrogen n loads is a major concern with nuisance and toxic algal blooms and hypoxic conditions costing billions of dollars annually in economic and ecological damages harke et al 2016 paerl et al 2016 watson et al 2016 for example the massive algal bloom in lake erie in 2014 which led to drinking water supply disruptions for the city of toledo ohio is estimated to have cost us65 million bingham et al 2015 quantifying and reducing nutrient loads to surface waters is challenging due to high contributions from diffuse sources one such source is septic systems which are onsite wastewater treatment units widely used worldwide in areas not serviced by municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps it is estimated that septic systems are used in 26 of households across europe williams et al 2012 and more than 20 of households in the united states u s epa 2018 despite numerous studies linking septic systems to groundwater and surface water quality impairments e g mechtensimer and toor 2016 schaider et al 2016 verhougstraete et al 2015 withers et al 2014 the contribution of septic systems to stream watershed nutrient loads is poorly quantified furthermore septic systems may be an important source of other contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and pathogens james et al 2016 schaider et al 2017 verhougstraete et al 2015 septic systems are designed to release partially treated wastewater into the unsaturated zone below a septic drain field commonly the released septic effluent infiltrates through the unsaturated zone to the water table where it is then transported by groundwater flow if the resultant groundwater septic plume reaches and discharges to a nearby stream the septic effluent constituents may be added to the stream watershed load in agricultural areas the groundwater septic plume may also be short circuited by field tile drains which also discharge to adjacent streams during high water table periods it is estimated that for well functioning systems around 20 of total p tp in the raw wastewater is removed in the septic tank due to particulate p settling in the tank lusk et al 2017 the main forms of p in the effluent released to the drain field are srp soluble reactive phosphorus and organic p organic p is mostly mineralized to srp in the drain field and as such srp is the dominant form of p transported in the subsurface srp is also the bioavailable p fraction that stimulates plant including algal growth and is therefore of concern for water quality impairment it is often thought that srp is not overly mobile in the subsurface including within and downgradient of a septic drain field as it has a high tendency to interact with soils through sorption and precipitation reactions however increasing evidence suggests that srp can be mobile under certain conditions namely calcareous soils coarse grain soils neutral ph and following long sustained p input into the subsurface domagalski and johnson 2011 holman et al 2008 consistent with this high srp plumes have been observed 75 100 m downgradient of septic drain fields in calcareous sandy aquifers robertson et al 2019 roy et al 2017 compared to p n removal is generally poor in septic systems including in the septic tank and within and below the drain field organic n and ammonium nh4 n are the main forms of n in the wastewater effluent released to a septic drain field for well functioning systems these forms are rapidly converted to nitrate no3 n close to the drain field distribution lines lusk et al 2017 no3 n is more mobile and conservative in the subsurface than srp however its transport in the subsurface can be influenced by microbially mediated reactions including denitrification septic systems that are poorly designed situated or maintained can deliver excessive nutrient loads into adjacent surface waters withers et al 2014 in some cases suboptimal conditions can lead to septic tank overflow or a clogged or low permeability drain field this can result in septic effluent at ground surface and its potential transport overland to nearby surface waters during wet weather conditions beal et al 2005 withers et al 2014 cases have also been reported where although illegal septic effluent is directly discharged into agricultural tile drains drainage ditches or a nearby surface water together termed misconnections dunk et al 2008 the rates of all of these types of septic system failures are estimated at 20 in canada council of canadian academies 2009 and up to 70 in the united kingdom and ireland withers et al 2014 the complexity of nutrient behavior in the subsurface below a septic drain field and downgradient robertson 2008 robertson et al 2019 robinson 2015 as well as uncertainty around the rate and type of failure of septic systems in a given watershed makes quantifying and predicting nutrient loads from septic systems to streams challenging furthermore inventories of septic system numbers and locations within watersheds often do not exist the use of direct field measurements of stream nutrients to quantify septic system contributions is confounded by the diffuse nature of septic derived nutrient inputs as well as contributions from other nutrient sources such as those associated with agriculture robinson 2015 speed et al 2018 currently the most promising solutions to overcome these challenges is the measurement of a suitable human wastewater tracer in streams tracers previously used include inorganic wastewater constituents e g chloride boron sodium pharmaceuticals caffeine and microbial source tracking markers e g james et al 2016 richards et al 2017 verhougstraete et al 2015 however these tracers are either not ubiquitously used amongst the population can be linked with other common sources or are not conservative in the environment i e degradation sorption limited viability foolad et al 2015 james et al 2016 richards et al 2017 van stempvoort et al 2013 the wastewater tracer that shows the most promise to date for quantifying septic effluent inputs to streams is the artificial sweetener acesulfame spoelstra et al 2020 spoelstra et al 2017 artificial sweeteners including acesulfame saccharin cyclamate and sucralose are an emerging class of human wastewater tracers lange et al 2012 all have negligible sorption and low analytical detection limits buerge et al 2009 burke et al 2014 lange et al 2012 artificial sweeteners are widely used in consumer products including diet beverages and foods they are also in products such as pharmaceuticals and toothpaste and therefore are present in human wastewater even in households that avoid consumption of artificially sweetened foods spoelstra et al 2020 recently proposed using acesulfame as the primary tracer for septic effluent inputs to streams due to its relatively high persistence through wastewater treatment and in the environment including during subsurface transport and frequent detection in wastewater affected waters other artificial sweeteners either have i higher degradation rates in wastewater activated sludge and or soil e g saccharin cyclamate buerge et al 2009 spoelstra et al 2013 ii slightly higher detection limits and therefore commonly found at non detect concentrations in the environment e g sucralose spoelstra et al 2020 or iii can be attributed to other sources such as pig feed e g saccharin ma et al 2017 or the breakdown of some sulfonylurea herbicides e g saccharin berger and lee wolfe 1996 further discussion regarding the efficacy of using acesulfame as a human wastewater tracer compared with other artificial sweeteners is described by spoelstra et al 2020 it is important to note that while acesulfame has been found to be the most recalcitrant artificial sweetener recent studies have shown it can be degraded to some extent through wastewater treatment processes buerge et al 2011 castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 men et al 2017 and also naturally in surface waters by sunlight gan et al 2014 spoelstra et al 2020 recently presented a broad scale study where acesulfame concentrations measured in 173 rural streams across southern ontario canada during baseflow conditions were used to estimate how much septic system effluent the streams receive by combining acesulfame concentrations with general estimates of septic system density upstream and estimated stream discharge they reported that on average 18 of septic effluent generated within watersheds is reaching the streams while this study provides valuable preliminary estimates potential temporal variability in acesulfame stream loads was neglected and it was assumed that septic effluent reaches streams predominately via shallow groundwater discharge other potential pathways via which septic effluent may reach the stream were not explored although the specific transport pathways e g subsurface transport surface transport misconnections determine the fate and delivery of nutrients and other contaminants from septic systems to the stream finally the contribution of septic systems to watershed nutrient loads was not quantified by spoelstra et al 2020 or any prior studies through application of tracer data although septic system contributions are a key uncertainty for nutrient source apportionment in watersheds to address these research gaps the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate variability in the fraction of septic effluent generated in a watershed that reaches the watershed outlet over time and between watersheds 2 assess the relative importance of the various pathways by which septic effluent may be transported to the watershed outlet and 3 quantify the potential contribution of septic systems to watershed nutrient loads using acesulfame derived septic effluent loads to address these objectives acesulfame and nutrient stream concentrations and loads were measured across a range of discharge conditions over a 10 month period in three watersheds in the lake erie basin canada that have no other major sources of acesulfame i e municipal wwtp landfills recreational areas as there was no existing inventory of septic system numbers a geospatial tool was developed to spatially locate septic systems in the watersheds uncertainty in the use of acesulfame as a tracer for quantifying septic effluent input to the streams is discussed with the calculations used in this study thought to provide a lower limit on the fraction of septic effluent that is delivered to the watershed outlets ultimately the study findings provide important insight into the timing and delivery of septic effluent to streams in addition to the testing of field tools suitable for quantifying septic system contributions to nutrient and other contaminant loads at the watershed scale this information is needed to improve actions aimed at reducing loads of nutrients and other contaminants to surface waters including the establishment of regulations regarding the design maintenance and monitoring of septic systems 2 methodology 2 1 description of study sites this study focuses on three watersheds in the ontario lake erie basin canada which are herein named based on the closest town florence 76 km2 bothwell 14 km2 and strathroy 24 km2 fig 1 these watersheds have no other major sources of acesulfame including landfills municipal wwtps discharges or recreational areas while artificial sweeteners including acesulfame can be found in wwtp biosolids that are applied to agricultural fields as acesulfame does not readily adsorb to biosolids storck et al 2016 this is expected to only be a minor source of acesulfame in the watersheds buerge et al 2011 the three watersheds have primarily agricultural land use 75 90 with 5 10 forest cover bothwell has the highest urban land use 20 compared to florence and strathroy 5 development in these watersheds occurred mostly before 1960 which is around when septic systems became popular in ontario rutty and sullivan 2010 sandy deposits are the major surficial geology in all three watersheds with florence having minor silt areas in the west near the watershed outlet and strathroy having small gravel areas throughout as well as silt diamicton and organic deposits in the northeast ontario ministry of energy northern development and mines 2003 there is extensive agricultural tile drain coverage in the florence and bothwell watersheds ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2018 suggesting that despite the permeable sand gravel surficial geology classification by ontario ministry of energy northern development and mines 2003 the soils in these watersheds may be poorly draining and or there is a high water table elevation the three watersheds drain into the sydenham river which ultimately drains to lake erie through lake st clair no inventory existed for the numbers and locations of septic systems in the watersheds as such the locations of individual residential septic systems were identified in arcgis using 0 2 m resolution imagery from the south western ontario orthoimagery project swoop ontario ministry of natural resources and forestry 2015 and property parcel boundaries teranet inc 2014 the populations in these watersheds reside year round and there are no known neighborhood septic systems septic systems associated with commercial and industrial buildings were not included in the inventory as there are few of these buildings in the study watersheds and there is limited in flux of non residents into the watersheds this is not expected to affect the study results details on the methodology used to locate individual residential septic systems is provided in the supplementary material 2 2 field measurements and sample analysis measurements of stream discharge and sampling for stream concentrations of artificial sweeteners acesulfame saccharin cyclamate sucralose and nutrients tp no3 n were conducted from nov 2017 to aug 2018 at the watershed outlets fig 1b stream discharge was calculated using the mid point method turnipseed and sauer 2010 from vertically averaged stream velocity measurements performed using a velocimeter global water flow probe fp111 and water depth at 0 5 m increments across the stream stream samples were collected in three 60 ml ldpe bottles for analysis of tp no3 n and artificial sweeteners all samples except tp samples were filtered immediately using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters samples were kept cold during transport and stored frozen until analysis except for tp samples which were analyzed within 24 h of collection tp was analyzed using a uv vis spectrometer hach method 8190 no3 n was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 432 w 717 plus autosampler samples were analyzed for artificial sweeteners acesulfame saccharin cyclamate sucrolose using ion chromatography thermo fisher dionex ics 5000 system and ion suppression using a dionex 60 aers 500 2 mm coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer ab sciex concord on canada 5500 qtrap ms ms with an electrospray ionization source in negative mode the detection limits of acesulfame saccharin cyclamate and sucralose were 2 2 3 and 20 ng l respectively all stream samples were below the detection limit for cyclamate and only seven samples were above the detection limit for sucralose and therefore this data is not discussed additional details on the analytical method used for artificial sweetener analysis including qa qc results are provided in the supplementary material 2 3 data analysis the stream mass loads kg d at the watershed outlets for all analyzed constituents were first calculated for all sampling events using the measured stream discharge and concentrations the acesulfame stream load was divided by an estimated mass of acesulfame generated from a single septic system per day to determine the equivalent number of septic systems contributing effluent to the stream this value can be interpreted as the equivalent number of septic systems that contribute all their effluent to the stream or alternatively and more realistically a summation of all partial contributions from septic systems to the stream in the watershed the fraction of septic effluent reaching the watershed outlet on a given sampling day was calculated by dividing the equivalent number of septic systems by the total number of septic systems in the watershed the acesulfame load from a single septic system was estimated to be 2 53 10 5 0 24 10 5 kg d this is based on the mean acesulfame concentration in septic tanks of single dwellings of 43 8 1 standard deviation µg l 4 2 µg l n 14 snider et al 2017 as used by spoelstra et al 2020 an average per person indoor household water usage of 221 8 l d gauley associated ltd 2016 and an average 2 6 people per household statistics canada 2016 similar to the approach used for acesulfame saccharin stream loads were also converted to equivalent number of septic system using an estimated daily amount of saccharin generated by one septic system 1 10 10 5 0 07 10 5 kg d this value is based on the mean saccharin concentration in septic tanks of single dwellings of 19 0 1 standard deviation µg l 1 2 µg l n 14 snider et al 2017 it is important to recognize the uncertainties associated with the use of acesulfame and the approach described above to calculate the fraction of septic effluent in the stream firstly the acesulfame concentrations used for the septic tank are based on a mean standard deviation of samples from single dwelling septic tanks for which the acesulfame concentrations were found to range widely from 3 4 to 184 7 μg l the data were collected mostly from cottage properties that have seasonal to year round use to limit the impact of cottages that do not have high water use appliances e g dishwashers laundry snider et al 2017 derived average artificial sweetener concentration values following a log transformation to correct for skewness to large values still the mean values used here may not perfectly reflect concentrations in septic systems for year round dwellings it is thought however that variability in acesulfame concentrations between septic tanks will be smoothed out when considering septic effluent contributions at the watershed scale from hundreds of septic systems secondly while acesulfame is one of the most recalcitrant artificial sweeteners along with sucralose recent studies have shown that acesulfame can be susceptible to degradation within some wwtps buerge et al 2011 castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 men et al 2017 and also naturally in surface waters by sunlight gan et al 2014 as such it is possible that some degradation of acesulfame occurs either in the septic drain field or as acesulfame is transported along subsurface and or stream flow paths towards the watershed outlet due to the potential degradation of acesulfame the calculations presented may underestimate the fraction of septic effluent at the watershed outlets note that the acesulfame concentration in the septic tank rather than in the raw wastewater is considered in the calculations and as such any acesulfame degradation that occurs in the septic tank itself is taken into account thirdly acesulfame has only been in use in canada since 1988 gougeon et al 2004 this means that in using acesulfame as a tracer we are only able to account for septic effluent that was generated in the last 30 years this may again lead to underestimation of the fraction of septic effluent in the stream as it is possible that groundwater plumes from some septic systems may take more than 30 years to reach the stream it is recommended that future studies look at reducing these uncertainties for this current study the key findings hold despite these uncertainties as the focus is on evaluating variability in the fraction of septic effluent reaching the watershed outlets rather than simply providing an absolute value for the magnitude of the septic effluent reaching the outlets acesulfame concentration c stream discharge q relationships were evaluated for the three watersheds to provide insight into the transport of acesulfame and thus septic effluent to the watershed outlets moatar et al 2017 rose et al 2018 c q relationships were analyzed using a power relationship c aq b where b is a unitless exponent representing the slope of the log transformed c q relationship following moatar et al 2017 for b 0 2 the relationship is chemodynamic and positive indicating higher flows are mobilizing and delivering higher concentration acesulfame sources to the watershed outlet for b 0 2 the relationship is chemodynamic and negative indicating that continuous acesulfame inputs are diluted as the stream discharge increases for 0 2 b 0 2 the relationship is chemostatic whereby the concentration varies independently of discharge the statistical significance of the c q relationships were tested in minitab by pearson product moment correlation with the significance level set at 0 05 estimates of the maximum nutrient load at the watershed outlets that maybe attributed to septic systems were evaluated by multiplying the equivalent number of septic systems contributing effluent to the stream as determined from the acesulfame stream load by estimated tp and total nitrogen tn loads from a single septic system 5 8 10 3 3 0 10 3 kg d and 37 10 3 12 10 3 kg d respectively these estimated loads assume a mean tp concentration in the septic tank of 10 1 standard deviation mg l p 5 2 mg l p n 63 a mean tn concentration of 64 1 standard deviation mg l n 21 mg l n n 63 lowe et al 2009 an average per person indoor household water usage of 221 8 l d gauley associated ltd 2016 and an average 2 6 people per household statistics canada 2016 the calculated acesulfame corrected maximum septic derived nutrient loads are those loads that will reach the stream if there is negligible removal of n and p between the septic tank and stream as may occur for direct misconnections the calculated loads were compared with the stream tp and no3 n loads measured on a given sampling day to determine the maximum fraction of tp and no3 n stream watershed load that may be attributed to septic systems for this calculation it is assumed that all ammonium and organic n in the septic tank effluent transforms to no3 n in the drain field lusk et al 2017 and as such the amount of tn released from the septic tank is compared with the measured no3 n stream load while n removal in the septic drain field is generally low lusk et al 2017 a recent review of field data by robertson et al 2019 found that on average 66 of tp in the septic tank effluent is removed in the septic drain field in areas where the soil is calcareous as it is in our study watersheds as such in addition to calculating a maximum possible septic derived p load to the stream a p attenuation factor was applied recognizing this high tendency of p to adsorb and precipitate in the drain field for this the calculated acesulfame corrected septic derived tp loads were multiplied by 34 100 minus attenuation factor of 66 to provide a more realistic estimate of the tp load from septic systems to the stream assuming the majority of septic effluent is transported through the subsurface 3 results and discussion 3 1 septic system placement the watersheds florence bothwell and strathroy are estimated to have 272 298 and 127 septic systems respectively fig 1 the associated densities of septic systems in each watershed are 3 4 septics km2 21 3 septics km2 and 5 0 septics km2 bothwell has 89 of its septic systems in an urban area with this area located in the upstream section of the watershed in comparison only 49 of septic systems in florence are in an urban area and in strathroy there is no urban area considering the surficial sediment type florence bothwell and strathroy have 206 76 298 100 and 90 74 septic systems respectively located in sand and or gravel sediment 3 2 amount of septic effluent reaching watershed outlets acesulfame was found at concentrations above the detection limit 2 ng l in all stream samples from all three watersheds except for one sampling event in strathroy 27 nov 2017 for that single outlier the acesulfame concentration was assumed to be half the detection limit 1 ng l in subsequent calculations acesulfame concentrations at the three watershed outlets over the 10 month sampling period are shown together with the measured stream discharge in fig 2 acesulfame stream concentrations varied from 11 to 39 ng l 9 87 ng l and 2 15 ng l for florence bothwell and strathroy respectively as there are no other known or expected major sources of acesulfame in these watersheds the presence of acesulfame at the watershed outlets suggests septic effluent is reaching the streams these data show that acesulfame stream concentrations at the outlets vary considerably over time fig 2 suggesting that a one off snapshot baseflow sampling approach as used by spoelstra et al 2020 may not provide comprehensive estimation of septic effluent inputs to a stream temporal variability in the acesulfame concentrations at the watershed outlets may be caused by changes in acesulfame mass added to the stream or changes in the transport of acesulfame through the stream network to the watershed outlets alternately it may reflect different amounts of dilution caused by changing water inputs to the stream i e flow conditions this is explored in the next section by examining the concentration stream discharge c q relationships for each watershed the equivalent number of septic systems contributing effluent to the stream determined from the stream acesulfame concentrations and stream discharge and recognizing the variability in the representative septic tank acesulfame concentration used in the calculation mean 1 standard deviation also exhibited high temporal variability the equivalent number of septic systems ranged from 3 0 3 95 9 septic systems in florence 7 0 10 5 2 4 10 3 kg d fig 2b 1 5 0 1 290 28 septic systems in bothwell 3 8 10 5 7 3 10 3 kg d fig 2c and 0 4 0 03 15 1 septic systems in strathroy 8 8 10 6 3 7 10 4 kg d fig 2d for the majority of the sampling events the equivalent number of contributing septic systems were much lower than the total number of septic systems in the watersheds 272 298 and 127 septic systems in florence bothwell and strathroy indicating that generally most of the septic system effluent is not reaching the stream higher acesulfame stream loads in all watersheds were observed in late spring i e april and may with loads converted to equivalent number of septic systems close to the total number of septic systems in the bothwell watershed in late spring however note that the sample size was small for winter n 2 and no sampling was conducted in fall it is possible that the septic effluent that is not reaching the stream is being transported to deeper groundwater systems not intercepted by the stream transported to other disconnected surface water bodies including wetlands or alternatively the acesulfame may be taken up by vegetation e g ma et al 2017 it is also possible that the septic effluent is trapped in disconnected compartments of the watershed and that our sampling was not sufficient to capture all peak events when this trapped effluent was released for these peak events similar to the one observed in bothwell in late spring the acesulfame stream loads may be reach close to 100 contribution as the trapped acesulfame is released finally as discussed above the acesulfame may also degrade to some extent and therefore the equivalent septic system numbers presented are a lower estimate on the amount of septic effluent reaching the stream the sampling events were separated into low and high discharge conditions by classifying high discharge conditions as those where there was a 40 increase in stream discharge from the preceding low discharge conditions bowes et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 the acesulfame stream loads in the three watersheds are greater for high discharge compared to low discharge conditions considering low discharge conditions only the mean percentage of septic effluent delivered to the watershed outlets was 9 1 8 1 and 2 0 3 for florence bothwell and strathroy 25 3 22 3 and 3 0 4 equivalent septic systems respectively in contrast for high discharge conditions the mean percentage of septic effluent delivered to the stream was 24 2 33 4 and 6 0 7 for florence bothwell and strathroy 65 7 99 11 8 1 equivalent septic systems respectively these results underscore the need to consider temporal variability in designing stream sampling protocols given that sampling only under low discharge conditions as was done by spoelstra et al 2020 can considerably underestimate the percentage of septic effluent reaching the watershed outlet the acesulfame stream loads presented above show a clear difference in the percentage of septic effluent reaching the outlets between the study watersheds with a lower percentage of septic effluent reaching the outlet for strathroy compared to florence and bothwell for both high and low discharge conditions potential factors that may contribute to the differences in the percentage of septic effluent reaching the outlets between the watersheds are provided in table 2 calculation of the number of septic systems as a function of setback distance distance between septic system and stream revealed that different setback distances for the septic systems in each of the watersheds likely does not cause the differences between the watersheds supplementary material fig s3 rather the differences may be due to differences in the pathways via which septic effluent is reaching the watershed outlets while speculative it is possible that the lower percentage of septic effluent reaching the strathroy outlet compared to the florence and bothwell outlets is due to higher soil drainage and or a lower groundwater table in the watershed as suggested by the lower density of agricultural tile drains fig s2 these conditions are generally associated with better functioning septic systems including higher infiltration of septic effluent into the subsurface and less potential for septic system failure due to waterlogging or misconnections short circuiting of septic groundwater plumes by agricultural tile drains may also presumably be less in the strathroy watershed it is also important to note that sampling bias may play some role in the differences between the watersheds as a slightly different number of high discharge events were captured for the three watersheds variations in household acesulfame consumption and therefore the acesulfame load generated from septic systems may also account for the differences between the watersheds although it is expected this variability would be small considering the large number of septic systems in each watershed higher spatial and temporal resolution water quality sampling through the watersheds combined with household surveys are needed to better quantify the factors contributing to the differences between the watersheds 3 3 concentration discharge relationship for all watersheds the c q relationships for acesulfame show chemodynamic behavior with positive slopes b 0 and pearson product moment correlation indicating the relationships are significant α 0 05 fig 4 the significant positive c q relationships indicate that the acesulfame concentrations observed at the outlets may be controlled by transport limitations whereby additional hydrological pathways delivering less dilute higher concentration septic effluent to the watershed outlets are activated during wet weather conditions as stream discharge increases the positive c q relationship was strongest for strathroy b 0 93 compared with bothwell b 0 49 and florence b 0 23 suggesting greater importance of hydrological connectivity in governing acesulfame concentration at the watershed outlet for strathroy the positive c q relationships for the three watersheds were somewhat unexpected due to the common notion that septic effluent is delivered predominately to streams via subsurface flow paths spoelstra et al 2020 if this were the case it would lead to a flat or negative c q relationship whereby increasing water inputs during high discharge conditions would dilute acesulfame and other septic effluent contaminants concentrations at the watershed outlets conceptually there are several factors that may contribute to the observed c q relationships and temporal variability in acesulfame stream loads some of which affect the transport of septic effluent to the stream and others that affect acesulfame in stream transport to the watershed outlet table 2 during low discharge periods subsurface transport is expected to be the main active pathway delivering acesulfame from septic systems to the stream with some potential contribution from direct misconnection of septic tanks to the stream through pipes dunk et al 2008 withers et al 2014 as discharge increases a rising groundwater table associated with rain and snow melt events may lead to increased groundwater discharge to the stream as well as higher drainage from agriculture tile drains which may short circuit shallow subsurface septic plumes both processes will cause larger inputs of septic effluent and associated acesulfame to the stream as the stream discharge continues to increase overland flow may become an important pathway with surface transport of septic effluent to the stream from failing septic systems i e as septic tile beds become waterlogged and effluent breaks out at the ground surface of these possible pathways that become activated under higher discharge conditions only short circuiting of the septic plume via agricultural tile drains and overland flow is expected to lead to the observed higher less dilute acesulfame concentrations observed at the watershed outlet as the stream discharge increases and thus the positive c q relationships it is recommended that future studies use stream tracers including stable water isotopes or radon 222 to better disentangle the acesulfame contributions from subsurface transport versus overland transport as the stream discharge varies it is also unclear if the positive c q relationships observed here are a function of the specific characteristics of the watersheds e g sand gravel surficial geology and therefore it is recommended that further work be conducted in other watersheds and geographical regions with different characteristics the longitudinal transport of acesulfame down the stream network may also contribute to the observed positive c q relationships at the watershed outlets for instance stream longitudinal connectivity was observed to be reduced i e as dry sections or stream cut off at road crossings during low discharge conditions this may have led to acesulfame from septic systems being trapped in disconnected stream reaches under low discharge conditions as stream discharge increases acesulfame concentrations and loads may increase due to the release and downstream transport of acesulfame stored in these previously disconnected stream reaches this may have contributed to the positive c q relationships particularly in strathroy where reduced stream connectivity was observed during low discharge conditions the highest measured acesulfame stream load 7 g d occurred at the bothwell outlet under high discharge conditions with the load equivalent to 290 28 septic systems delivering effluent to the outlet this is close to the total estimated number of septic systems in the watershed 298 septic systems this high load highlights the unsteady transport of acesulfame through the watershed caused by the trapping and subsequent release of acesulfame from different compartments of the hydrological landscape that become reconnected under high discharge conditions it is important to note that while other factors included in table 2 such as seasonal population changes and changing household acesulfame consumption and water usage patterns may also cause temporal variations in acesulfame stream loads these factors do not explain the positive c q relationships for the three watersheds stream concentration and load data for the artificial sweetener saccharin was also explored in an attempt to untangle the factors that may be contributing to the observed temporal variability in acesulfame concentrations and loads saccharin is less conservative in the environment compared to acesulfame buerge et al 2011 spoelstra et al 2017 and therefore it was thought that comparison of saccharin and acesulfame mass loads at the watershed outlets might provide insight into the relative contribution of fast i e overland transport from failed systems versus slow i e subsurface transport pathways in delivering septic effluent to the streams saccharin stream concentrations were all above the detection limit aside from two samples florence 3 may bothwell 27 nov the magnitude and temporal variability in the saccharin stream loads differ from the acesulfame stream loads both converted to the equivalent number of contributing septic systems fig 5 further the c q relationships for saccharin reveal chemostatic behavior with a flat relationship fig s5 in contrast with positive chemodynamic behavior for acesulfame fig 4 this suggests different sources or behavior transport reactivity degradation of saccharin and acesulfame in the watersheds importantly the average saccharin stream loads are higher than the average acesulfame loads in florence and strathroy the finding is inconsistent with acesulfame being more persistent than saccharin in the environment as well as acesulfame concentrations 43 8 4 2 µg l being higher in septic tanks compared with saccharin concentrations 19 0 1 2 µg l snider et al 2017 this suggests there may be additional sources of saccharin in these agricultural watersheds such as pig feed and associated field manure application ma et al 2017 or sulfonylurea herbicides berger and lee wolfe 1996 large observed spikes in saccharin concentrations and loads during high flow conditions in spring and summer coincided with spikes in tp and no3 n fig s5 suggesting high saccharin loads may be associated with manure runoff note that saccharin concentrations did not consistently peak when tp and no3 n were high which may be due to the timing seasonality of manure and inorganic fertilizer applications overall the additional sources of saccharin confounded our ability to use saccharin loads in combination with acesulfame loads to help untangle the various pathways by which septic effluent is delivered to the watershed outlets these findings indicate that caution is required if saccharin is used to evaluate septic effluent inputs to rural streams 3 4 contribution of septic systems to watershed nutrient loads as expected tp and no3 n concentrations and loads at the watershed outlets also varied considerably between sampling events fig s5 the tp stream loads ranged from 0 7 to 16 kg d 0 1 to 3 kg d and 0 06 to 2 kg d for the florence bothwell and strathroy watersheds respectively with the loads generally higher during high discharge compared with low discharge conditions table 1 the no3 n stream loads were also generally higher during high flow conditions and ranged from 19 to 913 kg d 7 to 544 kg d and 7 to 58 kg d for the florence bothwell and strathroy watersheds table 1 the percentage of no3 n loads measured at the watershed outlets that could be associated with septic systems was low for all watersheds with bothwell having the highest possible percentage contribution mean 2 0 7 and 2 0 9 considering low and high discharge conditions respectively table 1 the percentage contribution of septic systems to the measured tp stream loads was higher than for no3 n considering high discharge conditions the mean percentage contribution of septic systems to the tp stream load was 9 4 36 20 and 5 3 for florence bothwell and strathroy respectively the mean percentage contribution was similar for low discharge conditions 8 4 32 24 and 5 4 for florence bothwell and strathroy respectively this is because although the measured tp stream load was greater for high discharge conditions the septic effluent reaching the outlet as determined by acesulfame stream loads was also higher the high uncertainties for the percentage of tp derived from septic systems is due to the large variability in measured tp concentrations in septic tanks 10 5 2 mg l p lowe et al 2009 as well as high variability in the measured tp stream loads between sampling events c q relationships for tp and no3 n differed from the positive chemodynamic behavior for acesulfame fig s4 further suggesting that septic effluent inputs do not control the nutrient dynamics in the streams for these watersheds to provide a potentially more realistic estimate of the tp mass from septic systems that is reaching the stream the estimated tp mass load from septic systems as determined from acesulfame was refined assuming 66 attenuation of tp below the septic drain field robertson et al 2019 while this refinement reduces the percentage contribution of septic systems to the tp stream loads i e 3 1 12 6 and 2 1 for florence bothwell and strathroy respectively for high discharge conditions the overall findings are consistent given other uncertainties in the calculations considering tp attenuation the contribution of septic systems to the measured tp stream load considering individual sampling events was greatest 36 19 under low flow conditions in late summer in bothwell when the measured stream tp load was lowest it is important to note that while the attenuation factor was applied to all the septic derived tp load p attenuation may in fact be less for septic effluent that is delivered to the stream via surface transport direct misconnections or misconnections short circuiting by agricultural tile drains as such future efforts should focus on better quantifying the pathways by which septic effluent is delivered to streams such that septic derived p loading estimates to surface waters can be more accurately quantified comparing the results between the watersheds the percentage contribution of septic effluent to the tp and no3 n stream loads were consistently higher for the bothwell watershed compared to the florence and strathroy watersheds table 1 this may be due to the higher septic system density in the bothwell watershed combined with lower agricultural land use and thus lower agricultural nutrient loadings this finding highlights the potentially larger contribution of septic effluent to nutrient stream loads in rural urbanized areas compared with rural agricultural areas 4 environmental implications this study demonstrates high temporal variability in mass loads of the artificial sweetener acesulfame at three watershed outlets indicating highly variable septic system effluent inputs to the streams the results suggest that one off or snapshot stream sampling does not provide an accurate representation of the septic effluent inputs to a stream positive c q relationships for acesulfame at the watershed outlets reported here for the first time contradict the common assumption that septic effluent is predominantly delivered to surface waters via groundwater discharge and that therefore septic derived contaminant concentrations will be highest during low flows the positive c q relationships suggest more complicated pathways than simply subsurface inputs whereby additional transport pathways e g surface transport or increased in stream transport may be activated under high discharge conditions leading to increased delivery of less dilute septic effluent to the watershed outlets the data indicate that watershed studies that sample only during low flow conditions may substantially underestimate total septic effluent loads to streams also pathogen concentrations associated with septic effluent could be elevated in surface waters during peak flows if surface transport pathways are activated additional field work is needed in watersheds with different characteristics watershed area surficial geology septic system density septic system age land use to determine if the findings from this study are widespread the field methods and calculations used in this study can be applied in other watersheds although the estimated acesulfame load generated from septic systems may need to be adjusted for other geographic regions with different diets and prevalence of acesulfame in consumer products detailed spatiotemporal sampling including use of tracers to identify relative water sources groundwater versus new surface water stable water isotopes and radon 222 is also needed to better disentangle the various contributing transport pathways as quantification of the rapid pathways is critical for evaluating the risks posed by septic systems with respect to nutrient pathogen and emerging contaminant loads to streams for instance the percentage contribution of septic systems to tp loads reported in this study will vary depending on the pathways via which septic effluent reaches the stream i e p is highly attenuated in the subsurface but may experience negligible attenuation if rapid transport pathways deliver effluent to the stream the findings of this study and future studies that use acesulfame as a tracer are needed to refine estimates of septic derived nutrient and contaminant loads to tributaries and to revise regulations for the design and maintenance of septic systems for instance if septic system failures are found to be prevalent in a watershed then increased design and construction oversight and mandatory re inspection programs should be considered credit authorship contribution statement lauren e oldfield investigation writing

5378,septic systems are often cited as an important contributor to rural watershed nutrient loads despite limited quantitative evidence regarding their actual contribution the measurement of the artificial sweetener acesulfame in streams to quantify upstream inputs of septic system effluent has recently been proposed however there is a lack of detailed study on this application including temporal variability influence of dry and wet weather conditions and disentangling the contributions from functioning versus failing septic systems further this approach has not been applied to assess the relative contribution of septic systems to nutrient watershed loads here we conducted artificial sweetener and nutrient stream measurements in three watersheds with no other identified sources of acesulfame e g no municipal wastewater treatment plants landfills over a 10 month period measured acesulfame stream concentrations varied from below detection 2 ng l to 87 ng l with acesulfame stream loads revealing that septic system inputs to streams vary considerably between low and high stream discharge conditions positive acesulfame concentration stream discharge relationships for all three watersheds reveal the potentially important contributions from failing septic systems and surface flow pathways i e effluent breakout from septic drain field under high discharge conditions further they indicate that contrary to conventional thinking sampling under low discharge conditions may underestimate septic effluent delivery to streams the estimated contribution of septic systems to measured total phosphorus stream loads on a given sampling day varied widely 1 36 considering attenuation between the septic tank and stream but typically septic system contributions to nitrate stream loads were low 2 the findings provide guidance on the application of this new tool for managing septic effluent contributions of nutrients and other wastewater contaminants to rural watershed streams keywords onsite wastewater treatment systems phosphorus nutrients tracer field measurements 1 introduction surface water eutrophication caused by excessive nutrient phosphorus p and nitrogen n loads is a major concern with nuisance and toxic algal blooms and hypoxic conditions costing billions of dollars annually in economic and ecological damages harke et al 2016 paerl et al 2016 watson et al 2016 for example the massive algal bloom in lake erie in 2014 which led to drinking water supply disruptions for the city of toledo ohio is estimated to have cost us65 million bingham et al 2015 quantifying and reducing nutrient loads to surface waters is challenging due to high contributions from diffuse sources one such source is septic systems which are onsite wastewater treatment units widely used worldwide in areas not serviced by municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps it is estimated that septic systems are used in 26 of households across europe williams et al 2012 and more than 20 of households in the united states u s epa 2018 despite numerous studies linking septic systems to groundwater and surface water quality impairments e g mechtensimer and toor 2016 schaider et al 2016 verhougstraete et al 2015 withers et al 2014 the contribution of septic systems to stream watershed nutrient loads is poorly quantified furthermore septic systems may be an important source of other contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products and pathogens james et al 2016 schaider et al 2017 verhougstraete et al 2015 septic systems are designed to release partially treated wastewater into the unsaturated zone below a septic drain field commonly the released septic effluent infiltrates through the unsaturated zone to the water table where it is then transported by groundwater flow if the resultant groundwater septic plume reaches and discharges to a nearby stream the septic effluent constituents may be added to the stream watershed load in agricultural areas the groundwater septic plume may also be short circuited by field tile drains which also discharge to adjacent streams during high water table periods it is estimated that for well functioning systems around 20 of total p tp in the raw wastewater is removed in the septic tank due to particulate p settling in the tank lusk et al 2017 the main forms of p in the effluent released to the drain field are srp soluble reactive phosphorus and organic p organic p is mostly mineralized to srp in the drain field and as such srp is the dominant form of p transported in the subsurface srp is also the bioavailable p fraction that stimulates plant including algal growth and is therefore of concern for water quality impairment it is often thought that srp is not overly mobile in the subsurface including within and downgradient of a septic drain field as it has a high tendency to interact with soils through sorption and precipitation reactions however increasing evidence suggests that srp can be mobile under certain conditions namely calcareous soils coarse grain soils neutral ph and following long sustained p input into the subsurface domagalski and johnson 2011 holman et al 2008 consistent with this high srp plumes have been observed 75 100 m downgradient of septic drain fields in calcareous sandy aquifers robertson et al 2019 roy et al 2017 compared to p n removal is generally poor in septic systems including in the septic tank and within and below the drain field organic n and ammonium nh4 n are the main forms of n in the wastewater effluent released to a septic drain field for well functioning systems these forms are rapidly converted to nitrate no3 n close to the drain field distribution lines lusk et al 2017 no3 n is more mobile and conservative in the subsurface than srp however its transport in the subsurface can be influenced by microbially mediated reactions including denitrification septic systems that are poorly designed situated or maintained can deliver excessive nutrient loads into adjacent surface waters withers et al 2014 in some cases suboptimal conditions can lead to septic tank overflow or a clogged or low permeability drain field this can result in septic effluent at ground surface and its potential transport overland to nearby surface waters during wet weather conditions beal et al 2005 withers et al 2014 cases have also been reported where although illegal septic effluent is directly discharged into agricultural tile drains drainage ditches or a nearby surface water together termed misconnections dunk et al 2008 the rates of all of these types of septic system failures are estimated at 20 in canada council of canadian academies 2009 and up to 70 in the united kingdom and ireland withers et al 2014 the complexity of nutrient behavior in the subsurface below a septic drain field and downgradient robertson 2008 robertson et al 2019 robinson 2015 as well as uncertainty around the rate and type of failure of septic systems in a given watershed makes quantifying and predicting nutrient loads from septic systems to streams challenging furthermore inventories of septic system numbers and locations within watersheds often do not exist the use of direct field measurements of stream nutrients to quantify septic system contributions is confounded by the diffuse nature of septic derived nutrient inputs as well as contributions from other nutrient sources such as those associated with agriculture robinson 2015 speed et al 2018 currently the most promising solutions to overcome these challenges is the measurement of a suitable human wastewater tracer in streams tracers previously used include inorganic wastewater constituents e g chloride boron sodium pharmaceuticals caffeine and microbial source tracking markers e g james et al 2016 richards et al 2017 verhougstraete et al 2015 however these tracers are either not ubiquitously used amongst the population can be linked with other common sources or are not conservative in the environment i e degradation sorption limited viability foolad et al 2015 james et al 2016 richards et al 2017 van stempvoort et al 2013 the wastewater tracer that shows the most promise to date for quantifying septic effluent inputs to streams is the artificial sweetener acesulfame spoelstra et al 2020 spoelstra et al 2017 artificial sweeteners including acesulfame saccharin cyclamate and sucralose are an emerging class of human wastewater tracers lange et al 2012 all have negligible sorption and low analytical detection limits buerge et al 2009 burke et al 2014 lange et al 2012 artificial sweeteners are widely used in consumer products including diet beverages and foods they are also in products such as pharmaceuticals and toothpaste and therefore are present in human wastewater even in households that avoid consumption of artificially sweetened foods spoelstra et al 2020 recently proposed using acesulfame as the primary tracer for septic effluent inputs to streams due to its relatively high persistence through wastewater treatment and in the environment including during subsurface transport and frequent detection in wastewater affected waters other artificial sweeteners either have i higher degradation rates in wastewater activated sludge and or soil e g saccharin cyclamate buerge et al 2009 spoelstra et al 2013 ii slightly higher detection limits and therefore commonly found at non detect concentrations in the environment e g sucralose spoelstra et al 2020 or iii can be attributed to other sources such as pig feed e g saccharin ma et al 2017 or the breakdown of some sulfonylurea herbicides e g saccharin berger and lee wolfe 1996 further discussion regarding the efficacy of using acesulfame as a human wastewater tracer compared with other artificial sweeteners is described by spoelstra et al 2020 it is important to note that while acesulfame has been found to be the most recalcitrant artificial sweetener recent studies have shown it can be degraded to some extent through wastewater treatment processes buerge et al 2011 castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 men et al 2017 and also naturally in surface waters by sunlight gan et al 2014 spoelstra et al 2020 recently presented a broad scale study where acesulfame concentrations measured in 173 rural streams across southern ontario canada during baseflow conditions were used to estimate how much septic system effluent the streams receive by combining acesulfame concentrations with general estimates of septic system density upstream and estimated stream discharge they reported that on average 18 of septic effluent generated within watersheds is reaching the streams while this study provides valuable preliminary estimates potential temporal variability in acesulfame stream loads was neglected and it was assumed that septic effluent reaches streams predominately via shallow groundwater discharge other potential pathways via which septic effluent may reach the stream were not explored although the specific transport pathways e g subsurface transport surface transport misconnections determine the fate and delivery of nutrients and other contaminants from septic systems to the stream finally the contribution of septic systems to watershed nutrient loads was not quantified by spoelstra et al 2020 or any prior studies through application of tracer data although septic system contributions are a key uncertainty for nutrient source apportionment in watersheds to address these research gaps the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate variability in the fraction of septic effluent generated in a watershed that reaches the watershed outlet over time and between watersheds 2 assess the relative importance of the various pathways by which septic effluent may be transported to the watershed outlet and 3 quantify the potential contribution of septic systems to watershed nutrient loads using acesulfame derived septic effluent loads to address these objectives acesulfame and nutrient stream concentrations and loads were measured across a range of discharge conditions over a 10 month period in three watersheds in the lake erie basin canada that have no other major sources of acesulfame i e municipal wwtp landfills recreational areas as there was no existing inventory of septic system numbers a geospatial tool was developed to spatially locate septic systems in the watersheds uncertainty in the use of acesulfame as a tracer for quantifying septic effluent input to the streams is discussed with the calculations used in this study thought to provide a lower limit on the fraction of septic effluent that is delivered to the watershed outlets ultimately the study findings provide important insight into the timing and delivery of septic effluent to streams in addition to the testing of field tools suitable for quantifying septic system contributions to nutrient and other contaminant loads at the watershed scale this information is needed to improve actions aimed at reducing loads of nutrients and other contaminants to surface waters including the establishment of regulations regarding the design maintenance and monitoring of septic systems 2 methodology 2 1 description of study sites this study focuses on three watersheds in the ontario lake erie basin canada which are herein named based on the closest town florence 76 km2 bothwell 14 km2 and strathroy 24 km2 fig 1 these watersheds have no other major sources of acesulfame including landfills municipal wwtps discharges or recreational areas while artificial sweeteners including acesulfame can be found in wwtp biosolids that are applied to agricultural fields as acesulfame does not readily adsorb to biosolids storck et al 2016 this is expected to only be a minor source of acesulfame in the watersheds buerge et al 2011 the three watersheds have primarily agricultural land use 75 90 with 5 10 forest cover bothwell has the highest urban land use 20 compared to florence and strathroy 5 development in these watersheds occurred mostly before 1960 which is around when septic systems became popular in ontario rutty and sullivan 2010 sandy deposits are the major surficial geology in all three watersheds with florence having minor silt areas in the west near the watershed outlet and strathroy having small gravel areas throughout as well as silt diamicton and organic deposits in the northeast ontario ministry of energy northern development and mines 2003 there is extensive agricultural tile drain coverage in the florence and bothwell watersheds ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2018 suggesting that despite the permeable sand gravel surficial geology classification by ontario ministry of energy northern development and mines 2003 the soils in these watersheds may be poorly draining and or there is a high water table elevation the three watersheds drain into the sydenham river which ultimately drains to lake erie through lake st clair no inventory existed for the numbers and locations of septic systems in the watersheds as such the locations of individual residential septic systems were identified in arcgis using 0 2 m resolution imagery from the south western ontario orthoimagery project swoop ontario ministry of natural resources and forestry 2015 and property parcel boundaries teranet inc 2014 the populations in these watersheds reside year round and there are no known neighborhood septic systems septic systems associated with commercial and industrial buildings were not included in the inventory as there are few of these buildings in the study watersheds and there is limited in flux of non residents into the watersheds this is not expected to affect the study results details on the methodology used to locate individual residential septic systems is provided in the supplementary material 2 2 field measurements and sample analysis measurements of stream discharge and sampling for stream concentrations of artificial sweeteners acesulfame saccharin cyclamate sucralose and nutrients tp no3 n were conducted from nov 2017 to aug 2018 at the watershed outlets fig 1b stream discharge was calculated using the mid point method turnipseed and sauer 2010 from vertically averaged stream velocity measurements performed using a velocimeter global water flow probe fp111 and water depth at 0 5 m increments across the stream stream samples were collected in three 60 ml ldpe bottles for analysis of tp no3 n and artificial sweeteners all samples except tp samples were filtered immediately using 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters samples were kept cold during transport and stored frozen until analysis except for tp samples which were analyzed within 24 h of collection tp was analyzed using a uv vis spectrometer hach method 8190 no3 n was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters 432 w 717 plus autosampler samples were analyzed for artificial sweeteners acesulfame saccharin cyclamate sucrolose using ion chromatography thermo fisher dionex ics 5000 system and ion suppression using a dionex 60 aers 500 2 mm coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer ab sciex concord on canada 5500 qtrap ms ms with an electrospray ionization source in negative mode the detection limits of acesulfame saccharin cyclamate and sucralose were 2 2 3 and 20 ng l respectively all stream samples were below the detection limit for cyclamate and only seven samples were above the detection limit for sucralose and therefore this data is not discussed additional details on the analytical method used for artificial sweetener analysis including qa qc results are provided in the supplementary material 2 3 data analysis the stream mass loads kg d at the watershed outlets for all analyzed constituents were first calculated for all sampling events using the measured stream discharge and concentrations the acesulfame stream load was divided by an estimated mass of acesulfame generated from a single septic system per day to determine the equivalent number of septic systems contributing effluent to the stream this value can be interpreted as the equivalent number of septic systems that contribute all their effluent to the stream or alternatively and more realistically a summation of all partial contributions from septic systems to the stream in the watershed the fraction of septic effluent reaching the watershed outlet on a given sampling day was calculated by dividing the equivalent number of septic systems by the total number of septic systems in the watershed the acesulfame load from a single septic system was estimated to be 2 53 10 5 0 24 10 5 kg d this is based on the mean acesulfame concentration in septic tanks of single dwellings of 43 8 1 standard deviation µg l 4 2 µg l n 14 snider et al 2017 as used by spoelstra et al 2020 an average per person indoor household water usage of 221 8 l d gauley associated ltd 2016 and an average 2 6 people per household statistics canada 2016 similar to the approach used for acesulfame saccharin stream loads were also converted to equivalent number of septic system using an estimated daily amount of saccharin generated by one septic system 1 10 10 5 0 07 10 5 kg d this value is based on the mean saccharin concentration in septic tanks of single dwellings of 19 0 1 standard deviation µg l 1 2 µg l n 14 snider et al 2017 it is important to recognize the uncertainties associated with the use of acesulfame and the approach described above to calculate the fraction of septic effluent in the stream firstly the acesulfame concentrations used for the septic tank are based on a mean standard deviation of samples from single dwelling septic tanks for which the acesulfame concentrations were found to range widely from 3 4 to 184 7 μg l the data were collected mostly from cottage properties that have seasonal to year round use to limit the impact of cottages that do not have high water use appliances e g dishwashers laundry snider et al 2017 derived average artificial sweetener concentration values following a log transformation to correct for skewness to large values still the mean values used here may not perfectly reflect concentrations in septic systems for year round dwellings it is thought however that variability in acesulfame concentrations between septic tanks will be smoothed out when considering septic effluent contributions at the watershed scale from hundreds of septic systems secondly while acesulfame is one of the most recalcitrant artificial sweeteners along with sucralose recent studies have shown that acesulfame can be susceptible to degradation within some wwtps buerge et al 2011 castronovo et al 2017 kahl et al 2018 men et al 2017 and also naturally in surface waters by sunlight gan et al 2014 as such it is possible that some degradation of acesulfame occurs either in the septic drain field or as acesulfame is transported along subsurface and or stream flow paths towards the watershed outlet due to the potential degradation of acesulfame the calculations presented may underestimate the fraction of septic effluent at the watershed outlets note that the acesulfame concentration in the septic tank rather than in the raw wastewater is considered in the calculations and as such any acesulfame degradation that occurs in the septic tank itself is taken into account thirdly acesulfame has only been in use in canada since 1988 gougeon et al 2004 this means that in using acesulfame as a tracer we are only able to account for septic effluent that was generated in the last 30 years this may again lead to underestimation of the fraction of septic effluent in the stream as it is possible that groundwater plumes from some septic systems may take more than 30 years to reach the stream it is recommended that future studies look at reducing these uncertainties for this current study the key findings hold despite these uncertainties as the focus is on evaluating variability in the fraction of septic effluent reaching the watershed outlets rather than simply providing an absolute value for the magnitude of the septic effluent reaching the outlets acesulfame concentration c stream discharge q relationships were evaluated for the three watersheds to provide insight into the transport of acesulfame and thus septic effluent to the watershed outlets moatar et al 2017 rose et al 2018 c q relationships were analyzed using a power relationship c aq b where b is a unitless exponent representing the slope of the log transformed c q relationship following moatar et al 2017 for b 0 2 the relationship is chemodynamic and positive indicating higher flows are mobilizing and delivering higher concentration acesulfame sources to the watershed outlet for b 0 2 the relationship is chemodynamic and negative indicating that continuous acesulfame inputs are diluted as the stream discharge increases for 0 2 b 0 2 the relationship is chemostatic whereby the concentration varies independently of discharge the statistical significance of the c q relationships were tested in minitab by pearson product moment correlation with the significance level set at 0 05 estimates of the maximum nutrient load at the watershed outlets that maybe attributed to septic systems were evaluated by multiplying the equivalent number of septic systems contributing effluent to the stream as determined from the acesulfame stream load by estimated tp and total nitrogen tn loads from a single septic system 5 8 10 3 3 0 10 3 kg d and 37 10 3 12 10 3 kg d respectively these estimated loads assume a mean tp concentration in the septic tank of 10 1 standard deviation mg l p 5 2 mg l p n 63 a mean tn concentration of 64 1 standard deviation mg l n 21 mg l n n 63 lowe et al 2009 an average per person indoor household water usage of 221 8 l d gauley associated ltd 2016 and an average 2 6 people per household statistics canada 2016 the calculated acesulfame corrected maximum septic derived nutrient loads are those loads that will reach the stream if there is negligible removal of n and p between the septic tank and stream as may occur for direct misconnections the calculated loads were compared with the stream tp and no3 n loads measured on a given sampling day to determine the maximum fraction of tp and no3 n stream watershed load that may be attributed to septic systems for this calculation it is assumed that all ammonium and organic n in the septic tank effluent transforms to no3 n in the drain field lusk et al 2017 and as such the amount of tn released from the septic tank is compared with the measured no3 n stream load while n removal in the septic drain field is generally low lusk et al 2017 a recent review of field data by robertson et al 2019 found that on average 66 of tp in the septic tank effluent is removed in the septic drain field in areas where the soil is calcareous as it is in our study watersheds as such in addition to calculating a maximum possible septic derived p load to the stream a p attenuation factor was applied recognizing this high tendency of p to adsorb and precipitate in the drain field for this the calculated acesulfame corrected septic derived tp loads were multiplied by 34 100 minus attenuation factor of 66 to provide a more realistic estimate of the tp load from septic systems to the stream assuming the majority of septic effluent is transported through the subsurface 3 results and discussion 3 1 septic system placement the watersheds florence bothwell and strathroy are estimated to have 272 298 and 127 septic systems respectively fig 1 the associated densities of septic systems in each watershed are 3 4 septics km2 21 3 septics km2 and 5 0 septics km2 bothwell has 89 of its septic systems in an urban area with this area located in the upstream section of the watershed in comparison only 49 of septic systems in florence are in an urban area and in strathroy there is no urban area considering the surficial sediment type florence bothwell and strathroy have 206 76 298 100 and 90 74 septic systems respectively located in sand and or gravel sediment 3 2 amount of septic effluent reaching watershed outlets acesulfame was found at concentrations above the detection limit 2 ng l in all stream samples from all three watersheds except for one sampling event in strathroy 27 nov 2017 for that single outlier the acesulfame concentration was assumed to be half the detection limit 1 ng l in subsequent calculations acesulfame concentrations at the three watershed outlets over the 10 month sampling period are shown together with the measured stream discharge in fig 2 acesulfame stream concentrations varied from 11 to 39 ng l 9 87 ng l and 2 15 ng l for florence bothwell and strathroy respectively as there are no other known or expected major sources of acesulfame in these watersheds the presence of acesulfame at the watershed outlets suggests septic effluent is reaching the streams these data show that acesulfame stream concentrations at the outlets vary considerably over time fig 2 suggesting that a one off snapshot baseflow sampling approach as used by spoelstra et al 2020 may not provide comprehensive estimation of septic effluent inputs to a stream temporal variability in the acesulfame concentrations at the watershed outlets may be caused by changes in acesulfame mass added to the stream or changes in the transport of acesulfame through the stream network to the watershed outlets alternately it may reflect different amounts of dilution caused by changing water inputs to the stream i e flow conditions this is explored in the next section by examining the concentration stream discharge c q relationships for each watershed the equivalent number of septic systems contributing effluent to the stream determined from the stream acesulfame concentrations and stream discharge and recognizing the variability in the representative septic tank acesulfame concentration used in the calculation mean 1 standard deviation also exhibited high temporal variability the equivalent number of septic systems ranged from 3 0 3 95 9 septic systems in florence 7 0 10 5 2 4 10 3 kg d fig 2b 1 5 0 1 290 28 septic systems in bothwell 3 8 10 5 7 3 10 3 kg d fig 2c and 0 4 0 03 15 1 septic systems in strathroy 8 8 10 6 3 7 10 4 kg d fig 2d for the majority of the sampling events the equivalent number of contributing septic systems were much lower than the total number of septic systems in the watersheds 272 298 and 127 septic systems in florence bothwell and strathroy indicating that generally most of the septic system effluent is not reaching the stream higher acesulfame stream loads in all watersheds were observed in late spring i e april and may with loads converted to equivalent number of septic systems close to the total number of septic systems in the bothwell watershed in late spring however note that the sample size was small for winter n 2 and no sampling was conducted in fall it is possible that the septic effluent that is not reaching the stream is being transported to deeper groundwater systems not intercepted by the stream transported to other disconnected surface water bodies including wetlands or alternatively the acesulfame may be taken up by vegetation e g ma et al 2017 it is also possible that the septic effluent is trapped in disconnected compartments of the watershed and that our sampling was not sufficient to capture all peak events when this trapped effluent was released for these peak events similar to the one observed in bothwell in late spring the acesulfame stream loads may be reach close to 100 contribution as the trapped acesulfame is released finally as discussed above the acesulfame may also degrade to some extent and therefore the equivalent septic system numbers presented are a lower estimate on the amount of septic effluent reaching the stream the sampling events were separated into low and high discharge conditions by classifying high discharge conditions as those where there was a 40 increase in stream discharge from the preceding low discharge conditions bowes et al 2015 as shown in fig 3 the acesulfame stream loads in the three watersheds are greater for high discharge compared to low discharge conditions considering low discharge conditions only the mean percentage of septic effluent delivered to the watershed outlets was 9 1 8 1 and 2 0 3 for florence bothwell and strathroy 25 3 22 3 and 3 0 4 equivalent septic systems respectively in contrast for high discharge conditions the mean percentage of septic effluent delivered to the stream was 24 2 33 4 and 6 0 7 for florence bothwell and strathroy 65 7 99 11 8 1 equivalent septic systems respectively these results underscore the need to consider temporal variability in designing stream sampling protocols given that sampling only under low discharge conditions as was done by spoelstra et al 2020 can considerably underestimate the percentage of septic effluent reaching the watershed outlet the acesulfame stream loads presented above show a clear difference in the percentage of septic effluent reaching the outlets between the study watersheds with a lower percentage of septic effluent reaching the outlet for strathroy compared to florence and bothwell for both high and low discharge conditions potential factors that may contribute to the differences in the percentage of septic effluent reaching the outlets between the watersheds are provided in table 2 calculation of the number of septic systems as a function of setback distance distance between septic system and stream revealed that different setback distances for the septic systems in each of the watersheds likely does not cause the differences between the watersheds supplementary material fig s3 rather the differences may be due to differences in the pathways via which septic effluent is reaching the watershed outlets while speculative it is possible that the lower percentage of septic effluent reaching the strathroy outlet compared to the florence and bothwell outlets is due to higher soil drainage and or a lower groundwater table in the watershed as suggested by the lower density of agricultural tile drains fig s2 these conditions are generally associated with better functioning septic systems including higher infiltration of septic effluent into the subsurface and less potential for septic system failure due to waterlogging or misconnections short circuiting of septic groundwater plumes by agricultural tile drains may also presumably be less in the strathroy watershed it is also important to note that sampling bias may play some role in the differences between the watersheds as a slightly different number of high discharge events were captured for the three watersheds variations in household acesulfame consumption and therefore the acesulfame load generated from septic systems may also account for the differences between the watersheds although it is expected this variability would be small considering the large number of septic systems in each watershed higher spatial and temporal resolution water quality sampling through the watersheds combined with household surveys are needed to better quantify the factors contributing to the differences between the watersheds 3 3 concentration discharge relationship for all watersheds the c q relationships for acesulfame show chemodynamic behavior with positive slopes b 0 and pearson product moment correlation indicating the relationships are significant α 0 05 fig 4 the significant positive c q relationships indicate that the acesulfame concentrations observed at the outlets may be controlled by transport limitations whereby additional hydrological pathways delivering less dilute higher concentration septic effluent to the watershed outlets are activated during wet weather conditions as stream discharge increases the positive c q relationship was strongest for strathroy b 0 93 compared with bothwell b 0 49 and florence b 0 23 suggesting greater importance of hydrological connectivity in governing acesulfame concentration at the watershed outlet for strathroy the positive c q relationships for the three watersheds were somewhat unexpected due to the common notion that septic effluent is delivered predominately to streams via subsurface flow paths spoelstra et al 2020 if this were the case it would lead to a flat or negative c q relationship whereby increasing water inputs during high discharge conditions would dilute acesulfame and other septic effluent contaminants concentrations at the watershed outlets conceptually there are several factors that may contribute to the observed c q relationships and temporal variability in acesulfame stream loads some of which affect the transport of septic effluent to the stream and others that affect acesulfame in stream transport to the watershed outlet table 2 during low discharge periods subsurface transport is expected to be the main active pathway delivering acesulfame from septic systems to the stream with some potential contribution from direct misconnection of septic tanks to the stream through pipes dunk et al 2008 withers et al 2014 as discharge increases a rising groundwater table associated with rain and snow melt events may lead to increased groundwater discharge to the stream as well as higher drainage from agriculture tile drains which may short circuit shallow subsurface septic plumes both processes will cause larger inputs of septic effluent and associated acesulfame to the stream as the stream discharge continues to increase overland flow may become an important pathway with surface transport of septic effluent to the stream from failing septic systems i e as septic tile beds become waterlogged and effluent breaks out at the ground surface of these possible pathways that become activated under higher discharge conditions only short circuiting of the septic plume via agricultural tile drains and overland flow is expected to lead to the observed higher less dilute acesulfame concentrations observed at the watershed outlet as the stream discharge increases and thus the positive c q relationships it is recommended that future studies use stream tracers including stable water isotopes or radon 222 to better disentangle the acesulfame contributions from subsurface transport versus overland transport as the stream discharge varies it is also unclear if the positive c q relationships observed here are a function of the specific characteristics of the watersheds e g sand gravel surficial geology and therefore it is recommended that further work be conducted in other watersheds and geographical regions with different characteristics the longitudinal transport of acesulfame down the stream network may also contribute to the observed positive c q relationships at the watershed outlets for instance stream longitudinal connectivity was observed to be reduced i e as dry sections or stream cut off at road crossings during low discharge conditions this may have led to acesulfame from septic systems being trapped in disconnected stream reaches under low discharge conditions as stream discharge increases acesulfame concentrations and loads may increase due to the release and downstream transport of acesulfame stored in these previously disconnected stream reaches this may have contributed to the positive c q relationships particularly in strathroy where reduced stream connectivity was observed during low discharge conditions the highest measured acesulfame stream load 7 g d occurred at the bothwell outlet under high discharge conditions with the load equivalent to 290 28 septic systems delivering effluent to the outlet this is close to the total estimated number of septic systems in the watershed 298 septic systems this high load highlights the unsteady transport of acesulfame through the watershed caused by the trapping and subsequent release of acesulfame from different compartments of the hydrological landscape that become reconnected under high discharge conditions it is important to note that while other factors included in table 2 such as seasonal population changes and changing household acesulfame consumption and water usage patterns may also cause temporal variations in acesulfame stream loads these factors do not explain the positive c q relationships for the three watersheds stream concentration and load data for the artificial sweetener saccharin was also explored in an attempt to untangle the factors that may be contributing to the observed temporal variability in acesulfame concentrations and loads saccharin is less conservative in the environment compared to acesulfame buerge et al 2011 spoelstra et al 2017 and therefore it was thought that comparison of saccharin and acesulfame mass loads at the watershed outlets might provide insight into the relative contribution of fast i e overland transport from failed systems versus slow i e subsurface transport pathways in delivering septic effluent to the streams saccharin stream concentrations were all above the detection limit aside from two samples florence 3 may bothwell 27 nov the magnitude and temporal variability in the saccharin stream loads differ from the acesulfame stream loads both converted to the equivalent number of contributing septic systems fig 5 further the c q relationships for saccharin reveal chemostatic behavior with a flat relationship fig s5 in contrast with positive chemodynamic behavior for acesulfame fig 4 this suggests different sources or behavior transport reactivity degradation of saccharin and acesulfame in the watersheds importantly the average saccharin stream loads are higher than the average acesulfame loads in florence and strathroy the finding is inconsistent with acesulfame being more persistent than saccharin in the environment as well as acesulfame concentrations 43 8 4 2 µg l being higher in septic tanks compared with saccharin concentrations 19 0 1 2 µg l snider et al 2017 this suggests there may be additional sources of saccharin in these agricultural watersheds such as pig feed and associated field manure application ma et al 2017 or sulfonylurea herbicides berger and lee wolfe 1996 large observed spikes in saccharin concentrations and loads during high flow conditions in spring and summer coincided with spikes in tp and no3 n fig s5 suggesting high saccharin loads may be associated with manure runoff note that saccharin concentrations did not consistently peak when tp and no3 n were high which may be due to the timing seasonality of manure and inorganic fertilizer applications overall the additional sources of saccharin confounded our ability to use saccharin loads in combination with acesulfame loads to help untangle the various pathways by which septic effluent is delivered to the watershed outlets these findings indicate that caution is required if saccharin is used to evaluate septic effluent inputs to rural streams 3 4 contribution of septic systems to watershed nutrient loads as expected tp and no3 n concentrations and loads at the watershed outlets also varied considerably between sampling events fig s5 the tp stream loads ranged from 0 7 to 16 kg d 0 1 to 3 kg d and 0 06 to 2 kg d for the florence bothwell and strathroy watersheds respectively with the loads generally higher during high discharge compared with low discharge conditions table 1 the no3 n stream loads were also generally higher during high flow conditions and ranged from 19 to 913 kg d 7 to 544 kg d and 7 to 58 kg d for the florence bothwell and strathroy watersheds table 1 the percentage of no3 n loads measured at the watershed outlets that could be associated with septic systems was low for all watersheds with bothwell having the highest possible percentage contribution mean 2 0 7 and 2 0 9 considering low and high discharge conditions respectively table 1 the percentage contribution of septic systems to the measured tp stream loads was higher than for no3 n considering high discharge conditions the mean percentage contribution of septic systems to the tp stream load was 9 4 36 20 and 5 3 for florence bothwell and strathroy respectively the mean percentage contribution was similar for low discharge conditions 8 4 32 24 and 5 4 for florence bothwell and strathroy respectively this is because although the measured tp stream load was greater for high discharge conditions the septic effluent reaching the outlet as determined by acesulfame stream loads was also higher the high uncertainties for the percentage of tp derived from septic systems is due to the large variability in measured tp concentrations in septic tanks 10 5 2 mg l p lowe et al 2009 as well as high variability in the measured tp stream loads between sampling events c q relationships for tp and no3 n differed from the positive chemodynamic behavior for acesulfame fig s4 further suggesting that septic effluent inputs do not control the nutrient dynamics in the streams for these watersheds to provide a potentially more realistic estimate of the tp mass from septic systems that is reaching the stream the estimated tp mass load from septic systems as determined from acesulfame was refined assuming 66 attenuation of tp below the septic drain field robertson et al 2019 while this refinement reduces the percentage contribution of septic systems to the tp stream loads i e 3 1 12 6 and 2 1 for florence bothwell and strathroy respectively for high discharge conditions the overall findings are consistent given other uncertainties in the calculations considering tp attenuation the contribution of septic systems to the measured tp stream load considering individual sampling events was greatest 36 19 under low flow conditions in late summer in bothwell when the measured stream tp load was lowest it is important to note that while the attenuation factor was applied to all the septic derived tp load p attenuation may in fact be less for septic effluent that is delivered to the stream via surface transport direct misconnections or misconnections short circuiting by agricultural tile drains as such future efforts should focus on better quantifying the pathways by which septic effluent is delivered to streams such that septic derived p loading estimates to surface waters can be more accurately quantified comparing the results between the watersheds the percentage contribution of septic effluent to the tp and no3 n stream loads were consistently higher for the bothwell watershed compared to the florence and strathroy watersheds table 1 this may be due to the higher septic system density in the bothwell watershed combined with lower agricultural land use and thus lower agricultural nutrient loadings this finding highlights the potentially larger contribution of septic effluent to nutrient stream loads in rural urbanized areas compared with rural agricultural areas 4 environmental implications this study demonstrates high temporal variability in mass loads of the artificial sweetener acesulfame at three watershed outlets indicating highly variable septic system effluent inputs to the streams the results suggest that one off or snapshot stream sampling does not provide an accurate representation of the septic effluent inputs to a stream positive c q relationships for acesulfame at the watershed outlets reported here for the first time contradict the common assumption that septic effluent is predominantly delivered to surface waters via groundwater discharge and that therefore septic derived contaminant concentrations will be highest during low flows the positive c q relationships suggest more complicated pathways than simply subsurface inputs whereby additional transport pathways e g surface transport or increased in stream transport may be activated under high discharge conditions leading to increased delivery of less dilute septic effluent to the watershed outlets the data indicate that watershed studies that sample only during low flow conditions may substantially underestimate total septic effluent loads to streams also pathogen concentrations associated with septic effluent could be elevated in surface waters during peak flows if surface transport pathways are activated additional field work is needed in watersheds with different characteristics watershed area surficial geology septic system density septic system age land use to determine if the findings from this study are widespread the field methods and calculations used in this study can be applied in other watersheds although the estimated acesulfame load generated from septic systems may need to be adjusted for other geographic regions with different diets and prevalence of acesulfame in consumer products detailed spatiotemporal sampling including use of tracers to identify relative water sources groundwater versus new surface water stable water isotopes and radon 222 is also needed to better disentangle the various contributing transport pathways as quantification of the rapid pathways is critical for evaluating the risks posed by septic systems with respect to nutrient pathogen and emerging contaminant loads to streams for instance the percentage contribution of septic systems to tp loads reported in this study will vary depending on the pathways via which septic effluent reaches the stream i e p is highly attenuated in the subsurface but may experience negligible attenuation if rapid transport pathways deliver effluent to the stream the findings of this study and future studies that use acesulfame as a tracer are needed to refine estimates of septic derived nutrient and contaminant loads to tributaries and to revise regulations for the design and maintenance of septic systems for instance if septic system failures are found to be prevalent in a watershed then increased design and construction oversight and mandatory re inspection programs should be considered credit authorship contribution statement lauren e oldfield investigation writing

5379,vegetation plays a significant role in river ecosystem which has a great influence on hydraulic structures and sediment transport understanding the vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration ssc in canopy flow is helpful to study the process of riverbed erosion and deposition in vegetated channels aiming at the sediment laden flow in open channel covered with submerged vegetation this study divides the water depth into two layers along the vertical direction with the vegetation height as the boundary and then proposes a new ssc distribution model based on gravitational theory to estimate the vertical distribution of relative ssc in the free water layer and vegetation layer respectively in the meanwhile a new formula is also proposed to evaluate the reynolds shear stress below the submerged vegetation height which has been successfully applied in the derivation of the new ssc distribution model the validation results of the simplified velocity model the new reynolds shear stress formula and the new ssc model compare well with the collected experimental data series on top of that it is found that the uniformity of ssc distribution profile progressively decreases with the increasing sediment particles diameters besides according to the validation results and discussion it is believed that the controversy point about gravitational theory would not have obvious influence on the estimation of ssc distribution so that the gravitational theory can be adopted to investigate suspended sediment transport in vegetation flow that would be benefit for river ecological restoration and better management keywords submerged vegetation flow suspended sediment concentration vertical distribution energy conservation gravitational theory 1 introduction as a complex ecosystem rivers play an important role in transporting water sediment nutriment seeds and so on thus rivers and their vicinities have become a suitable habitat for vegetation and animals meanwhile with the concept of ecological rivers a large number of landscape trees and shrubs have been planted on both sides of the river fig 1 however the existence of aquatic vegetation can alter the flow resistance velocity profile and turbulence structure ghisalberti and nepf 2002 2004 huai et al 2019 katul et al 2011 pan et al 2019 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 these changes have a great influence on sediment transport but the complicated interactions among vegetation effect water flow and sediment movement have not been explained clearly moreover the sediment transport has a significant influence on the function and morphology of hydraulic structures bank erosion sediment deposition and the evolution of river channels curran and hession 2013 huang et al 2019 masoodi et al 2019 samadi et al 2009 2011 wu et al 2005 therefore it is interesting to study the interactions to reduce floods risk and have a better river management as a prerequisite to predict sediment transport the vegetation influence on currents needs to be investigated first in the past decades a lot of researchers paid attention to the characteristics of vegetation flow and obtained abundant research results the velocity profile is most widely touched topic and many velocity models were proposed nepf 2012 romdhane et al 2019 yang and choi 2010 this is also important since it affects the vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration ssc differentiating from the open channel without vegetation the vertical distribution of longitudinal velocity is nearly uniform for emergent vegetation flow and exponential in the exchange zone of vegetation layer for submerged vegetation flow fig 2 on the other hand the reynolds shear stress reflects the turbulence intensity which is the key factor to maintain sediment suspension in the currents the reynolds shear stress is demonstrated to decrease linearly from the vegetation height to water surface while dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 reported that the reynolds shear stress profile is exponential and the maximum shear stress appears on the vicinity of the canopy height for both flexible and rigid submerged vegetation for emergent vegetation flow the reynolds shear stress is small and can almost be ignored choi and kang 2004 yang et al 2015 moreover the resistance and drag force caused by the vegetation were also been widely studied different formulas table 1 are established to predict the resistance the vegetation drag force f d and the drag coefficient c d etminan et al 2017 sonnenwald et al 2019 tang et al 2014 tanino and nepf 2008 wang et al 2018 sediment transport can be divided into bed load transport and suspended load transport fig 3 for bed load transport previous research focused on the initiation of sediment motion bed load transport rate ashida and michiue 1972 wiberg and dungan smith 1989 and effects of bed load on hydraulic characteristics dey et al 2012 for suspended load transport the focus of research is on the distribution of ssc reference level and concentration suspended load transport rate van rijn 1984 samaga et al 1986 and suspended load transport capacity celik and rodi 1991 dey 2014 sun et al 2019 it should be noted that the distribution of ssc is the prerequisite to solve the other three problems previous studies indicated that the distribution of ssc could be classified into three types in open channel flows hu and hui 1995 qu et al 2019 type ⅰ distribution is that the ssc gradually increases from bed to a certain level where the ssc reaches the maximum value and then the ssc will progressively decrease from the level to the free surface type ii profile is that the ssc monotonically decreases from the bed to the free surface with the distribution presenting a hyperbolic upward concave shape type iii profile is a gentle inverse s shaped distribution with asymmetric concentration distribution from the water surface to the river bed fig 3 to predict the distribution of ssc a lot of formulas were proposed table 2 rouse 1937 first introduced a formula known as rouse equation of concentration to describe the distribution of ssc based on the diffusion concept hunt 1954 considered the equilibrium state of suspended load and fluid phases for steady uniform flow and then proposed the hunt equation velikanov 1954 developed the gravitational theory based on the energy conservation which was used to obtain a new equation of the ssc distribution and the gravitational theory is used to quantify the suspended load transport capacity which is helpful to study the erosion and sedimentation of rivers wihee 1981 zhang 1961 ni and wang 1991 characterized the sediment diffusion coefficient by the sediment mixing length and derived a generalized equation of ssc distribution based on the sediment diffusion equation in the generalized equation the parameter m with taking different values can transfer the generalized equation into different equations such as laursen equation m 0 hunt equation m 0 8 and rouse equation m 1 in the previous studies more and more attention has been paid to the sediment transport in vegetated channels chembolu et al 2019 jordanova and james 2003 qu et al 2019 investigation of the vegetation effects on the ssc distribution is important to predict the suspended load transport rate and transport capacity that will be helpful to take appropriate ecological means for river restoration by reducing bank erosion and creating habitat yang and choi 2010 obtained a simple relationship to describe the ssc distribution in a non emergent vegetation flow by assuming the velocity uniform in the canopy layer wang et al 2016 studied the wave and vegetation effects on suspended load characteristics by flume experiments based on the diffusion theory li et al 2018 established a two layer theoretical ssc distribution model by treating the velocity in the submerged vegetation layer exponential for steady open channel flow with vegetation huai et al 2019 came up with a random displacement model rdm by adopting the lagrangian approach to predict the ssc distribution li et al 2019 proposed a zero plane and plant height double modified rouse formula to describe the ssc distribution above dense vegetation in water flow by comparing these ssc distribution models in table 2 it can be found that the development of these models mainly based on two theories developed from different theoretical bases one is the diffusion theory which is based on fick s law and the other is the gravitational theory that is based on the principle of conservation of energy the differences of the two theories are embodied in that they have different governing equations which have been presented later by adopting diffusion theory to derive ssc distribution profile the main problem lies in how to combine sediment diffusion coefficient ε s with momentum diffusion coefficient ε m the common treatment is introducing the turbulent schmidt number s c t to establish an equation relationship between ε s and ε m however the value of s c t is difficult to determine so that it is usually relied on empirical formulas graf and cellino 2002 gualtieri et al 2017 pal and ghoshal 2016 tsujimoto 2014 differentiating from diffusion theory the development of gravitational theory is based on the energy conservation and basic hydraulic conditions without introducing other parameters in this respect gravitational theory is superior nevertheless all of the models to predict the ssc distribution can only obtain the ssc relative to that at a certain height thus previous researchers have done a lot of work to investigate reference level z b and reference concentration c b einstein 1950 set the reference level as twice the sediment diameter z b 2 d and according to the definition of bed load transport rate the reference concentration is c b q b u b b where q b is bed load transport rate and u b is the average particle velocity in the bed layer bijker 1971 believed that b could be set as the bed roughness height and c b could be the concentration of q b itakura and kishi 1980 proposed that the reference level could be set as 0 05 h dey 2014 summarized the previous research results and concluded that the reference concentration c b is taken as the near bed concentration at the reference level z b 0 05 h this study aims to investigate the effects of submerged vegetation on the suspended sediment transport in the open channel flow based on the gravitational theory by introducing a simplified velocity model of submerged vegetation flow and evaluating the energy loss caused by vegetation a new two layer ssc distribution model and a new formula to calculate the reynolds shear stress in vegetation layer are proposed then the predicting results calculated by the proposed formulas are validated by comparing with the collected experimental data sets finally the influence of sediment diameter on the distribution profile of ssc is studied by the proposed model and the gravitational theory applied to predict the ssc distribution profile in vegetation flow is discussed 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 gravitational theory energy concept the gravitational theory based on energy conservation was originally developed by velikanov 1954 to investigate the distribution of ssc for the fluid and sediment phase the energy balance equations were derived in a two dimensional steady uniform open channel flow as below fig 4 1 ρ g 1 c u s f w 1 u d dz 1 c τ w 2 ρ s ρ g 1 c c ω w 3 2 ρ s g c u s f w 4 ρ s ρ u d dz c τ w 5 where c suspended sediment concentration u longitudinal mean velocity s f energy slope ρ fluid phase density ρ s sediment phase density ω 13 95 ν d 2 1 09 ρ s ρ ρ g d 13 95 ν d falling velocity of sediment particle zhang 1961 g 9 81 m s2 gravity constant ν kinematic viscosity of water in eq 1 w 1 is the total work done by the fluid phase per unit time due to energy slope w 2 is the energy loss of fluid phase caused by reynolds shear stress for momentum exchange and w 3 denotes the energy used to maintain sediment in suspension in eq 2 w 4 represents the total energy supplied by the sediment phase per unit time due to energy slope and w 5 refers to the total energy loss due to the momentum exchange of sediment phase if the longitudinal mean velocity distribution is assumed to follow the classic logarithmic law as in plane channel flow the distribution of ssc can be modeled by combining eq 1 and eq 2 however it should be noted that the mean velocity distribution u plays a key role in the ssc distribution which requires an effective velocity model rather than the logarithmic law profile in vegetated channel flows 2 2 flow model submerged vegetations such as shrubs and aquatic plants widely exist in natural rivers and change the flow structure and the associated sediment transport process for a sufficiently developed submerged vegetation flow h 2 h nepf 2012 divided the whole water depth into three zones i e wake zone z h δ e exchange zone h δ e z h and free water zone h z h where δ e is the penetration length and can be calculated by the following formula 3 δ e 0 23 0 06 c d a where a d δ s 2 is the frontal area per canopy volume called as vegetation density d is the diameter of vegetation δ s is the average spacing between canopies the three zone velocity model proposed by nepf 2012 gives the velocity profiles as 4 u u κ ln z z m z 0 h z h u u 1 u h u 1 e k u h z h δ e z h u 1 2 g s f c d a z

and u h the velocity at the vegetation height k u is a constant parameter that has a reference value for rigid vegetation as 8 7 1 4 c d a nepf 2012 for simplicity the velocity model above is simplified as a two layer model in the following derivation the two layer model contains the upper free water layer h z h and the vegetation layer 0 z h the velocity profile in the vegetation layer is exponential as described in the exchange zone see eq 4 the validation of the present simplification will be analyzed in section 3 2 2 3 new ssc model based on gravitational theory compared with the sediment laden open channel flow without vegetation there is an additional energy loss term w 6 caused by vegetation in the vegetated flow however w 6 only exists in the submerged vegetation layer huai et al 2010 analyzed the force on a unit volume of water during a unit time in the submerged vegetation layer and evaluated the work done by vegetation as 5 w 6 1 2 c d a u 3 0 z h this vegetation induced energy loss term w 6 should be incorporated into the energy balance equations and a new ssc model can be formulated together with the simplified two layer velocity model 2 3 1 upper free water layer h z h based on the gravitational theory the energy balance equations in the upper free water layer for fluid and sediment phase are the same as eq 1 and eq 2 however a new logarithmic velocity profile see eq 4 which takes into account the vegetation effect is adopted i e 6 u u κ ln z z m z 0 combining eq 1 and eq 2 and integrating the sum of them from z to h gives h z h 7 g s f h z u v ρ s ρ ρ g ω z h c 1 c u d z the concentration c is small and the velocity u is large the ration c u is quite small so that the second term of the right hand side of eq 7 could be negligibly small as compared to the first term thus eq 7 can be simplified approximately as 8 u v g s f h z similarly 1 c is considered to be approximately equal to 1 thus by substituting eq 6 and eq 8 into eq 1 the differential equation for ssc in the upper free water layer can be derived as 9 dc dz ρ s ρ ρ κ ω s f u c h z ln z z m z 0 then the distribution of ssc can be obtained by integrating eq 9 from h to z i e 10 c c h e β 1 ξ 1 11 β 1 ρ s ρ ρ κ ω s f g s f h h 0 5 ρ s ρ ρ κ ω s f u 12 ξ 1 h z d z 1 z ln z z m z 0 where c h is the ssc at the vegetation height and symbol represents the relative height to h 2 3 2 submerged vegetation layer 0 z h for suspended sediment transport in the vegetation layer the energy balance mechanism is modified due to the energy loss caused by the vegetation drag force see eq 5 with which the new energy balance equations for fluid and sediment phase are proposed as 13 ρ g 1 c u s f u d dz 1 c τ ρ s ρ g 1 c c ω 1 2 ρ c d a u 3 1 c 14 ρ s g c u s f ρ s ρ u d dz c τ 1 2 ρ s c d a u 3 c the last terms of the right hand side of eq 13 and eq 14 are the vegetation drag force work on the fluid phase and sediment phase respectively these two terms reflect the energy loss induced by vegetation on a unit volume in sediment laden flow similarly combining eq 13 with eq 14 and integrating it with limits z to h yields 0 z h 15 g s f h z u v ρ s ρ ρ z h g ω c 1 c u d z 1 2 c d a z h u 2 d z the above equation can be simplified by ignoring the second term of the right hand side with the negligible c then eq 15 can be rewritten as 16 u v 1 2 c d a z h u 2 d z g s f h z according to the simplification of the velocity model in the submerged vegetation layer the longitudinal mean velocity is described as 0 z h 17 u u 1 u h u 1 e k u h z substituting eq 16 and eq 17 into eq 13 the differential equation of ssc in the vegetation layer can be similarly obtained as eq 9 the differential equation is expressed as 18 dc dz ρ s ρ ρ g ω c u 1 2 c d a z h u 2 d z g s f h z and the distribution of ssc could be also derived by integrating eq 18 from z to h as 19 c c h e β 2 ξ 2 20 β 2 ρ s ρ ρ g ω 21 ξ 2 z h 1 f z d z 22 f z u 1 η 1 e k u h z 1 2 c d a η 4 u 1 2 z η 2 e k

u h u 1 2 2 k u η 4 u 1 2 h 2 u 1 u h u 1 k u u h u 1 2 2 k u it is worth noting that f z as the denominator cannot be zero the value of f z is related to reynolds shear stress in the canopy layer which is determined by eq 16 on the river bed z 0 reynolds stress is zero however the vertical calculation range starts from z 0 05 h which is the reference level as mentioned above therefore f z will never take the value of zero in the calculation domain in summary a one dimensional ssc distribution model in a sediment laden flow with submerged vegetation is proposed based on the gravitational theory the basic formulations for the upper free water layer and vegetation layer are described by eq 10 and eq 19 respectively essentially different reynolds shear stress distributions produce different ssc distributions this indicates that the turbulent flow plays a key role in the transport and concentration distribution of suspended sediment the new ssc distribution model will be validated in section 3 4 3 validation and analysis 3 1 experimental data collected for validation to validate the simplified velocity model reynolds stress model and new ssc model different experimental data series are collected from the previous literature some of them are clear water experiments dunn et al 1996 huthoff and augustijn 2006 zhao et al 2019 and some are tests with low suspended sediment concentration in the flow lu 2008 to ensure flow fully developed along the vertical direction the relative water depth to vegetation height h h is greater than 2 in the collected experiments the vertical mean ssc in the collected experiments ranges from 1 67 to 4 92 furthermore the material of sediment particles used in these tests is plastic ρ s 1 082 g cm3 which is easier to suspend in the water flow the hydraulic conditions and characters of vegetation and sediment have been listed in table 3 mean relative error mre and pearson correlation coefficient cor are adopted to elucidate the quantitative error and the correlation between measured data and model results 24 mre i 1 n q i p i p i 100 n 25 cor pq p q n p 2 p 2 n q 2 q 2 n where p is measured data and q represents predicted values n is the number of data cor ranges from 1 to 1 and it means completely positive correlation between measured and predicted values with cor of 1 3 2 validation of the simplified velocity model in the derivation of new ssc distribution model the applicable velocity model eq 6 and eq 17 is the simplification of that proposed by nepf 2012 the vertical distribution of longitudinal mean velocity in the entire vegetation layer is considered to be exponential as described by eq 17 to validate the simplified model the comparisons of the model results with 12 experimental data sets are shown in fig 5 mre and cor are listed in table 4 it can be found that the longitudinal mean velocity in the wake zone is not actually uniform and the exponential profile can describe the velocity distribution trend according to table 4 mre varies from 2 06 case ⅴ to 7 55 c15 2 and cor ranges from 0 9885 c30 1 to 0 9990 case ⅴ the data indicates the simplified velocity has a moderate accuracy and there is a good correlation between measured and predicted values the deviations between model results and experimental data sets may be caused by the empirical parameters of the simplified velocity model such as z 0 and k u however on the whole the comparison results presented by fig 5 indicate that the simplified flow velocity model can basically predict the vertical distribution of velocity thus the simplified flow velocity model can be applied to develop the new ssc distribution model based on gravitational theory 3 3 validation of the reynolds stress model in the derivation of the ssc distribution in the vegetation layer a new formula eq 16 is proposed to model the reynolds stress as mentioned before the reynolds stress distribution is exponential in the canopy layer and the maximum value appears at the vegetation height the previous reynolds stress distribution model could be generalized as huai et al 2013 26 τ ρ u v ρ u v z h e α z h ρ g s f h h e α z h where α is a constant related to hydraulic conditions and vegetation properties huai et al 2013 proposed an empirical formula to estimate the constant i e 27 α c d a 0 03 h h fig 6 shows the comparisons of reynolds stress model results and experimental results in the vegetation layer results from the proposed formula eq 16 and previous formula eq 26 are presented above the vegetation height the distribution of reynolds shear stress is approximately linear and calculated by eq 8 it should be mentioned that largest deviations occur in the upper free water layer of case 8 which has also been reported by dimitris and panayotis 2011 but the reason could be further explored nevertheless the predicted reynolds stress profiles by eq 16 and eq 26 are basically consistent with the experimental data according to the values of mre and cor presented in table 5 it can be found that eq 16 presents a better accuracy and correlation in canopy layer than eq 26 besides eq 16 can simplify the present derivation of the new ssc model hence eq 16 is applied in this paper besides the distribution profiles of eddy viscosity υ t presented in fig 6 are analyzed it can be found that υ t increases first and then decreases with the increasing relative height the peak values of eddy viscosity appear approximately near 0 4 h h above the vegetation height the distribution profiles are discontinuous and unsmooth at the vegetation height that may be caused by the complexity of hydraulic conditions near the vegetation height or the discontinuity of the velocity gradient du dz 3 4 validation of the new ssc model the compared suspended sediment concentration data is collected in a series of experiments which were conducted in a flume with rigid submerged vegetation lu 2008 the water depth varies from 0 15 m to 0 30 m with two vegetation densities a 3 m 1 and a 6 m 1 the median diameter of light model sediment used in the experiments is 0 217 mm and the corresponding settling velocity is about 0 47 cm s in still water fig 7 shows the vertical distribution of the measured and predicted ssc the bottom edge of calculation domain is at the reference level 0 05h in order to distinguish the vegetation layer and the upper water layer the scaled concentration presented in fig 7 is normalized with the concentration at the vegetation height c h it can be found that all the distribution types are almost type iii in which the concentration increases from water surface to river bed with a gentle inverse s shaped distribution table 6 shows that mre ranges from 2 31 c15 1 to 10 58 c30 2 and cor varies from 0 9674 c24 1 to 0 9925 c15 2 the quantitative results elucidate that the new ssc model eq 10 and eq 19 results are basically in good agreement and correlation with the experimental data while there is relatively large deviation in the near bed region the reason behind the deviation could be attributed to the experiment error or the simplification of velocity profile which is not that appropriate close to the wall besides the left side and right side derivatives with respect to z h at the vegetation height are compared the values of the deviation between them range from 0 0033 to 0 0005 that means the left side derivative can be considered approximately equal to the right side derivative and the relative concentration at z h is 1 thus the ssc distribution is continuous and smooth at the vegetation height 3 5 sensitivity analysis of sediment diameter rouse 1937 defined the suspension number φ which could reflect the magnitude of gravity effect relative to turbulence intensity and the evenness of vertical distribution of ssc the suspension number is described as 28 φ ω κ u where ω is settling velocity m s and u is friction velocity m s κ is von kármán constant which is dimensionless if the suspended load effect on hydraulic conditions is ignored the influence of sediment diameter on the ssc distribution can be analyzed in a submerged vegetation flow with the same hydraulic condition so this paper adopt suspension number to perform sensitivity analysis of sediment diameter the hydraulic condition of c30 1 is selected with hypothetical sediment laden flow where the median diameter of light model sediment particles ρ s 1 082 g m 3 varies from 50 mm to 400 mm fig 8 shows the variation of the predicted ssc distribution with different diameters it can be found that the ssc distribution gradually becomes more and more uneven with the increasing suspension number this is mainly due to the gradual increase in the effect of gravity relative to turbulence with sediment diameters varying from 50 mm to 400 mm it is in consistent with the standpoint proposed by rouse 1937 therefore the new ssc model proposed in this paper could also reflect the influence of the relative magnitude of gravity and turbulence on the vertical distribution of suspended load in addition the type of vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration progressively changes from type iii to type ii with the suspension number increasing from 0 152 to 0 203 it indicates that the magnitude of gravity effect relative to turbulence intensity to some extent could reflect the type of ssc distribution to be more specific type ii usually occurs with larger suspension number that means gravity effect is dominant on the contrary type iii generally occurs when turbulence intensity is stronger than gravity effect 4 discussion eq 9 and eq 18 could be transformed into a same equation 29 ε s dc dz ω c 0 where ε s is a coefficient that is described as 30 ε s u τ γ s γ γ s and γ are the unit weight of sediment and water respectively it is obvious that eq 29 resembles the same form as the sediment diffusion equation from the diffusion theory in two dimensional steady uniform flow which could be written as 31 ε s dc dz ω c 0 where ε s is the sediment diffusion coefficient which is hard to be determined directly the common method to determine ε s is adopting the turbulent schmidt number to establish an empirical equal relationship with the momentum exchange coefficient however compared to ε s in diffusion theory ε s in eq 29 is obtained from the derivation with an explicit equation therefore gravitational theory avoid the problem mentioned before this is an advantage of gravitational theory over diffusion theory furthermore about gravitational theory the biggest controversy is treating the fluid and sediment phase of a unit volume of silt content water separately while both occupy the entire space at the same time dey 2014 in response to this issue this paper discusses as follows first of all the energy conservation equations for fluid and sediment phase are combined while deriving the vertical distribution of u v which is important for suspended sediment transport it means that the solid and fluid phases are not completely considered separately it only occurs in the process of integrating the ssc distribution by using the energy conservation equation of fluid phase while u v has been determined besides both the derivations conducted by velikanov 1954 and this paper based on gravitational theory assume that the work is appropriate for small concentration of sediment laden water flow it means that the proportion of sediment in the whole volume is very small thus during the derivation the simplification that considering 1 c approximately equal to 1 can be taken so it is considered in this paper that treating fluid and sediment phase separately would not have a big impact although there may be a little deviation and the validation results has proved it actually this is similar to ignoring the effects of sediment movement on hydrodynamic conditions such as velocity and turbulence intensity which is the mechanism for suspended sediment transport in conclusion this paper considers that the gravitational theory can be applied to solve the ssc distribution problem 5 conclusion for better understanding of suspended sediment transport in submerged vegetation flow this paper analyzes the applicability of gravitational theory and then proposes a new ssc distribution model which divides the water depth into the free water layer and the vegetation layer to estimate the distribution of relative suspended sediment concentration ssc along the vertical direction meanwhile a new formula is also proposed to estimate reynolds shear stress distribution below the submerged vegetation height in the derivation of the new ssc model then the simplified two layer velocity model the new ssc model and the formula to estimate reynolds shear stress are validated with collected experimental data respectively the comparison results indicate that the flow model the new ssc model and the reynolds stress formula proposed in this paper all moderately agree with measured data series and there is a good correlation between the experimental and predicted profiles and the ssc distribution is continuous and smooth at the vegetation height besides the influence of varying sediment diameters on the ssc distribution is analyzed and it can be found that the distribution profile gradually becomes more and more uneven with sediment diameter increasing on top of that the transition from type iii to type ii is reckoned to have a relationship with the magnitude of gravity effect relative to turbulence intensity furthermore according to the validation results and discussion it is considered that the controversy about gravitational theory has a little effect on the water flow with low concentration of suspended load so that the theory can be adopted to study suspended sediment transport in vegetation flow the proposed model could be helpful to investigate suspended sediment transport in the flow through submerged vegetation such as shrubs and the modified governing equations eq 13 and eq 14 of gravitational theory could be applied to study suspended load transport capacity in channels covered with submerged vegetation for better understanding of riverbed erosion and deposition in vegetated rivers however in flows through emergent canopies the characteristics of hydraulic conditions and sediment movement are significantly different which need further investigation in the future besides vegetation density has a great influence on hydraulic conditions so that the effect of vegetation density on ssc distribution is also worth further studying credit authorship contribution statement da li formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft

5379,vegetation plays a significant role in river ecosystem which has a great influence on hydraulic structures and sediment transport understanding the vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration ssc in canopy flow is helpful to study the process of riverbed erosion and deposition in vegetated channels aiming at the sediment laden flow in open channel covered with submerged vegetation this study divides the water depth into two layers along the vertical direction with the vegetation height as the boundary and then proposes a new ssc distribution model based on gravitational theory to estimate the vertical distribution of relative ssc in the free water layer and vegetation layer respectively in the meanwhile a new formula is also proposed to evaluate the reynolds shear stress below the submerged vegetation height which has been successfully applied in the derivation of the new ssc distribution model the validation results of the simplified velocity model the new reynolds shear stress formula and the new ssc model compare well with the collected experimental data series on top of that it is found that the uniformity of ssc distribution profile progressively decreases with the increasing sediment particles diameters besides according to the validation results and discussion it is believed that the controversy point about gravitational theory would not have obvious influence on the estimation of ssc distribution so that the gravitational theory can be adopted to investigate suspended sediment transport in vegetation flow that would be benefit for river ecological restoration and better management keywords submerged vegetation flow suspended sediment concentration vertical distribution energy conservation gravitational theory 1 introduction as a complex ecosystem rivers play an important role in transporting water sediment nutriment seeds and so on thus rivers and their vicinities have become a suitable habitat for vegetation and animals meanwhile with the concept of ecological rivers a large number of landscape trees and shrubs have been planted on both sides of the river fig 1 however the existence of aquatic vegetation can alter the flow resistance velocity profile and turbulence structure ghisalberti and nepf 2002 2004 huai et al 2019 katul et al 2011 pan et al 2019 yang et al 2015 zhao et al 2019 these changes have a great influence on sediment transport but the complicated interactions among vegetation effect water flow and sediment movement have not been explained clearly moreover the sediment transport has a significant influence on the function and morphology of hydraulic structures bank erosion sediment deposition and the evolution of river channels curran and hession 2013 huang et al 2019 masoodi et al 2019 samadi et al 2009 2011 wu et al 2005 therefore it is interesting to study the interactions to reduce floods risk and have a better river management as a prerequisite to predict sediment transport the vegetation influence on currents needs to be investigated first in the past decades a lot of researchers paid attention to the characteristics of vegetation flow and obtained abundant research results the velocity profile is most widely touched topic and many velocity models were proposed nepf 2012 romdhane et al 2019 yang and choi 2010 this is also important since it affects the vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration ssc differentiating from the open channel without vegetation the vertical distribution of longitudinal velocity is nearly uniform for emergent vegetation flow and exponential in the exchange zone of vegetation layer for submerged vegetation flow fig 2 on the other hand the reynolds shear stress reflects the turbulence intensity which is the key factor to maintain sediment suspension in the currents the reynolds shear stress is demonstrated to decrease linearly from the vegetation height to water surface while dijkstra and uittenbogaard 2010 reported that the reynolds shear stress profile is exponential and the maximum shear stress appears on the vicinity of the canopy height for both flexible and rigid submerged vegetation for emergent vegetation flow the reynolds shear stress is small and can almost be ignored choi and kang 2004 yang et al 2015 moreover the resistance and drag force caused by the vegetation were also been widely studied different formulas table 1 are established to predict the resistance the vegetation drag force f d and the drag coefficient c d etminan et al 2017 sonnenwald et al 2019 tang et al 2014 tanino and nepf 2008 wang et al 2018 sediment transport can be divided into bed load transport and suspended load transport fig 3 for bed load transport previous research focused on the initiation of sediment motion bed load transport rate ashida and michiue 1972 wiberg and dungan smith 1989 and effects of bed load on hydraulic characteristics dey et al 2012 for suspended load transport the focus of research is on the distribution of ssc reference level and concentration suspended load transport rate van rijn 1984 samaga et al 1986 and suspended load transport capacity celik and rodi 1991 dey 2014 sun et al 2019 it should be noted that the distribution of ssc is the prerequisite to solve the other three problems previous studies indicated that the distribution of ssc could be classified into three types in open channel flows hu and hui 1995 qu et al 2019 type ⅰ distribution is that the ssc gradually increases from bed to a certain level where the ssc reaches the maximum value and then the ssc will progressively decrease from the level to the free surface type ii profile is that the ssc monotonically decreases from the bed to the free surface with the distribution presenting a hyperbolic upward concave shape type iii profile is a gentle inverse s shaped distribution with asymmetric concentration distribution from the water surface to the river bed fig 3 to predict the distribution of ssc a lot of formulas were proposed table 2 rouse 1937 first introduced a formula known as rouse equation of concentration to describe the distribution of ssc based on the diffusion concept hunt 1954 considered the equilibrium state of suspended load and fluid phases for steady uniform flow and then proposed the hunt equation velikanov 1954 developed the gravitational theory based on the energy conservation which was used to obtain a new equation of the ssc distribution and the gravitational theory is used to quantify the suspended load transport capacity which is helpful to study the erosion and sedimentation of rivers wihee 1981 zhang 1961 ni and wang 1991 characterized the sediment diffusion coefficient by the sediment mixing length and derived a generalized equation of ssc distribution based on the sediment diffusion equation in the generalized equation the parameter m with taking different values can transfer the generalized equation into different equations such as laursen equation m 0 hunt equation m 0 8 and rouse equation m 1 in the previous studies more and more attention has been paid to the sediment transport in vegetated channels chembolu et al 2019 jordanova and james 2003 qu et al 2019 investigation of the vegetation effects on the ssc distribution is important to predict the suspended load transport rate and transport capacity that will be helpful to take appropriate ecological means for river restoration by reducing bank erosion and creating habitat yang and choi 2010 obtained a simple relationship to describe the ssc distribution in a non emergent vegetation flow by assuming the velocity uniform in the canopy layer wang et al 2016 studied the wave and vegetation effects on suspended load characteristics by flume experiments based on the diffusion theory li et al 2018 established a two layer theoretical ssc distribution model by treating the velocity in the submerged vegetation layer exponential for steady open channel flow with vegetation huai et al 2019 came up with a random displacement model rdm by adopting the lagrangian approach to predict the ssc distribution li et al 2019 proposed a zero plane and plant height double modified rouse formula to describe the ssc distribution above dense vegetation in water flow by comparing these ssc distribution models in table 2 it can be found that the development of these models mainly based on two theories developed from different theoretical bases one is the diffusion theory which is based on fick s law and the other is the gravitational theory that is based on the principle of conservation of energy the differences of the two theories are embodied in that they have different governing equations which have been presented later by adopting diffusion theory to derive ssc distribution profile the main problem lies in how to combine sediment diffusion coefficient ε s with momentum diffusion coefficient ε m the common treatment is introducing the turbulent schmidt number s c t to establish an equation relationship between ε s and ε m however the value of s c t is difficult to determine so that it is usually relied on empirical formulas graf and cellino 2002 gualtieri et al 2017 pal and ghoshal 2016 tsujimoto 2014 differentiating from diffusion theory the development of gravitational theory is based on the energy conservation and basic hydraulic conditions without introducing other parameters in this respect gravitational theory is superior nevertheless all of the models to predict the ssc distribution can only obtain the ssc relative to that at a certain height thus previous researchers have done a lot of work to investigate reference level z b and reference concentration c b einstein 1950 set the reference level as twice the sediment diameter z b 2 d and according to the definition of bed load transport rate the reference concentration is c b q b u b b where q b is bed load transport rate and u b is the average particle velocity in the bed layer bijker 1971 believed that b could be set as the bed roughness height and c b could be the concentration of q b itakura and kishi 1980 proposed that the reference level could be set as 0 05 h dey 2014 summarized the previous research results and concluded that the reference concentration c b is taken as the near bed concentration at the reference level z b 0 05 h this study aims to investigate the effects of submerged vegetation on the suspended sediment transport in the open channel flow based on the gravitational theory by introducing a simplified velocity model of submerged vegetation flow and evaluating the energy loss caused by vegetation a new two layer ssc distribution model and a new formula to calculate the reynolds shear stress in vegetation layer are proposed then the predicting results calculated by the proposed formulas are validated by comparing with the collected experimental data sets finally the influence of sediment diameter on the distribution profile of ssc is studied by the proposed model and the gravitational theory applied to predict the ssc distribution profile in vegetation flow is discussed 2 theoretical analysis 2 1 gravitational theory energy concept the gravitational theory based on energy conservation was originally developed by velikanov 1954 to investigate the distribution of ssc for the fluid and sediment phase the energy balance equations were derived in a two dimensional steady uniform open channel flow as below fig 4 1 ρ g 1 c u s f w 1 u d dz 1 c τ w 2 ρ s ρ g 1 c c ω w 3 2 ρ s g c u s f w 4 ρ s ρ u d dz c τ w 5 where c suspended sediment concentration u longitudinal mean velocity s f energy slope ρ fluid phase density ρ s sediment phase density ω

phase per unit time due to energy slope w 2 is the energy loss of fluid phase caused by reynolds shear stress for momentum exchange and w 3 denotes the energy used to maintain sediment in suspension in eq 2 w 4 represents the total energy supplied by the sediment phase per unit time due to energy slope and w 5 refers to the total energy loss due to the momentum exchange of sediment phase if the longitudinal mean velocity distribution is assumed to follow the classic logarithmic law as in plane channel flow the distribution of ssc can be modeled by combining eq 1 and eq 2 however it should be noted that the mean velocity distribution u plays a key role in the ssc distribution which requires an effective velocity model rather than the logarithmic law profile in vegetated channel flows 2 2 flow model submerged vegetations such as shrubs and aquatic plants widely exist in natural rivers and change the flow structure and the associated sediment transport process for a sufficiently developed submerged vegetation flow h 2 h nepf 2012 divided the whole water depth into three zones i e wake zone z h δ e exchange zone h δ e z h and free water zone h z h where δ e is the penetration length and can be calculated by the following formula 3 δ e 0 23 0 06 c d a where a d δ s 2 is the frontal area per canopy volume called as vegetation density d is the diameter of vegetation δ s is the average spacing between canopies the three zone velocity model proposed by nepf 2012 gives the velocity profiles as 4 u u κ ln z z m z 0 h z h u u 1 u h u 1 e k u h z h δ e z h u 1 2 g s f c d a z

and u h the velocity at the vegetation height k u is a constant parameter that has a reference value for rigid vegetation as 8 7 1 4 c d a nepf 2012 for simplicity the velocity model above is simplified as a two layer model in the following derivation the two layer model contains the upper free water layer h z h and the vegetation layer 0 z h the velocity profile in the vegetation layer is exponential as described in the exchange zone see eq 4 the validation of the present simplification will be analyzed in section 3 2 2 3 new ssc model based on gravitational theory compared with the sediment laden open channel flow without vegetation there is an additional energy loss term w 6 caused by vegetation in the vegetated flow however w 6 only exists in the submerged vegetation layer huai et al 2010 analyzed the force on a unit volume of water during a unit time in the submerged vegetation layer and evaluated the work done by vegetation as 5 w 6 1 2 c d a u 3 0 z h this vegetation induced energy loss term w 6 should be incorporated into the energy balance equations and a new ssc model can be formulated together with the simplified two layer velocity model 2 3 1 upper free water layer h z h based on the gravitational theory the energy balance equations in the upper free water layer for fluid and sediment phase are the same as eq 1 and eq 2 however a new logarithmic velocity profile see eq 4 which takes into account the vegetation effect is adopted i e 6 u u κ ln z z m z 0 combining eq 1 and eq 2 and integrating the sum of them from z to h gives h z h 7 g s f h z u v ρ s ρ ρ g ω z h c 1 c u d z the concentration c is small and the velocity u is large the ration c u is quite small so that the second term of the right hand side of eq 7 could be negligibly small as compared to the first term thus eq 7 can be simplified approximately as 8 u v g s f h z similarly 1 c is considered to be approximately equal to 1 thus by substituting eq 6 and eq 8 into eq 1 the differential equation for ssc in the upper free water layer can be derived as 9 dc dz ρ s ρ ρ κ ω s f u c h z ln z z m z 0 then the distribution of ssc can be obtained by integrating eq 9 from h to z i e 10 c c h e β 1 ξ 1 11 β 1 ρ s ρ ρ κ ω s f g s f h h 0 5 ρ s ρ ρ κ ω s f u 12 ξ 1 h z d z 1 z ln z z m z 0 where c h is the ssc at the vegetation height and symbol represents the relative height to h 2 3 2 submerged vegetation layer 0 z h for suspended sediment transport in the vegetation layer the energy balance mechanism is modified due to the energy loss caused by the vegetation drag force see eq 5 with which the new energy balance equations for fluid and sediment phase are proposed as 13 ρ g 1 c u s f u d dz 1 c τ ρ s ρ g 1 c c ω 1 2 ρ c d a u 3 1 c 14 ρ s g c u s f ρ s ρ u d dz c τ 1 2 ρ s c d a u 3 c the last terms of the right hand side of eq 13 and eq 14 are the vegetation drag force work on the fluid phase and sediment phase respectively these two terms reflect the energy loss induced by vegetation on a unit volume in sediment laden flow similarly combining eq 13 with eq 14 and integrating it with limits z to h yields 0 z h 15 g s f h z u v ρ s ρ ρ z h g ω c 1 c u d z 1 2 c d a z h u 2 d z the above equation can be simplified by ignoring the second term of the right hand side with the negligible c then eq 15 can be rewritten as 16 u v 1 2 c d a z h u 2 d z g s f h z according to the simplification of the velocity model in the submerged vegetation layer the longitudinal mean velocity is described as 0 z h 17 u u 1 u h u 1 e k u h z substituting eq 16 and eq 17 into eq 13 the differential equation of ssc in the vegetation layer can be similarly obtained as eq 9 the differential equation is expressed as 18 dc dz ρ s ρ ρ g ω c u 1 2 c d a z h u 2 d z g s f h z and the distribution of ssc could be also derived by integrating eq 18 from z to h as 19 c c h e β 2 ξ 2 20 β 2 ρ s ρ ρ g ω 21 ξ 2 z h 1 f z d z 22 f z u 1 η 1 e k u h z 1 2 c d a η 4 u 1 2 z η 2 e k u h z η 3 e 2 k u h z g s f h z where the parameters η 1 η 2 η 3 η 4 are constants which can be calculated from the velocity model in the vegetation layer i e 23 η 1 u h u 1 η 2 2 u 1 u h u 1 k u η 3 u h u 1 2 2 k u η 4 u 1 2 h 2 u 1 u h u 1 k u u h u 1 2 2 k u it is worth noting that f z as the denominator cannot be zero the value of f z is related to reynolds shear stress in the canopy layer which is determined by eq 16 on the river bed z 0 reynolds stress is zero however the vertical calculation range starts from z 0 05 h which is the reference level as mentioned above therefore f z will never take the value of zero in the calculation domain in summary a one dimensional ssc distribution model in a sediment laden flow with submerged vegetation is proposed based on the gravitational theory the basic formulations for the upper free water layer and vegetation layer are described by eq 10 and eq 19 respectively essentially different reynolds shear stress distributions produce different ssc distributions this indicates that the turbulent flow plays a key role in the transport and concentration distribution of suspended sediment the new ssc distribution model will be validated in section 3 4 3 validation and analysis 3 1 experimental data collected for validation to validate the simplified velocity model reynolds stress model and new ssc model different experimental data series are collected from the previous literature some of them are clear water experiments dunn et al 1996 huthoff and augustijn 2006 zhao et al 2019 and some are tests with low suspended sediment concentration in the flow lu 2008 to ensure flow fully developed along the vertical direction the relative water depth to vegetation height h h is greater than 2 in the collected experiments the vertical mean ssc in the collected experiments ranges from 1 67 to 4 92 furthermore the material of sediment particles used in these tests is plastic ρ s 1 082 g cm3 which is easier to suspend in the water flow the hydraulic conditions and characters of vegetation and sediment have been listed in table 3 mean relative error mre and pearson correlation coefficient cor are adopted to elucidate the quantitative error and the correlation between measured data and model results 24 mre i 1 n q i p i p i 100 n 25 cor pq p q n p 2 p 2 n q 2 q 2 n where p is measured data and q represents predicted values n is the number of data cor ranges from 1 to 1 and it means completely positive correlation between measured and predicted values with cor of 1 3 2 validation of the simplified velocity model in the derivation of new ssc distribution model the applicable velocity model eq 6 and eq 17 is the simplification of that proposed by nepf 2012 the vertical distribution of longitudinal mean velocity in the entire vegetation layer is considered to be exponential as described by eq 17 to validate the simplified model the comparisons of the model results with 12 experimental data sets are shown in fig 5 mre and cor are listed in table 4 it can be found that the longitudinal mean velocity in the wake zone is not actually uniform and the exponential profile can describe the velocity distribution trend according to table 4 mre varies from 2 06 case ⅴ to 7 55 c15 2 and cor ranges from 0 9885 c30 1 to 0 9990 case ⅴ the data indicates the simplified velocity has a moderate accuracy and there is a good correlation between measured and predicted values the deviations between model results and experimental data sets may be caused by the empirical parameters of the simplified velocity model such as z 0 and k u however on the whole the comparison results presented by fig 5 indicate that the simplified flow velocity model can basically predict the vertical distribution of velocity thus the simplified flow velocity model can be applied to develop the new ssc distribution model based on gravitational theory 3 3 validation of the reynolds stress model in the derivation of the ssc distribution in the vegetation layer a new formula eq 16 is proposed to model the reynolds stress as mentioned before the reynolds stress distribution is exponential in the canopy layer and the maximum value appears at the vegetation height the previous reynolds stress distribution model could be generalized as huai et al 2013 26 τ ρ u v ρ u v z h e α z h ρ g s f h h e α z h where α is a constant related to hydraulic conditions and vegetation properties huai et al 2013 proposed an empirical formula to estimate the constant i e 27 α c d a 0 03 h h fig 6 shows the comparisons of reynolds stress model results and experimental results in the vegetation layer results from the proposed formula eq 16 and previous formula eq 26 are presented above the vegetation height the distribution of reynolds shear stress is approximately linear and calculated by eq 8 it should be mentioned that largest deviations occur in the upper free water layer of case 8 which has also been reported by dimitris and panayotis 2011 but the reason could be further explored nevertheless the predicted reynolds stress profiles by eq 16 and eq 26 are basically consistent with the experimental data according to the values of mre and cor presented in table 5 it can be found that eq 16 presents a better accuracy and correlation in canopy layer than eq 26 besides eq 16 can simplify the present derivation of the new ssc model hence eq 16 is applied in this paper besides the distribution profiles of eddy viscosity υ t presented in fig 6 are analyzed it can be found that υ t increases first and then decreases with the increasing relative height the peak values of eddy viscosity appear approximately near 0 4 h h above the vegetation height the distribution profiles are discontinuous and unsmooth at the vegetation height that may be caused by the complexity of hydraulic conditions near the vegetation height or the discontinuity of the velocity gradient du dz 3 4 validation of the new ssc model the compared suspended sediment concentration data is collected in a series of experiments which were conducted in a flume with rigid submerged vegetation lu 2008 the water depth varies from 0 15 m to 0 30 m with two vegetation densities a 3 m 1 and a 6 m 1 the median diameter of light model sediment used in the experiments is 0 217 mm and the corresponding settling velocity is about 0 47 cm s in still water fig 7 shows the vertical distribution of the measured and predicted ssc the bottom edge of calculation domain is at the reference level 0 05h in order to distinguish the vegetation layer and the upper water layer the scaled concentration presented in fig 7 is normalized with the concentration at the vegetation height c h it can be found that all the distribution types are almost type iii in which the concentration increases from water surface to river bed with a gentle inverse s shaped distribution table 6 shows that mre ranges from 2 31 c15 1 to 10 58 c30 2 and cor varies from 0 9674 c24 1 to 0 9925 c15 2 the quantitative results elucidate that the new ssc model eq 10 and eq 19 results are basically in good agreement and correlation with the experimental data while there is relatively large deviation in the near bed region the reason behind the deviation could be attributed to the experiment error or the simplification of velocity profile which is not that appropriate close to the wall besides the left side and right side derivatives with respect to z h at the vegetation height are compared the values of the deviation between them range from 0 0033 to 0 0005 that means the left side derivative can be considered approximately equal to the right side derivative and the relative concentration at z h is 1 thus the ssc distribution is continuous and smooth at the vegetation height 3 5 sensitivity analysis of sediment diameter rouse 1937 defined the suspension number φ which could reflect the magnitude of gravity effect relative to turbulence intensity and the evenness of vertical distribution of ssc the suspension number is described as 28 φ ω κ u where ω is settling velocity m s and u is friction velocity m s κ is von kármán constant which is dimensionless if the suspended load effect on hydraulic conditions is ignored the influence of sediment diameter on the ssc distribution can be analyzed in a submerged vegetation flow with the same hydraulic condition so this paper adopt suspension number to perform sensitivity analysis of sediment diameter the hydraulic condition of c30 1 is selected with hypothetical sediment laden flow where the median diameter of light model sediment particles ρ s 1 082 g m 3 varies from 50 mm to 400 mm fig 8 shows the variation of the predicted ssc distribution with different diameters it can be found that the ssc distribution gradually becomes more and more uneven with the increasing suspension number this is mainly due to the gradual increase in the effect of gravity relative to turbulence with sediment diameters varying from 50 mm to 400 mm it is in consistent with the standpoint proposed by rouse 1937 therefore the new ssc model proposed in this paper could also reflect the influence of the relative magnitude of gravity and turbulence on the vertical distribution of suspended load in addition the type of vertical distribution of suspended sediment concentration progressively changes from type iii to type ii with the suspension number increasing from 0 152 to 0 203 it indicates that the magnitude of gravity effect relative to turbulence intensity to some extent could reflect the type of ssc distribution to be more specific type ii usually occurs with larger suspension number that means gravity effect is dominant on the contrary type iii generally occurs when turbulence intensity is stronger than gravity effect 4 discussion eq 9 and eq 18 could be transformed into a same equation 29 ε s dc dz ω c 0 where ε s is a coefficient that is described as 30 ε s u τ γ s γ γ s and γ are the unit weight of sediment and water respectively it is obvious that eq 29 resembles the same form as the sediment diffusion equation from the diffusion theory in two dimensional steady uniform flow which could be written as 31 ε s dc dz ω c 0 where ε s is the sediment diffusion coefficient which is hard to be determined directly the common method to determine ε s is adopting the turbulent schmidt number to establish an empirical equal relationship with the momentum exchange coefficient however compared to ε s in diffusion theory ε s in eq 29 is obtained from the derivation with an explicit equation therefore gravitational theory avoid the problem mentioned before this is an advantage of gravitational theory over diffusion theory furthermore about gravitational theory the biggest controversy is treating the fluid and sediment phase of a unit volume of silt content water separately while both occupy the entire space at the same time dey 2014 in response to this issue this paper discusses as follows first of all the energy conservation equations for fluid and sediment phase are combined while deriving the vertical distribution of u v which is important for suspended sediment transport it means that the solid and fluid phases are not completely considered separately it only occurs in the process of integrating the ssc distribution by using the energy conservation equation of fluid phase while u v has been determined besides both the derivations conducted by velikanov 1954 and this paper based on gravitational theory assume that the work is appropriate for small concentration of sediment laden water flow it means that the proportion of sediment in the whole volume is very small thus during the derivation the simplification that considering 1 c approximately equal to 1 can be taken so it is considered in this paper that treating fluid and sediment phase separately would not have a big impact although there may be a little deviation and the validation results has proved it actually this is similar to ignoring the effects of sediment movement on hydrodynamic conditions such as velocity and turbulence intensity which is the mechanism for suspended sediment transport in conclusion this paper considers that the gravitational theory can be applied to solve the ssc distribution problem 5 conclusion for better understanding of suspended sediment transport in submerged vegetation flow this paper analyzes the applicability of gravitational theory and then proposes a new ssc distribution model which divides the water depth into the free water layer and the vegetation layer to estimate the distribution of relative suspended sediment concentration ssc along the vertical direction meanwhile a new formula is also proposed to estimate reynolds shear stress distribution below the submerged vegetation height in the derivation of the new ssc model then the simplified two layer velocity model the new ssc model and the formula to estimate reynolds shear stress are validated with collected experimental data respectively the comparison results indicate that the flow model the new ssc model and the reynolds stress formula proposed in this paper all moderately agree with measured data series and there is a good correlation between the experimental and predicted profiles and the ssc distribution is continuous and smooth at the vegetation height besides the influence of varying sediment diameters on the ssc distribution is analyzed and it can be found that the distribution profile gradually becomes more and more uneven with sediment diameter increasing on top of that the transition from type iii to type ii is reckoned to have a relationship with the magnitude of gravity effect relative to turbulence intensity furthermore according to the validation results and discussion it is considered that the controversy about gravitational theory has a little effect on the water flow with low concentration of suspended load so that the theory can be adopted to study suspended sediment transport in vegetation flow the proposed model could be helpful to investigate suspended sediment transport in the flow through submerged vegetation such as shrubs and the modified governing equations eq 13 and eq 14 of gravitational theory could be applied to study suspended load transport capacity in channels covered with submerged vegetation for better understanding of riverbed erosion and deposition in vegetated rivers however in flows through emergent canopies the characteristics of hydraulic conditions and sediment movement are significantly different which need further investigation in the future besides vegetation density has a great influence on hydraulic conditions so that the effect of vegetation density on ssc distribution is also worth further studying credit authorship contribution statement da li formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft
