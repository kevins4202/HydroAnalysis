13945,membrane filtration is an attractive for laundry wastewater treatment especially when aiming for detergent and water reuse however its performance is largely restricted by membrane fouling especially when it is run under high and trans membrane pressure p and in the sidestream configuration the conventional treatment systems typically consist of multi processes for removal of pollutants including detergent to meet the water discharge or reuse specification this study assesses performance of a submerged membrane filtration under low p for treatment of real laundry wastewater obtained from local laundry shop aiming for detergent and water reuse results show that low p of as low as 0 05 bar offers the highest permeability of 297 15 3 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 without significant membrane fouling increasing the p leads to decreasing trend in the permeability especially in the early stages of filtration aeration was found to be effective in enhancing hydraulic performance by 60 at rates 1 lmin 1 below which offers ineffective foulant scouring impact the membrane effectively removes chemical oxygen demand total nitrogen total phosphorus and turbidity of 52 13 65 and 97 respectively and the system offers recovery of detergent from the spent laundry wastewater by 78 implementation of the concept in a laundry set up can be done by treating wastewater from the washing cycle and reusing back the permeate for the following cycle our overall results suggest that the system is suitable to be applied for detergent and water reuse from wash cycle of industrial laundry keywords membrane fouling aeration rate submerged membrane filtration laundry wastewater reuse detergent recovery 1 introduction the need to recycle wastewater becomes highly critical due to depleting water reserve coupled with high water consumption accompanying the rapid population growth urbanization and industrialization 1 water recycling or reuse is one of effective alternatives to counter problems such as water shortage while avoiding the treatment of wastewater before discharging into major water bodies as reported by hancock et al 2 the rising of water prices will eventually lead to a critical point where water recycling and reuse produced by the existing or developing technologies commercially viable hence many researchers focus on water recovery from various water sources and methods 3 5 reusing laundry wastewater is one of the promising ways of recycling wastewater to combat water shortage as well as for protecting environment due to the detrimental impact of surfactants surfactants consist of high toxicity components and contribute between 10 4 98 8 of the toxicity of the detergents 6 7 they also create a bacterial population rise transmitting through food chain to protozoa which are more sensitive to laundry wash toxins 7 8 generally industrial washing laundry needs almost 15 l of freshwater to process 1 kg of garments and discharges about 400 m3 daily 9 in case of residential building 60 140 l of freshwater is used per washing cycle 10 moreover discharging laundry wastewater with high content of detergent is not a favourable practice because detergents impose negative impacts to the environment this is due to their accumulation in organisms causing eutrophication of aquatic environments 11 12 and some are resilient to biodegradation 13 in some cases the presence of high detergent content in river destroys fish mucus membrane and gills to some degree the damaged mucus membranes leave the fishes sensitive to bacteria and parasites water body with 15 ppm of detergent is toxic to fish and at 5 ppm fish eggs would be killed 14 many researchers show their interest in recovering water and detergent from laundry wastewater 15 19 as summarized in table 1 with the advancement in membrane science and technology the application of membrane filtration is deemed to be highly attractive due to its low energy usage smaller foot print and less usage of chemicals 20 however due to process objective of completely removing excess detergent membrane filtration has been integrated with other processes i e coagulation as pre treatment to boost up the treatment performance ciabatti et al 9 demonstrated a system for purification and water reuse of industrial laundry wastewater by integrating crossflow ultrafiltration uf with physico chemical pre treatment sand filtration ozonation and granular activated carbon filtration the results show the chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solid tss and turbidity removal efficiencies of 87 98 and 99 respectively it suggests that the post treatment using uf helps to further eliminate the residual pollutant including the excess detergent and allows reuse of the treated water effluent in some washing processes of home textiles in this process the main objective was to recover the water since the employed process units was used also remove the excess detergent on top of other pollutants in another report linclau et al 21 employed nanofiltration combined with membrane bioreactor mbr in treating and recycling wastewater from a detergent production site they utilized tubular membranes and resulted permeate quality with cod of 50 mg l and anionic surfactant concentration of 0 5 mg l which was sufficient to produce water quality for feeding a cooling tower unit in other studies shang et al 22 used coagulation as pre treatment and obtained high steady state permeability of 160 450 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 while seo et al 23 applied ozone and achieved permeability of 25 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 apart from hybridization with other processes membrane has also been used as standalone unit sumisha et al 8 employed a standalone cross flow ultrafiltration system and developed polyethersulfone based uf membranes to treat laundry wastewater the results show that a permeability of 11 04 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 was obtained when the system was operated at trans membrane pressure p of 5 bar meanwhile a study by choobar et al 24 using cross flow microfiltration system with ps of 0 5 1 5 bars reveals that increasing the feed pressure enhanced the cake formation on the membrane surface and contribute to membrane fouling findings from previous reports suggest that combination of more than one processes are proven to be efficient in achieving better water discharge and water reuse specifications however operating multiple units requires high operating cost and large footprint with the focus was mostly on treating the wastewater in order to meet the discharge standards or for water reuse purpose 28 30 when the stand alone membrane was applied the filtration suffers from membrane fouling which deteriorates the permeability according to crittenden et al 31 typical operation pressures are around 0 1 1 0 bar with flux values between 50 to 100 lm 2 h 1 application of high p in a cross flow system promotes membrane fouling as revealed in previous studies 8 24 and thus can lead to the high pumping energy therefore a new approach of using a lowpressure system 0 1 bar with the objective for not only reusing the water but also reusing any excess detergent is worthy for investigation it means that additional process is not required for reusing of detergent purposes the mechanism of operating at low pressure 0 1 bar for the submerged membrane system resembles the concept of gravity driven membrane with the common operating pressures of 0 04 0 1 bar 32 the low pressure system could be operated under sustainable flux hence prolonged its operation time and lest frequent chemical cleaning 33 the low pressure system under constant p operation can assist membrane fouling mitigation because it offers a low local flux which minimize the drag force that normally carry the foulant to the membrane surface based on literatures it was found that study on the application of membrane filtration in a standalone process aiming for both reusing water and excess detergent is scarce this study assesses a low pressure submerged membrane filtration for treating a laundry wastewater aimed for water and detergent reuse instead of employing external membrane filtration this study utilizes submerged filtration system since this configuration offers more simplicity smaller footprint and lower energy demand the permeation rejection as well as detergent recovery performances of the system were evaluated some parametric studies such as the effect of p and rate of aeration had been performed and discussed this study also investigates the possibility of recovering detergent as a second grade cleaning agent which is still found limited in the literature finally a conceptual process design for implementation of the system in industrial laundry is also discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 membrane fabrication and characterization the membrane used in this study was fabricated from a solution of 15 wt of polysufone psf sigma aldrich usa 1 wt of polyethylene glycol peg sigma aldrich usa and dimethylacetamide dmac sigma aldrich usa the dope solution was casted wet thickness of 210 μm on a non woven support novatexx 24413 fredenberg filter germany to provide mechanical support to the thin film 34 35 after casting the membrane was immediately immersed in water bath for overnight and stored wet prior used at room temperature the fabrication conditions and properties of the resulting membrane have been detailed elsewhere 36 the synthesized membrane was characterized and the pore size porosity contact angle thickness and clean water permeability of the membrane were 0 01 μm 51 2 2 6 67 0 1 0 361 5 6 μm and 923 54 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 respectively the pore size porosity contact angle and thickness of the membranes were measured using capillary flow porometer porolux 1000 ib ft germany dry wet method a gioniometer oca 20 data physics filderstadt germany and a digital micrometer mitutoyo 293 340 30 japan respectively 2 2 laundry wastewater and detergent recovery test real laundry wastewater used as the feed for the filtration test was collected from local laundry shop three samples were collected and analysed to identify the detergent recovery rates namely 1 the mixture of the detergent and water before washing 2 the solution after washing stage that later used as the filtration feed and 3 filtration permeate for the first sampling point before washing the detergent concentration is set at 8 g l 1 as suggested in the dosage instructions stated in the detergent packaging the cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were analysed using hach lange test kits colorado usa while the turbidity was analysed using a turbidity meter hach 2100q colorado usa since the surfactants exist in water as colloidal suspension uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 kyoto japan was used to determine the detergent content 37 39 absorbance values of all sample solutions were measured at wavelength of 201 5 nm x with correlation equation as shown in eq 1 1 d e t e r g e n t c o n c e n t r a t i o n g l 0 1649 x 0 1205 r 2 0 9935 2 3 submerged filtration set up the filtration performance was evaluated using a submerged constant pressure filtration set up as illustrated in fig 1 a vacuum pump was used to generate the vacuum condition in the permeate collecting system and the p was controlled by adjusting the pressure control valve connected to the pipeline the permeate collecting system was linked to the submerged membrane panel the system was equipped with an aeration as fouling mitigation control placed beneath the membrane panel the permeate was collected and measured in semi batch wise for every 10 min of filtration cycle after measurement the permeate was returned to the feed tank to maintain the liquid level and about constant feed condition the effect of p and aeration rate on the permeability performance were studied the p was varied at 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 bar while maintaining the aeration rate at 1 lmin 1 the effect of aeration rate was determined by varying the aeration rate from 0 to 1 5 lmin 1 with fixed pressure of 0 1 bar the performance of the filtration was evaluated using permeability l and rejection r parameter are defined in eqs 2 and 3 2 l δ v t a δ p 3 r c f c p c f 100 where δ v indicates the difference of permeate volume l t is the duration of filtration h a is the effective filtration area m2 δ p is trans membrane pressure bar c f concentration in the feed g l and c p concentration in the feed g l 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of operating parameters 3 1 1 effect of transmembrane pressure fig 2 shows the filterability performance over time and the steady state permeability at different ps 0 05 0 1 and 0 15 bar under a fixed aeration rate of 1 lmin 1 which is sufficient for fouling control in submerged filtration system 40 it shows that there is an immediate decline in permeability in the beginning of the experiment and at some point it starts to stabilize and reach plateau value this trend was obtained since the ps generate higher initial fluxes and the water flow drags solute foulant toward the membrane pores that form foulant layer this is supported through the work reported by mikulasek et al 41 and they had justified that the fluxes reached steady or nearly steady state values due to the cake growth caused by shear exerted at its surface balakrishnan et al 42 also reported the same trend and explained that the significant drop in permeability was due to the deposition of small particles and colloids on the membrane surface hence causing membrane fouling the steady state permeate indicates the formation of established fouling layer miller et al 43 suggested that the severe fouling seen at the beginning of constant pressure filtration occurs due to the elevated initial flux of a clean membrane this can be reduced by imposing a constant and a much lower flux which limits initial rapid build up of fouling layer 44 fouling increases with time as the compressibility of the cake and the thickening of the cake layer on the membrane increases over time due to hydraulic resistance the permeability fluctuations are observed at the p of 0 05 bar which is believed due to external pressure variations as a result of feed level fluctuation since p is low the hydrostatic pressure in the tank also imposes detectable impact to the filtration of the membrane 32 33 the feed level fluctuation caused by the supplied aeration also contributed to the unstable permeability measurement fig 2b shows the steady state permeability obtained by the membrane filtration at different applied ps the results show that p of 0 05 bar demonstrates the highest value of 297 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 the obtained permeabilities in this study are much higher than the ones reported in literature see data in table 1 this suggests that at lower p the system has less fouling and most likely less compressed fouling layer the data also show that increasing p from 0 05 to 0 15 bar reduces the permeability which can be ascribed by higher p that cause more fouling layer compaction the permeability data in fig 2 indicated that the p does not affect the filtration flux the finding suggests the possibility to operate the detergent wastewater filtration under very low p driven only by hydrostatic pressure that is beneficial not only for enhancing permeability but also lowering the energy consumption for permeate pumping that normally corresponds to the applied pressure fig 3 illustrates the membrane fouling mechanism of two constant pressure filtration system under low and high ps the illustration can help to explain the results in fig 2 in term of mechanisms of membrane fouling at the beginning of the operation high p drives the transport of water instantly flows through membrane pores leading to very high initial flux at t 0 923 54 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 the flow of water exhibits the drag force that carries the foulant material to the pore mouth which later interacts with the membrane surface and rapidly foul the membrane the impact of the drag force to carry the foulant toward the membrane is much stronger than the back diffusion of the foulant away from the membrane leading to foulant accumulation nearby the membrane surface conversely low p leads to low initial flux at t 0 and thus low force to drag the foulant toward the pore mouth a low drag force toward the membrane surface is balanced by the back diffusion resulting in low rate of foulant accumulation 3 1 2 effect of aeration rate aeration rate improves the permeability performance and the impact is only significant at rates 1 lmin 1 fig 4 a and b the results show that the highest applied aeration rate 1 5 lmin 1 contributes to the highest steady state permeability of 247 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 suggesting that it possess the greatest fouling removal impact prior studies conducted by eliseus et al 45 also reported similar trend of increasing permeability as higher aeration rates this is because the air bubbles generated from the aerator scour off the foulant better at higher aeration rates which corresponding to higher number and larger size of the bubbles which enhances the foulant scouring impact the buoyancy force lifts the bubbles released from the bubble generator to move upwards and contact with the membrane surface thus helps to mitigate foulant deposition and prolong the effective filtration cycle at lower aeration rates 0 0 5 and 1 0 lmin 1 the plateau permeability reaches a value of about 150 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 this indicates that the cake layer formation is about similar despite having different aeration rate which means that these rates are too low to induce significant fouling mitigation under this condition the foulants blocked the membrane pores and reduce its filterability performance this finding is unique and mostly due to the resultant of membrane feed properties interaction normally different feeds have different filtration behaviour depending on the feed properties such as viscosity and velocity gradient between moving fluid and static membrane surface 46 it is also reported that the efficiency of aeration for foulant removal was not proportional with the aeration rate but had an optimum value 47 50 therefore it is suggested that a rate of 1 5 lmin 1 as the best aeration rate for the system considering its effectiveness in membrane fouling control which enable efficent two phase flow fouling control 51 such aeration level is within the range of the one applied in full scale membrane bioreactor 52 and can still be lowered when applying a custom made membrane i e the one with surface pattern 53 3 2 rejection performance and detergent recovery rate based on feed sample analysis to determine its properties the cod tn tp and turbidity values were 201 mg l 16 3 mg l 1 8 mg l and 53 1 ntu respectively fig 5 shows the rejection of cod tn tp and turbidity by the membrane it is observed that the applied uf membrane could remove the substance present in the feed wastewater effectively the removal of cod is 52 0 17 2 generally cod measures the organic matters and other reducing substances 8 the applied feed had a high cod content 201 mg l might be due to the presence of anionic surfactants builders and other oil substances as reported by šostar turk et al 27 it is postulated that the detergent was not all used up during the washing cycle leading to uneconomical wastage the residual cod in the permeate can be considered as the excess detergent unused for the washing purpose therefore the reuse of permeate water from this filtration implicates the reuse of the excess detergent disregard the presence of micelles despite the inadequacy of micelle for cleaning purpose this study assumes that both free surfactants and micelle are worthy of recovering since the removal of micelle from the permeate solution requires another decent techniques 20 54 55 however further study with clear distinction between micelles and free surfactants and detailed analysis of the substances is required before permeate recycling and will be conducted as the follow up study the low percentage removal of tn 12 9 3 4 and the higher percentage removal of the tp of approximately 65 3 11 3 compared to tn because of phosphorus bonded to the organic molecules has relatively larger molecule size makes it easier to be removed indeed uf shall not retained small molecules of either nitrogen based or phosphorous based molecules instead nitrogen based is typically and free form while the phosphorous based can be in bound form as such the former shows lower rejection the turbidity is reduced from 53 1 to 1 11 ntu corresponding to 97 9 1 6 rejection indicates the effective removal of dirt and suspended solid from the feed which also enhances the permeate quality potential of water and detergent reuse the results on detergent recovery analysis suggest that only minimum recovery rate was obtained most of the detergent 89 75 was used for washing purpose leaving excess detergent of 10 25 to be recovered out of the excess detergent 0 82 g l 1 77 96 could be recovered in the permeate corresponding to 8 of overall recovery total of detergent loaded prior washing cycle 8 g l 1 the high detergent recovery can be ascribed by the formation of dynamic membranes on top of the actual membrane that added more resistance and constrict the pore size and enhance the rejection at this point it is hard to speculate on the detailed retention mechanism we base our discussion on bound and free detergent the bound or consumed detergent is attached to a substrate that is large enough to be fully retained by the membrane pores while the free detergent can pass through the membrane pore which allows it to be recovered it is worth noting that the ability to recover the excess detergent offer substantial benefit in processing the used laundry wastewater unlike most of the earlier studies in table 1 that set the process objective to eliminate the excess from the treated water which requires application of multiple units the proposed approached aims to maintain the excess detergent which turn the treatment process become simple standalone ultrafiltration unit 3 3 practical implementation fig 6 illustrates a block flow diagram for implementation of membrane filtration integrated into the current industrial washing system the proposed filtration process should comply with the existing washing cycle a typical wash cycle consists of several stages of cycle is detailed as follows 1 the washing step is done by filling water and the cleaning agents to the washing chamber followed by agitation of the garment load for a certain period followed by draining of the used water 2 rinsing step is done by filling the freshwater to the washing chamber followed by agitating to remove residual detergent and 3 spinning step comprises of spinning the garment rapidly for a certain period to remove most of the remaining water via centrifugal force the proposed filtration system operates by reusing the wastewater generated during the washing cycle implementing the idea of partial reuse of laundry wastewater for washing of garments involves make up detergent and fresh water the wastewater generated during the washing of garments during the wash cycle containing high amounts of residual detergent is filtered by the membrane system and the permeate is then stored in the reuse water storage as illustrated in fig 6 employing this system is estimated to save half of water the one used in the washing cycle and most of the residual excess detergent on top of water and detergent recovery there is potential environmental advantages of implementing water and excess detergent reuse in the laundry recovery systems it reduces the total water volume and detergents as well as the quantity of wastewater treating used water from the washing cycle would require multiple processes as summarized in table 1 according to giagnorio et al 56 employing ultrafiltration would achieved 40 recovery of reusable surfactants through the recycling of laundry wastewater besides the collected surfactants can be recycled into an array of other applications such as lower grade surfactants for road cleaning and car wash as suggested by linclau et al 21 they also reported that if the recycled stream contains half the detergent concentration of the pure product the stream could be used as wash water as a lower grade industrial detergent it should be noted that this study was performed by assuming the typical condition of laundry wastewater with temperature ranged from 25 to 40 c 57 58 discharged from cold or warm washing options thus the proposed implementation might be less convenient for laundry wastewater with temperatures of 80 c since it might deteriorate the lifespan of the polymeric membrane implementation of such system under low pressure i e 0 05 bar means that the filtration can be run using under gravity driven mechanism which helps to save energy footprint the energy consumption factor then can be restricted to the aeration only nevertheless it would be desirable to investigate the filtration system without aeration in expense of lowering the filtration flux see fig 3 which corresponds to higher investment cost for the membrane the most optimum condition for system implementation with respect to trade off between capital and operational expenditures should be evaluated in the future studies 4 conclusion this study assesses the performance of low pressure submerged membrane filtration system in treating laundry wastewater under certain parametric studies including p and rate of aeration increasing p from 0 05 to 0 15 bar reduces the permeability for about 62 at lower aeration rate 0 1 0 lmin 1 the impact of aeration rate towards membrane fouling control is less significant this could be due to ineffective contact of air bubbles to scour off the foulant the permeability improved significantly when the aeration rate reaches 1 5 lmin 1 the proposed concept can be implemented for treatment of used water in the washing cycles with the potential of reusing wastewater and the excess detergent further research on detailed analyses of detergent and optimum design to minimize capital and operational expenditure are therefore

fouling the steady state permeate indicates the formation of established fouling layer miller et al 43 suggested that the severe fouling seen at the beginning of constant pressure filtration occurs due to the elevated initial flux of a clean membrane this can be reduced by imposing a constant and a much lower flux which limits initial rapid build up of fouling layer 44 fouling increases with time as the compressibility of the cake and the thickening of the cake layer on the membrane increases over time due to hydraulic resistance the permeability fluctuations are observed at the p of 0 05 bar which is believed due to external pressure variations as a result of feed level fluctuation since p is low the hydrostatic pressure in the tank also imposes detectable impact to the filtration of the membrane 32 33 the feed level fluctuation caused by the supplied aeration also contributed to the unstable permeability measurement fig 2b shows the steady state permeability obtained by the membrane filtration at different applied ps the results show that p of 0 05 bar demonstrates the highest value of 297 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 the obtained permeabilities in this study are much higher than the ones reported in literature see data in table 1 this suggests that at lower p the system has less fouling and most likely less compressed fouling layer the data also show that increasing p from 0 05 to 0 15 bar reduces the permeability which can be ascribed by higher p that cause more fouling layer compaction the permeability data in fig 2 indicated that the p does not affect the filtration flux the finding suggests the possibility to operate the detergent wastewater filtration under very low p driven only by hydrostatic pressure that is beneficial not only for enhancing permeability but also lowering the energy consumption for permeate pumping that normally corresponds to the applied pressure fig 3 illustrates the membrane fouling mechanism of two constant pressure filtration system under low and high ps the illustration can help to explain the results in fig 2 in term of mechanisms of membrane fouling at the beginning of the operation high p drives the transport of water instantly flows through membrane pores leading to very high initial flux at t 0 923 54 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 the flow of water exhibits the drag force that carries the foulant material to the pore mouth which later interacts with the membrane surface and rapidly foul the membrane the impact of the drag force to carry the foulant toward the membrane is much stronger than the back diffusion of the foulant away from the membrane leading to foulant accumulation nearby the membrane surface conversely low p leads to low initial flux at t 0 and thus low force to drag the foulant toward the pore mouth a low drag force toward the membrane surface is balanced by the back diffusion resulting in low rate of foulant accumulation 3 1 2 effect of aeration rate aeration rate improves the permeability performance and the impact is only significant at rates 1 lmin 1 fig 4 a and b the results show that the highest applied aeration rate 1 5 lmin 1 contributes to the highest steady state permeability of 247 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 suggesting that it possess the greatest fouling removal impact prior studies conducted by eliseus et al 45 also reported similar trend of increasing permeability as higher aeration rates this is because the air bubbles generated from the aerator scour off the foulant better at higher aeration rates which corresponding to higher number and larger size of the bubbles which enhances the foulant scouring impact the buoyancy force lifts the bubbles released from the bubble generator to move upwards and contact with the membrane surface thus helps to mitigate foulant deposition and prolong the effective filtration cycle at lower aeration rates 0 0 5 and 1 0 lmin 1 the plateau permeability reaches a value of about 150 lm 2 h 1 bar 1 this indicates that the cake layer formation is about similar despite having different aeration rate which means that these rates are too low to induce significant fouling mitigation under this condition the foulants blocked the membrane pores and reduce its filterability performance this finding is unique and mostly due to the resultant of membrane feed properties interaction normally different feeds have different filtration behaviour depending on the feed properties such as viscosity and velocity gradient between moving fluid and static membrane surface 46 it is also reported that the efficiency of aeration for foulant removal was not proportional with the aeration rate but had an optimum value 47 50 therefore it is suggested that a rate of 1 5 lmin 1 as the best aeration rate for the system considering its effectiveness in membrane fouling control which enable efficent two phase flow fouling control 51 such aeration level is within the range of the one applied in full scale membrane bioreactor 52 and can still be lowered when applying a custom made membrane i e the one with surface pattern 53 3 2 rejection performance and detergent recovery rate based on feed sample analysis to determine its properties the cod tn tp and turbidity values were 201 mg l 16 3 mg l 1 8 mg l and 53 1 ntu respectively fig 5 shows the rejection of cod tn tp and turbidity by the membrane it is observed that the applied uf membrane could remove the substance present in the feed wastewater effectively the removal of cod is 52 0 17 2 generally cod measures the organic matters and other reducing substances 8 the applied feed had a high cod content 201 mg l might be due to the presence of anionic surfactants builders and other oil substances as reported by šostar turk et al 27 it is postulated that the detergent was not all used up during the washing cycle leading to uneconomical wastage the residual cod in the permeate can be considered as the excess detergent unused for the washing purpose therefore the reuse of permeate water from this filtration implicates the reuse of the excess detergent disregard the presence of micelles despite the inadequacy of micelle for cleaning purpose this study assumes that both free surfactants and micelle are worthy of recovering since the removal of micelle from the permeate solution requires another decent techniques 20 54 55 however further study with clear distinction between micelles and free surfactants and detailed analysis of the substances is required before permeate recycling and will be conducted as the follow up study the low percentage removal of tn 12 9 3 4 and the higher percentage removal of the tp of approximately 65 3 11 3 compared to tn because of phosphorus bonded to the organic molecules has relatively larger molecule size makes it easier to be removed indeed uf shall not retained small molecules of either nitrogen based or phosphorous based molecules instead nitrogen based is typically and free form while the phosphorous based can be in bound form as such the former shows lower rejection the turbidity is reduced from 53 1 to 1 11 ntu corresponding to 97 9 1 6 rejection indicates the effective removal of dirt and suspended solid from the feed which also enhances the permeate quality potential of water and detergent reuse the results on detergent recovery analysis suggest that only minimum recovery rate was obtained most of the detergent 89 75 was used for washing purpose leaving excess detergent of 10 25 to be recovered out of the excess detergent 0 82 g l 1 77 96 could be recovered in the permeate corresponding to 8 of overall recovery total of detergent loaded prior washing cycle 8 g l 1 the high detergent recovery can be ascribed by the formation of dynamic membranes on top of the actual membrane that added more resistance and constrict the pore size and enhance the rejection at this point it is hard to speculate on the detailed retention mechanism we base our discussion on bound and free detergent the bound or consumed detergent is attached to a substrate that is large enough to be fully retained by the membrane pores while the free detergent can pass through the membrane pore which allows it to be recovered it is worth noting that the ability to recover the excess detergent offer substantial benefit in processing the used laundry wastewater unlike most of the earlier studies in table 1 that set the process objective to eliminate the excess from the treated water which requires application of multiple units the proposed approached aims to maintain the excess detergent which turn the treatment process become simple standalone ultrafiltration unit 3 3 practical implementation fig 6 illustrates a block flow diagram for implementation of membrane filtration integrated into the current industrial washing system the proposed filtration process should comply with the existing washing cycle a typical wash cycle consists of several stages of cycle is detailed as follows 1 the washing step is done by filling water and the cleaning agents to the washing chamber followed by agitation of the garment load for a certain period followed by draining of the used water 2 rinsing step is done by filling the freshwater to the washing chamber followed by agitating to remove residual detergent and 3 spinning step comprises of spinning the garment rapidly for a certain period to remove most of the remaining water via centrifugal force the proposed filtration system operates by reusing the wastewater generated during the washing cycle implementing the idea of partial reuse of laundry wastewater for washing of garments involves make up detergent and fresh water the wastewater generated during the washing of garments during the wash cycle containing high amounts of residual detergent is filtered by the membrane system and the permeate is then stored in the reuse water storage as illustrated in fig 6 employing this system is estimated to save half of water the one used in the washing cycle and most of the residual excess detergent on top of water and detergent recovery there is potential environmental advantages of implementing water and excess detergent reuse in the laundry recovery systems it reduces the total water volume and detergents as well as the quantity of wastewater treating used water from the washing cycle would require multiple processes as summarized in table 1 according to giagnorio et al 56 employing ultrafiltration would achieved 40 recovery of reusable surfactants through the recycling of laundry wastewater besides the collected surfactants can be recycled into an array of other applications such as lower grade surfactants for road cleaning and car wash as suggested by linclau et al 21 they also reported that if the recycled stream contains half the detergent concentration of the pure product the stream could be used as wash water as a lower grade industrial detergent it should be noted that this study was performed by assuming the typical condition of laundry wastewater with temperature ranged from 25 to 40 c 57 58 discharged from cold or warm washing options thus the proposed implementation might be less convenient for laundry wastewater with temperatures of 80 c since it might deteriorate the lifespan of the polymeric membrane implementation of such system under low pressure i e 0 05 bar means that the filtration can be run using under gravity driven mechanism which helps to save energy footprint the energy consumption factor then can be restricted to the aeration only nevertheless it would be desirable to investigate the filtration system without aeration in expense of lowering the filtration flux see fig 3 which corresponds to higher investment cost for the membrane the most optimum condition for system implementation with respect to trade off between capital and operational expenditures should be evaluated in the future studies 4 conclusion this study assesses the performance of low pressure submerged membrane filtration system in treating laundry wastewater under certain parametric studies including p and rate of aeration increasing p from 0 05 to 0 15 bar reduces the permeability for about 62 at lower aeration rate 0 1 0 lmin 1 the impact of aeration rate towards membrane fouling control is less significant this could be due to ineffective contact of air bubbles to scour off the foulant the permeability improved significantly when the aeration rate reaches 1 5 lmin 1 the proposed concept can be implemented for treatment of used water in the washing cycles with the potential of reusing wastewater and the excess detergent further research on detailed analyses of detergent and optimum design to minimize capital and operational expenditure are therefore

biodegradability of gymw was enhanced by ppor with five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 chemical oxygen demand cod increasing from 0 08 to 0 34 and effluent color declining from 525 to 8 after

revealed that compared with seed sludge s0 bacterial genera benefited from degrading refractory substances such as dokdonella 8 88 defluviimonas 5 71 thauera 4 4 and rhodobacter 3 95 and they became enriched in active sludge s1 from the sbbr keywords photocatalytic pre oxidation reactor gardenia yellow manufacturing wastewater sequencing batch bioreactor k2s2o8 doped tio2 biodegradability 1 introduction a significant level of interest has arisen regarding natural yellow colorants in wastewater due to warnings related to the synthetic origin of some yellow food coloring 1 gardenia yellow a water soluble natural pigment extracted from gardenia fruit is widely used in medicine and food production such as antiphlogistic analgesic noodles and confectioneries 2 3 gardenia yellow mainly consists of crocin chlorogenic acid and iridoid glycosides geniposide genipin and it has been reported that after conversion to aglycon genipin geniposide has hepatotoxicity and it is easily decomposed to genipin in the human body 4 6 furthermore due to an extreme complex pollutant composition and refractory substances gymw is difficult to degrade using activated sludge methods previous studies have indicated that cod removal efficiency improved when gymw was treated by anaerobic aerobic a o processes however effluent cod do still not meet emission standards 7 there is therefore an urgent need to identify new methods to achieve advanced treatment combining chemical pre oxidation techniques with biological post treatment can result in readily biodegradable intermediates being biologically treated thus having positive effects in treating complex industrial wastewater 8 some studies suggested that biotransformation is slow for dyes wastewater and their color and toxicity affect the quality of water and the efficiency of some water treatment techniques 9 it has also been reported that biorefractory organic compounds can be degraded using photocatalytic oxidation therefore photocatalysis process has been proposed as a useful pre treatment before activated sludge treatment given that the wide band gap of tio2 3 2 ev limits the use of the solar energy 10 many methods have been used to modify tio2 to make its absorption red shift umebayashi et al 11 prepared s doped tio2 in which s atoms replaced o atoms and the photocatalysts showed a significant red shift of the absorption edge ohno et al 12 synthesized s doped tio2 by sol gel method the photocatalysts had high photoactivity for mb degradation in the visible region niu et al 13 prepared s doped tio2 photocatalysts using k2s2o8 as sulfur source showed high photoactivity intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb was used to biodegrade and mineralize a range of biorefractory pollutants such as dinitrotoluene trichlorophenol and dyes 14 therefore tio2 doped with potassium persulfate k2s2o8 was applied to oxidize the refractory compounds of gymw during the photocatalytic reaction stage as the anaerobic reactor was not suitable to treat wastewater with low levels of cod sbbr was applied as a post biological treatment to ensure cod levels of gymw meet emission standards in this study we prepared a k2s2o8 doped tio2 photocatalyst and used xrd xps drs and sem to characterize it a ppor sbbr system was then build up to degrade gymw the change of pollutant composition was analyzed using the excitation emission matrix eem spectra in addition the microbial community structure in sbbr was investigated using high throughput sequencing 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater

table 1 seeded sludge of sbbr used in this study was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of the wulongkou municipal wastewater treatment plant 113 61 e 34 78 n 2 2 photocatalyst synthesis k2s2o8 doped tio2 applied as a photocatalyst to treat wastewater was synthesized using the sol gel method 15 10 ml of titanium butoxide and 40 ml of absolute ethanol were combined in a beaker and stirred at 400 rpm 10 ml of deionized water was then added to the solution followed by the addition of 0 2 ml of k2s2o8 0 2 mol l dropwise after the solution was left to rest for 24 h the supernatant liquid was decanted and the precipitate was oven dried at 103 c dhg 9240a shanghai yiheng tech instrument co ltd the sample was then calcined in air in a furnace a 550 ndi vulcan at a constant temperature of 300 c for 3 h 2 3 photocatalytic pre oxidation a laboratory scale ppor system with sbbr post treatment was built up to treat gymw fig 1 the working volume of ppor and sbbr were 3 l and 4 l respectively in order to enhance biodegradability gymw was pre treated by photocatalysis in the ppor system the content of the k2s2o8 doped tio2 photocatalyst was 2 g l 16 the light resource was long arc xenon lamp gxz300 80 w situated 5 cm above the reactor having an irradiation wavelength between 290 800 nm and a light intensity of 18 5 mw cm 2 a 420 nm cutoff filter was used for visible light irradiation and a high pressure mercury lamp guv200 55 w for uv light before irradiation gymw pumped into the reactor was treated in the dark for 30 min to attain desorption absorption equilibrium after the photocatalytic reaction was carried out for 180 min turned off the aeration pump and stand still for 2 h to allow the catalyst to settle to the bottom of the cone of ppor ppor effluent was passed to the sbbr to continue biodegradation as shown in fig 1 the outlet of ppor is above the cone to ensure that the catalyst does not flow into sbbr 2 4 sbbr post treatment during sbbr operation the volume of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was 1500 200 mg l in the sbbr the operation period included introducing wastewater aerobic reaction 4 h sedimentation 2 h and drainage volume exchange ratio is half operation of the system was undertaken for 100 days during the biological reaction ph was maintained at 7 5 0 5 with the addition of hcl 0 1 m dissolved oxygen do concentration was 3 0 0 5 mg l 2 5 analytical methods effluent samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 4 min tg16 ws china and cod bod5 and mlss were measured using the potassium dichromate standard method international standard and the gravimetric method respectively total organic carbon toc concentration was determined using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu ph and do were measured using a digital ph mv meter phb 4 leici and a do analyzer hq40d hach respectively chemical characteristics of the soluble organics from gymw were analyzed by eem rf 6000 shimadzu in addition crystalline structures were examined using xrd d8 advance bruker with a scanning range of 15 to 75 the chemical states of the photocatalyst were obtained using xps 250xi escalab the uv vis absorbance spectra were obtained by a scan uv vis spectrophotometer uv 365 shimadzu using baso4 as the reflectance sample surface morphology of the photocatalyst were observed using sem geminisem 450 zeiss 2 6 high throughput sequencing and analysis two sludge samples seed sludge s0 and sludge on the 100th day s1 from the sbbr were collected to investigate the bacterial community structure dna from the two samples were amplified by pcr using primer sets 314 f 5 ccctacacgacgctcttccgatctg 3 and 805r 5 gactggagttccttggcacccgagaattcca 3 for the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes in miseq sequencing platform following the methods of wan et al 17 low quality sequences and chimeras were deleted by mothur and uchime similar sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using a 97 identity threshold the ribosomal database project rdp was used in taxonomic classification the sequences generated in this study are available on the ncbi sequence read archive with accession number prjna607897 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the crystal phases of the photocatalysts were exhibited using xrd fig 2 diffraction peaks at 2θ 24 49 38 19 48 19 54 85 55 21 62 1 and 73 32 were indexed to the 101 004 200 105 211 and 204 lattice planes of anatase phase tio2 jcpds card 21 1272 respectively 18 19 however diffraction peaks of k2s2o8 were not found in the xrd pattern of the doped sample possibly being attributed to the low amount and relatively lower diffraction intensity of k2s2o8 in addition the as synthesized k2s2o8 doped tio2 photocatalyst was found to have high purity as no impurity related peaks were recorded 20 results from the xps spectra of k2s2o8 doped tio2 and pure tio2 fig 3 recorded elements such as titanium oxygen potassium sulfur and carbon ti 2p1 2 and ti 2p3 2 peaks were located at 464 1 ev and 458 7 ev respectively splitting of 5 4 ev indicated that ti4 existed in k2s2o8 doped tio2 and pure tio2 samples 21 the peak of o 1s observed between 529 9 530 1 ev suggested that o element was o2 22 in addition the peak of s 2p was only found in the k2s2o8 doped tio2 sample drs of k2s2o8 doped tio2 and pure tio2 were shown in fig 4 the band gap of k2s2o8 doped tio2 nanoparticles decreased with k2s2o8 doping fig 4b a shift of the absorption edge toward the visible light regions of the solar spectrum is observed in fig 4a sem analysis of sample surface morphology fig 5 indicated that k2s2o8 doped tio2 and pure tio2 samples were composed of regular sphere particles with k2s2o8 doped tio2 having a smaller particle size a smaller particle size corresponded to a larger specific surface area this being conducive to improving the catalytic activity of the photocatalysts it was previously reported that doping of nonmetals and or metals to tio2 inhibited the growth of tio2 particles 23 24 in addition so4 2 ions anchored on the surface of tio2 have strong affinity for electrons capturing the photo induced electrons e which hinders the recombination of electrons e and holes h all these led up to enhanced photoactivity and ultimately promoted degradation efficiency in real world scenarios 3 2 gymw photocatalytic pre oxidation in order to verify the photocatalytic performance of the k2s2o8 doped tio2 photocatalyst pure tio2 and k2s2o8 doped tio2 were applied to degrade gymw under visible light and uv light respectively as shown in fig 6 b the two catalysts had similar efficiency under uv light with visible light irradiation by contrast the doped photocatalyst performed much better throughout the 180 min reaction process fig 6a photocatalysis under visible light irradiation pre oxidation of gymw to enhance its biodegradability fig 6c bod5 cod of ppor influent was 0 08 suggesting that the wastewater had a low propensity to be biodegraded after irradiating for 180 min cod and toc concentrations gradually declined from 382 4 mg l and 158 mg l to 250 3 mg l and 125 mg l respectively and bod5 cod excessed 0 3 our results indicate that although photocatalytic treatment cannot completely mineralize pollutants in gymw it could break refractory components and conserve them into biodegradable intermediates in addition effluent color declined from 525 to 8 3 3 gymw post treatment by sbbr ppor effluent could be treated by sbbr to achieve a further decrease of cod a ppor sbbr was built up and operated for 100 days and its representative running data is shown in fig 7 influent cod was 382 4 8 2 mg l and ppor performance was quite stable after 180 min of visible light irradiation cod declined to 250 3 5 5 mg l with a removal efficiency of 34 however as microorganisms needed to adapt to the oligotrophic environment sbbr underwent a gradual improvement initially effluent cod of sbbr was 121 6 mg l after acclimatizing for 80 days cod had reduced to 50 mg l discharge standards cod removal efficiency for the whole ppor sbbr system attained 87 8 and this high level of performance was maintained throughout to the last ppor sbbr effluent attained the level of grade i a in the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants gb 18918 2002 table 1 as the treated effluent is suitable for direct discharge into rivers this process therefore eliminates costs associated with transporting the wastewater to municipal treatment plants as well as costs related to further treatment processes thereby significantly reducing overall disposal costs this novel system is also a promising and cost effective process to advance treatment of complex industrial wastewater 3 4 fluorescence analysis of gymw eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize dissolved organic matter in gymw throughout ppor sbbr treatment results indicated that the fluorescence region of influent was concentrated in λex 300 nm 500 nm λem 400 nm 600 nm fig 8 a two fluorescence peaks were identified in this region associated to a humic acid like substance which was difficult to biodegrade 25 26 this result corresponds to the low bod5 cod value of 0 08 however after photocatalytic pre oxidation the fluorescence blue region shifted and fluorescence intensity decreased fig 8b a shift in the blue region is associated with structural change of substances caused by oxidation such as decomposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into small molecules a reduction in the number of aromatic rings and conjugated groups and the disappearance of specific functional groups 27 28 therefore macromolecular refractory pollutants in gymw may be converted to biodegradable intermediate compounds a finding that was in accordance with bod5 cod results recording an increase to 0 3 fluorescence intensity in sbbr effluent fig 8c continued to decline and the fluorescence region continued to shift towards the uv region suggesting that contaminants in ppor effluent continued to be decomposed by microorganisms 3 5 microbial community structure analysis richness and diversity of microbial community were analyzed from seed sludge s0 and activated sludge on the 100th day s1 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were also conducted on these samples in total 53884 sequences and 42900 sequences were obtained from s0 and s1 respectively table 2 the richness of microorganisms was characterized via ace and the chao1 index with higher ace and chao1 indices indicating a higher abundance of microorganisms 29 it could be inferred that species richness in s1 ace index 22646 and chao1 index 14369 declined in comparison to s0 ace index 28078 and chao1 index 15989 shannon and simpson indices were used to explain species diversity a higher shannon index or a lower simpson index implied higher species diversity 30 seed sludge diversity shannon and simpson indices 5 91 and 0 00093 was recorded to be higher than that of s1 shannon and simpson indices 5 69 and 0 02 this finding can be ascribed to the fact that gymw used in this study formed an oligotrophic environment with some refractory substances possibly inhibiting microorganism growth community composition based on the result of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing from two samples 28 known bacterial phyla were detected in both s0 and s1 and 10 of them were identified as the major phyla the relative abundance 1 in s0 the primary phyla were proteobacteria 51 55 bacteroidetes 19 75 planctomycetes 6 45 verrucomicrobia 3 99 chloroflexi 3 18 actinobacteria 2 99 and firmicutes 1 41 fig 9 a result that was in accordance with previous studies on universal mwtp 31 32 compared with s0 the relative abundance of proteobacteria 59 52 chloriflexi 5 61 and firmicutes 3 71 increased in s1 and the proportions of bacteroidetes 14 81 verrucomicrobia 1 48 and actinobacteria 2 07 decreased it was reported that proteobacteria had the ability to degrade refractory organisms and members of chloroflexi served as phenols degraders 33 34 the presence of a macromolecular refractory substance in gymw could be the reason why these kinds of bacteria accumulated in s1 the decreased proportions of verrucomicrobia may be ascribed to the fact that verrucomicrobia is more adaptable to an acidic environment 35 at the genus level analysis of the major genera relative abundance 1 recorded a significant shift in microbial composition fig 9b dokdonella 8 88 defluviimonas 5 71 rhodobacter 3 95 gemmobacter 2 48 and thauera 4 4 were the dominant bacteria in s1 it has been previously reported that these bacteria have a good propensity to degrade refractory compounds for example defluviimonas rhodobacter and gemmobacter decomposed low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah 36 and dokdonella and thauera can degrade a wide range of carbon sources including many aromatic compounds 37 38 in contrast the presence of novosphingobium 6 3 and nitrospira 2 21 declined to a very low proportion almost not being recorded in s1 novosphingobium was always recorded in the anaerobic digester 39 and nitrospira is enriched in a nitrifying system 40 the aerobic environment and low concentrations of nitrogen may account for their depletion 4 conclusions 1 the k2s2o8 doped tio2 photocatalyst was successfully synthesized 2 after visible light irradiation for 180 min cod toc and color removal efficiency reached 34 21 and 98 respectively in addition bod5 cod increased from 0 08 to 0 34 3 ppor effluent was additionally treated by microorganisms here cod reduced to 50 mg l therefore meeting discharge standards of grade i a in gb 18918 2002 4 proteobacteria chloriflexi bacteroidetes and firmicutes were the dominant bacterial in s1 the bacterial genera of dokdonella defluviimonas thauera and rhodobacter can degrade a wide range of carbon sources including aromatic compounds enriched in s1 overall the ppor sbbr system is a promising method to advance refractory industrial wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

k2s2o8 doped tio2 applied as a photocatalyst to treat wastewater was synthesized using the sol gel method 15 10 ml of titanium butoxide and 40 ml of absolute ethanol were combined in a beaker and stirred at 400 rpm 10 ml of deionized water was then added to the solution followed by the addition of 0 2 ml of k2s2o8 0 2 mol l dropwise after the solution was left to rest for 24 h the supernatant liquid was decanted and the precipitate was oven dried at 103 c dhg 9240a shanghai yiheng tech instrument co ltd the sample was then calcined in air in a furnace a 550 ndi vulcan at a constant temperature of 300 c for 3 h 2 3 photocatalytic pre oxidation a laboratory scale ppor system with sbbr post treatment was built up to treat gymw fig 1 the working volume of ppor and sbbr were 3 l and 4 l respectively in order to enhance biodegradability gymw was pre treated by photocatalysis in the ppor system the content of the k2s2o8 doped tio2 photocatalyst was 2 g l 16 the light resource was long arc xenon lamp gxz300 80 w situated 5 cm above the reactor having an irradiation wavelength between 290 800 nm and a light intensity of 18 5 mw cm 2 a 420 nm cutoff filter was used for visible light irradiation and a high pressure mercury lamp guv200 55 w for uv light before irradiation gymw pumped into the reactor was treated in the dark for 30 min to attain desorption absorption equilibrium after the photocatalytic reaction was carried out for 180 min turned off the aeration pump and stand still for 2 h to allow the catalyst to settle to the bottom of the cone of ppor ppor effluent was passed to the sbbr to continue biodegradation as shown in fig 1 the outlet of ppor is above the cone to ensure that the catalyst does not flow into sbbr 2 4 sbbr post treatment during sbbr operation the volume of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was 1500 200 mg l in the sbbr the operation period included introducing wastewater aerobic reaction 4 h sedimentation 2 h and drainage volume exchange ratio is half operation of the system was undertaken for 100 days during the biological reaction ph was maintained at 7 5 0 5 with the addition of hcl 0 1 m dissolved oxygen do concentration was 3 0 0 5 mg l 2 5 analytical methods effluent samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 4 min tg16 ws china and cod bod5 and mlss were measured using the potassium dichromate standard method international standard and the gravimetric method respectively total organic carbon toc concentration was determined using a toc analyzer toc l shimadzu ph and do were measured using a digital ph mv meter phb 4 leici and a do analyzer hq40d hach respectively chemical characteristics of the soluble organics from gymw were analyzed by eem rf 6000 shimadzu in addition crystalline structures were examined using xrd d8 advance bruker with a scanning range of 15 to 75 the chemical states of the photocatalyst were obtained using xps 250xi escalab the uv vis absorbance spectra were obtained by a scan uv vis spectrophotometer uv 365 shimadzu using baso4 as the reflectance sample surface morphology of the photocatalyst were observed using sem geminisem 450 zeiss 2 6 high throughput sequencing and analysis two sludge samples seed sludge s0 and sludge on the 100th day s1 from the sbbr were collected to investigate the bacterial community structure dna from the two samples were amplified by pcr using primer sets 314 f 5 ccctacacgacgctcttccgatctg 3 and 805r 5 gactggagttccttggcacccgagaattcca 3 for the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes in miseq sequencing platform following the methods of wan et al 17 low quality sequences and chimeras were deleted by mothur and uchime similar sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using a 97 identity threshold the ribosomal database project rdp was used in taxonomic classification the sequences generated in this study are available on the ncbi sequence read archive with accession number prjna607897 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the crystal phases of the photocatalysts were exhibited using xrd fig 2 diffraction peaks at 2θ 24 49 38 19 48 19 54 85 55 21 62 1 and 73 32 were indexed to the 101 004 200 105 211 and 204 lattice planes of anatase phase tio2 jcpds card 21 1272 respectively 18 19 however diffraction peaks of k2s2o8 were not found in the xrd pattern of the doped sample possibly being attributed to the low amount and relatively lower diffraction intensity of k2s2o8 in addition the as synthesized k2s2o8 doped tio2 photocatalyst was found to have high purity as no impurity related peaks were recorded 20 results from the xps spectra of k2s2o8 doped tio2 and pure tio2 fig 3 recorded elements such as titanium oxygen potassium sulfur and carbon ti 2p1 2 and ti 2p3 2 peaks were located at 464 1 ev and 458 7 ev respectively splitting of 5 4 ev indicated that ti4 existed in k2s2o8 doped tio2 and pure tio2 samples 21 the peak of o 1s observed between 529 9 530 1 ev suggested that o element was o2 22 in addition the peak of s 2p was only found in the k2s2o8 doped tio2 sample drs of k2s2o8 doped tio2 and pure tio2 were shown in fig 4 the band gap of k2s2o8 doped tio2 nanoparticles decreased with k2s2o8 doping fig 4b a shift of the absorption edge toward the visible light regions of the solar spectrum is observed in fig 4a sem analysis of sample surface morphology fig 5 indicated that k2s2o8 doped tio2 and pure tio2 samples were composed of regular sphere particles with k2s2o8 doped tio2 having a smaller particle size a smaller particle size corresponded to a larger specific surface area this being conducive to improving the catalytic activity of the photocatalysts it was previously reported that doping of nonmetals and or metals to tio2 inhibited the growth of tio2 particles 23 24 in addition so4 2 ions anchored on the surface of tio2 have strong affinity for electrons capturing the photo induced electrons e which hinders the recombination of electrons e and holes h all these led up to enhanced photoactivity and ultimately promoted degradation efficiency in real world scenarios 3 2 gymw photocatalytic pre oxidation in order to verify the photocatalytic performance of the k2s2o8 doped tio2 photocatalyst pure tio2 and k2s2o8 doped tio2 were applied to degrade gymw under visible light and uv light respectively as shown in fig 6 b the two catalysts had similar efficiency under uv light with visible light irradiation by contrast the doped photocatalyst performed much better throughout the 180 min reaction process fig 6a photocatalysis under visible light irradiation pre oxidation of gymw to enhance its biodegradability fig 6c bod5 cod of ppor influent was 0 08 suggesting that the wastewater had a low propensity to be biodegraded after irradiating for 180 min cod and toc concentrations gradually declined from 382 4 mg l and 158 mg l to 250 3 mg l and 125 mg l respectively and bod5 cod excessed 0 3 our results indicate that although photocatalytic treatment cannot completely mineralize pollutants in gymw it could break refractory components and conserve them into biodegradable intermediates in addition effluent color declined from 525 to 8 3 3 gymw post treatment by sbbr ppor effluent could be treated by sbbr to achieve a further decrease of cod a ppor sbbr was built up and operated for 100 days and its representative running data is shown in fig 7 influent cod was 382 4 8 2 mg l and ppor performance was quite stable after 180 min of visible light irradiation cod declined to 250 3 5 5 mg l with a removal efficiency of 34 however as microorganisms needed to adapt to the oligotrophic environment sbbr underwent a gradual improvement initially effluent cod of sbbr was 121 6 mg l after acclimatizing for 80 days cod had reduced to 50 mg l discharge standards cod removal efficiency for the whole ppor sbbr system attained 87 8 and this high level of performance was maintained throughout to the last ppor sbbr effluent attained the level of grade i a in the discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plants gb 18918 2002 table 1 as the treated effluent is suitable for direct discharge into rivers this process therefore eliminates costs associated with transporting the wastewater to municipal treatment plants as well as costs related to further treatment processes thereby significantly reducing overall disposal costs this novel system is also a promising and cost effective process to advance treatment of complex industrial wastewater 3 4 fluorescence analysis of gymw eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to characterize dissolved organic matter in gymw throughout ppor sbbr treatment results indicated that the fluorescence region of influent was concentrated in λex 300 nm 500 nm λem 400 nm 600 nm fig 8 a two fluorescence peaks were identified in this region associated to a humic acid like substance which was difficult to biodegrade 25 26 this result corresponds to the low bod5 cod value of 0 08 however after photocatalytic pre oxidation the fluorescence blue region shifted and fluorescence intensity decreased fig 8b a shift in the blue region is associated with structural change of substances caused by oxidation such as decomposition of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into small molecules a reduction in the number of aromatic rings and conjugated groups and the disappearance of specific functional groups 27 28 therefore macromolecular refractory pollutants in gymw may be converted to biodegradable intermediate compounds a finding that was in accordance with bod5 cod results recording an increase to 0 3 fluorescence intensity in sbbr effluent fig 8c continued to decline and the fluorescence region continued to shift towards the uv region suggesting that contaminants in ppor effluent continued to be decomposed by microorganisms 3 5 microbial community structure analysis richness and diversity of microbial community were analyzed from seed sludge s0 and activated sludge on the 100th day s1 dna extraction and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing were also conducted on these samples in total 53884 sequences and 42900 sequences were obtained from s0 and s1 respectively table 2 the richness of microorganisms was characterized via ace and the chao1 index with higher ace and chao1 indices indicating a higher abundance of microorganisms 29 it could be inferred that species richness in s1 ace index 22646 and chao1 index 14369 declined in comparison to s0 ace index 28078 and chao1 index 15989 shannon and simpson indices were used to explain species diversity a higher shannon index or a lower simpson index implied higher species diversity 30 seed sludge diversity shannon and simpson indices 5 91 and 0 00093 was recorded to be higher than that of s1 shannon and simpson indices 5 69 and 0 02 this finding can be ascribed to the fact that gymw used in this study formed an oligotrophic environment with some refractory substances possibly inhibiting microorganism growth community composition based on the result of 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing from two samples 28 known bacterial phyla were detected in both s0 and s1 and 10 of them were identified as the major phyla the relative abundance 1 in s0 the primary phyla were proteobacteria 51 55 bacteroidetes 19 75 planctomycetes 6 45 verrucomicrobia 3 99 chloroflexi 3 18 actinobacteria 2 99 and firmicutes 1 41 fig 9 a result that was in accordance with previous studies on universal mwtp 31 32 compared with s0 the relative abundance of proteobacteria 59 52 chloriflexi 5 61 and firmicutes 3 71 increased in s1 and the proportions of bacteroidetes 14 81 verrucomicrobia 1 48 and actinobacteria 2 07 decreased it was reported that proteobacteria had the ability to degrade refractory organisms and members of chloroflexi served as phenols degraders 33 34 the presence of a macromolecular refractory substance in gymw could be the reason why these kinds of bacteria accumulated in s1 the decreased proportions of verrucomicrobia may be ascribed to the fact that verrucomicrobia is more adaptable to an acidic environment 35 at the genus level analysis of the major genera relative abundance 1 recorded a significant shift in microbial composition fig 9b dokdonella 8 88 defluviimonas 5 71 rhodobacter 3 95 gemmobacter 2 48 and thauera 4 4 were the dominant bacteria in s1 it has been previously reported that these bacteria have a good propensity to degrade refractory compounds for example defluviimonas rhodobacter and gemmobacter decomposed low molecular weight polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah 36 and dokdonella and thauera can degrade a wide range of carbon sources including many aromatic compounds 37 38 in contrast the presence of novosphingobium 6 3 and nitrospira 2 21 declined to a very low proportion almost not being recorded in s1 novosphingobium was always recorded in the anaerobic digester 39 and nitrospira is enriched in a nitrifying system 40 the aerobic environment and low concentrations of nitrogen may account for their depletion 4 conclusions 1 the k2s2o8 doped tio2 photocatalyst was successfully synthesized 2 after visible light irradiation for 180 min cod toc and color removal efficiency reached 34 21 and 98 respectively in addition bod5 cod increased from 0 08 to 0 34 3 ppor effluent was additionally treated by microorganisms here cod reduced to 50 mg l therefore meeting discharge standards of grade i a in gb 18918 2002 4 proteobacteria chloriflexi bacteroidetes and firmicutes were the dominant bacterial in s1 the bacterial genera of dokdonella defluviimonas thauera and rhodobacter can degrade a wide range of carbon sources including aromatic compounds enriched

13947,in this study tailor made nanobentonite incorporated nanocellulose chitosan aerogel ncnb has been used to study its metal adsorption capacity from simulated wastewater the aerogel was characterised with fesem afm edx xrd ftir raman spectroscopy and found the successful conversion to the desired adsorbent in nano dimension this ncnb was used for optimisation of chromium cobalt and copper adsorption response surface methodology rsm was implemented to derive the binary correlation between various experimental parameters such as initial metal concentration ph adsorbent mass and temperature using central composite design ccd the regression coefficients were evaluated which validated second order polynomial equation for the remediation of cr co and cu with ncnb the maximum adsorption efficiencies under the optimum condition of the process parameters for cr co and cu removal were found to be 98 90 97 45 and 99 01 respectively co efficient of determination r2 for cr co and cu were 0 9796 0 8973 and 0 9321 respectively halsey isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model agreed well with the experimental data for all the three metals thermodynamics study showed the metal adsorption was spontaneous endothermic and feasible in nature these data imperatively show that use of this aerogel can be a good alternative to the expensive methods of heavy metal remediation keywords adsorption design of experiment chromium cobalt copper 1 introduction water being the most vital element of all the life forms has the utmost attention due to the global scarcity it is facing from past few decades with rapid decrease in the available water for drinking agriculture industrial and domestic usage 1 5 among the roots of water pollution industrialization tops the list with mostly heavy metal contamination from the waste effluents heavy metals are reported in sources like geogenic industrial automobile emissions batteries chemical fertilisers dyes aging water supply infrastructure and microplastics in the oceans agricultural pharmaceutical domestic waste waste incineration and atmospheric sources 6 9 mining and other metal based industries are the most prominent point source of environmental heavy metal pollution 10 15 these heavy metals act as a pseudo element in living body and interfere with the natural metabolism process absorbed mass exposure route and duration heavily impact the metal toxicity and so is the acute or chronic severity due to oxidative stress caused by the formation of free radical 12 16 heavy metal treatment has become of particular concern due to their persistence in the ecosystem several technique such as adsorption coagulation chemical precipitation membrane filtration photocatalytic degradation electrochemical treatment have been used with their respective pros and cons 13 14 17 18 however the technique of heavy metal clean up through adsorption has its advantage over other mechanical process is being a passive metabolic process it does not require external energy this has been practiced since long with lignocellulosic plant biomass activated carbon clay algae etc 13 14 19 but they suffer from low sorption and low selectivity towards pollutant to circumvent this issue novel synthetic materials have been explored and aerogel is a new star candidate in this area of adsorption with their high efficiency recyclability temperature and ph stability easy separation from waste after treatment till now various studies have been done by fabricating cellulose aerogel and composites with other materials and good adsorption capacity towards different metals are achieved 20 21 one study reported a facile way of using hybrid cellulose aerogel with loaded metal organic framework for pb2 removal and also regeneration of the adsorbent without producing secondary pollution 22 another study revealed aerogel produced from waste office paper and chitosan showed good adsorption capacity for copper the aerogel showed high mechanical strength 23 kelechi et al used chitosan silica aerogel to remove cadmium and reported 98 adsorption capacity within 3 h 24 another research group shaoguo et al studied cellulose aerogel composite with metal organic frameworks for chromium cr vi removal the high porosity of the hybrid aerogel was loaded with zeolite imidazole framework and obviously the adsorption capacity increases enormously 25 some studies showed when cellulose was scaled down their natural properties of high surface area 20 250 m2 g high strength porocity renewability biocompatibility biodegradability reusability natural abundance shape memory 23 surface with tuneable surface morphology and chemistry etc get enhanced that allow controlled interactions with polymers nanocellulose surface possess large number of active functional groups like oh cooh compared to those in common materials despite that application nanocellulose in pure form as an adsorbent has some limitations they get disintegrated in the water so there is a need to cross link nanocellulose with some cross linker 26 27 or other compatible material by addition of a cross linker to these particles three dimensional interwoven network can be generated 28 clay minerals were often known as very inexpensive strong sorbents due to their incredible density and availability 29 the effective sorption mechanism in bentonite is due to the si iv and al iii isomorphous replacement in the silica layer resulting in constant negative charges on its surface by reducing its size to nanometre range its available specific surface area will be extensively enhanced on the basis of which it was anticipated that the resulting material will exhibit better adsorption capacity in this study nanobentonite incorporated nanocellulose chitosan aerogel nbnc has been synthesized and used for the treatment of three primary heavy metals viz chromium cr cobalt co and copper cu from simulated wastewater the process was optimised using response surface methodology rsm for experimental parameter of adsorbent mass temperature ph and initial metal concentration rsm is an appropriate model to decrease the workload while optimising several parameters for a process than one variable at a time ovat method 30 rsm has been hugely used in environment fields to find the effect of explanatory variable on response variable 31 nevertheless there is no research available regarding the optimization of conditions for adsorption application of aerogel in these three metals selected for this work which is the novelty of the present study however different research groups often select experimental conditions freely such as temperature 25 95 c etc aerogel initial concentration 0 5 10 mg ml etc reaction time 1 24 h etc ph 2 8 and adsorbent mass 1 10 mg etc 32 33 and also detailed isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics study to determine the physico chemical nature of the adsorption process was performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemicals applied to prepare the aerogel were purchased from himedia which includes cellulose powder sodium periodate ethylene glycol chloroacetic acid hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide and chitosan ethyl alcohol was obtained from commercial sources all experiments were performed using milli q water 2 2 methods cellulose was converted to nano cellulose using acid hydrolysis with 64 w v sulphuric acid 15 after that the nano cellulose was mixed with sodium periodate in dark condition at 40 c for oxidation of the nanocellulose ethylene glycol was used to remove the excess sodium periodate and a gel like product was obtained which was dialysed using a membrane of 12000 14000 molecular weight cut off and the obtained dialdehydenanocellulose danc was stored at 5 c simultaneously with the help of ultrasonication bentonite powder was converted to nanobentonite nb and dried in an oven at 50 c chitosan flakes were modified to carboxymethyl chitosan cmc after treating with sodium hydroxide in isopropanol and then chloroacetic acid in isopropanol solution 34 to this dried cmc danc and nb was added gradually and sonicated for 1 h in an ice bath for uniform mixing the obtained hydrogel slurry was kept at 80 c for 24 h and then lyophilised and finally obtained the nanobentonite incorporated dialdehyde nanocellulose carboxymethyl chitosan aerogel nbnc 2 3 characterisation the scanning electron microscopy zeiss gemini germany equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy was used to analyse the surface morphology and elemental presence of the adsorbent atomic force microscope cypher oxford with radiator was used to check the surface description in three dimension and roughness data of the sample was checked with the software gwyddion the crystallinity of the aerogel was checked with a x ray diffractometer rigaku micromax 007hf before and after adsorption a laser micro raman microscope horiba jobin vyon labram hr with 400 lines per mm grating 633 nm excitation wavelength was used to check the structural fingerprint of the composite material the laser power on sample was 20 0 mw and a 10 microscope objective was used for the study each sample was scanned from 50 to 4000 cm 1 for a 10 s exposure time 2 4 swelling coefficient swelling coefficient is a characteristic parameter of aerogel that reflects the affinity of the aerogel for water or other fluids it is the ratio of settled wet weight to the dry weight of the aerogel 35 to determine dry aerogel of known weight was put in a measuring cylinder and sufficient amount of water was added to cover the aerogel when no further change was observed in the water level the weight of the aerogel was measured and compared to that of the dry weight 2 5 adsorption experiment the percentage removal of the respective metal was calculated using the below eq 1 and 2 36 where co and ce are the initial metal concentration mg l and equilibrium metal concentration at time t mg l respectively 1 r 1 c e c 0 100 the biosorption capacity qe of biosorbent was derived as 2 q e c 0 c e v m where mass of the biosorbent and volume of the metal solution were denoted as m g and v ml in this study four variables were adopted to study their effect on the metal adsorption viz initial metal concentration ph adsorbent mass and temperature ccd design expert ver 11 was implemented to prepare a test series with minimum number of experimental conditions in a cost and time effective manner it allows to investigate indicative interaction and their influence of the explanatory parameters on the adsorption efficiency by regression analysis of the data obtained design matrix in the ccd is outlined with the four parameters with low central and high point total experiments were found to be 30 of which factorial points axial points and replicates at the centre point were 16 8 and 6 respectively they were then conducted for cr co and cu adsorptive removal modelling separately using the equation 3 and 4 mentioned below 3 n 2 l 2 l c 0 where l is the input variable number and c0 denotes the central points eq 4 was used to denote the experimental variables xi to xi using below equation 4 x i x i x 0 δ x i where xi denotes the central point of x0 below mentioned eq 5 was applied to derive the relation between experimental parameters and response factors 5 y β 0 σ i q k β i x i σ i q k β i i x i 2 σ i 1 k σ i j 1 k β i j x i x j ε where β0 is used as the model constant βi implies the linear coefficient βii is defined as the quadratic constant βij defines the interaction coefficient between xi and xj and ε is the residual factor the range of desired parameters with a 95 confidence limit were tabulated in table 1 with different level of design variables the adsorption experiments were performed with known concentration of cr co and cu separately in containers using predetermined mass of the aerogel obtained from the design of experiment the ph of the solution was adjusted by 1 m naoh and hcl with the help of a ph meter to the desired values all the experiments were conditioned for 3 h at 140 agitation speed for varied temperature the metal concentration was evaluated using 96 well micro reader uv spectrometer at 540 nm 510 nm and 492 nm for cr co and cu respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterisation of the aerogel adsorption 3 1 1 swelling coefficient swelling coefficient sc was determined to be 29 48 which is pretty significant as calculated from the below mentioned formula 6 where sv is the swollen weight and dv being the dry weight of the aerogel 37 6 s c s v d v d v 3 1 2 fesem and edx fesem images of nanobentonite in the fig 1 a reveals spheres that mostly lie in the size range of 10 nm and 20 nm sheets like structures of the ncnb aerogel are observed in the fig 1b broken channels of the nano cellulose chitosan are seen where nanobentonite particles are incorporated in the matrix energy dispersive x ray of the raw aerogel and after adsorption by cr co and cu was done the of metal adsorbed were shown in comparison with c h o and n present in the adsorbent after adsorption significant metal peaks 1 1 5 1 and 2 4 wt were observed in the fig 2 b d for cr co and cu respectively 3 1 3 afm and roughness data surface morphology and topography were analyzed with afm on a clean silica surface the sample was drop casted and dried at room temperature the afm image of the ncnb and ncnb after metal adsorption was shown in fig 2b d the height and phase images of the were taken over a 5 μm 5 μm area in fig 2a there are less spots as compared to the bright contrast dots represent cr co and cu on ncnb the roughness data was determined using a software named gwyddion where various roughness parameters viz roughness average rms roughness height peak and waviness the roughness average for ncnb with cr 5 421 pm co 1 772 pm and cu 1 227 pm are significantly less as compared to the raw ncnb 975 722 pm suggesting the smoothness of the surface owing to the maximum adsorption of the metal on the adsorbent the data were tabulated in table 2 with some additional parameters derived from the afm images 3 1 4 xrd fig 3 showed the xrd pattern of ncnb ncnb after adsorption of cr co and cu three major peaks 2ө 5 20 35 03 were observed from ncnb corresponds to the characteristic peaks of cellulose structure the ncnb with metal diffractogram pattern was slightly different at an angle 35 54 62 from the ncnb as some peaks appear for cr co and cu confirmed from literature report 38 39 it was also observed that the crystalline structure of the ncnb was intake and ordered in ncnb cr a distinct peak was observed at 2ө 62 that was due to the presence of cr as confirmed from the result of pure cr diffractogram showing for ncnb co peaks at 35 and 63 confirmed the presence of co similarly a weak peak at 75 showed the presence of cu from the xrd analysis the crystallinity index of sample can be determined which is a quantitative indicator of the crystalline nature of the sample a hypothesis by hermans and weidinger 40 states that diffraction from crystalline and amorphous materials are additive 3 1 5 raman for ncnb peaks at 300 980 denotes nanobentonite peaks at 1654 corresponds to chitosan whereas 568 1149 1474 2730 2895 and 3381 denotes cellulose characteristics band 41 for ncnb cr a peak at 750 corresponds to raw cr appearance of the peak at 690 confirms the adsorption of co characteristics peaks at 293 343 629 can be assigned to presence of cu fig 3 establishment of response surface methodology one of the most crucial parameters in solid liquid phase sorption for judging the sorption ability of charged molecules towards the sorbate surface is ph it affects the solution chemistry and sorbent surface charge simultaneously during the reaction 30 ncnb was first checked with cr co and cu solution with ph ranging from 2 to 9 fig 4 for cr the parameters were optimised at 4 ph temperature 37 5 c 1 mg of the biosorbent with 550 mg l of initial metal solution for co optimum parameters were 2 ph temperature 37 5 c 3 mg of the biosorbent with 550 mg l of initial metal concentration similarly cu was optimised at 5 ph temperature 31 25 2 mg of biosorbent and 775 mg l of the metal concentration table 3 biosorption capacity qe for cr co and cu were found to be 2749 685 916 65 and 1937 49 mg g respectively the resultant equations in terms of actual factors in the quadratic model for each of the metal are showed in the below equation 7 8 and 9 where a b c and d are initial concentration of metal ph adsorbent mass and temperature respectively cr removal 7 13 717 0 113 a 15 273 b 7 111 c 6 553 d 0 002 a b 0 005 a c 0 00306

polynomial design plot for interaction model graph of the effect is depicted in figs 5 7 the interaction plot of the response for cr shown in fig 5 indicates that the interaction between the temperature adsorbent mass and initial concentration have the highest effect on the metal adsorption the interaction between temperature and the initial concentration showed significance in affecting the removal efficiency the model graphs fig 5 for chromium shows that the removal percentage of cr decreases with increase in initial concentration while at low temperature the removal was high that agreed well with the exothermic nature of the adsorption process there was a gradual increase and then decrease in the removal with increasing the adsorbent mass that could be due to the saturation of the adsorbent active site with cr metal similarly with increase in ph there is a drop in removal percentage and was maximum at 4 the interaction plot of the response for co is shown in fig 6 the interaction between temperature and the initial concentration was the most significant in affecting the removal efficiency the model graphs shown in fig 6 for cobalt shows that the removal percentage of co increases with decrease in initial concentration at low temperature the removal was high that is the exothermic nature of the process there was a decrease in the removal due to raising the the metal solution ph the adsorbent mass and removal percentage was directly proportional the interaction plot of the response for cu shown in fig 7 indicates that the interaction between the temperature and initial concentration have the highest effect on the metal adsorption the interaction between adsorbent mass and the initial concentration was also significant in affecting the removal efficiency the model graphs for copper shows that the removal percentage of cu increases with initial concentration and then gradually decreased as shown in fig 7 while at low temperature the removal was high that was in accordance with the exothermic adsorption process there was an increase in the removal due to raising the adsorbent mass 3 2 analysis of statistical data for chromium from the model f value it can be concluded that the model is significant the chances that any f value of 5 61 is only 0 10 implying f value this large might occur because of noise also p value 0 008 0 05 shows the model terms are significant here a d ad a2 c2 and d2 are the significant terms the predicted r² value 0 4762 is less than the adjusted r² of 0 6899 the difference is 0 2 that is desirable adeq precision determines the signal to noise ratio and a ratio 4 is desirable in this model the ratio of 8 1901 shows an adequate signal all the data derived using anova were shown in table 4 3 3 analysis

temperature plays the most significant role there is only a 0 11 chance that a lack of fit f value this high can occur because of noise the adeq ratio of 8 977 indicates an adequate signal all the data derived using anova were shown in table 6 error function of different metals has been shown in table 7 3 5 kinetic analysis the adsorption rate is the significant factor in removal process to understand the kinetics of the adsorption process pseudo first order pfo pseudo second order pso intra particle diffusion ipd and elovich e model was applied using the equations shown below 10 11 12

time t respectively rate constants of pfo and pso are assigned with k1 and k2 respectively kid is the rate constant and c is the ipd model constant e constants are denoted by α and β a graph by plotting log qe qt vs t was used but low values of the r2 and high value of std err for cr co and cu indicates the insufficiency of the pfo model to fit the equilibrium data similarly the plot between t qt against t was used to determine the pso kinetics values such as k2 and qe in pso the rate limiting step is the valent forces through sharing and exchange of electrons it can be seen that the pso kinetic model is more suitable to describe the adsorption kinetic data of cr co and cu fig 8 the std err value for this was lowest than the other models studied moreover the equilibrium adsorption capacity calculated through to this model qe cal are closer to the experimental values qe exp which indicates that the adsorption is controlled by the chemical reaction rate also the regression of plot of t qt vs t for all the metals passes through the origin fig 8 the driving force behind the adsorption of cr co and cu onto nbnc surface might be due to the sharing and exchange of electrons table 8 a table is included to compare the adsorption capacity of nbnc with adsorbents reported in literature as included in table 11 23 42 48 3 6 isotherm studies to study the interaction between adsorbate molecules with the adsorbent surface isotherm models are used in this study three models viz freundlich redlich peterson and halsey were used to fit experimental data freundlich model describes the heterogeneous surface characteristics and an exponential distribution of active sites the linear form of freundlich isotherm is shown in the below eq 14 14 log q e log k f 1 n log c e here freundlich constants k f is related to biosorption capacity and the biosorption intensity is denoted as 1 n 50 the halsey isotherm model signifies the multilayer adsorption of sorbate over sorbent this model is used to establish surface heteroporosity for the adsorbent and its interaction with the sorbate molecules the linear form for the model 51 is represented as 15 l n q e 1 n h l n k h 1 n h l n 1 c e halsey isotherm model constant and halsey isotherm model exponent are represented as kh and n respectively the coefficient of determination r2 and standard error std err for the three isotherm presented in table 9 indicates that experimental data for cr and cu well fitted to halsey isotherm whereas co followed freundlich isotherm with high r2 and low std err the freundlich constants kf and n values were determined by the plot logqe vs logce for biosorption on ncnb the n value 0 49 between 0 10 indicated the favourable chemisorption of co onto nbnc halsey isotherm plotted ln 1 ce vs lnqe confirmed the multilayer adsorption for cr and cu the isotherm plots have been shown in fig 9 3 7 thermodynamic studies the thermodynamic studies were conducted in the temperature range from 30 to 50 c through the determination of change in gibbs free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs of the reaction the classic van t hoff reaction isotherm equation correlates the thermodynamic parameters and are represented with the help of the below equations 52 53 16 δ g δ g r t ln k l 17 ln k l δ s r δ h r t 18 δ g r t ln k l here kl is the isotherm sorption constant of langmuir equation r is the universal gas constant 8 314 j molk and t is the absolute temperature in kelvin δh and δs can be calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot ln kl vs 1 t respectively with rise in temperature there will be increase mobility of the adsorbate molecules and decreased viscosity of the solution that facilitates the subsequent adsorption stages the negative value of the enthalpy shows that the adsorption is exothermic reaction for all the metals studied positive entropy value suggests the feasibility of the adsorption as there will be an increased randomness at the internal structure of the adsorbent 13 14 the negative free energy confirms the spontaneity of the adsorption which is energetically favorable as well table 10 41 13 14 3 8 adsorption mechanism the adsorption process is basically dependent on the surface morphology particle size of the adsorbent ncnb the feasible accessibility of cr co and co is due to incorporation of large amount of functional group from nanocellulose and negative charges from bentonite and chitosan on the surface of ncnb the size reduction to nano range is an added advantage to avail enhanced surface area the fesem image clearly shows the sheet like structure with nanoparticles on it the ftir analysis indicates that ncnb possesses several active sites which play a predominant role in the interaction process with metal molecules the fast and spontaneous and feasible adsorption process could be related to chemisorption process as interpreted with the pseudo second order kinetic model agreement a proper understanding and interpretation of adsorption isotherms is critical for the overall improvement of adsorption mechanism pathways and effective design of adsorption system for cr and cu halsey isotherm agreed well whereas co followed freundlich isotherm freundlich isotherm is applicable to adsorption processes that occur on heterogonous surfaces this isotherm gives an expression which defines the surface heterogeneity and the exponential distribution of active sites and their energies halsey isotherm is used to evaluate multilayer adsorption at a relatively large distance from the surface nimibofa et al 2017 the halsey isotherm fits the experimental data for cr and cu well due to high correlation coefficient r 2 than freundlich which may be attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of activate sites and multilayer adsorption on ncnb after the treatment of metal right from the begining 4 conclusion in this study the use of aerogel for the remediation of three different heavy metals viz cr co and cu has been studied various characterisation showed the evidence of nano sized composite aerogel the ncnb aerogel was applied as a super effective adsorbent

13947,in this study tailor made nanobentonite incorporated nanocellulose chitosan aerogel ncnb has been used to study its metal adsorption capacity from simulated wastewater the aerogel was characterised with fesem afm edx xrd ftir raman spectroscopy and found the successful conversion to the desired adsorbent in nano dimension this ncnb was used for optimisation of chromium cobalt and copper adsorption response surface methodology rsm was implemented to derive the binary correlation between various experimental parameters such as initial metal concentration ph adsorbent mass and

metal adsorption was spontaneous endothermic and feasible in nature these data imperatively show that use of this aerogel can be a good alternative to the expensive methods of heavy metal remediation keywords adsorption design of experiment chromium cobalt copper 1 introduction water being the most vital element of all the life forms has the utmost attention due to the global scarcity it is facing from past few decades with rapid decrease in the available water for drinking agriculture industrial and domestic usage 1 5 among the roots of water pollution industrialization tops the list with mostly heavy metal contamination from the waste effluents heavy metals are reported in sources like geogenic industrial automobile emissions batteries chemical fertilisers dyes aging water supply infrastructure and microplastics in the oceans agricultural pharmaceutical domestic waste waste incineration and atmospheric sources 6 9 mining and other metal based industries are the most prominent point source of environmental heavy metal pollution 10 15 these heavy metals act as a pseudo element in living body and interfere with the natural metabolism process absorbed mass exposure route and duration heavily impact the metal toxicity and so is the acute or chronic severity due to oxidative stress caused by the formation of free radical 12 16 heavy metal treatment has become of particular concern due to their persistence in the ecosystem several technique such as adsorption coagulation chemical precipitation membrane filtration photocatalytic degradation electrochemical treatment have been used with their respective pros and cons 13 14 17 18 however the technique of heavy metal clean up through adsorption has its advantage over other mechanical process is being a passive metabolic process it does not require external energy this has been practiced since long with lignocellulosic plant biomass activated carbon clay algae etc 13 14 19 but they suffer from low sorption and low selectivity towards pollutant to circumvent this issue novel synthetic materials have been explored and aerogel is a new star candidate in this area of adsorption with their high efficiency recyclability temperature and ph stability easy separation from waste after treatment till now various studies have been done by fabricating cellulose aerogel and composites with other materials and good adsorption capacity towards different metals are achieved 20 21 one study reported a facile way of using hybrid cellulose aerogel with loaded metal organic framework for pb2 removal and also regeneration of the adsorbent without producing secondary pollution 22 another study revealed aerogel produced from waste office paper and chitosan showed good adsorption capacity for copper the aerogel showed high mechanical strength 23 kelechi et al used chitosan silica aerogel to remove cadmium and reported 98 adsorption capacity within 3 h 24 another research group shaoguo et al studied cellulose aerogel composite with metal organic frameworks for chromium cr vi removal the high porosity of the hybrid aerogel was loaded with zeolite imidazole framework and obviously the adsorption capacity increases enormously 25 some studies showed when cellulose was scaled down their natural properties of high surface area 20 250 m2 g high strength porocity renewability biocompatibility biodegradability reusability natural abundance shape memory 23 surface with tuneable surface morphology and chemistry etc get enhanced that allow controlled interactions with polymers nanocellulose surface possess large number of active functional groups like oh cooh compared to those in common materials despite that application nanocellulose in pure form as an adsorbent has some limitations they get disintegrated in the water so there is a need to cross link nanocellulose with some cross linker 26 27 or other compatible material by addition of a cross linker to these particles three dimensional interwoven network can be generated 28 clay minerals were often known as very inexpensive strong sorbents due to their incredible density and availability 29 the effective sorption mechanism in bentonite is due to the si iv and al iii isomorphous replacement in the silica layer resulting in constant negative charges on its surface by reducing its size to nanometre range its available specific surface area will be extensively enhanced on the basis of which it was anticipated that the resulting material will exhibit better adsorption capacity in this study nanobentonite incorporated nanocellulose chitosan aerogel nbnc has been synthesized and used for the treatment of three primary heavy metals viz chromium cr cobalt co and copper cu from simulated wastewater the process was optimised using response surface methodology rsm for experimental parameter of adsorbent mass temperature ph and initial metal concentration rsm is an appropriate model to decrease the workload while optimising several parameters for a process than one variable at a time ovat method 30 rsm has been hugely used in environment fields to find the effect of explanatory variable on response variable 31 nevertheless there is no research available regarding the optimization of conditions for adsorption application of aerogel in these three metals selected for this work which is the novelty of the present study however different research groups often select experimental conditions freely such as temperature 25 95 c etc aerogel initial concentration 0 5 10 mg ml etc reaction time 1 24 h etc ph 2 8 and adsorbent mass 1 10 mg etc 32 33 and also detailed isotherm kinetics and thermodynamics study to determine the physico chemical nature of the adsorption process was performed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials chemicals applied to prepare the aerogel were purchased from himedia which includes cellulose powder sodium periodate ethylene glycol chloroacetic acid hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide and chitosan ethyl alcohol was obtained from commercial sources all experiments were performed using milli q water 2 2 methods cellulose was converted to nano

danc was stored at 5 c simultaneously with the help of ultrasonication bentonite powder was converted to nanobentonite nb and dried in an oven at 50 c chitosan flakes were modified to carboxymethyl chitosan cmc after treating with sodium hydroxide in isopropanol and then chloroacetic acid in isopropanol solution 34 to this dried cmc danc and nb was added gradually and sonicated for 1 h in an ice bath for uniform mixing the obtained hydrogel slurry was kept at 80 c for 24 h and then lyophilised and finally obtained the nanobentonite incorporated dialdehyde nanocellulose carboxymethyl chitosan

for the study each sample was scanned from 50 to 4000 cm 1 for a 10 s exposure time 2 4 swelling coefficient swelling coefficient is a characteristic parameter of aerogel that reflects the affinity of the aerogel for water or other fluids it is the ratio of settled wet weight to the dry weight of the aerogel 35 to determine dry aerogel of known weight was put in a measuring cylinder and sufficient amount of water was added to cover the aerogel when no further change was observed in the water level the weight of the aerogel was measured and compared to that of the dry weight 2 5 adsorption

to the raw ncnb 975 722 pm suggesting the smoothness of the surface owing to the maximum adsorption of the metal on the adsorbent the data were tabulated in table 2 with some additional parameters derived from the afm images 3 1 4 xrd fig 3 showed the xrd pattern of ncnb ncnb after adsorption of cr co and cu three major peaks 2ө 5 20 35 03 were observed from ncnb corresponds to the characteristic peaks of cellulose structure the ncnb with metal diffractogram pattern was slightly different at an angle 35 54 62 from the ncnb as some peaks appear for cr co and cu confirmed from literature report 38 39 it was also observed that the crystalline structure of the ncnb was intake and ordered in ncnb cr a distinct peak was observed at 2ө 62 that was due to the presence of cr as confirmed from the result of pure cr diffractogram showing for ncnb co peaks at 35 and 63 confirmed the presence of co similarly a weak peak at 75 showed the presence of cu from the xrd analysis the crystallinity index of sample can be determined which is a quantitative indicator of the crystalline nature of the sample a hypothesis by hermans and weidinger 40 states that diffraction from

presence of cu fig 3 establishment of response surface methodology one of the most crucial parameters in solid liquid phase sorption for judging the sorption ability of charged molecules towards the sorbate surface is ph it affects the solution chemistry and sorbent surface charge simultaneously during the reaction 30 ncnb was first checked with cr co and cu solution with ph ranging from 2 to 9 fig 4 for cr the parameters were optimised at 4 ph temperature 37 5 c 1 mg of the biosorbent with 550 mg l of initial metal solution for co optimum parameters were 2 ph temperature 37 5 c 3 mg of the

agreed well with the exothermic nature of the adsorption process there was a gradual increase and then decrease in the removal with increasing the adsorbent mass that could be due to the saturation of the adsorbent active site with cr metal similarly with increase in ph there is a drop in removal percentage and was maximum at 4 the interaction plot of the response for co is shown in fig 6 the interaction between temperature and the initial concentration was the most significant in affecting the removal efficiency the model graphs shown in fig 6 for cobalt shows that the removal percentage of co increases with decrease in initial concentration at low temperature the removal was high that is the exothermic nature of the process there was a decrease in the removal due to raising the the metal solution ph the adsorbent mass and removal percentage was directly proportional the interaction plot of the response for cu shown in fig 7 indicates that the interaction between the temperature and initial concentration have the highest effect on the metal adsorption the interaction between adsorbent mass and the initial concentration was also significant in affecting the removal efficiency the model graphs for copper shows that the removal percentage of cu increases with initial concentration and then gradually decreased as shown in fig 7 while at low temperature the removal was high that was in accordance with the exothermic adsorption process there was an increase in the removal due to raising the adsorbent mass 3 2 analysis of statistical data for chromium from the model f

agreement a proper understanding and interpretation of adsorption isotherms is critical for the overall improvement of adsorption mechanism pathways and effective design of adsorption system for cr and cu halsey isotherm agreed well whereas co followed freundlich isotherm freundlich isotherm is applicable to adsorption processes that occur on heterogonous surfaces this isotherm gives an expression which defines the surface heterogeneity and the exponential distribution of active sites and their energies halsey isotherm is used to evaluate multilayer adsorption at a relatively large distance from the surface nimibofa et al 2017 the halsey isotherm fits the experimental data for cr and cu well due to high correlation coefficient r 2 than freundlich which may be attributed to the heterogeneous distribution of activate sites and multilayer adsorption on ncnb after the treatment of metal right from the begining 4 conclusion in this study the use of aerogel for the remediation of three different heavy metals viz cr co and cu has been studied various characterisation showed the evidence of nano sized composite aerogel the ncnb aerogel was applied as a super effective adsorbent

effluent oil palm kernel shell continuous adsorption two in one carbonization activation system 1 introduction the palm oil mills in malaysia produced approximately 19 92 million tonnes of crude palm oil cpo in 2017 processing of fresh fruit bunch ffb to cpo generates huge amount of waste which includes in tonnes per hectare 20 08 oil palm empty fruit bunch opefb 74 48 oil palm trunk opt 14 47 oil palm frond opf and 1 10 oil palm kernel shell opks 1 these wastes are expected to increase to be more than 120 million tonnes in 2020 2 besides the solid biomass the palm oil industry also generates about 48 72 million tonnes of raw palm oil mill effluent pome per year 3 raw pome has high concentration amount of biochemical oxygen demand bod of 25 000 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod of 50 000 mg l 1 and total suspended solids tss of 40 500 mg l 1 4 raw pome also has a high colour intensity observed as dark brown with the acidic ph of 3 0 4 5 5 therefore it is prohibited to discharge the raw without proper treatment due to high organic acid contents that can disturb the river ecology and contaminate river 4 6 to meet the standard limit set by the department of environment doe malaysia various treatment methods and technologies are being considered conventional and widely applied treatment method for pome is using an open ponding system 7 although the system could reach the standard limit however it requires large space areas and long treatment time other available technologies are ultrafiltration coagulation membrane system and adsorption 8 9 these technologies are capable to meet the standard requirement however the system needs to be improved so that it is feasible for industrial use activated carbon from renewable biomass is alternative adsorbents for the industrial sector it is also environmentally sourced due to efficiency for the pollutants and heavy metals removal in wastewater treatments availability of the raw materials low value price and ease of the process design 10 11 the activated carbon from oil palm biomass is found to be sustainable and economically viable the oil palm biomass was produced by the mill and available in the mill site owing to these advantages the raw material transportation and operating cost can be minimized 6 the opks is a suitable precursor for activated carbon production due to its high density high carbon content and low ash content 12 activated carbon from opks ac opks has proven effectively eliminated organic acid and heavy metals from pome final discharge in the last pond before discharge into the river 4 13 this ac opks can be produced by carbonizing the biomass to bio char below 500 c and further activated at high temperature above 800 c using physical or chemical activation method 4 13 14 the two in one carbonization activation system has been developed to improve production efficiency by combining the separate processes of carbonization and activation into a single system 13 the ac opks produced has a great surface area of 935 m2 g 1 the treatment process of pome final discharge using ac opks has been tested in a laboratory scale by batch experiment and resulting in a significant great reduction of pollutants in pome final discharge 4 13 in order to enhance the adsorption capacity a continuous adsorption system using the ac opks produced from the two in one carbonization activation system is proposed and reported in this article 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials preparation the opks was collected from sri ulu langat palm oil mill dengkil selangor malaysia this opks was carbonized and activated using a two in one carbonization activation system following the methods described 13 the ac opks produced from this process was washed using distilled water for 15 min dried in the oven for 24 h and kept in a sealed plastic bag prior to continuous adsorption process approximately 400 l of pome final discharge was collected from last pond anaerobic pond at jugra palm oil mill dengkil selangor malaysia this pome final discharge has a bod value of more than 100 mg l 1 based on the characterization reported 13 the pome final discharge was kept in tanks and stored at the temperature of 16 c for not more than 24 h before it was tested for continuous adsorption study to avoid the uncertainty of the bod value due to biological activities in pome final discharge 2 2 continuous adsorption of pome final discharge continuous adsorption system equipped with an adsorption column height 1 m diameter 0 1 m magnetic stirrer for mixing purpose influent tank water pump and the effluent tank was developed fig 1 the adsorption column was filled with ac opks before the pome final discharge was pumped from the influent tank at the bottom of the column and flows upward to the effluent tank this adsorption system was tested with different ac opks dosage of 0 01 0 05 kg l 1 the flow rate of 30 70 ml min 1 and treatment time of 2 12 h the bed height of bioadsorbent in the adsorption column is based on the bioadsorbent dosage all the test parameters were conducted in triplicates to make sure a constant reproducibility and all the filtrates from the effluent tank were collected for further analysis 2 3 analytical procedures biological oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss and colour intensity was analyzed based on the methods reported 5 measurement of colour intensity was conducted using a spectrophotometer model brand country the surface area and pore characteristics of ac opks were reported in our previous works using automatic volumetric sorption analyzer asap2020 micromeritics new york usa 13 the opks and ac opks were analyzed using fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy model spectrum one by perkinelmer version 6 1 to identify functional groups of materials the spectra were recorded with a wavelength ranging from 4000 to 600 cm 1 resolution of 4 cm 1 and background spectra at an average of 32 scans for each spectrum meanwhile the elemental compositions of activated carbon before treatment and bioadsorbent after treatment were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy equipped with electron dispersive x ray sem edx hitachi sn 3400 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics and properties of ac opks the ac opks produced and used in this study has similar characteristic and properties with the previous reported ac opks as shown in table 1 13 opks with high mechanical strength has a carbon content as high as 60 90 compared with other oil palm biomass materials 6 the proximate analysis of raw opks shows different characteristics with ac opks after physical activation process the ac opks had the highest fixed carbon content of 87 90 however low volatile matter content and moisture content of 2 08 and 0 20 respectively due to the high temperature of 400 900 c performed during the carbonization and activation process more liquids and tar residues were driven off from the raw material 15 prolong the carbonization time and increase the carbonization temperature will decrease the volatile matter content however the ash content will increase which is not suitable to be used as a bioadsorbent according to 16 pore volume surface area and pore size distribution are the important quantitative characterisation of the bioadsorbent pore development in ac opks is due to the removal of volatile matter during the process which increases the surface area and develops rudimentary pores for better adsorption 17 the surface area of opks ac was chosen at 678 m2 g 1 that is sufficient enough to be used as a bioadsorbent to eliminate unwanted compounds in pome final discharge 3 2 ft ir spectroscopy analysis of ac opks the functional groups of opks and ac opks are shown in fig 2 the peaks of opks between the wavelengths of 3500 to 3000 cm 1 represents of ch stretch of alkaline and it was found to be diminished for ac opks after activation process at high temperature according to 18 this phenomenon was due to the dehydrated of water and loss of hydrogen and oxygen during the steam activation process the peak at 1600 cm 1 indicates the stretching of aromatic cc contribute to the increase of carbon content during the process changes or shifting of the ac opks peak can be seen at this peak because most of the surface groups had decomposed the ac opks showed the band of hydroxyl groups at around 3403 cm 1 it was showed that ac opks was reversibly devoted to the surface by van der waals forces physical sorption as a bioadsorbent in the adsorption process of pome final discharge the peak at 1032 cm 1 for opks assigned to the existing of alcohols and phenols this is proven by other study showed that the alcohol functional groups are convenient for cod removal in wastewater effluent 14 meanwhile the existing absorption peak between the wavelengths of 700 800 cm 1 indicates to the aliphatic group produced by the vibration of aromatic substitution this was in agreement by 19 who also produced aromatic vibration peaks from lotus stalk during the production of activated carbon 3 3 continuous adsorption of pome final discharge pome final discharge requires additional treatment before discharge into the river due to high cod level up to 4192 mg l 1 high bod level of about to 294 mg l 1 tss reading of 2289 mg l 1 and 14539 admi for colour table 2 the high concentration for colour retain in pome final discharge is might be due to the presence of total suspended solids and dissolved particles in pome final discharge other than that polyphenol compounds lignin melanoidin tannin and polyalcohol compounds also contribute to colour concern in pome final discharge that might be derived from sterilization process and anaerobic treatments in wastewater treatment plant 20 the ph of pome final discharge showed slightly alkaline however high ph 9 0 will harmfully affect aquatic biota in the river if discharged without prior treatment therefore it is important for palm oil millers that treated pome final discharge fulfil the stringent effluent environmental regulations by doe malaysia with the bod set value must below than 20 mg l 1 tss below than 200 mg l 1 and colour below than 100 admi 3 4 effect of flow rate the flow rate of pome final discharge is an important parameter for continuous adsorption study the concentration of bod cod and tss are significantly affected by the flow rate of pome final discharge as shown in fig 3 the concentration of pollutants bod cod and tss increases with the increase of flow rate from 30 to 70 ml min 1 for the optimum dosage of ac opks at 0 04 kg l 1 at optimum treatment duration of 10 h and flow rate of 50 ml min 1 the concentration of bod cod and tss are 19 05 mg l 1 302 mg l 1 and 118 mg l 1 respectively the high concentration of pollutants at a higher flow rate is might be due to the small surface area of ac opks which causes low adsorption capacity 25 3 5 effect of ac opks loading the removal performance of pollutants and colour at a different dosage of ac opks with an optimum flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and treatment duration at 10 h are shown in fig 4 the removal performance of pollutants and colour achieved up to 90 and above the percentage removal of pollutants increasing with the increase of dosage however starts to decrease after 0 04 kg l 1 at 0 04 kg l 1 the percentage removal of bod cod tss and colour are 93 52 92 79 94 84 and 89 21 respectively the adsorption rate of pollutants adsorbed on ac opks was dramatically affected by the amounts of bioadsorbent according to 26 the long residence time is needed for adsorption onto the surface area of activated carbon by increasing treatment time however adsorption sites will reach at equilibrium stage due to pores were filled with adsorbate molecules and adsorption sites started to be saturated 5 27 28 3 6 elemental compositional of ac opks before and after treatment the elemental compositions produced from pome final discharge treated with ac opks before and after treatment at optimum conditions are shown and summarized in table 3 the result shows that major elements presented in bioadsorbent for nitrogen and oxygen increased to 13 9 and 35 1 respectively meanwhile trace elements magnesium aluminium silicon sulphur chlorine phosphorus potassium calcium and ferrum also increased in activated carbon after used for the treatment of pome final discharge this finding also supported by the other study through the treatment of sludge using activated carbon with the major elements are carbon and oxygen that helps to the formation of micro flocs during coagulation and flocculation process 29 therefore from this result it can be suggested that the spent activated carbon can be applied as an organic fertilizer for vegetative and plants growth due to the present high amount of nitrogen phosphorus potassium and oxygen 3 7 comparison study in comparison with batch adsorption system the continuous adsorption system for pome final discharge treatment showed a significant improvement on the percentage removal for all types of pollutants bod cod and tss except for colour table 4 based on a previous finding by 13 the bod 120 mg l 1 tss 240 mg l 1 and colour 3700 admi were reduced significantly and all the values were below the stringent doe regulatory act however for this study colour concentration value was significantly high and above the permitted level even though it was 89 21 removed from its original concentration this situation might be due to the high initial colour concentration of raw pome final discharge of 14 539 admi as compared to 3700 admi in previous work the high initial colour of raw pome final discharge in this study is high due to plant constituents such as lignin and phenolic compounds and the concentration might be differing each day for each processing treatment meanwhile the bod and tss concentration was successfully been removed to 19 10 mg l 1 and 118 mg l 1 respectively which is below the standard discharge limit by doe overall the concentration of pollutants for batch adsorption and continuous adsorption meet the standard limit as required however the advantage of using continuous adsorption system is the pome final discharge was continuously run in a column for several hours and the samples can be collected at a regular interval time which can implementation of integrated system operation in real wastewater treatment plant 4 conclusion from the column adsorption studies that had been conducted the column optimum condition parameters were identified and can be used for the design of commercial large scale adsorption column treatment system therefore this study shows that continuous adsorption system using ac opks with bioadsorbent dosage of 0 04 kg l 1 the flow rate of 50 ml min 1 and treatment duration 10 h is capable to treat the pome final discharge that meets the stringent effluent environmental regulations by doe discharge limits continuous adsorption system had improved the pollutants bod cod tss and colour removal by 83 68 90 and 97 to 94 93 and 95 respectively except for colour removal of 89 21 even though ac opks had a high ability for the pollutants removal however the spent ac opks will pose an environmental issue on a waste management challenge therefore the spent activated carbon can be reactivated or use as an organic fertilizer towards the vegetative plants as it contains beneficial enrich nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium from the adsorption of pome final discharge declaration of competing interest authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgements we would like to thank the director general of mpob for

13949,the objective of this work was to optimize the conditions of dairy effluent treatment by dissolved air flotation daf at the chemically assisted primary treatment level using the combined polyacrylamide pam and tanfloc coagulants for this the effect of coagulant dosing and ph on the effluent turbidity removal was studied using a central composite rotatable design ccrd synthetic wastewater was used in the optimization phase and after optimization the system was used to treat real dairy wastewater in order to determine the pollutant removal efficiency coagulation and flocculation tests were performed in jar test equipment and flotation in a flotastest whose operating conditions were optimized the results were excellent with respect to turbidity obtaining removal efficiency above 90 for most treatments the regression model obtained was quadratic and significant at 5 probability whose r² was 97 41 the model has been validated and can be used for predictive purposes the optimum point for turbidity removal was with 758 3 mg l 1 of pam combined with 205 4 mg l 1 of tanfloc at ph 7 6 expressive reductions in solids organic matter nutrients oils and greases were achieved when the system was employed for treatment of real dairy wastewater keywords daf central composite rotatable design polyacrylamide tanfloc turbidity 1 introduction dairy industries consume a high volume of water for a variety of purposes including milk processing units cleaning structures and sanitizing and disinfecting structures on average 2 5 l of water are spent for each liter of processed milk 1 2 dairy wastewater is characterized by high biochemical oxygen demand bod chemical oxygen demand cod high dissolved solids suspended solids oils greases and nutrients such as ammonia or minerals and phosphates which require adequate attention before discharge to the environment 3 4 among the methods used to treat dairy wastewater most are based on physicochemical or biological principles biological methods require large area long treatment time and low efficiency when applied as a single treatment system on the other hand physicochemical methods such as dissolved air flotation daf have been a promising technology that has gained prominence and has been applied as a chemically enhanced primary treatment cept in countless wastewater treatment industries cept is a technology that uses coagulants to enhance the removal of pollutants in the primary phase of treatment the addition of coagulants in the process aims to assist the flocculation of colloidal particles present in the medium so that they are removed by sedimentation or flotation however the use of chemical coagulants in the process generates secondary pollution due to sludge produced in large volumes that contains toxic substances this becomes an environmental liability 5 and causes companies to invest even more in technologies for the treatment and disposal of this sludge increasing operating costs 6 7 several organic and plant based coagulants have been tested in the treatment of water and wastewater in place of chemical coagulants 8 9 10 11 polyacrylamide pam is an acrylamide derived flocculant polymer widely used as a coagulant due to its high molecular weight water solubility and low cost 12 13 ahmad et al 14 proved that the addition of pam improved coagulation performance using aluminum polychloride apc in wastewater treatment aguilar et al 15 observed that coagulation efficiency and flocs settling rate when using ferric sulfate aluminum sulfate and apc coagulants can be improved by the addition of anionic polyacrylamide apam and the required amount of coagulants can also be reduced by the addition of apam plant tannin based coagulants have also been widely used in water and wastewater treatment systems tanfloc sg tanac is a tannin based product modified by physicochemical process and has great potential as a flocculant 16 its use has become attractive due to the advantages presented by natural coagulants such as little sludge generated lower concentration of heavy metals in sludge and water alkalinity not being consumed during treatment in addition to being organic and biodegradable however little is known about coagulation flocculation efficiency when using tanfloc associated with pam in the treatment of dairy wastewater considering this and the available technologies there is a need to achieve greater efficiency in the wastewater treatment process at a lower cost and in a sustainable manner thus the present work aims to evaluate the performance of tanfloc associated with pam in the treatment of dairy wastewater by dissolved air flotation through the planning of experiments in a central composite rotatable design ccrd 2 material and methods the experiment was conducted both at the agricultural product pre processing and storage sector and at the environmental quality laboratory of the department of agricultural engineering federal university of viçosa ufv located in viçosa brazil all analyses performed followed methods available in american public health association et al 17 2 1 wastewater materials the experiment used synthetic dairy wastewater sdw as suggested by silva et al 18 according to the authors this formulation satisfactorily characterizes a synthetic effluent which does not contain whey from cheese making table 1 presents the average composition of the synthetic effluent used in the experiment a sample of real wastewater was obtained from the monte celeste dairy factory viçosa mg brazil whose characteristics are presented in table 2 and it was also used for the final evaluation of the treatment efficiency of the proposed system 2 2 coagulation flocculation in each assay a volume of 2 l of sdw sample was used and placed in a 2 l beaker the samples were agitated in a jar test apparatus at 320 rpm g 220 s 1 for solubilization of the products and coagulation destabilization of the particles in each assay the cationic pam and tanfloc pop coagulants were added the ph of the samples was adjusted after dosing and complete dissolution of the coagulants using a ph meter and with the addition of 1 1 v v either naoh or hcl solutions after adjusting the ph a reduced flocculation was performed by stirring the sdw for 5 min at 120 rpm g 80 s 1 for the formation of microflocs which according to richter 19 and edzwald 20 are suitable for high particle removal efficiency in the process after flocculation the samples were transferred to the flotation column slowly along the flotation wall so that the flocs formed did not break then the flotation tests were performed 2 3 flotation process and system used the operating conditions of the flotation system are presented in table 3 the fixed parameters were adopted according to the recommendation of edzwald 20 and based on preliminary tests the flotation process was performed in the same way for all tests air was injected through the lower inlet and dissolved in potable water under pressure in the saturation chamber until it reached the pressure of 10 bar being adjusted by the pressure regulating valve after reaching the pressure inside the saturation chamber the air injection was maintained for 2 min for water saturation afterwards the piping valve connecting the saturation chamber to the flotation column was opened injecting supersaturated air water into the flotation column to maintain the pressure set in the saturation chamber during valve opening air was injected through the upper opening of the saturation chamber to compensate for pressure drop because of water exiting the chamber a maximum pressure drop of 2 bar was achieved during the entire flotation column water release process the system inlet flow rate was adjusted to 5 l min 1 and the flotation rate in the flotation column was set to 10 0 1 cm min 1 using both needle valves after injection of the water volume corresponding to the pre established recirculation ratio 20 the chamber water outlet valve was closed sealing the water and gas injection in the flotation column then 5 min after the start of the flotation 500 ml of samples were collected from the lower portion of the flotation column in each run 2 4 experimental planning the central composite rotatable design ccrd was used to determine the best ph value and the best coagulant doses thus determining the best treatment by the surface response method thus an experimental design was organized in 3 blocks with 23 factorial points 2 3 axial points 6 repetitions in the central point and an α 1 633 totaling 20 trials table 4 presents the factors and levels used in the planning in this stage residual turbidity was the response variable chosen to obtain the optimal treatment this is because it can be quickly analyzed and mainly because it presents good representation of the flotation process behavior residual turbidity was measured using the thermo scientific orion ao3010 portable turbidity meter at the end of each flotation test the residual turbidity value was corrected by a correction factor of 1 2 corresponding to the recirculation ratio 20 due to the dilution of the sample by water injection into the flotation column the statistical planning of the ccrd the results analysis and the generation of the prediction model and graphs were made using tools from minitab 17 software the optimal response was determined using the response optimizer tool which determines the combination of values of each model prediction factor to generate the best response adopting a residual turbidity value of 0 ntu in the next step the obtained model was validated this was also done using the synthetic effluents through 3 tests at the determined optimum point the measured and estimated residual turbidity values of the model were compared with the parameters generated by the statistical program after response optimization confidence interval and model prediction interval at a significance level of 5 at the end of the study the best condition obtained was applied to the treatment of real wastewater collected from the monte celeste dairy factory to evaluate the system efficiency applying the optimal treatment previously determined the following parameters were analyzed residual turbidity cod bod color o g tss tn and tp for statistical analysis of the results the minitab 17 minitab 33 computer application was used for generation of the predictive model response optimization and graph construction 3 results and discussion 3 1 results obtained in experimental runs the residual turbidity results as well as the removal efficiencies are presented in table 5 based on the results turbidity removal efficiency was above 90 for most of the applied treatments lower efficiency was observed when 600 mg l 1 of pam and 100 mg l 1 tanfloc at ph 5 00 was used where the residual turbidity observed was 157 2 ntu removal efficiency 74 8 the decrease in turbidity removal efficiency can be explained by the increased dosage of both coagulants in the process which contributed to the increase in concentration of suspended solids in the medium similar results were observed by hameed et al 11 using tanfloc to treat municipal wastewater according to the authors the increase in coagulant dosage from a given dose 35 mg l 1 has no significant effect on the removal of water turbidity on the contrary it shows a decrease in turbidity removal efficiency especially in waters with low initial turbidity value similarly ma et al 21 observed that over dosing of pam prevents floc growth reducing sedimentation efficiency however it can be observed that at ph 7 00 the dosage of 600 mg l 1 of pam and 100 mg l 1 tanfloc removed 90 5 of turbidity and the observed residual turbidity was only 59 2 ntu this result justifies the influence of ph which was significant at 5 significance 3 2 analysis of variance the total variation of the turbidity dependent variable to the regression and residue model anova is presented in table 6 the quadratic regression shows that the model was significant p 0 05 since the calculated f value equal to 47 91 ms ss was greater than the value of f critical f0 05 9 10 3 02 in addition box et al 22 explains that for a regression to be not only significant but also useful for predictive purposes the fvalue fcritical ratio must be greater than three a condition that was met by the model it can also be observed that the model lack of fit was not significant p 0 05 since the f value for the misadjustment ms lack of fit ms pure error was less than the f critical f0 05 7 3 8 89 which is desirable in obtaining a regression model the p value p 0 001 of the model shows that the second order polynomial model fit well with the experimental data this is because when this value is lower the model fit is better the values of the coefficients of determination which measure the fit of the model to the observed data are presented in table 7 the standard deviation sd of the distance between the data values and the adjusted values was 7 45 ntu table 7 such a measurement represents how far the turbidity data values fall from the values adjusted by the model a lower value of s suggests better description of the response by the model therefore a good result was obtained regarding this parameter the value of the coefficient of determination r² 0 9784 indicates that only 2 16 of the total variation cannot be explained by the empirical model this is good because more variation that is explained by the model results in data points that are closer to the fitted regression line according to olmez 23 a larger r² suggests a better model and lesser error and models with r² values greater than 0 80 are more reliable for predictive purposes once the model has been adjusted the value of the adjusted coefficient of determination adjusted r² should be considered this value it is the percentage of variation in response that is explained by the model and is adjusted for the number of model predictors relative to the number of observations thus 95 89 variation in response can be explained by the adjusted model on the other hand the predicted r² should be used to predict answers for new observations in this study the value was high 90 92 and thus the model has a high predictive capacity predicted r2 may be more useful than adjusted r2 for model comparison because it is calculated from observations that are not included in model calculation minitab 17 the difference between r² and predicted r² must be less than 0 2 for the model to be reliable this relationship was met by the proposed model indicating the absence of over adjustment and therefore it is useful for predictive purposes 3 3 mathematical model contour plots and response surface the mathematical model obtained to represent the residual turbidity as a function of the ph values and coagulant doses with their respective coefficients is presented in eq 1 1 tresidual 272 7 113 1 ph 0 9865 pam 0 179 tanfloc 12 3 ph2 0 000288 tanfloc2 0 1424 ph pam 0 000151 pam tanfloc from this mathematical model contour and response surface graphs were generated for the turbidity response variable shown in fig 1 these analyses kept one variable at the central point and the other two varying within the range studied through the graphs obtained it is possible to confirm the significant interaction of the factors studied fig 1 shows that the maximum and minimum points are within the experimental region thus the contour plot shows hyperbolic characteristic fig 1a in contrast when the pam dosage was fixed at the midpoint and tanfloc doses varied the contour plot exhibited a circle fig 1b according to nair et al 24 the hyperbolic characteristic presents a saddle point that is an inflection point between a relative maximum and a relative minimum and is neither a minimum point nor a maximum point the contour plot of tanfloc dosage in relation to ph shows that the ideal conditions for turbidity removal were located in the region where the tanfloc dose ranged from 250 to 550 mg l 1 and ph from 5 8 to 7 2 maintaining pam dosage at 350 mg l 1 fig 1a the process of coagulation of colloidal particles occurred through charge neutralization adsorption and bridging since the coagulants employed are organic polymers thus chemical bridges are formed when the colloidal particles are adsorbed on the surface of the various polymer chains 25 according to hameed et al 11 tanfloc is a tannin based coagulant which are polyphenolic compounds with high water solubility and molecular weight ranging from 500 to a few thousand daltons presenting cationic character thus the modified compound tanfloc has the same characteristics as pure tannin and other added features these new features give it numerous applications in the coagulation process through charge neutralization in turn pam exhibits flocculating action similar to conventional polymer flocculants by destabilizing and neutralizing negatively charged colloidal particle charges making them unstable it also presents coagulant action in various ph ranges 26 10 a fact that justifies the results found in this work rozeno et al 27 studied biodiesel industry effluent treatment with tannin as a coagulant associated with pam they observed that with a dosage of 860 mg l 1 of coagulant at ph 8 00 there was 92 removal of turbidity the removal mechanism being the same observed in this work was the formation of bridges adsorption and neutralization of charges ribeiro et al 28 used tannin 250 mg l 1 associated with pam 8 mg l 1 in the treatment of industrial laundry effluent and the authors observed that the application of pam associated tannin provided values close to 100 turbidity removal in acidic phs and near the neutral ph region as well as approximately 80 reduction in the basic range according to the same authors the tannin coagulation process in this dosing range is explained by the sweep mechanism for this interactions occur in greater quantity and involve all particles in the effluent suspension and participate in the system minimizing turbidity in the medium as also observed in this work 3 4 optimization and validation of the mathematical model response surfaces can be analyzed for maximum or minimum responses and corresponding optimum conditions with multiple responses optimal conditions can be met when all parameters meet the desirable criteria 24 when there are more than three independent variables montgomery 29 mentions that it becomes more difficult to find the conditions that satisfy all the answers simultaneously thus multicriteria methodologies can be followed in this work the optimized condition was defined using the response optimizer from the minitab software in order to minimize the residual turbidity this resulted in obtaining the following point pam dose of 758 3 mg l 1 with tanfloc dose of 205 4 mg l 1 at ph 7 6 at this point the model was validated to confirm the validity of the mathematical model additional tests with three repetitions were performed at the optimal point for confirmation the results are presented in table 8 the average residual turbidity obtained in the experimental tests was 62 0 ntu in contrast the model estimated that under this condition the effluent after treatment would be free of turbidity expressed by the value of predicted residual turbidity of 0 0 ntu on other hand the results are according to ci and pi predicted ranges using the mathematical model eq 1 to foresee the residual turbidity at the optimized ph value of 7 6 pam value of 758 3 mg l 1 and tanfloc concentration of zero a tresidual of 50 4 ntu and an efficiency of 91 9 are predicted on other hand testing pam concentration equal to zero at ph 7 6 and tanfloc concentration of 212 3 mg l 1 a tresidual of 98 0 ntu and an efficiency of 84 3 are predicted comparing this results with the values in table 5 it can be seen that at ph of 7 6 the tanfloc added isolated and with an lower dose compared to the pam can reach treatment efficiency above 90 indicating that depending on the desirable efficiency required for the treatment the tanfloc is more indicated due to less sludge generation and potential reduction on treatment costs of the dairy wastewater transport and sludge disposal 3 5 system application in real wastewater treatment after obtaining the best conditions and validating the model obtained real raw wastewater was collected from the monte celeste dairy factory whose initial characteristics are shown in table 2 the results obtained from the treatment are shown in table 9 excellent results were observed when the treatment was applied to the real raw dairy effluent presenting expressive reductions in solids organic matter and nutrients ayeche 30 treated dairy effluent with an alternative coagulant obtained from the residue from acetylene production and the authors reported reductions in cod bod turbidity tss and tp by 49 54 92 93 and 83 with a coagulant dose equal to 4000 mg l 1 at alkaline ph 7 11 only tp removal found by this author was above the removal efficiency observed in this study but it is noteworthy that the dosage used in this study was well below that used by ayeche 30 mansoorian et al 31 reported maximum removal efficiency of cod bod nh3 nh4 dissolved and suspended phosphorus so4 2 and tss at 90 46 81 72 73 22 69 43 31 18 72 45 39 43 and 70 17 respectively in the treatment of dairy effluents with microbial fuel cells according to taufer et al 32 the treatment of dairy effluent as an industrial effluent is difficult to maintain consistent and achieve a homogeneous result of contaminant removal because of the large variation in pollutant loads the use of coagulants pam and tanfloc in the dissolved air flotation for the treatment dairy wastewater showed promising results due the high efficiencies obtained when used combined or isolated other advantage is that the sludge generated during the treatment process can be used as an fertilizer in agriculture after proper treatment 4 conclusion the use of tanfloc associated with polyacrylamide has shown great potential to be used in the treatment of dairy wastewater by cept with dissolved air flotation the central composite rotatable design was efficient in modeling the responses of the wastewater treatment process demonstrating the significant effect of the independent variables studied on the turbidity removal response variable the optimal treatment point was obtained with pam dosage of 758 3 mg l 1 and tanfloc dosage of 212 3 mg l 1 at ph 7 6 declaration of

tanfloc dose ranged from 250 to 550 mg l 1 and ph from 5 8 to 7 2 maintaining pam dosage at 350 mg l 1 fig 1a the process of coagulation of colloidal particles occurred through charge neutralization adsorption and bridging since the coagulants employed are organic polymers thus chemical bridges are formed when the colloidal particles are adsorbed on the surface of the various polymer chains 25 according to hameed et al 11 tanfloc is a tannin based coagulant which are polyphenolic compounds with high water solubility and molecular weight ranging from 500 to a few thousand daltons presenting cationic character thus the modified compound tanfloc has the same characteristics as pure tannin and other added features these new features give it numerous applications in the coagulation process through charge neutralization in turn pam exhibits flocculating action similar to conventional polymer flocculants by destabilizing and neutralizing negatively charged colloidal particle charges making them unstable it also presents coagulant action in various ph ranges 26 10 a fact that justifies the results found in this work rozeno et al 27 studied biodiesel industry effluent treatment with tannin as a coagulant associated with pam they observed that with a dosage of 860 mg l 1 of coagulant at ph 8 00 there was 92 removal of turbidity the removal mechanism being the same observed in this work was the formation of bridges adsorption and neutralization of charges ribeiro et al 28 used tannin 250 mg l 1 associated with pam 8 mg l 1 in the treatment of industrial laundry effluent and the authors observed that the application of pam associated tannin provided values close to 100 turbidity removal in acidic phs and near the neutral ph region as well as approximately 80 reduction in the basic range according to the same authors the tannin coagulation process in this dosing range is explained by the sweep mechanism for this interactions occur in greater quantity and involve all particles in the effluent suspension and participate in the system minimizing turbidity in the medium as also observed in this work 3 4 optimization and validation of the mathematical model response surfaces can be analyzed for maximum or minimum responses and corresponding optimum conditions with multiple responses optimal conditions can be met when all parameters meet the desirable criteria 24 when there are more than three independent variables montgomery 29 mentions that it becomes more difficult to find the conditions that satisfy all the answers simultaneously thus multicriteria methodologies can be followed in this work the optimized condition was defined using the response optimizer from the minitab software in order to minimize the residual turbidity this resulted in obtaining the following point pam dose of 758 3 mg l 1 with tanfloc dose of 205 4 mg l 1 at ph 7 6 at this point the model was validated to confirm the validity of the mathematical model additional tests with three repetitions were performed at the optimal point for confirmation the results are presented in table 8 the average residual turbidity obtained in the experimental tests was 62 0 ntu in contrast the model estimated that under this condition the effluent after treatment would be free of turbidity expressed by the value of predicted residual turbidity of 0 0 ntu on other hand the results are according to ci and pi predicted ranges using the mathematical model eq 1 to foresee the residual turbidity at the optimized ph value of 7 6 pam value of 758 3 mg l 1 and tanfloc concentration of zero a tresidual of 50 4 ntu and an efficiency of 91 9 are predicted on other hand testing pam concentration equal to zero at ph 7 6 and tanfloc concentration of 212 3 mg l 1 a tresidual of 98 0 ntu and an efficiency of 84 3 are predicted comparing this results with the values in table 5 it can be seen that at ph of 7 6 the tanfloc added isolated and with an lower dose compared to the pam can reach treatment efficiency above 90 indicating that depending on the desirable efficiency required for the treatment the tanfloc is more indicated due to less sludge generation and potential reduction on treatment costs of the dairy wastewater transport and sludge disposal 3 5 system application in real wastewater treatment after obtaining the best conditions and validating the model obtained real raw wastewater was collected from the monte celeste dairy factory whose initial characteristics are shown in table 2 the results obtained from the treatment are shown in table 9 excellent results were observed when the treatment was applied to the real raw dairy effluent presenting expressive reductions in solids organic matter and nutrients ayeche 30 treated dairy effluent with an alternative coagulant obtained from the residue from acetylene production and the authors reported reductions in cod bod turbidity tss and tp by 49 54 92 93 and 83 with a coagulant dose equal to 4000 mg l 1 at alkaline ph 7 11 only tp removal found by this author was above the removal efficiency observed in this study but it is noteworthy that the dosage used in this study was well below that used by ayeche 30 mansoorian et al 31 reported maximum removal efficiency of cod bod nh3 nh4 dissolved and suspended phosphorus so4 2 and tss at 90 46 81 72 73 22 69 43 31 18 72 45 39 43 and 70 17 respectively in the treatment of dairy effluents with microbial fuel cells according to taufer et al 32 the treatment of dairy effluent as an industrial effluent is difficult to maintain consistent and achieve a homogeneous result of contaminant removal because of the large variation in pollutant loads the use of coagulants pam and tanfloc in the dissolved air flotation for the treatment dairy wastewater showed promising results due the high efficiencies obtained when used combined or isolated other advantage is that the sludge generated during the treatment process can be used as an fertilizer in agriculture after proper treatment 4 conclusion the use of tanfloc associated with polyacrylamide has shown great potential to be used in the treatment of dairy wastewater by cept with dissolved air flotation the central composite rotatable design was efficient in modeling the responses of the wastewater treatment process demonstrating the significant effect of the independent variables studied on the turbidity removal response variable the optimal treatment point was obtained with pam dosage of 758 3 mg l 1 and tanfloc dosage of 212 3 mg l 1 at ph 7 6 declaration of
