7235,in this study a new approach is developed to simulate groundwater flow through both an overlying unconfined aquifer and an underlying discrete fracture network the groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network including magnitude and direction is explicitly simulated based on the mass conservation which depends on a variety of parameters related to flow and network characteristics in the overlying unconfined aquifer we approximate the flow using the dupuit assumptions in the underlying fracture network we use the cubic law and forchheimer s law to iteratively simulate laminar or turbulent flow in individual fractures depending on the reynolds number explicitly separating laminar and turbulent flows in the fractures results in a system of nonlinear equations which is iteratively solved while the flow from the overlying unconfined aquifer is a small portion of the overall flow in the underlying fracture network incorrect use of the laminar or turbulent flow equation in the fractures can lead to significant errors in simulating the flow exchange as apertures increase both the portion of the total flowrate in the aquifer and the portion of the flow in the fractures coming from the aquifer decrease as the overall hydraulic gradient increases both the portion of the total flow in the aquifer and the portion of the fracture flow that comes from the aquifer increase the portion of the total flow in the aquifer increases with the aquifer thickness while the portion of fracture flow coming from the overlying aquifer decreases keywords

total flowrates through fractures were proportional to apertures to the fifth power by considering the square root relationship of displacement to length scaling and the traditional cubic law they then explored this relationship by examining a suite of flow simulations through dfns meyer and bazen 2011 presented a mathematical formulation for analyzing multi stage multi cluster transverse dfns

to simulate groundwater flows in the fractures brush and thomson 2003 when the flow is turbulent forchheimer s law is often applied to describe groundwater flow behaviors chen et al 2001 one major limitation of the previous approaches in simulating groundwater flows in dfns lies in the assumption that flow within the whole fracture network is either laminar or turbulent there have been numerous studies of groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers serrano 1995 liang and zhang 2012 mahdavi and seyyedian 2014 chang et al 2016 and stream water and groundwater interactions workman et al 1997 moench and barlow 2000 barlow et al 2000 hattermann et al 2004 chen and chen 2003 ameli and craig 2014 saeedpanah and azar 2017 serrano 1995 presented an analytical solution of the nonlinear boussinesq flow

stream and aquifer the storage of the infiltrated stream water in the surrounding aquifer and the storage zone where groundwater is replaced by the stream water during a flood ameli and craig 2014 developed a semi analytical series solution for modeling steady state free boundary groundwater surface water exchange in complex stratified aquifers the appropriateness of the dupuit forchheimer approximation for simulating flux distribution was investigated which illustrated the solution s efficacy for simulating physically realistic domains recently saeedpanah and azar 2017 presented an analytical solution to examine interactions between streams with varying water levels and an aquifer using laplace and fourier transform methods in summary many previous studies have dealt with groundwater flows in dfns in unconfined aquifers and interactions between aquifers and streams however few studies have investigated the exchange between a dfn and an overlying unconfined aquifer depending on the behaviors of the fracture network and aquifer groundwater may flow from the aquifer to the fracture network or vice versa as shown in fig 1 a in this study we develop a new approach to determine steady state groundwater flows in a fracture network and an overlying unconfined aquifer and their exchange the main objectives of this study are three fold first we develop a new approach to simulate groundwater flow through both the overlying unconfined aquifer and the dfn the groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network is simulated explicitly second we investigate the factors affecting the groundwater exchange between the overlying unconfined aquifer and the fracture network finally we examine the potential errors of using only the cubic law approach or the forchheimer s law approach in the whole fracture network in modeling groundwater exchange in the overlying unconfined aquifer we approximate groundwater flow based on the dupuit assumptions in the fracture network we use the cubic law and the forchheimer s law to respectively simulate laminar flow and turbulent flow in individual fractures depending on the reynolds number explicitly separating laminar and turbulent flows in the fractures results in a system of nonlinear and linear equations which is then solved by iteration the exchange between the fracture network and the aquifer is taken into account based on mass conservation the exchange including magnitude and direction depends on a variety of parameters such as aperture hydraulic gradient and aquifer hydraulic conductivity 2 methodology to demonstrate the method a fracture network and unconfined aquifer configuration shown in fig 1 b is used however the general approach can be used for any type of fracture network and aquifer configurations the main flow direction is from left to right through the imposed higher hydraulic head condition on the left between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network the groundwater may flow down from the aquifer to the fracture network or up from the fracture network to the aquifer in this study the rock matrix in the fracture network is assumed to be impermeable for each fracture and each segment in the unconfined aquifer we can write one flow equation for the domain shown in fig 1 b the hydraulic heads at the inlets and at the outlets for both the unconfined aquifer and fracture network are given as the constant head i e dirichlet conditions which represent steady state flows under hydrostatic conditions on both upstream and downstream boundaries the hydraulic head values at the internal nodes are unknowns among them the hydraulic heads at the nodes in the interface between the aquifer and the fracture network are approximately equal to the saturated aquifer thicknesses as shown in fig 1 b based on the continuity requirements at each internal node we can establish mass conservation equations based on the dupuit assumptions in the unconfined aquifer the cubic law or the forchheimer s law in the fracture network because these equations are nonlinear we solve them iteratively by the newton raphson method the continuity equations at node i j 1 and node i j are presented as an example to illustrate the method if the flow directions are as indicated the continuity equation for node i j 1 is 1 q i 1 j 1 i j 1 q i j 1 i 1 j 1 q i j 1 i j 0 similarly for node i j the continuity equation can be written as 2 q i j 1 i j q i 1 j i j q i j i 1 j q i j i j 1 0 where the positive sign denotes the groundwater flow toward node i j 1 or node i j while the negative sign denotes that away from node i j 1 or node i j the actual flow direction in each fracture needs to be determined as part of the iterative procedure the discrete fracture model where groundwater flows only occur in the fractures is used for computing the flow through the fractures and the dupuit equation is used to describe the steady state flow in the unconfined aquifer the following equation can be developed based on the continuity requirement at node i j 1 3 k t i 1 j 1 2 t i j 1 2 2 δ l i 1 j 1 i j 1 k t i j 1 2 t i 1 j 1 2 2 δ l i j 1 i 1 j 1 ρ gb i j 1 i j 3 h 12 μ h i j 1 h i j δ l i j 1 i j 0 where k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer t l is the aquifer thickness at the subscripted node i e the water table depth for the node linking the aquifer and the fracture network figure 1b δl l is the distance between the two subscripted nodes ρ m l 3 is the density of water g l t 2 is the gravitational acceleration μ m l 1 t 1 is the dynamic viscosity of water b l is the aperture of the fracture between the two subscripted nodes with width h l the cubic law is only applied to describe flow in the fractures under laminar conditions when the reynolds number defined as re 2 bρv μ is smaller than the critical reynolds number in defined re v l t 1 is the mean velocity in the fracture in developing eq 3 above we have used the widely used cubic law witherspoon et al 1980 konzuk and kueper 2004 klimczak et al 2010 for flows in the fractures which is reflected by the third term in eq 3 and the dupuit assumptions dupuit 1863 bear 2013 for flows in each segment of the overlying aquifer which is represented by the first two terms in eq 3 based on the continuity requirement one equation can be similarly developed for each of the internal nodes in the fracture network as the equations in the aquifer are always nonlinear in terms of the unknowns t i 1 j 1 t i j 1 and t i 1 j 1 the resulting system of equations is solved by newton raphson iteration if the flow in the fracture is turbulent we use forchheimer s law to determine flowrate q l3 t 1 in each fracture forchheimer 1901 zimmerman et al 2004 zhang and nemcik 2013 4 q μ k β ρ μ k β ρ 2 4 g δ h δ l β bh 2 where β l 1 is the inertial resistance coefficient k l2 is the permeability related to the fracture aperture we use k b2 12 and β 0 550 k in this study ward 1964 however it should be noted that any other empirical formulas of β in relation to the aperture can be implemented the flow equation for node i j 1 at the interface between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network can be written as 5 k t i 1 j 1 2 t i j 1 2 2 δ l i 1 j 1 i j 1 μ k β ρ μ k β ρ 2 4 g h i j h i j 1 δ l i j 1 i j β b i j 1 i j h 2 k t i j 1 2 t i 1 j 1 2 2 δ l i j 1 i 1 j 1 0 similarly equations for all the internal nodes in the network can be developed using forchheimer s law if the flows are turbulent while nonlinear equation for turbulent flow in the fracture is different from the one for laminar flow the system of nonlinear equations can be similarly solved by newton raphson iteration two main features in this study include the groundwater exchange component between the fracture network and the overlying unconfined aquifer and an approach to explicitly take into account the flow behavior in each fracture based on the reynolds number for the groundwater exchange component we explicitly determine the groundwater flowrate in each fracture that hydraulically connects the aquifer and fracture network for the flow behavior component we explicitly check the reynolds number and determine the equation to be used in each fracture for instance if the flows in the fractures from node i 1 j to node i j and from node i j 1 to node i j are turbulent but the flows in the other fractures are laminar the continuity equation for node i j is 6 μ k β ρ μ k β ρ 2 4 g h i j h i j 1 δ l i j 1 i j β b i j 1 i j h 2 μ k β ρ μ k β ρ 2 4 g h i j h i

for all nodes depending on the reynolds number in each fracture at each iteration the flow equations need to be updated based on the reynolds number for all individual fractures we first use initial guesses for the unknown hydraulic heads and saturated aquifer thicknesses in all flow equations for all nodes with unknown hydraulic heads and aquifer thicknesses the reynolds number is then calculated and used to determine whether flow is laminar or turbulent for all fractures by comparing it to the critical reynolds number iteration proceeds until the solutions meet all requirements for all nodes at the interface between the unconfined aquifer and fracture network and inside the fracture network our focus of the study is on the groundwater flow budget through the fracture network overlying aquifer and the exchange between the unconfined aquifer and fracture network we define the groundwater exchange flowrate qe as the sum of groundwater flowrates between the unconfined aquifer and fracture network for the segment in fig 1 b qe is equal to the sum of q i 1 j 1 i 1 j q i j 1 i j and q i 1 j 1 i 1 j in addition we also examine the potential errors of uniformly using either the cubic law or forchheimer s law in all fractures without explicitly taking into account the flow behaviors in them in doing so we quantify the percentage error of exchange flowrate as 100 qeu qen qen where qeu the exchange flowrate based on the uniform behavior assumption while qen is the exchange flowrate based on the new approach developed in this study that explicitly takes into account the actual flow behavior of each fracture based on the reynolds number 3 results and discussion since it is not possible to consider all potential cases of fracture and aquifer configurations and other factors that influence the flows in the fracture network and the overlying unconfined aquifer we present a few illustrative examples to demonstrate the developed new approach our main focus is on the water budget components in the fracture network and aquifer domain we examine the total flowrate in the entire domain the portion of the flowrate in the fracture network and the overlying aquifer and the percentage of the flow exchange between the overlying aquifer and the underlying fracture network in relation to the aquifer and fracture network characteristics in particular we investigate how the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying unconfined aquifer fracture aperture non uniformity overall hydraulic gradient over the entire domain and aquifer thickness may affect groundwater flow behaviors and partitioning in the domain we use two unconfined aquifer and fracture network configurations one with a regular network and the other with a relatively mild irregular network shown in fig 2 in the regular configuration in fig 2 a the fractures are placed in a rectangular domain with 100 nodes including 10 nodes at the interface between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network and 90 nodes inside the fracture network the irregular configuration in fig 2 b also includes 100 nodes with the nodes not being uniformly spaced note that the regular and irregular fracture networks have similar node configuration with the irregular one being slightly twisted the unconfined aquifer is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous it should be emphasized that although only two relatively simple aquifer and fracture network configurations are used to illustrate the main influences of fracture and aquifer properties on the groundwater flow budget and behaviors the new approach can be applied in any aquifer and fracture network configurations in calculating the results we use g 9 8 m s2 ρ 1000 kg m 3 and µ 0 0011 kg m s the critical reynolds number of 100 is used to distinguish turbulent flow from laminar flow in each individual fracture chen et al 2015 it should be noted however that the developed new approach is applicable to any critical reynolds number as the approach explicitly distinguishes flow behavior in each individual fracture since a higher critical reynolds number indicates a higher threshold for flow to change to turbulent flow it is expected that a higher critical reynolds number would reduce the errors from the uniform use of cubic law and increase the errors of using the forcheimer s law uniformly in fig 3 we plot the total flowrate through the domain including both the overlying unconfined aquifer and the fracture network in relation to the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer the unconfined aquifer and fracture network configurations are similar to those in fig 2 but the apertures of all fractures are uniform with the value of 0 001 m for fig 3 a and 0 003 m for fig 3 b the other parameters used in the calculations include the hydraulic heads at the inlet and outlet of 11 m and 10 m respectively the total domain length of 100 m which results in the overall hydraulic gradient over the domain of 0 01 the range of hydraulic conductivity used in illustrating the results is typical from clay to sand for unconfined aquifer materials freeze and cherry 1979 fetter 2001 with the small aperture for all fractures in fig 3 a the flow in each individual fracture is laminar the total flowrate calculated using the cubic law is the same as the new approach that explicitly takes into account flow behavior in each individual fracture although the cubic law can predict the total flowrate very well for both the regular and the irregular network configurations the flowrate in the irregular fracture network configuration is about 2 times that in the regular fracture network one the increase in the total groundwater flowrate for the irregular fracture network configuration is mainly due to the increase in the unconfined aquifer although the flowrate in the fracture network may decrease due to high resistance in the irregular fracture network the total flowrate increases with the hydraulic conductivity especially for large values for both the regular and irregular network configurations the forchheimer s law significantly under predict the total flowrate in the domain since the flows in the fractures are laminar when the aperture for all fractures increases to 0 003 m most of the flows become turbulent in the fractures as shown in fig 3 b the forchheimer s law then predicts almost the same with the new approach while the cubic law significantly over predicts the flowrate in this case the majority of groundwater flowrate occurs in the underlying fracture network increasing the unconfined aquifer hydraulic conductivity increases the flowrate in the aquifer however the increase is only a small portion of the total groundwater flowrate therefore the hydraulic conductivity does not significantly affect the total flowrate in fig 4 through fig 6 we show various groundwater balance components for the unconfined aquifer and fracture network configurations in fig 2 but the apertures of all fractures are uniform of 0 001 m for plot a and 0 003 m for plot b respectively the other parameters in fig 4 through fig 6 include the hydraulic heads at inlet and outlet of 11 m and 10 m respectively total domain length of 100 m and overall hydraulic gradient of 0 01 fig 4 shows the percentage of total flowrate that flows through the unconfined aquifer as a function of the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer when the aperture is small at 0 001 m the percent of the total flow through the unconfined aquifer is higher with the increase in k in fig 4 a compared to the larger aperture case in fig 4 b fig 5 plots the percentage of groundwater flowrate in the fracture network that comes from the overlying aquifer as a function of the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer when the aperture is smaller higher portion of groundwater flow in the fracture network is from the overlying unconfined aquifer as the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer increases more groundwater flows through the unconfined aquifer fig 4 and at the same time the flowrate to the underlying fracture network receives higher proportion of groundwater from the overlying aquifer fig 5 the results shown in fig 5 a demonstrate that for a small aperture fracture network the cubic law predicts almost the same flow exchange between the overlying aquifer and underlying fracture network as the new method which means that the groundwater flow in the fracture network is predominantly laminar on the other hand when the aperture becomes large the groundwater flow in the fracture network is mainly turbulent and the forchheimer s law predicts results very close to the new method as shown in fig 5 b to examine the potential errors of using uniform flow behavior assumption in all fractures in fig 6 we plot the relative percentage error of groundwater flow in the fractures coming from the unconfined aquifer as a function of the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer under the same conditions as those in fig 5 for the small aperture case the cubic law predicts almost zero errors for both the regular and irregular configurations while the forchheimer s law under predicts the groundwater flow exchange between the aquifer and fracture network by up to 20 at the high hydraulic conductivity case for the regular fracture network and up to 50 for the irregular fracture network as shown in fig 6 a from fig 6 b the cubic law may over estimate the groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network by almost 200 when the aperture of the fractures is large and flow becomes turbulent which highlights the importance of explicitly taking into account flow behavior in each individual fracture we can conclude that while the flow from the overlying aquifer is a small portion of the overall flow in the underlying fracture network since the fractures considered are relatively large the errors of incorrect use of the laminar or turbulent flow equations in the fractures can lead to significant errors in simulating the groundwater flow exchange between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network for the fracture network configurations in fig 2 we also include several large fractures i e the thick black lines in fig 2 to examine the effects of non uniform fracture size which could be the main dominant factor of potential co existence of laminar and turbulent flows in different fractures we use two main connected large fractures with one being connected to the unconfined aquifer and the other one being only inside the fracture network this configuration serves two purposes to examine 1 how the new approach distinguishes laminar flow and turbulent flow in the fracture network which usually occurs in large fractures and 2 how the large fractures connected to the unconfined aquifer may affect the groundwater flow exchange between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network fig 7 plots the simulation results of groundwater flow components as a function of the larger aperture in the network for the aquifer and fracture network configurations shown in fig 2 for the total flowrate in fig 7 a the percent of total groundwater flowrate through the unconfined aquifer in fig 7 b and the percent of groundwater flowrate in the fracture network coming from the overlying unconfined aquifer in fig 7 c the other parameters required for the simulations include the small aperture of 0 001 m the hydraulic conductivity k of 0 001 m s the hydraulic heads at inlet and outlet of 11 m and 10 m respectively and the total domain length of 100 m which results in the overall hydraulic gradient of 0 01 when all the fractures have the same aperture of 0 001 m the groundwater flows in all fractures are laminar when the aperture of large fractures shown in fig 2 increases to 0 002 m the groundwater flows in portion of the fractures start to become turbulent and the flowrate calculated using the new approach is in between those determined based on the cubic law and the forchheimer s law for both the regular and irregular configurations seen in fig 7 a when the aperture of the large fractures further increases the new approach produces results closer to the forchheimer s law in other words the forchheimer s law is more accurate in describing the actual state of flow behavior in the fracture network under such conditions the results shown in fig 7 b demonstrate that as the aperture of the large fractures increases the portion of the groundwater flow in the fracture network coming from the overlying aquifer decreases it is expected that the results of groundwater flow in the fracture network coming from the aquifer also move closer to those from the forchheimer s law since the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network are highly interacting from fig 7 c we can see that the irregularity in the fracture network configurations has influenced the exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network in particular the portion of the fracture network flow coming from the overlying aquifer does not necessarily follow a monotonic trend in relation to the fracture aperture seen in fig 7 c given the small percentages of groundwater flow exchange between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network the non monotonic trend seen in fig 7 c is due to the fracture network irregularity since this trend is only observed in the irregular network configurations in fig 8 we show the results of groundwater flow budget components as a function of the overall hydraulic gradient for the aquifer and fracture network configurations of fig 2 for the total flowrate fig 8 a the percent of total flowrate through the unconfined aquifer fig 8 b and the percent of flowrate in the fracture network coming from the aquifer fig 8 c other parameters include the small aperture of 0 001 m the large aperture of 0 004 m the hydraulic conductivity k of 0 001 m s and the hydraulic heads at inlet and outlet of 11 m and 10 m respectively as expected the total flowrate increases quickly with the overall hydraulic gradient seen in fig 8 a since the large aperture in the network is 4 times the small one the groundwater flowrate contribution is mainly dictated by the large fractures and the flow is mainly turbulent therefore the forchheimer s law simulates flow results close to the new approach while the cubic law significantly over predicts the total groundwater flowrates in the domain mainly due to its over estimation of flow in the large fractures the results plotted in fig 8 b illustrate that the portion of total groundwater flow through the unconfined aquifer also increases with the hydraulic gradient however the cubic law would predict a relatively constant percentage of the total flow as aquifer flow which means both the flows in the aquifer and in the fracture network would increase at the same pace in response to the increase in the hydraulic gradient which is consistent with the linear relationship assumption implied in the laminar flow equations as the hydraulic gradient increases the portion of groundwater flow in the fracture network that comes from the overlying aquifer also increases when the turbulent flow occurs in the network overall the laminar cubic law approach significantly under predicts the flow exchange between the aquifer and fracture network since it virtually simulates similar rate of flow increase in both the aquifer and fracture network in response to the increased hydraulic gradient in fig 9 we show the groundwater flow components as a function of the unconfined aquifer thickness for the fracture network and aquifer configurations of fig 2 when the small aperture is 0 001 m the large aperture is 0 004 m the aquifer hydraulic conductivity is 0 001 m s and the hydraulic gradient is 0 01 similar to previous figures we plot the total groundwater flowrate in fig 9 a the percent of total flowrate through the unconfined aquifer in fig 9 b and the percent of flowrate in the fracture network coming from the aquifer in fig 9 c as discussed earlier the groundwater flow in the fracture network is mainly dictated by the fractures with the large aperture where the flows are mainly turbulent in addition the majority of the total flow is through the fractures therefore in both the regular and irregular configurations the forchheimer s law predicts the total flowrate close to the results from the new approach and the cubic law approach significantly over predicts the total groundwater flowrate fig 9 a as expected the total flowrate increases with the increase in aquifer thickness however the extent of this increase is small since the majority of groundwater flow still occurs in the underlying fracture network while the increase in the total groundwater flow mainly results from the increase in the thickness of the unconfined aquifer which is due to the increase in the portion of the aquifer flow seen in fig 9 b in both the regular and irregular configurations the new approach predicts an aquifer flowrate between the values predicted by the cubic law and the forchheimer s law which means the flow behavior in the fracture network is a mixture of both laminar and turbulent flows due to the increase in aquifer thickness the unconfined aquifer can carry more flow and the portion of flow entering the underlying fracture network decreases with the increase in the aquifer thickness fig 9 c the results shown in fig 9 c also illustrate that the fracture network irregularity also affects the groundwater flow exchange between the aquifer and fracture network overall however only a small portion of groundwater flow in the fracture network is from the overlying aquifer 4 conclusions in this study a new approach was developed to improve the simulation of groundwater flow through a domain consisting of an unconfined aquifer overlying a discrete fracture network dfn the flow in the overlying unconfined aquifer was solved by using the dupuit assumptions flow in the fracture network was solved using an approach that distinguishes laminar and turbulent flows in individual fractures and by using the cubic law or forchheimer s law based on the local reynolds number the final state of flow was determined iteratively the exchange between the overlying unconfined aquifer and the fracture network was subject to mass conservation the impacts of various parameters such as aperture hydraulic gradient aquifer hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness on the groundwater flow were investigated using a few illustrative cases we also examine the potential errors assuming uniform flow of either laminar or turbulent flow in all fractures the main conclusions are the total groundwater flowrate and the relative portion of the total flowrate in the unconfined aquifer both increase with hydraulic conductivity especially when hydraulic conductivity is large but the extent of the increase also depends on the size of fractures in the fracture network as the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer increases more groundwater flows through the aquifer while the contribution of the flowrate to the underlying fracture network receives a high proportion of water from the overlying aquifer indiscriminately applying either the laminar or the turbulent flow equation in all fractures can lead to significant errors in simulating groundwater flow exchange between the unconfined aquifer and the underlying fracture network the extent of the potential errors of using them uniformly depends largely on the aperture of the fractures it is important to explicitly take into account flow behavior in the fractures to accurately determine the total groundwater flowrate and the other flow budget components in the aquifer and fracture network domain as fracture apertures increase both the portion of total flowrate in the unconfined aquifer and the portion of flow in the fractures coming from the unconfined aquifer decrease as the overall hydraulic gradient increases both the portion of the total flow in the unconfined aquifer and portion of the fracture flow that comes from the unconfined aquifer increase however if we assume laminar flow in the fractures these portions do not vary with the overall hydraulic gradient the portion of total flow in the unconfined aquifer increases with the unconfined aquifer thickness while the portion of the fracture flow that comes from the overlying aquifer decreases with the unconfined aquifer thickness in examining the effects of various important aquifer and fracture network properties we only use a couple of simple unconfined aquifer and fracture network configurations to single out important factors that may affect groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network and their potential exchange however the developed new approach that explicitly considers flows in both the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network can be applied to any two dimensional domain with an unconfined aquifer overlying a dfn acknowledgments this study was supported by the wyoming center for

then explored this relationship by examining a suite of flow simulations through dfns meyer and bazen 2011 presented a mathematical formulation for analyzing multi stage multi cluster transverse dfns

the combined effect of the network scale topology and fracture scale heterogeneities based on 2 million dfn simulations berrone et al 2014 developed a numerical method of simulating steady state fluid flow in dfns using enrichment functions optimization procedures and non conforming meshes by using a benchmark test problem of a hypothetical repository in fractured crystalline rock hadgu et al 2017

representing geomechanical response to stresses and hydraulic behaviors and examined the important factors influencing the quality of dfn representations when flow is laminar the cubic law can be used to simulate groundwater flows in the fractures brush and thomson 2003 when the flow is turbulent forchheimer s law is often applied to describe groundwater flow behaviors chen et al 2001 one major limitation of the previous approaches in simulating groundwater flows in dfns lies in the assumption that flow within the whole fracture network is either laminar or turbulent there have been numerous studies of groundwater flow in unconfined aquifers serrano 1995 liang and zhang 2012 mahdavi and seyyedian 2014 chang et al 2016 and stream water and groundwater interactions workman et al 1997 moench and barlow 2000 barlow et al 2000 hattermann et al 2004 chen and chen 2003 ameli and craig 2014 saeedpanah and azar 2017 serrano 1995 presented an analytical solution of the nonlinear boussinesq flow

variations in subbasins along with river flow at the regional scale which was able to stimulate daily groundwater levels and discharge chen and chen 2003 investigated the water exchange rate between a stream and aquifer the storage of the infiltrated stream water in the surrounding aquifer and the storage zone where groundwater is replaced by the stream water during a flood ameli and craig 2014 developed a semi analytical series solution for modeling steady state free boundary groundwater surface water exchange in complex stratified aquifers the appropriateness of the dupuit forchheimer approximation for simulating flux distribution was investigated which illustrated the solution s efficacy for simulating physically realistic domains recently saeedpanah and azar 2017 presented an analytical solution to examine interactions between streams with varying water levels and an aquifer using laplace and fourier transform methods in summary many previous studies have dealt with groundwater flows in dfns in unconfined aquifers and interactions between aquifers and streams however few studies have investigated the exchange between a dfn and an overlying unconfined aquifer depending on the behaviors of the fracture network and aquifer groundwater may flow from the aquifer to the fracture network or vice versa as shown in fig 1 a in this study we develop a new approach to determine steady state groundwater flows in a fracture network and an overlying unconfined aquifer and their exchange the main objectives of this study are three fold first we develop a new approach to simulate groundwater flow through both the overlying unconfined aquifer and the dfn the groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network is simulated explicitly second we investigate the factors affecting the groundwater exchange between the overlying unconfined aquifer and the fracture network finally we examine the potential errors of using only the cubic law approach or the forchheimer s law approach in the whole fracture network in modeling groundwater exchange in the overlying unconfined aquifer we approximate groundwater flow based on the dupuit assumptions in the fracture network we use the cubic law and the forchheimer s law to respectively simulate laminar flow and turbulent flow in individual fractures depending on the reynolds number explicitly separating laminar and turbulent flows in the fractures results in a system of nonlinear and linear equations which is then solved by iteration the exchange between the fracture network and the aquifer is taken into account based on mass conservation the exchange including magnitude and direction depends on a variety of parameters such as aperture hydraulic gradient and aquifer hydraulic conductivity 2 methodology to demonstrate the method a fracture network and unconfined aquifer configuration shown in fig 1 b is used however the general approach can be used for any type of fracture network and aquifer configurations the main flow direction is from left to right through the imposed higher hydraulic head condition on the left between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network the groundwater may flow down from the aquifer to the fracture network or up from the fracture network to the aquifer in this study the rock matrix in the fracture network is assumed to be impermeable for each fracture and each segment in the unconfined aquifer we can write one flow equation for the domain shown in fig 1 b the hydraulic heads at the inlets and at the outlets for both the unconfined aquifer and fracture network are given as the constant head i e dirichlet conditions which represent steady state flows under hydrostatic conditions on both upstream and downstream boundaries the hydraulic head values at the internal nodes are unknowns among them the hydraulic heads at the nodes in the interface between the aquifer and the fracture network are approximately equal to the saturated aquifer thicknesses as shown in fig 1 b based on the continuity requirements at each internal node we can establish mass conservation equations based on the dupuit assumptions in the unconfined aquifer the cubic law or the forchheimer s law in the fracture network because these equations are nonlinear we solve them iteratively by the newton raphson method the continuity equations at node i j 1 and node i j are presented as an example to illustrate the method if the flow directions are as indicated the continuity equation for node i j 1 is 1 q i 1 j 1 i j 1 q i j 1 i 1 j 1 q i j 1 i j 0 similarly for node i j the continuity equation can be written as 2 q i j 1 i j q i 1 j i j q i j i 1 j q i j i j 1 0 where the positive sign denotes the groundwater flow toward node i j 1 or node i j while the negative sign denotes that away from node i j 1 or node i j the actual flow direction in each fracture needs to be determined as part of the iterative procedure the discrete fracture model where groundwater flows only occur in the fractures is used for computing the flow through the fractures and the dupuit equation is used to describe the steady state flow in the unconfined aquifer the following equation can be developed based on the continuity requirement at node i j 1 3 k t i 1 j 1 2 t i j 1 2 2 δ l i 1 j 1 i j 1 k t i j 1 2 t i 1 j 1 2 2 δ l i j 1 i 1 j 1 ρ gb i j 1 i j 3 h 12 μ h i j 1 h i j δ l i j 1 i j 0 where k l t 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer t l is the aquifer thickness at the subscripted node i e the water table depth for the node linking the aquifer and the fracture network figure 1b δl l is the distance between the two subscripted nodes ρ m l 3 is the density of water g l t 2 is the gravitational acceleration μ m l 1 t 1 is the dynamic viscosity of water b l is the aperture of the fracture between the two subscripted nodes with width h l the cubic law is only applied to describe flow in the fractures under laminar conditions when the reynolds number defined as re 2 bρv μ is smaller than the critical reynolds number in defined re v l t 1 is the mean velocity in the fracture in developing eq 3 above we have used the widely used cubic law witherspoon et al 1980 konzuk and kueper 2004 klimczak et al 2010 for flows in the fractures which is reflected by the third term in eq 3 and the dupuit assumptions dupuit 1863 bear 2013 for flows in each segment of the overlying aquifer which is represented by the first two terms in eq 3 based on the continuity requirement one equation can be similarly developed for each of the internal nodes in the fracture network as the equations in the aquifer are always nonlinear in terms of the unknowns t i 1 j 1 t i j 1 and t i 1 j 1 the resulting system of equations is solved by newton raphson iteration if the flow in the fracture is turbulent we use forchheimer s law to determine flowrate q l3 t 1 in each fracture forchheimer 1901 zimmerman et al 2004 zhang and nemcik 2013 4 q μ k β ρ μ k β ρ 2 4 g δ h δ l β bh 2 where β l 1 is the inertial resistance coefficient k l2 is the permeability related to the fracture aperture we use k b2 12 and β 0 550 k in this study ward 1964 however it should be noted that any other empirical formulas of β in relation to the aperture can be implemented the flow equation for node i j 1 at the interface between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network can be written as 5 k t i 1 j 1 2 t i j 1 2 2 δ l i 1 j 1 i j 1 μ k β ρ μ k β ρ 2 4 g h i j h i j 1 δ l i j 1 i j β b i j 1 i j h 2 k t i j 1 2 t i 1 j 1 2 2 δ l i j 1 i 1 j 1 0 similarly equations for all the internal nodes in the network can be developed using forchheimer s law if the flows are turbulent while nonlinear equation for turbulent flow in the fracture is different from the one for laminar flow the system of nonlinear equations can be similarly solved by newton raphson iteration two main features in this study include the groundwater exchange component between the fracture network and the overlying unconfined aquifer and an approach to explicitly take into account the flow behavior in each fracture based on the reynolds number for the groundwater exchange component we explicitly determine the groundwater flowrate in each fracture that hydraulically connects the aquifer and fracture network for the flow behavior component we explicitly check the reynolds number and determine the equation to be used in each fracture for instance if the flows in the fractures from node i 1 j to node i j and from node i j 1 to node i j are turbulent but the flows in the other fractures are laminar the continuity equation for node i j is 6 μ k β ρ μ k β ρ 2 4 g h i j h i j 1 δ l i j 1 i j β b i j 1 i j h 2 μ k β ρ μ k β ρ 2 4 g h i j h i

for all nodes depending on the reynolds number in each fracture at each iteration the flow equations need to be updated based on the reynolds number for all individual fractures we first use initial guesses for the unknown hydraulic heads and saturated aquifer thicknesses in all flow equations for all nodes with unknown hydraulic heads and aquifer thicknesses the reynolds number is then calculated and used to determine whether flow is laminar or turbulent for all fractures by comparing it to the critical reynolds number iteration proceeds until the solutions meet all requirements for all nodes at the interface between the unconfined aquifer and fracture network and inside the fracture network our focus of the study is on the groundwater flow budget through the fracture network overlying aquifer and the exchange between the unconfined aquifer and fracture network we define the groundwater exchange flowrate qe as the sum of groundwater flowrates between the unconfined aquifer and fracture network for the segment in fig 1 b qe is equal to the sum of q i 1 j 1 i 1 j q i j 1 i j and q i 1 j 1 i 1 j in addition we also examine the potential errors of uniformly using either the cubic law or forchheimer s law in all fractures without explicitly taking into account the flow behaviors in them in doing so we quantify the percentage error of exchange flowrate as 100 qeu qen qen where qeu the exchange flowrate based on the uniform behavior assumption while qen is the exchange flowrate based on the new approach developed in this study that explicitly takes into account the actual flow behavior of each fracture based on the reynolds number 3 results and discussion since it is not possible to consider all potential cases of fracture and aquifer configurations and other factors that influence the flows in the fracture network and the overlying unconfined aquifer we present a few illustrative examples to demonstrate the developed new approach our main focus is on the water budget components in the fracture network and aquifer domain we examine the total flowrate in the entire domain the portion of the flowrate in the fracture network and the overlying aquifer and the percentage of the flow exchange between the overlying aquifer and the underlying fracture network in relation to the aquifer and fracture network characteristics in particular we investigate how the hydraulic conductivity of the overlying unconfined aquifer fracture aperture non uniformity overall hydraulic gradient over the entire domain and aquifer thickness may affect groundwater flow behaviors and partitioning in the domain we use two unconfined aquifer and fracture network configurations one with a regular network and the other with a relatively mild irregular network shown in fig 2 in the regular configuration in fig 2 a the fractures are placed in a rectangular domain with 100 nodes including 10 nodes at the interface between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network and 90 nodes inside the fracture network the irregular configuration in fig 2 b also includes 100 nodes with the nodes not being uniformly spaced note that the regular and irregular fracture networks have similar node configuration with the irregular one being slightly twisted the unconfined aquifer is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous it should be emphasized that although only two relatively simple aquifer and fracture network configurations are used to illustrate the main influences of fracture and aquifer properties on the groundwater flow budget and behaviors the new approach can be applied in any aquifer and fracture network configurations in calculating the results we use g 9 8 m s2 ρ 1000 kg m 3 and µ 0 0011 kg m s the critical reynolds number of 100 is used to distinguish turbulent flow from laminar flow in each individual fracture chen et al 2015 it should be noted however that the developed new approach is applicable to any critical reynolds number as the approach explicitly distinguishes flow behavior in each individual fracture since a higher critical reynolds number indicates a higher threshold for flow to change to turbulent flow it is expected that a higher critical reynolds number would reduce the errors from the uniform use of cubic law and increase the errors of using the forcheimer s law uniformly in fig 3 we plot the total flowrate through the domain including both the overlying unconfined aquifer and the fracture network in relation to the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer the unconfined aquifer and fracture network configurations are similar to those in fig 2 but the apertures of all fractures are uniform with the value of 0 001 m for fig 3 a and 0 003 m for fig 3 b the other parameters used in the calculations include the hydraulic heads at the inlet and outlet of 11 m and 10 m respectively the total domain length of 100 m which results in the overall hydraulic gradient over the domain of 0 01 the range of hydraulic conductivity used in illustrating the results is typical from clay to sand for unconfined aquifer materials freeze and cherry 1979 fetter 2001 with the small aperture for all fractures in fig 3 a the flow in each individual fracture is laminar the total flowrate calculated using the cubic law is the same as the new approach that explicitly takes into account flow behavior in each individual fracture although the cubic law can predict the total flowrate very well for both the regular and the irregular network configurations the flowrate in the irregular fracture network configuration is about 2 times that in the regular fracture network one the increase in the total groundwater flowrate for the irregular fracture network configuration is mainly due to the increase in the unconfined aquifer although the flowrate in the fracture network may decrease due to high resistance in the irregular fracture network the total flowrate increases with the hydraulic conductivity especially for large values for both the regular and irregular network configurations the forchheimer s law significantly under predict the total flowrate in the domain since the flows in the fractures are laminar when the aperture for all fractures increases to 0 003 m most of the flows become turbulent in the fractures as shown in fig 3 b the forchheimer s law then predicts almost the same with the new approach while the cubic law significantly over predicts the flowrate in this case the majority of groundwater flowrate occurs in the underlying fracture network increasing the unconfined aquifer hydraulic conductivity increases the flowrate in the aquifer however the increase is only a small portion of the total groundwater flowrate therefore the hydraulic conductivity does not significantly affect the total flowrate in fig 4 through fig 6 we show various groundwater balance components for the unconfined aquifer and fracture network configurations in fig 2 but the apertures of all fractures are uniform of 0 001 m for plot a and 0 003 m for plot b respectively the other parameters in fig 4 through fig 6 include the hydraulic heads at inlet and outlet of 11 m and 10 m respectively total domain length of 100 m and overall hydraulic gradient of 0 01 fig 4 shows the percentage of total flowrate that flows through the unconfined aquifer as a function of the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer when the aperture is small at 0 001 m the percent of the total flow through the unconfined aquifer is higher with the increase in k in fig 4 a compared to the larger aperture case in fig 4 b fig 5 plots the percentage of groundwater flowrate in the fracture network that comes from the overlying aquifer as a function of the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer when the aperture is smaller higher portion of groundwater flow in the fracture network is from the overlying unconfined aquifer as the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer increases more groundwater flows through the unconfined aquifer fig 4 and at the same time the flowrate to the underlying fracture network receives higher proportion of groundwater from the overlying aquifer fig 5 the results shown in fig 5 a demonstrate that for a small aperture fracture network the cubic law predicts almost the same flow exchange between the overlying aquifer and underlying fracture network as the new method which means that the groundwater flow in the fracture network is predominantly laminar on the other hand when the aperture becomes large the groundwater flow in the fracture network is mainly turbulent and the forchheimer s law predicts results very close to the new method as shown in fig 5 b to examine the potential errors of using uniform flow behavior assumption in all fractures in fig 6 we plot the relative percentage error of groundwater flow in the fractures coming from the unconfined aquifer as a function of the hydraulic conductivity of the unconfined aquifer under the same conditions as those in fig 5 for the small aperture case the cubic law predicts almost zero errors for both the regular and irregular configurations while the forchheimer s law under predicts the groundwater flow exchange between the aquifer and fracture network by up to 20 at the high hydraulic conductivity case for the regular fracture network and up to 50 for the irregular fracture network as shown in fig 6 a from fig 6 b the cubic law may over estimate the groundwater exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network by almost 200 when the aperture of the fractures is large and flow becomes turbulent which highlights the importance of explicitly taking into account flow behavior in each individual fracture we can conclude that while the flow from the overlying aquifer is a small portion of the overall flow in the underlying fracture network since the fractures considered are relatively large the errors of incorrect use of the laminar or turbulent flow equations in the fractures can lead to significant errors in simulating the groundwater flow exchange between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network for the fracture network configurations in fig 2 we also include several large fractures i e the thick black lines in fig 2 to examine the effects of non uniform fracture size which could be the main dominant factor of potential co existence of laminar and turbulent flows in different fractures we use two main connected large fractures with one being connected to the unconfined aquifer and the other one being only inside the fracture network this configuration serves two purposes to examine 1 how the new approach distinguishes laminar flow and turbulent flow in the fracture network which usually occurs in large fractures and 2 how the large fractures connected to the unconfined aquifer may affect the groundwater flow exchange between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network fig 7 plots the simulation results of groundwater flow components as a function of the larger aperture in the network for the aquifer and fracture network configurations shown in fig 2 for the total flowrate in fig 7 a the percent of total groundwater flowrate through the unconfined aquifer in fig 7 b and the percent of groundwater flowrate in the fracture network coming from the overlying unconfined aquifer in fig 7 c the other parameters required for the simulations include the small aperture of 0 001 m the hydraulic conductivity k of 0 001 m s the hydraulic heads at inlet and outlet of 11 m and 10 m respectively and the total domain length of 100 m which results in the overall hydraulic gradient of 0 01 when all the fractures have the same aperture of 0 001 m the groundwater flows in all fractures are laminar when the aperture of large fractures shown in fig 2 increases to 0 002 m the groundwater flows in portion of the fractures start to become turbulent and the flowrate calculated using the new approach is in between those determined based on the cubic law and the forchheimer s law for both the regular and irregular configurations seen in fig 7 a when the aperture of the large fractures further increases the new approach produces results closer to the forchheimer s law in other words the forchheimer s law is more accurate in describing the actual state of flow behavior in the fracture network under such conditions the results shown in fig 7 b demonstrate that as the aperture of the large fractures increases the portion of the groundwater flow in the fracture network coming from the overlying aquifer decreases it is expected that the results of groundwater flow in the fracture network coming from the aquifer also move closer to those from the forchheimer s law since the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network are highly interacting from fig 7 c we can see that the irregularity in the fracture network configurations has influenced the exchange between the aquifer and the fracture network in particular the portion of the fracture network flow coming from the overlying aquifer does not necessarily follow a monotonic trend in relation to the fracture aperture seen in fig 7 c given the small percentages of groundwater flow exchange between the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network the non monotonic trend seen in fig 7 c is due to the fracture network irregularity since this trend is only observed in the irregular network configurations in fig 8 we show the results of groundwater flow budget components as a function of the overall hydraulic gradient for the aquifer and fracture network configurations of fig 2 for the total flowrate fig 8 a the percent of total flowrate through the unconfined aquifer fig 8 b and the percent of flowrate in the fracture network coming from the aquifer fig 8 c other parameters include the small aperture of 0 001 m the large aperture of 0 004 m the hydraulic conductivity k of 0 001 m s and the hydraulic heads at inlet and outlet of 11 m and 10 m respectively as expected the total flowrate increases quickly with the overall hydraulic gradient seen in fig 8 a since the large aperture in the network is 4 times the small one the groundwater flowrate contribution is mainly dictated by the large fractures and the flow is mainly turbulent therefore the forchheimer s law simulates flow results close to the new approach while the cubic law significantly over predicts the total groundwater flowrates in the domain mainly due to its over estimation of flow in the large fractures the results plotted in fig 8 b illustrate that the portion of total groundwater flow through the unconfined aquifer also increases with the hydraulic gradient however the cubic law would predict a relatively constant percentage of the total flow as aquifer flow which means both the flows in the aquifer and in the fracture network would increase at the same pace in response to the increase in the hydraulic gradient which is consistent with the linear relationship assumption implied in the laminar flow equations as the hydraulic gradient increases the portion of groundwater flow in the fracture network that comes from the overlying aquifer also increases when the turbulent flow occurs in the network overall the laminar cubic law approach significantly under predicts the flow exchange between the aquifer and fracture network since it virtually simulates similar rate of flow increase in both the aquifer and fracture network in response to the increased hydraulic gradient in fig 9 we show the groundwater flow components as a function of the unconfined aquifer thickness for the fracture network and aquifer configurations of fig 2 when the small aperture is 0 001 m the large aperture is 0 004 m the aquifer hydraulic conductivity is 0 001 m s and the hydraulic gradient is 0 01 similar to previous figures we plot the total groundwater flowrate in fig 9 a the percent of total flowrate through the unconfined aquifer in fig 9 b and the percent of flowrate in the fracture network coming from the aquifer in fig 9 c as discussed earlier the groundwater flow in the fracture network is mainly dictated by the fractures with the large aperture where the flows are mainly turbulent in addition the majority of the total flow is through the fractures therefore in both the regular and irregular configurations the forchheimer s law predicts the total flowrate close to the results from the new approach and the cubic law approach significantly over predicts the total groundwater flowrate fig 9 a as expected the total flowrate increases with the increase in aquifer thickness however the extent of this increase is small since the majority of groundwater flow still occurs in the underlying fracture network while the increase in the total groundwater flow mainly results from the increase in the thickness of the unconfined aquifer which is due to the increase in the portion of the aquifer flow seen in fig 9 b in both the regular and irregular configurations the new approach predicts an aquifer flowrate between the values predicted by the cubic law and the forchheimer s law which means the flow behavior in the fracture network is a mixture of both laminar and turbulent flows due to the increase in aquifer thickness the unconfined aquifer can carry more flow and the portion of flow entering the underlying fracture network decreases with the increase in the aquifer thickness fig 9 c the results shown in fig 9 c also illustrate that the fracture network irregularity also affects the groundwater flow exchange between the aquifer and fracture network overall however only a small portion of groundwater flow in the fracture network is from the overlying aquifer 4 conclusions in this study a new approach was developed to improve the simulation of groundwater flow through a domain consisting of an unconfined aquifer overlying a discrete fracture network dfn the flow in the overlying unconfined aquifer was solved by using the dupuit assumptions flow in the fracture network was solved using an approach that distinguishes laminar and turbulent flows in individual fractures and by using the cubic law or forchheimer s law based on the local reynolds number the final state of flow was determined iteratively the exchange between the overlying unconfined aquifer and the fracture network was subject to mass conservation the impacts of various parameters such as aperture hydraulic gradient aquifer hydraulic conductivity and aquifer thickness on the groundwater flow were investigated using a few illustrative cases we also examine the potential errors assuming uniform flow of either laminar or turbulent flow in all fractures the main conclusions are the total groundwater flowrate and the relative portion of the total flowrate in the unconfined aquifer both increase with hydraulic conductivity especially when hydraulic conductivity is large but the extent of the increase also depends on the size of fractures in the fracture network as the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer increases more groundwater flows through the aquifer while the contribution of the flowrate to the underlying fracture network receives a high proportion of water from the overlying aquifer indiscriminately applying either the laminar or the turbulent flow equation in all fractures can lead to significant errors in simulating groundwater flow exchange between the unconfined aquifer and the underlying fracture network the extent of the potential errors of using them uniformly depends largely on the aperture of the fractures it is important to explicitly take into account flow behavior in the fractures to accurately determine the total groundwater flowrate and the other flow budget components in the aquifer and fracture network domain as fracture apertures increase both the portion of total flowrate in the unconfined aquifer and the portion of flow in the fractures coming from the unconfined aquifer decrease as the overall hydraulic gradient increases both the portion of the total flow in the unconfined aquifer and portion of the fracture flow that comes from the unconfined aquifer increase however if we assume laminar flow in the fractures these portions do not vary with the overall hydraulic gradient the portion of total flow in the unconfined aquifer increases with the unconfined aquifer thickness while the portion of the fracture flow that comes from the overlying aquifer decreases with the unconfined aquifer thickness in examining the effects of various important aquifer and fracture network properties we only use a couple of simple unconfined aquifer and fracture network configurations to single out important factors that may affect groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network and their potential exchange however the developed new approach that explicitly considers flows in both the unconfined aquifer and the fracture network can be applied to any two dimensional domain with an unconfined aquifer overlying a dfn acknowledgments this study was supported by the wyoming center for

temporal variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along the stream reach obstructed by two vented dams in sequence statistical tests such as levene s and welch s t tests were employed to check for various variability measures the strength of spatial dependence and the presence of spatial autocorrelation among the streambed k s samples were tested by using moran s i statistic the measures of central tendency and dispersion pointed out reasonable spatial variability in k s distribution throughout the study reach during two consecutive years 2016 and 2017 the streambed was heterogeneous with regard to hydraulic conductivity distribution with high k s zones near the backwater areas of the vented dam and low k s zones particularly at the tail water section of vented dams dam operational strategies were responsible for seasonal fluctuations in sedimentation and modifications to streambed substrate characteristics such as porosity grain size packing etc resulting in heterogeneous streambed k s profiles the channel downstream of vented dams contained significantly more cohesive deposits of fine sediment due to the overflow of surplus suspended sediment laden water

ephemeral and intermittent flashy streams having bed material predominantly composed of sand gravel and large cobbles the physics of these flashy streams is quite distinct from that of alluvial streams viz steep bed slopes drainage basins are small peak flows during monsoon season high rates of sediment transport causing abrupt changes in bed profile etc putty and prasad 2000 small reservoirs erected on the mountainous rivers are often beset with the danger of rapid siltation zhao et al 2013 even though forests serve as a temporary barrier by with holding storm water and preventing sheet erosion the soil erosion from hillsides and silt flows from an upland watershed may accumulate along valley sides and channel bed over time these flashy streams fan out into the plains during times of abnormal floods which drives and spread out deposits into streambeds adams 1989 fragmenting streams with dams diversions and sometimes culverts disrupt the longitudinal connectivity of a stream chen 2004 fanelli and lautz 2008 the head of water behind dam adds hydraulic pressure to increase k s but if very fine sediments and organics settle as a result into the bed substrates the k s may be reduced most of the existing research focusses on how in stream structures affect the hyporheic exchange of water and heat between the surface flow and the underlying aquifer system the hyporheic solute exchange and flux are likely to be influenced by longitudinal streambed profile and other geomorphic factors leading to heterogeneity and anisotropy of streambed k s ryan and boufadel 2006 song et al 2007 tonina and buffington 2009 liu et al 2018 studied the dynamic processes of hyporheic exchange in a riparian zone downstream of the xin an river dam and found that dams also induce thermal heterogeneity in the subsurface via infiltration studies have shown that intense hyporheic exchange exists in the vicinity of in stream structures hester and doyle 2008 and the streambed hydraulic conductivity and depth of alluvium are the key factors that determine hyporheic residence time tonina and buffington 2011 the study by rana et al 2017 determined that a series of in stream structures have the potential to increase transient storage than a single structure the effect of in stream structures on the variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity at reach scale is seldom considered analyzed or known hence this paper is intended to inform broadly on the spatial and temporal patterns of k s along a dynamic heterogeneous streambed over relatively short distances relative to the vented dams and short time period relative to the frequent high magnitude events additionally we verify whether the streambed k s has increased due to the hydraulic pressure exerted by the head of water behind vented dams or else declined due to the settlement of very fine sediments and organics into the bed substrate each situation may pose varying complexities to consider and call for representative studies 2 details of study area 2 1 pavanje river basin about three fourths of the area of pavanje river basin consists of mountainous and undulating land its geological structure consist of laterite dolerite biotite hornblende granite banded biotite gneiss and charnockite and on the whole its topography is steep which accounts for the swiftness of river avinash et al 2014 the watershed receives very heavy rainfall around 3 900 mm annually from the southwest monsoon during the months of june to october cgwb 2012 the pavanje river originates in the foothills of western ghats and flows towards the west to join the arabian sea it lies between north latitudes 13 07 30 to 12 57 30 and east longitudes 74 45 00 to 75 02 30 the basin lies within the dakshina kannada district of karnataka state india fig 1 drainage frequency values of the basin range from 0 25 to 6 5 the basement rocks of the basin predominantly consist of granitic gneiss of the archean age one of the oldest rocks of the peninsular india these basement rocks are overlaid by ferruginous laterites which cover up about 55 60 area of the basin they are highly porous and permeable the thickness of laterite cap varies in the order of 3 m to 20 m lateritic mounds underlain by thin beds of clay granites and gneiss patches of dolerite dykes charnockites quartzite and chlorite schist s are also noticed in some parts coastal alluvium and lateritic soils are predominant in the landscape formed by the weathering of underlying rocks and due to the marine and river processes gajendragad et al 1986 the lateritic hills do not retain soil moisture and only thick vegetation and grassland is observed in these regions torrential rain washes down the soil and weathered substrate materials and deposit them in the valleys and streams the water appears brownish red due to the dispersion of colloidal clay matter the laterites can have variable consistency limits attributed from their distinct mineralogy plenty of sand gravel and fine clayey soil leached out during surface water flow is deposited into streambeds and swampy areas shwetha and varija 2013 2 2 vented dam a vented dam fig 2 is a type of low head storage dam which consists of a number of gateways called vents throughout the stretch of the dam to regulate and stabilize the streamflow during low flow periods shetkar and mahesha 2011a b stop log type of gates is employed to block the flow in vented dams a number of long rectangular timber panels are stacked vertically between two piers one and above the other in the grooves incised within the piers of the vented dam the ditch between a pair of stop logs is stuffed with fine mud to prevent water leakage that occurs amid a couple of timber panels a series of vented dams are constructed along the pavanje river reach across the third and fourth order streams for controlling and storing the surface runoff contributed from base flow these vented dams are seasonal structures which come into operation only after monsoon retreats during the rainy season the vents are unregulated offering no obstruction to the flood these vented dams retard runoff and control sedimentation during their operation gowda and mayya 2015 the water stored in the vented dams will be used for irrigation by local farmers during the post monsoon and winter periods october to january the stream dries up every summer in the months of february to may 3 methodology 3 1 field experiments and data collection the stream shown in fig 3 was considered for streambed hydraulic conductivity k s estimation at a depth of 0 3 m using guelph permeameter gp the k s was measured in situ during the months of february to may of two consecutive years 2016 and 2017 over a 1 829 km stream reach of pavanje river where the stream comes across two vented dams in sequence sampling of k s was done as per the procedure followed by chen 2004 the gp tests were conducted along 40 transects across the channel see fig 3 during dry periods covering the upstream and downstream reaches of each vented dam the spacing between each transect was 50 m and in each transect for every 5 meter distance k s was determined a total of 187 k s test samples were collected from the sampling spots every year for the comparative evaluation of variability of k s over the upstream and downstream of vented dams the stream reach considered was divided into three segments see fig 3 the segment 1 is downstream of vented dam 1 segment 2 is the mid section which includes both the upstream and downstream environments and lastly the segment 3 is upstream of vented dam 2 the longitudinal extent of segments 1 2 and 3 was approximately about 500 729 and 600 m respectively before the study began the channel physiognomies like the type of substrate particles and width of the stream at each transect were surveyed the sediments deposited in the stream were poorly sorted and composed of loamy sand silt and fine to medium grained sand the stream reach considered is a sinuous channel with a meander bend in the upstream the width of stream varied from 18 to 50 m 3 2 guelph permeameter guelph permeameter designed by reynolds and elrick 1985 is a constant head permeameter based on well auger hole method and marriotte principle for precise measurements of in situ saturated hydraulic conductivity the procedure involves measuring the consistent rate of water flow into saturated stream sediments from a cylindrical well hole in which a constant depth head of water is maintained the k s measurements are made when a bulb of saturated soil is formed around the auger hole due to flow along both vertical gravity and lateral capillary directions depending on the soil type k s tests can be made within 30 min to 2 h utilizing just 3 0 liters of water the two head procedure was followed to get more accurate k s estimates the k s is calculated using the equations given below elrick and reynolds 1992 permeameter g u e l p h 2012 1 k s g 2 q 2 g 1 q 1 2 q 1 r 1 35 22 3 q 2 r 2 35 22 4 g 1 h 2 c 1 π 2 h 1 h 2 h 2 h 1 a 2 h 1 c 2 h 2 c 1 5 g 2 h 1 c 2 π 2 h 1 h 2 h 2 h 1 a 2 h 1 c 2 h 2 c 1 where r is steady state rate of fall of water in reservoirs cm s k s is sediment saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s a is borehole radius cm h 1 is the first head of water established in borehole cm h 2 is the second head of water established in borehole cm and c i is dimensionless shape factor that depends primarily on the h a ratio and according to the soil texture structure category macdonald et al 2012 lee et al 1985 and more and deka 2017 are few literature examples where guelph permeameter was used for estimation of k s in streambed sandy and sandy loam soils 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 normality test an evaluation of the normality of data is essential for some statistical tests since normal data is a basic presumption in parametric testing the kolmogorov smirnov k s test massey jr 1951 lilliefors corrected k s test lilliefors 1967 shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 d agostino pearson test d agostino et al 1990 were used to determine whether k s data are normally distributed or not the k s test assesses the goodness of fit by comparing the standard normal distribution against the empirical cumulative distribution however k s test is regarded as less sensitive and is not recommended for testing normality nowadays ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 the lilliefors test a tailored version of k s test adjusts the k s statistic for small values at the tails of probability distribution and examines for a significant difference between the empirical cdf and the specified distribution shapiro wilk s w test is another similar normality test that effectively assesses the correlation between sample data and the corresponding ideal normal scores and is an unbiased estimator of goodness of fit to the standard normal distribution the d agostino pearson test is a versatile and powerful test against non normality arising from skewness and kurtosis its test statistic is based on a comparative evaluation of kurtosis and skewness coefficients of the sample data with that of the moments of a normal distribution quantified by pearson s coefficients the common null hypothesis of all these statistical tests is that the k s data has been drawn at random from a normal distribution as with most statistical tests a statistically significant p value typically 0 05 exhibits a strong evidence against the null hypothesis i e the sample distribution is non normal 3 3 2 test for equality of variances the non parametric tests levene s test levene 1960 for assessing homogeneity of variance and welch s t test welch 1947 for analyzing sample means were used to determine if streambed k s values differ significantly between two segments i e the upstream and downstream of vented dams of the river and between two sampling times the kruskal wallis test is advantageous when the data are not normally distributed however while using it to test whether the medians of two data groups are different it assumes that the observations in each group are from samples of same distribution so if the data of two groups have dissimilar distribution for instance the observations of one group is skewed to the left and another is skewed to the right and have different variances the results of kruskal wallis test may be unreliable if the distributions are heteroscedastic it is better to use levene s test or welch s t test for two groups instead of kruskal wallis test kao and green 2008 whenever the sample sizes are small or unequal and the standard deviations of the two groups are substantially different or unequal welch s t test is recommended under the null hypothesis that the difference between two population means is equal the welch s t test calculates a t statistic by adjusting the number of degrees of freedom even when the population variances are unequal the levene s test examines for homogeneity of variances under the null hypothesis that variances are equal across each set of samples 3 4 geostatistical analysis 3 4 1 spatial autocorrelation moran s i finding the spatial autocorrelation using moran s i index moran 1948 aids to examine whether the pattern of a phenomenon is clustered dispersed or random when analyzing spatial data moran s i index finds the correlation between the neighborhood values of a variable which are scattered in space in two or more dimensions the moran s i index is a parametric test which exhibits the spatial autocorrelation value in between 1 and 1 and generates a z score and p value to evaluate the level of autocorrelation a positive index value indicates that the data is spatially clustered while a negative index indicates dispersion in the present study the moran s i for different lags was determined to know the range of autocorrelation values as a function of distance the moran s i is calculated as 6 i n w i 1 n j 1 n w ij z i z j i 1 n z i 2 where n is number of observations z i x i x x is the value of the variable at location i and x is the mean value of the variable of interest w is the sum of weights w ij for all pairs in the system cliff and ord 1981 the inferential local moran s i statistic is represented as slope in the scatter plot which signposts the type and strength of spatial autocorrelation of a variable 3 4 2 spatial interpolation schemes 3 4 2 1 deterministic approach in the present study two deterministic spatial interpolation methods namely the inverse distance weighting idw and radial basis functions rbf were employed to generate the spatial distribution maps of streambed k s the idw scheme estimates the magnitude of a variable phenomenon at non sampled locations by taking the advantage of weighting i e the weight of any known point differs with the inverse square of its distance from the estimated point shepard 1968 the idw is a moving average interpolator based on search neighborhood strategy which doesn t account for spatial structure i e arrangement of the sampled points hence the efficiency of interpolation is dependent on spacing and density of the samples inverse distance weighting is arrived at using the formula johnston et al 2001 7 z s o i 1 n λ i z s i where z s o is the estimated value for unknown location s o n is the number of measured sample points z s i is the measured value at the location s i λ i are the weights assigned to each measured points which are determined by 8 λ i d io p i 1 n d io p with i 1 n λ i 1 where d io represents the distance between estimated location s o and each of the measured location s i p is the weighting power the rate of which falls off as the distance becomes larger the radial basis functions rbf belong to the category of exact interpolation technique with an ability to generalize scattered data to several space dimensions by expanding a linear combination of the basis functions with radial symmetry i e same span in all dimensions baxter 1992 rbf is established in terms of radial distance from a point 9 z x y w ϕ x x c 2 y y c 2 w ϕ x c w ϕ r where w is the weight of rbf determined from interpolation conditions c x c y c are the coordinates of the point or center and r is the spatial distance from neighborhood point in the xy plane to the center ϕ r r 0 may be any one of the basis functions there exists several options of rbfs namely thin plate spline completely regularized spline spline with tension multi quadratic and inverse multi quadratic spline whose shapes are different from one another and result in non identical interpolation surface the rbf estimated values can be above the maximum and below the minimum measured values whilst the values estimated from idw interpolation never crosses the upper and lower limits of measured values buhmann 2003 3 4 2 2 geostatistical approach kriging is the universally accepted best linear unbiased estimator since it takes regionalization into consideration the procedure involves exploratory statistical data analysis fitting suitable semivariogram model generation of prediction surface map and optionally provides some measures of certainty or accuracy by exploring a variance surface johnston et al 2001 the semivariogram models used in ordinary kriging ok are the mathematical forms used to describe the inherent spatial correlation structure in the data kriging weights for the neighborhood measured points are assigned based on the concept of spatial stationarity of the data quantified through semivariogram model the variance of estimation error is a resultant of the variogram type and the spatial scattering of measured neighborhood points the experimental variogram is generally composed with irregular scatter of neighborhood points due to large lag distance and tolerance and is different from that of theoretical variogram which is a plot of variance against lag fitted with a model curve goovaerts 1999 in the present study ok involving circular spherical pentaspherical exponential and guassian variogram models were tested to describe the semivariance the ok estimator for point estimation is arrived based on the mathematical relations given below 10 z p μ p where p x y is one of the sample location and z p is the value of the random variable of interest at that particular location μ is the fixed unknown mean for the data and p is the random error representing the variation around the mean which is intrinsically stationary when provided with n measurements z p 1 z p n at known locations p 1 p n the estimate z at an unsampled location p o is given as a weighted sum of the data 11 z p o i 1 n λ i z p i where λ i is an unknown weight for the measured value at the i th location to ensure unbiasedness condition for the unknown measurement the sum of the weights λ i must be equal to 1 i e i 1 n λ i 1 with the expected error e z p o z p o and measurement variance 12 var z p o e z p o z p o 2 13 2 i 1 n λ i γ p i p o i 1 n j 1 n λ i λ j γ p i p j where γ p i p j is the semivariance of z between the data points p i and p j and γ p i p o is the semivariance between the i th data point and the target point p o for comprehensive details related to geostatistics and the mathematical concepts of ok and semivariogram modeling one can refer to the following literatures webster and oliver 2007 kitanidis 1997 goovaerts 1997 4 results and discussion 4 1 grain size analysis and streambed k s values from in situ permeameter tests many varying conditions occur as a result of different geologic and geomorphic characteristics of a river the stream characteristics that can influence streambed hydraulic conductivity include the configuration of channel geometry floodplain connection streambed substrate characteristics like texture structure etc table 1 summarizes the channel characteristics of study reach the grain size distribution of sediments collected from each transect of the study reach was analyzed in terms of d50 median diameter which showed a good correlation with mean k s values of the corresponding transect coarse sediments tend to have a greater percentage of pore space and hence a lower density whilst the fine sediments usually contain a greater fraction of clay packed in the pore spaces between larger grains that affects the streambed k s as a support to this premise significant statistical correlation existed between the d50 median diameter and mean k s values of transects along the study reach with r 0 97 and 0 96 for samples of 2016 and 2017 respectively over the entire study reach d50 varied between 1 25 4 2 mm with reference to 2016 sediment samples and 1 4 4 15 mm for 2017 samples as expected d50 didn t exhibit a static or homogeneous distribution over the reach due to complex patterns of flow and sediment regime instigated by the existence of vented dams as a result of silt and particulate organic matter inputs from the floodplain and riparian vegetation the sediments of segment 1 had lower d50 values in the range 1 25 2 25 mm with respect to 2016 samples and 1 4 1 78 mm pertaining to 2017 samples the sediments of segment 2 sinuous channel and segment 3 meandering channel had moderate d50 values as presented in fig 4 the upstream of vented dam 2 i e the meandering streambed comprised with coarse sand and gravel due to sorting or deposition of coarse sediments at the upstream end of the reservoir whilst the fine silt and clay sediment deposition was observed near to the body of dam due to entrapping of coarse sediments above vented dam 2 the segment 2 suffers from shortage of coarse sediments and the surplus suspended sediment laden water overflowing from vented dam 2 contribute to fine sediment deposition downstream sedimentation in series of small reservoirs is dependent on the nature of stream flow geometry of the reservoirs and the distance between two reservoirs vented dams are known to affect the substrate physical composition distinct associations of several deposits and relative distribution and accumulation places in the stream the lateral accretion deposits are usually coarser than accumulates of vertical accretion however the deposits of channel fill or lag is comparatively finer than lateral accretion and coarser than vertical accretion accumulates the descriptive statistics of in situ measured streambed hydraulic conductivity k s along the three segments of the study reach measured at two different time periods are presented in table 2 to illustrate the overall variation in the k s distribution the magnitude of k s with reference to the three segments varied by two orders of magnitude the streambed k s along the stream reach varied from 11 634 cm day 793 886 cm day and 16 932 cm day 777 989 cm day during the sampling periods 2016 2017 respectively the longitudinal variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along every 50 m upstream and downstream of vented dams is presented in fig 4 it is evident that there exists significant differences in mean k s values of the upstream and downstream segments of vented dams progressive decrease and inconsistent mean k s values can be observed while getting away from the vented dam 1 towards downstream due to lateral accretion deposits spread out by second order stream confluence at around 50 m downstream of vented dam 2 an elevated mean k s is observed at this transect the mean k s values of all transects downstream of vented dam 1 varied between 31 85 188 98 cm day for 2016 samples and 35 77 192 09 cm day for 2017 samples similarly at segment 2 varied between 100 88 535 73 cm day for 2016 samples and 111 33 504 87 cm day for 2017 samples the mean k s values of all transects upstream of vented dam 2 varied between 473 59 755 39 cm day for 2016 samples and 377 39 753 31 cm day for 2017 samples the streambed k s samples of segment 3 had reasonable temporal variability due to episodic changes in substrate particles and organic matter inputs at the meander bend of stream which is evident from significant differences in the minimum and extreme values of k s 4 2 variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along the study reach 4 2 1 statistical analysis the variation of k s data depicted via box plots presented in fig 5 allows to analyze the mean median range identify outliers extreme values and the dispersion represented via interquartile range the frequency distributions of k s data is graphically represented by histograms refer fig 6 wherein a normal distribution is hypothesized and tested through normality tests the results of kolmogorov smirnov k s k s with lilliefors correction shapiro wilk and d agostino pearson tests for k s measured at two time periods are provided in table 3 with reference to the full stretch of stream reach considered all the normality tests showed a p value less than 0 05 which signposts a non normal distribution of both k s and ln k s of two different time periods even after transforming the k s data by using natural log the distribution remained non normal due to inherent heterogeneity and significant field scale variability of k s across the study reach the k s data of segment 1 of the year 2016 was observed to have non normal distribution based on all test statistics however the ln transformed k s values were found to be normally distributed based on the k s and d agostino pearson tests for the same segment in the 2017 study period all the normality tests except shapiro wilk test accepted the null hypothesis of normal distribution of the ln transformed k s values at the segment 1 even though the realistic k s values were found to be non normal the k s test was the only one to confirm normality of k s values sampled from segment 2 during 2017 and segment 3 during 2016 with a fair p value 0 05 due to the skewed nature of k s data of segment 3 during 2017 all the normality tests rejected the null hypothesis of normal distribution of k s data at a significance level of 0 05 a distribution can deviate from that of normal due to lack of symmetry skewness kurtosis and mixture of distributions the empirical cdf curve of the k s test and the q q plots presented in fig 7 also portray that k s data follows a non normal distribution the results of levene s and welch s t tests table 4 infer that there exists significant differences in the variance and mean of streambed k s sampled from the three segments of the study reach the mean and variance of streambed k s samples measured at the upstream section of vented dams significantly varied from that of the downstream k s samples during both the study periods for instance the test statistic of levene s test conducted for testing equality of variance between samples of segments 1 and 2 of the year 2016 was relatively large with w 28 92 and p 0 the fluvial sedimentation on the upstream channel of the vented dams and the bed incision at the downstream which is however compensated during floods accompanied by retrogressive erosion are the main reasons for significant spatial variability of k s various kinds of valley deposits their physical composition distinct associations of several deposits relative distribution and accumulation places in the streams are some other related factors causing variability in streambed k s with respect to streambed k s of individual segments sampled at different time periods the levene s test failed to reject the null hypothesis at the 0 05 significance level table 4 thereby confirming the assumption of temporal homoscedasticity of streambed k s the welch s t test also accepted the null hypothesis that there was no significant differences in the central tendency of the k s values sampled between the two time periods in the study reach thereby discarding the rationale of temporal k s evolution the negative test statistic t values reflect that the sample mean was smaller than that of the hypothesized mean 4 2 2 geostatistical analysis the residual spatial autocorrelation between the samples of a variable in the geographical lattice can be detected through spatial correlogram which is usually a plot of moran s i as a function of distance or number of neighbors the moran s i coefficient between pand p lag is simply a slope of the least squares regression line that best fits the points each of the spatial neighborhood sensitivity plots in fig 8 is a distance based spatial correlogram revealing the moran s i across several neighborhood sizes a significant and positive spatial auto correlation was observed in the streambed k s patterns as represented by moran s i value close to 1 the moran s i was observed to diminish for the farthest neighbors from that of the reference point representing shrinking of spatial dependence the streambed k s patterns with reference to segments 1 and 2 showed a reasonable good spatial auto correlation up to 12 nearest neighbors as per non directional moran s i indices the spatial correlogram of the streambed k s patterns with respect to full stretch of the study reach had virtuous spatial influence up to 24 nearest neighbors the streambed k s patterns at the meandering stream section segment 3 was seen to have relatively weaker positive spatial auto correlation with distant neighbors the local moran s i scatterplot was used as an exploratory graphical tool for assessing the strength of spatial autocorrelation in the streambed k s data in the fig 9 scatter plots of moran s i are presented in which the slope of the regression line gives the local moran s i index the sign positive or negative of the moran s i index will be simply the sign of the slope of the regression line the streambed k s samples of two sampling periods were interpolated by incorporating the standard idw and completely regularized spline kernel based rbf interpolation methods using the geostatistical analyst wizard of arcgis 10 3 the root mean square error and kling gupta efficiency kge measures presented in table 5 were calculated based on the observed and predicted k s values assessed through cross validation by the idw and rbf methods the kge index ranges from to 1 which accounts for all the sources of systematic errors from different components i e bias correlation and variability gupta et al 2009 the kge of rbf estimates k s for the two periods were 0 985 and 0 978 respectively which necessarily represents a robust prediction or spatial interpolation fig 10 presents the prediction maps of streambed k s for two time periods using the idw and rbf methods with the use of sampled streambed k s values along the study reach experimental semivariograms were constructed to characterize the spatial variability of the sampled streambed k s using circular spherical pentaspherical exponential and gaussian semivariogram models however the results of only the best performing semivariograms are reported along with the streambed k s estimates and their estimation variance at the nodes semivariogram modeling and ordinary kriging analyses were performed in arcgis 10 3 through many simulation trials by using different semivariograms the best performing experimental semivariograms presented in table 6 of streambed k s for the study reach were found the nugget which represents the small scale variability or the measurement error is selected based on database and adjusted along with major axis and active lag distance for fitting the semivariogram model that appropriately captures the spatial distribution of k s data the lag parameters including the lag spacing and tolerance of the experimental variograms were tested for 9 12 15 and 21 number of nearest neighbors back to back the spatial autocorrelation was observed to drop significantly above 21 neighborhood spacings and the experimental semivariograms modelled by considering 15 nearest neighbors performed better for the k s samples of the year 2016 pentaspherical and circular semivariograms performed better than others tested with an rmse 42 976 46 751 cm day respectively and correspondingly for the k s data of 2017 the exponential and pentaspherical models provided better characterization of the spatial variability of streambed k s fig 11 demonstrates the fitted theoretical semivariograms against the empirical semivariance estimates of streambed k s the nugget to sill ratio or dependence ratio dr quantifies the degree of spatial autocorrelation and gives an idea of how much variance is successfully accounted in the semivariogram model a dr of less than 0 25 indicates a strong degree of spatial autocorrelation and if the dr ratio ranges between 0 25 and 0 75 it is regarded as moderate spatial association and lastly a dr 0 75 indicates weak spatial autocorrelation aidoo et al 2015 from the simulated semivariograms presented in table 6 which have very strong dependence ratio s krigged surface maps of streambed k s were generated for two time periods refer fig 12 among the three interpolation methods tested the rbf method was the one with lowest rmse and higher kge in all the cases the highly dense homogeneous network of samples contributed for relatively good performance of idw and rbf methods according to li and heap 2008 while modeling samples of dense homogeneous networks the geostatistical methods for instance ordinary kriging doesn t show superior spatial predictions than deterministic methods such as idw and rbf however the prediction uncertainty will be lower around the sampled values in ordinary kriging estimates compared to deterministic methods in fig 13 the taylor diagrams portray the relative performance of individual interpolation methods in simulating the spatial patterns of streambed k s the performance of all the three interpolation methods idw rbf and ok were marginally equal similar in terms of root mean square difference error rmsd standard deviation and correlation coefficient 4 3 discussion on influence of vented dams on streambed k s variability the presence of series of vented dams imparts particle size heterogeneity all along the direction of the stream and vertically within the bed cyclic scour and re deposition events over time and intrusion or settlement of fine sediments due to water stagnation behind dams can lead to changes in substrate composition all along the study reach statistically significant differences in streambed k s and substrate composition subsisted between upstream and downstream sections of vented dams significant differences also existed in streambed k s distribution at different transects within each segment of the study reach hydraulic conditions represented by head levels and duration of water storage behind the dams and the operational strategies were significant factors accounting for within channel k s differences the low k s zones at the tail water section downstream of vented dams occur due to the intrusion of fine sediments and organics into the pore spaces of a stable gravel substrate resulting in choking of hyporheic zones and anoxic conditions during periods of substrate movement induced by storm peaks the streambed is extremely dynamic to characterize a significant volume of bed load is being released and incorporated at the same time period anthropogenic disturbances to streambed via in stream gravel mining livestock washing contaminant release from laundry wash groundwater pumping for agricultural use are some significant factors to consider that lead to variability of k s there can be a surge of chemical substances and other nutrients released from anthropogenic activities due to river obstruction 5 conclusions it is expected that due to the obstruction caused by vented dams the coarse sediment load will be held back in the upstream reaches and the river will dig in near the tail end of vented dams to get stabilized in its course at the middle reach the array of channel adjustments that occur both upstream and downstream of vented dams are the factors responsible for the variability of streambed k s the movement of alluvial masses within the reservoir of vented dams is caused by phenomena of turbulent diffusion within the stream and especially by the action of internal circular currents turbulent diffusion currents occur in parts of the river having asymmetrical sections henceforth the streambed was heterogeneous with regard to hydraulic conductivity distribution due to an upset of equilibrium between supply and removal of sediments near the vented dam cross section the measures of central tendency and dispersion show that the streambed k s had reasonable spatial variability within the study reach with a minimum value of 11 63 cm day and the maximum being 793 88 cm day during the year 2016 and ranged between 16 93 and 777 98 cm day during the year 2017 the bedrock underlying the streambed and aquifer properties can also be the cause for low hydraulic conductivity at some sections of the stream the levene s and welch s t tests confirm the hypothesis of the significant spatial variability of streambed k s between the upstream and downstream reaches of the vented dams however significant temporal variability of streambed k s was not observed during the study period across all the three segments analysis of results demonstrates a strong influence of vented dam presence particularly on grain size and streambed k s distribution the spatial variability of streambed k s can be because of factors such as accretion or depletion of streambed elements local anomalies in substrate materials and river network which include precipitation and flow patterns underlying geology topography organic inputs natural and anthropogenic disturbances the moran s i

7236,the hydro geological properties of streambed together with the hydraulic gradients determine the fluxes of water energy and solutes between the stream and underlying aquifer system dam induced sedimentation affects hyporheic processes and alters substrate pore space geometries in the course of progressive stabilization of the sediment layers uncertainty in stream aquifer interactions arises from the inherent complex nested flow paths and spatio temporal variability of streambed hydraulic properties a detailed field investigation of streambed hydraulic conductivity k s using guelph permeameter was carried out in an intermittent stream reach of the pavanje river basin located in the mountainous forested tract of western ghats of india the present study reports the spatial and temporal variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along the stream reach obstructed by two vented dams in sequence statistical tests such as levene s and welch s t tests were employed to check for various variability measures the strength of spatial dependence and the presence of spatial autocorrelation among the streambed k s samples were tested by using moran s i statistic the measures of central tendency and dispersion pointed out reasonable spatial variability in k s distribution throughout the study reach during two consecutive years 2016 and 2017 the streambed was heterogeneous with regard to hydraulic conductivity distribution with high k s zones near the backwater areas of the vented dam and low k s zones particularly at the tail water section of vented dams dam operational strategies were responsible for seasonal fluctuations in sedimentation and modifications to streambed substrate characteristics such as porosity grain size packing etc resulting in heterogeneous streambed k s profiles the channel downstream of vented dams contained significantly more cohesive deposits of fine sediment due to the overflow of surplus suspended sediment laden water at low velocity and pressure head the statistical test results accept the hypothesis of significant spatial variability of streambed k s but refuse to accept the temporal variations the deterministic

the growth of deposits and the carrying capacity of a river may arise due to the erection of hydraulic structures skalak et al 2009 in stream structures such as dams weirs culverts and some land use practices in a watershed can significantly affect the five components of a natural healthy stream namely the shape flow connectivity biology and water quality naganna et al 2017 the vertical downward flow of water is primarily controlled by head available in the stream and the water movement in streambed homogeneous and heterogeneous depends on hydraulic conductivity suction potential and substrate characteristics chen 2000 as a result of dams the transportation capacity of the stream in the back water area is reduced and most of the sediment is deposited upstream snoussi et al 2002 in their study report that due to the construction of dams in the moulouya and sebou rivers more than 95 of the total sediment load got trapped and affected the shoreline morphology dams typically help slow water velocity and facilitate for the settling of suspended and fine sediments particles deep dams also have an anoxic zone that prevents decay of organics these are generalities but dams are known to reduce channel disturbances during floods support substrate sorting and hyporheic exchange wu et al 2015 report the vertical hydraulic conductivity distribution patterns across the stream before and after flood season floods not only include rain water of the catchment area but also carry sediments in suspension which may later get precipitated as the stream power reduces the coarse and heftier sediments travel a lesser distance in contrast to finer and lighter particles during floods heading to alteration of riverbed substrates due to sorting simpson and meixner 2012 a flash flood is differentiated from the routine river flow by a sharp rise in runoff water and stream stage malmon et al 2004 the flash floods associated with heavy thunder showers or under monsoon depressions cause heavy down pour within a short period in india flash floods occur in the entire belt of foothills of the himalayas and western ghats the western ghats of india in folds numerous ephemeral and intermittent flashy streams having bed material predominantly composed of sand gravel and large cobbles the physics of these flashy streams is quite distinct from that of alluvial streams viz steep bed slopes drainage basins are small peak flows during monsoon season high rates of sediment transport causing abrupt changes in bed profile etc putty and prasad 2000 small reservoirs erected on the mountainous rivers are often beset with the danger of rapid siltation zhao et al 2013 even though forests serve as a temporary barrier by with holding storm water and preventing sheet erosion the soil erosion from hillsides and silt flows from an upland watershed may accumulate along valley sides and channel bed over time these flashy streams fan out into the plains during times of abnormal floods which drives and spread out deposits into streambeds adams 1989 fragmenting streams with dams diversions and sometimes culverts disrupt the longitudinal connectivity of a stream chen 2004 fanelli and lautz 2008 the head of water behind dam adds hydraulic pressure to increase k s but if very fine sediments and organics settle as a result into the bed substrates the k s may be reduced most of the existing research focusses on how in stream structures affect the hyporheic exchange of water and heat between the surface flow and the underlying aquifer system the hyporheic solute exchange and flux are likely to be influenced by longitudinal streambed profile and other geomorphic factors leading to heterogeneity and anisotropy of streambed k s ryan and boufadel 2006 song et al 2007 tonina and buffington 2009 liu et al 2018 studied the dynamic processes of hyporheic exchange in a riparian zone downstream of the xin an river dam and found that dams also induce thermal heterogeneity in the subsurface via infiltration studies have shown that intense hyporheic exchange exists in the vicinity of in stream structures hester and doyle 2008 and the streambed hydraulic conductivity and depth of alluvium are the key factors that determine hyporheic residence time tonina and buffington 2011 the study by rana et al 2017 determined that a series of in stream structures have the potential to increase transient storage than a single structure the effect of in stream structures on the variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity at reach scale is seldom considered analyzed or known hence this paper is intended to inform broadly on the spatial and temporal patterns of k s along a dynamic heterogeneous streambed over relatively short distances relative to the vented dams and short time period relative to the frequent high magnitude events additionally we verify whether the streambed k s has increased due to the hydraulic pressure exerted by the head of water behind vented dams or else declined due to the settlement of very fine sediments and organics into the bed substrate each situation may pose varying complexities to consider and call for representative studies 2 details of study area 2 1 pavanje river basin about three fourths of the area of pavanje river basin consists of mountainous and undulating land its geological structure consist of laterite dolerite biotite hornblende granite banded biotite gneiss and charnockite and on the whole its topography is steep which accounts for the swiftness of river avinash et al 2014 the watershed receives very heavy rainfall around 3 900 mm annually from the southwest monsoon during the months of june to october cgwb 2012 the pavanje river originates in the foothills of western ghats and flows towards the west to join the arabian sea it lies between north latitudes 13 07 30 to 12 57 30 and east longitudes 74 45 00 to 75 02 30 the basin lies within the dakshina kannada district of karnataka state india fig 1 drainage frequency values of the basin range from 0 25 to 6 5 the basement rocks of the basin predominantly consist of granitic gneiss of the archean age one of the oldest rocks of the peninsular india these basement rocks are overlaid by ferruginous laterites which cover up about 55 60 area of the basin they are highly porous and permeable the thickness of laterite cap varies in the order of 3 m to 20 m lateritic mounds underlain by thin beds of clay granites and gneiss patches of dolerite dykes charnockites quartzite and chlorite schist s are also noticed in some parts coastal alluvium and lateritic soils are predominant in the landscape formed by the weathering of underlying rocks and due to the marine and river processes gajendragad et al 1986 the lateritic hills do not retain soil moisture and only thick vegetation and grassland is observed in these regions torrential rain washes down the soil and weathered substrate materials and deposit them in the valleys and streams the water appears brownish red due to the dispersion of colloidal clay matter the laterites can have variable consistency limits attributed from their distinct mineralogy plenty of sand gravel and fine clayey soil leached out during surface water flow is deposited into streambeds and swampy areas shwetha and varija 2013 2 2 vented dam a vented dam fig 2 is a type of low head storage dam which consists of a number of gateways called vents throughout the stretch of the dam to regulate and stabilize the streamflow during low flow periods shetkar and mahesha 2011a b stop log type of gates is employed to block the flow in vented dams a number of long rectangular timber panels are stacked vertically between two piers one and above the other in the grooves incised within the piers of the vented dam the ditch between a pair of stop logs is stuffed with fine mud to prevent water leakage that occurs amid a couple of timber panels a series of vented dams are constructed along the pavanje river reach across the third and fourth order streams for controlling and storing the surface runoff contributed from base flow these vented dams are seasonal structures which come into operation only after monsoon retreats during the rainy season the vents are unregulated offering no obstruction to the flood these vented dams retard runoff and control sedimentation during their operation gowda and mayya 2015 the water stored in the vented dams will be used for irrigation by local farmers during the post monsoon and winter periods october to january the stream dries up every summer in the months of february to may 3 methodology 3 1 field experiments and data collection the stream shown in fig 3 was considered for streambed hydraulic conductivity k s estimation at a depth of 0 3 m using guelph permeameter gp the k s was measured in situ during the months of february to may of two consecutive years 2016 and 2017 over a 1 829 km stream reach of pavanje river where the stream comes across two vented dams in sequence sampling of k s was done as per the procedure followed by chen 2004 the gp tests were conducted along 40 transects across the channel see fig 3 during dry periods covering the upstream and downstream reaches of each vented dam the spacing between each transect was 50 m and in each transect for every 5 meter distance k s was determined a total of 187 k s test samples were collected from the sampling spots every year for the comparative evaluation of variability of k s over the upstream and downstream of vented dams the stream reach considered was divided into three segments see fig 3 the segment 1 is downstream of vented dam 1 segment 2 is the mid section which includes both the upstream and downstream environments and lastly the segment 3 is upstream of vented dam 2 the longitudinal extent of segments 1 2 and 3 was approximately about 500 729 and 600 m respectively before the study began the channel physiognomies like the type of substrate particles and width of the stream at each transect were surveyed the sediments deposited in the stream were poorly sorted and composed of loamy sand silt and fine to medium grained sand the stream reach considered is a sinuous channel with a meander bend in the upstream the width of stream varied from 18 to 50 m 3 2 guelph permeameter guelph permeameter designed by reynolds and elrick 1985 is a constant head permeameter based on well auger hole method and marriotte principle for precise measurements of in situ saturated hydraulic conductivity the procedure involves measuring the consistent rate of water flow into saturated stream sediments from a cylindrical well hole in which a constant depth head of water is maintained the k s measurements are made when a bulb of saturated soil is formed around the auger hole due to flow along both vertical gravity and lateral capillary directions depending on the soil type k s tests can be made within 30 min to 2 h utilizing just 3 0 liters of water the two head procedure was followed to get more accurate k s estimates the k s is calculated using the equations given below elrick and reynolds 1992 permeameter g u e l p h 2012 1 k s g 2 q 2 g 1 q 1 2 q 1 r 1 35 22 3 q 2 r 2 35 22 4 g 1 h 2 c 1 π 2 h 1 h 2 h 2 h 1 a 2 h 1 c 2 h 2 c 1 5 g 2 h 1 c 2 π 2 h 1 h 2 h 2 h 1 a 2 h 1 c 2 h 2 c 1 where r is steady state rate of fall of water in reservoirs cm s k s is sediment saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s a is borehole radius cm h 1 is the first head of water established in borehole cm h 2 is the second head of water established in borehole cm and c i is dimensionless shape factor that depends primarily on the h a ratio and according to the soil texture structure category macdonald et al 2012 lee et al 1985 and more and deka 2017 are few literature examples where guelph permeameter was used for estimation of k s in streambed sandy and sandy loam soils 3 3 statistical analysis 3 3 1 normality test an evaluation of the normality of data is essential for some statistical tests since normal data is a basic presumption in parametric testing the kolmogorov smirnov k s test massey jr 1951 lilliefors corrected k s test lilliefors 1967 shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 d agostino pearson test d agostino et al 1990 were used to determine whether k s data are normally distributed or not the k s test assesses the goodness of fit by comparing the standard normal distribution against the empirical cumulative distribution however k s test is regarded as less sensitive and is not recommended for testing normality nowadays ghasemi and zahediasl 2012 the lilliefors test a tailored version of k s test adjusts the k s statistic for small values at the tails of probability distribution and examines for a significant difference between the empirical cdf and the specified distribution shapiro wilk s w test is another similar normality test that effectively assesses the correlation between sample data and the corresponding ideal normal scores and is an unbiased estimator of goodness of fit to the standard normal distribution the d agostino pearson test is a versatile and powerful test against non normality arising from skewness and kurtosis its test statistic is based on a comparative evaluation of kurtosis and skewness coefficients of the sample data with that of the moments of a normal distribution quantified by pearson s coefficients the common null hypothesis of all these statistical tests is that the k s data has been drawn at random from a normal distribution as with most statistical tests a statistically significant p value typically 0 05 exhibits a strong evidence against the null hypothesis i e the sample distribution is non normal 3 3 2 test for equality of variances the non parametric tests levene s test levene 1960 for assessing homogeneity of variance and welch s t test welch 1947 for analyzing sample means were used to determine if streambed k s values differ significantly between two segments i e the upstream and downstream of vented dams of the river and between two sampling times the kruskal wallis test is advantageous when the data are not normally distributed however while using it to test whether the medians of two data groups are different it assumes that the observations in each group are from samples of same distribution so if the data of two groups have dissimilar distribution for instance the observations of one group is skewed to the left and another is skewed to the right and have different variances the results of kruskal wallis test may be unreliable if the distributions are heteroscedastic it is better to use levene s test or welch s t test for two groups instead of kruskal wallis test kao and green 2008 whenever the sample sizes are small or unequal and the standard deviations of the two groups are substantially different or unequal welch s t test is recommended under the null hypothesis that the difference between two population means is equal the welch s t test calculates a t statistic by adjusting the number of degrees of freedom even when the population variances are unequal the levene s test examines for homogeneity of variances under the null hypothesis that variances are equal across each set of samples 3 4 geostatistical analysis 3 4 1 spatial autocorrelation moran s i finding the spatial autocorrelation using moran s i index moran 1948 aids to examine whether the pattern of a phenomenon is clustered dispersed or random when analyzing spatial data moran s i index finds the correlation between the neighborhood values of a variable which are scattered in space in two or more dimensions the moran s i index is a parametric test which exhibits the spatial autocorrelation value in between 1 and 1 and generates a z score and p value to evaluate the level of autocorrelation a positive index value indicates that the data is spatially clustered while a negative index indicates dispersion in the present study the moran s i for different lags was determined to know the range of autocorrelation values as a function of distance the moran s i is calculated as 6 i n w i 1 n j 1 n w ij z i z j i 1 n z i 2 where n is number of observations z i x i x x is the value of the variable at location i and x is the mean value of the variable of interest w is the sum of weights w ij for all pairs in the system cliff and ord 1981 the inferential local moran s i statistic is represented as slope in the scatter plot which signposts the type and strength of spatial autocorrelation of a variable 3 4 2 spatial interpolation schemes 3 4 2 1 deterministic approach in the present study two deterministic spatial interpolation methods namely the inverse distance weighting idw and radial basis functions rbf were employed to generate the spatial distribution maps of streambed k s the idw scheme estimates the magnitude of a variable phenomenon at non sampled locations by taking the advantage of weighting i e the weight of any known point differs with the inverse square of its distance from the estimated point shepard 1968 the idw is a moving average interpolator based on search neighborhood strategy which doesn t account for spatial structure i e arrangement of the sampled points hence the efficiency of interpolation is dependent on spacing and density of the samples inverse distance weighting is arrived at using the formula johnston et al 2001 7 z s o i 1 n λ i z s i where z s o is the estimated value for unknown location s o n is the number of measured sample points z s i is the measured value at the location s i λ i are the weights assigned to each measured points which are determined by 8 λ i d io p i 1 n d io p with i 1 n λ i 1 where d io represents the distance between estimated location s o and each of the measured location s i p is the weighting power the rate of which falls off as the distance becomes larger the radial basis functions rbf belong to the category of exact interpolation technique with an ability to generalize scattered data to several space dimensions by expanding a linear combination of the basis functions with radial symmetry i e same span in all dimensions baxter 1992 rbf is established in terms of radial distance from a point 9 z x y w ϕ x x c 2 y y c 2 w ϕ x c w ϕ r where w is the weight of rbf determined from interpolation conditions c x c y c are the coordinates of the point or center and r is the spatial distance from neighborhood point in the xy plane to the center ϕ r r 0 may be any one of the basis functions there exists several options of rbfs namely thin plate spline completely regularized spline spline with tension multi quadratic and inverse multi quadratic spline whose shapes are different from one another and result in non identical interpolation surface the rbf estimated values can be above the maximum and below the minimum measured values whilst the values estimated from idw interpolation never crosses the upper and lower limits of measured values buhmann 2003 3 4 2 2 geostatistical approach kriging is the universally accepted best linear unbiased estimator since it takes regionalization into consideration the procedure involves exploratory statistical data analysis fitting suitable semivariogram model generation of prediction surface map and optionally provides some measures of certainty or accuracy by exploring a variance surface johnston et al 2001 the semivariogram models used in ordinary kriging ok are the mathematical forms used to describe the inherent spatial correlation structure in the data kriging weights for the neighborhood measured points are assigned based on the concept of spatial stationarity of the data quantified through semivariogram model the variance of estimation error is a resultant of the variogram type and the spatial scattering of measured neighborhood points the experimental variogram is generally composed with irregular scatter of neighborhood points due to large lag distance and tolerance and is different from that of theoretical variogram which is a plot of variance against lag fitted with a model curve goovaerts 1999 in the present study ok involving circular spherical pentaspherical exponential and guassian variogram models were tested to describe the semivariance the ok estimator for point estimation is arrived based on the mathematical relations given below 10 z p μ p where p x y is one of the sample location and z p is the value of the random variable of interest at that particular location μ is the fixed unknown mean for the data and p is the random error representing the variation around the mean which is intrinsically stationary when provided with n measurements z p 1 z p n at known locations p 1 p n the estimate z at an unsampled location p o is given as a weighted sum of the data 11 z p o i 1 n λ i z p i where λ i is an unknown weight for the measured value at the i th location to ensure unbiasedness condition for the unknown measurement the sum of the weights λ i must be equal to 1 i e i 1 n λ i 1 with the expected error e z p o z p o and measurement variance 12 var z p o e z p o z p o 2 13 2 i 1 n λ i γ p i p o i 1 n j 1 n λ i λ j γ p i p j where γ p i p j is the semivariance of z between the data points p i and p j and γ p i p o is the semivariance between the i th data point and the target point p o for comprehensive details related to geostatistics and the mathematical concepts of ok and semivariogram modeling one can refer to the following literatures webster and oliver 2007 kitanidis 1997 goovaerts 1997 4 results and discussion 4 1 grain size analysis and streambed k s values from in situ permeameter tests many varying conditions occur as a result of different geologic and geomorphic characteristics of a river the stream characteristics that can influence streambed hydraulic conductivity include the configuration of channel geometry floodplain connection streambed substrate characteristics like texture structure etc table 1 summarizes the channel characteristics of study reach the grain size distribution of sediments collected from each transect of the study reach was analyzed in terms of d50 median diameter which showed a good correlation with mean k s values of the corresponding transect coarse sediments tend to have a greater percentage of pore space and hence a lower density whilst the fine sediments usually contain a greater fraction of clay packed in the pore spaces between larger grains that affects the streambed k s as a support to this premise significant statistical correlation existed between the d50 median diameter and mean k s values of transects along the study reach with r 0 97 and 0 96 for samples of 2016 and 2017 respectively over the entire study reach d50 varied between 1 25 4 2 mm with reference to 2016 sediment samples and 1 4 4 15 mm for 2017 samples as expected d50 didn t exhibit a static or homogeneous distribution over the reach due to complex patterns of flow and sediment regime instigated by the existence of vented dams as a result of silt and particulate organic matter inputs from the floodplain and riparian vegetation the sediments of segment 1 had lower d50 values in the range 1 25 2 25 mm with respect to 2016 samples and 1 4 1 78 mm pertaining to 2017 samples the sediments of segment 2 sinuous channel and segment 3 meandering channel had moderate d50 values as presented in fig 4 the upstream of vented dam 2 i e the meandering streambed comprised with coarse sand and gravel due to sorting or deposition of coarse sediments at the upstream end of the reservoir whilst the fine silt and clay sediment deposition was observed near to the body of dam due to entrapping of coarse sediments above vented dam 2 the segment 2 suffers from shortage of coarse sediments and the surplus suspended sediment laden water overflowing from vented dam 2 contribute to fine sediment deposition downstream sedimentation in series of small reservoirs is dependent on the nature of stream flow geometry of the reservoirs and the distance between two reservoirs vented dams are known to affect the substrate physical composition distinct associations of several deposits and relative distribution and accumulation places in the stream the lateral accretion deposits are usually coarser than accumulates of vertical accretion however the deposits of channel fill or lag is comparatively finer than lateral accretion and coarser than vertical accretion accumulates the descriptive statistics of in situ measured streambed hydraulic conductivity k s along the three segments of the study reach measured at two different time periods are presented in table 2 to illustrate the overall variation in the k s distribution the magnitude of k s with reference to the three segments varied by two orders of magnitude the streambed k s along the stream reach varied from 11 634 cm day 793 886 cm day and 16 932 cm day 777 989 cm day during the sampling periods 2016 2017 respectively the longitudinal variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along every 50 m upstream and downstream of vented dams is presented in fig 4 it is evident that there exists significant differences in mean k s values of the upstream and downstream segments of vented dams progressive decrease and inconsistent mean k s values can be observed while getting away from the vented dam 1 towards downstream due to lateral accretion deposits spread out by second order stream confluence at around 50 m downstream of vented dam 2 an elevated mean k s is observed at this transect the mean k s values of all transects downstream of vented dam 1 varied between 31 85 188 98 cm day for 2016 samples and 35 77 192 09 cm day for 2017 samples similarly at segment 2 varied between 100 88 535 73 cm day for 2016 samples and 111 33 504 87 cm day for 2017 samples the mean k s values of all transects upstream of vented dam 2 varied between 473 59 755 39 cm day for 2016 samples and 377 39 753 31 cm day for 2017 samples the streambed k s samples of segment 3 had reasonable temporal variability due to episodic changes in substrate particles and organic matter inputs at the meander bend of stream which is evident from significant differences in the minimum and extreme values of k s 4 2 variability of streambed hydraulic conductivity along the study reach 4 2 1 statistical analysis the variation of k s data depicted via box plots presented in fig 5 allows to analyze the mean median range identify outliers extreme values and the dispersion represented via interquartile range the frequency distributions of k s data is graphically represented by histograms refer fig 6 wherein a normal distribution is hypothesized and tested through normality tests the results of kolmogorov smirnov k s k s with lilliefors correction shapiro wilk and d agostino pearson tests for k s measured at two time periods are provided in table 3 with reference to the full stretch of stream reach considered all the normality tests showed a p value less than 0 05 which signposts a non normal distribution of both k s and ln k s of two different time periods even after transforming the k s data by using natural log the distribution remained non normal due to inherent heterogeneity and significant field scale variability of k s across the study reach the k s data of segment 1 of the year 2016 was observed to have non normal distribution based on all test statistics however the ln transformed k s values were found to be normally distributed based on the k s and d agostino pearson tests for the same segment in the 2017 study period all the normality tests except shapiro wilk test accepted the null hypothesis of normal distribution of the ln transformed k s values at the segment 1 even though the realistic k s values were found to be non normal the k s test was the only one to confirm normality of k s values sampled from segment 2 during 2017 and segment 3 during 2016 with a fair p value 0 05 due to the skewed nature of k s data of segment 3 during 2017 all the normality tests rejected the null hypothesis of normal distribution of k s data at a significance level of 0 05 a distribution can deviate from that of normal due to lack of symmetry skewness kurtosis and mixture of distributions the empirical cdf curve of the k s test and the q q plots presented in fig 7 also portray that k s data follows a non normal distribution the results of levene s and welch s t tests table 4 infer that there exists significant differences in the variance and mean of streambed k s sampled from the three segments of the study reach the mean and variance of streambed k s samples measured at the upstream section of vented dams significantly varied from that of the downstream k s samples during both the study periods for instance the test statistic of levene s test conducted for testing equality of variance between samples of segments 1 and 2 of the year 2016 was relatively large with w 28 92 and p 0 the fluvial sedimentation on the upstream channel of the vented dams and the bed incision at the downstream which is however compensated during floods accompanied by retrogressive erosion are the main reasons for significant spatial variability of k s various kinds of valley deposits their physical composition distinct associations of several deposits relative distribution and accumulation places in the streams are some other related factors causing variability in streambed k s with respect to streambed k s of individual segments sampled at different time periods the levene s test failed to reject the null hypothesis at the 0 05 significance level table 4 thereby confirming the assumption of temporal homoscedasticity of streambed k s the welch s t test also accepted the null hypothesis that there was no significant differences in the central tendency of the k s values sampled between the two time periods in the study reach thereby discarding the rationale of temporal k s evolution the negative test statistic t values reflect that the sample mean was smaller than that of the hypothesized mean 4 2 2 geostatistical analysis the residual spatial autocorrelation between the samples of a variable in the geographical lattice can be detected through spatial correlogram which is usually a plot of moran s i as a function of distance or number of neighbors the moran s i coefficient between pand p lag is simply a slope of the least squares regression line that best fits the points each of the spatial neighborhood sensitivity plots in fig 8 is a distance based spatial correlogram revealing the moran s i across several neighborhood sizes a significant and positive spatial auto correlation was observed in the streambed k s patterns as represented by moran s i value close to 1 the moran s i was observed to diminish for the farthest neighbors from that of the reference point representing shrinking of spatial dependence the streambed k s patterns with reference to segments 1 and 2 showed a reasonable good spatial auto correlation up to 12 nearest neighbors as per non directional moran s i indices the spatial correlogram of the streambed k s patterns with respect to full stretch of the study reach had virtuous spatial influence up to 24 nearest neighbors the streambed k s patterns at the meandering stream section segment 3 was seen to have relatively weaker positive spatial auto correlation with distant neighbors the local moran s i scatterplot was used as an exploratory graphical tool for assessing the strength of spatial autocorrelation in the streambed k s data in the fig 9 scatter plots of moran s i are presented in which the slope of the regression line gives the local moran s i index the sign positive or negative of the moran s i index will be simply the sign of the slope of the regression line the streambed k s samples of two sampling periods were interpolated by incorporating the standard idw and completely regularized spline kernel based rbf interpolation methods using the geostatistical analyst wizard of arcgis 10 3 the root mean square error and kling gupta efficiency kge measures presented in table 5 were calculated based on the observed and predicted k s values assessed through cross validation by the idw and rbf methods the kge index ranges from to 1 which accounts for all the sources of systematic errors from different components i e bias correlation and variability gupta et al 2009 the kge of rbf estimates k s for the two periods were 0 985 and 0 978 respectively which necessarily represents a robust prediction or spatial interpolation fig 10 presents the prediction maps of streambed k s for two time periods using the idw and rbf methods with the use of sampled streambed k s values along the study reach experimental semivariograms were constructed to characterize the spatial variability of the sampled streambed k s using circular spherical pentaspherical exponential and gaussian semivariogram models however the results of only the best performing semivariograms are reported along with the streambed k s estimates and their estimation variance at the nodes semivariogram modeling and ordinary kriging analyses were performed in arcgis 10 3 through many simulation trials by using different semivariograms the best performing experimental semivariograms presented in table 6 of streambed k s for the study reach were found the nugget which represents the small scale variability or the measurement error is selected based on database and adjusted along with major axis and active lag distance for fitting the semivariogram model that appropriately captures the spatial distribution of k s data the lag parameters including the lag spacing and tolerance of the experimental variograms were tested for 9 12 15 and 21 number of nearest neighbors back to back the spatial autocorrelation was observed to drop significantly above 21 neighborhood spacings and the experimental semivariograms modelled by considering 15 nearest neighbors performed better for the k s samples of the year 2016 pentaspherical and circular semivariograms performed better than others tested with an rmse 42 976 46 751 cm day respectively and correspondingly for the k s data of 2017 the exponential and pentaspherical models provided better characterization of the spatial variability of streambed k s fig 11 demonstrates the fitted theoretical semivariograms against the empirical semivariance estimates of streambed k s the nugget to sill ratio or dependence ratio dr quantifies the degree of spatial autocorrelation and gives an idea of how much variance is successfully accounted in the semivariogram model a dr of less than 0 25 indicates a strong degree of spatial autocorrelation and if the dr ratio ranges between 0 25 and 0 75 it is regarded as moderate spatial association and lastly a dr 0 75 indicates weak spatial autocorrelation aidoo et al 2015 from the simulated semivariograms presented in table 6 which have very strong dependence ratio s krigged surface maps of streambed k s were generated for two time periods refer fig 12 among the three interpolation methods tested the rbf method was the one with lowest rmse and higher kge in all the cases the highly dense homogeneous network of samples contributed for relatively good performance of idw and rbf methods according to li and heap 2008 while modeling samples of dense homogeneous networks the geostatistical methods for instance ordinary kriging doesn t show superior spatial predictions than deterministic methods such as idw and rbf however the prediction uncertainty will be lower around the sampled values in ordinary kriging estimates compared to deterministic methods in fig 13 the taylor diagrams portray the relative performance of individual interpolation methods in simulating the spatial patterns of streambed k s the performance of all the three interpolation methods idw rbf and ok were marginally equal similar in terms of root mean square difference error rmsd standard deviation and correlation coefficient 4 3 discussion on influence of vented dams on streambed k s variability the presence of series of vented dams imparts particle size heterogeneity all along the direction of the stream and vertically within the bed cyclic scour and re deposition events over time and intrusion or settlement of fine sediments due to water stagnation behind dams can lead to changes in substrate composition all along the study reach statistically significant differences in streambed k s and substrate composition subsisted between upstream and downstream sections of vented dams significant differences also existed in streambed k s distribution at different transects within each segment of the study reach hydraulic conditions represented by head levels and duration of water storage behind the dams and the operational strategies were significant factors accounting for within channel k s differences the low k s zones at the tail water section downstream of vented dams occur due to the intrusion of fine sediments and organics into the pore spaces of a stable gravel substrate resulting in choking of hyporheic zones and anoxic conditions during periods of substrate movement induced by storm peaks the streambed is extremely dynamic to characterize a significant volume of bed load is being released and incorporated at the same time period anthropogenic disturbances to streambed via in stream gravel mining livestock washing contaminant release from laundry wash groundwater pumping for agricultural use are some significant factors to consider that lead to variability of k s there can be a surge of chemical substances and other nutrients released from anthropogenic activities due to river obstruction 5 conclusions it is expected that due to the obstruction caused by vented dams the coarse sediment load will be held back in the upstream reaches and the river will dig in near the tail end of vented dams to get stabilized in its course at the middle reach the array of channel adjustments that occur both upstream and downstream of vented dams are the factors responsible for the variability of streambed k s the movement of alluvial masses within the reservoir of vented dams is caused by phenomena of turbulent diffusion within the stream and especially by the action of internal circular currents turbulent diffusion currents occur in parts of the river having asymmetrical sections henceforth the streambed was heterogeneous with regard to hydraulic conductivity distribution due to an upset of equilibrium between supply and removal of sediments near the vented dam cross section the measures of central tendency and dispersion show that the streambed k s had reasonable spatial variability within the study reach with a minimum value of 11 63 cm day and the maximum being 793 88 cm day during the year 2016 and ranged between 16 93 and 777 98 cm day during the year 2017 the bedrock underlying the streambed and aquifer properties can also be the cause for low hydraulic conductivity at some sections of the stream the levene s and welch s t tests confirm the hypothesis of the significant spatial variability of streambed k s between the upstream and downstream reaches of the vented dams however significant temporal variability of streambed k s was not observed during the study period across all the three segments analysis of results demonstrates a strong influence of vented dam presence particularly on grain size and streambed k s distribution the spatial variability of streambed k s can be because of factors such as accretion or depletion of streambed elements local anomalies in substrate materials and river network which include precipitation and flow patterns underlying geology topography organic inputs natural and anthropogenic disturbances the moran s i index approved the presence of spatial dependence in the heterogeneous streambed k s samples the idw and rbf interpolation maps were more accurate than the krigged surface maps however the prediction uncertainty was lower around the sampled values in ordinary kriging estimates compared to deterministic methods this study was based on streambed k s data sampled during two consecutive years in

7237,extreme flows are key components of river flow regimes that affect manifold hydrological geomorphological and ecological processes with societal relevance one fundamental characteristic of extreme flows in river basins is that they exhibit scaling properties which can be identified through scaling power laws understanding the physical mechanisms behind such scaling laws is a continuing challenge in hydrology with potential implications for the prediction of river flow regimes in a changing environment and ungauged basins after highlighting that the scaling properties are sensitive to environmental change we develop a physical interpretation of how temporal changes in scaling exponents relate to the capacity of river basins to regulate extreme river flows regulation is defined here as the basins capacity to either dampen high flows or to enhance low flows further we use this framework to infer temporal changes in the regulation capacity of five large basins in tropical south america our results indicate that during the last few decades the amazon river basin has been reducing its capacity to enhance low flows likely as a consequence of pronounced environmental change in its south and south eastern sub basins the proposed framework is widely applicable to different basins and provides foundations for using scaling laws as empirical tools for inferring temporal changes of hydrological regulation particularly relevant for identifying and managing hydrological consequences of environmental change keywords spatial scaling low flow high flow large basin hydrological regulation amazon 1 introduction in last decades it has been recognized that many systems in nature exhibit scaling or fractal properties chave and levin 2003 enquist et al 2007 gupta et al 2007 havlin et al 1999 the scaling concept is rooted on the idea that the behavior of many systems involving both natural and social phenomena needs to be understood at multiple scales of space and time blöschl and sivapalan 1995 havlin et al 1999 and that those systems can have properties that do not vary within a wide range of scales i e scaling properties mandelbrot 1983 identifying scaling properties and their relationship with the underlying physical processes provide a basis for the understanding and prediction of complex systems operating at multiple scales chave and levin 2003 enquist et al 2007 gupta et al 2007 the scale invariance of a system property is a consequence of the system s internal dynamics self organization and implies power law correlation between the system response e g river flow in a river basin and a scale parameter e g drainage area gupta et al 1996 gupta 2004 in river basins scaling properties have been identified for mean vogel and

the world e g eaton et al 2002 gupta et al 2010 poveda et al 2007 suggests that they have a common mechanistic origin that has been related to conservation principles and the fractal nature of river networks brown et al 2002 gupta et al 2007 sivapalan 2006 understanding the physical mechanisms of runoff generation behind empirical scaling laws is a fundamental challenge of the scaling theory in hydrology ayalew et al 2014 gupta and dawdy 1995 gupta et al 2007 gupta et al 2010 medhi and tripathi 2015 with potential implications for the theoretical development of hydrology dooge 1986 gupta et al 1996 sivapalan 2005 as well as for applications in the prediction of river flows in ungauged basins the pub problem hrachowitz et al 2013 and in a changing environment the panta rhei debate highlighted by the international association of hydrological sciences iahs montanari et al 2013 advances in linking scaling properties and physical processes include the notable example of gupta and dawdy 1995 who hypothesized that scaling exponents are indicators of differences between rainfall generated and snowmelt generated floods despite this and recent advances e g ayalew et al 2014 medhi and tripathi 2015 linking the scaling exponents with physical processes remains a continuing challenge further from the panta rhei perspective hydrological processes cannot be generally assumed as stationary montanari et al 2013 and all basins might be considered as ungauged gupta et al 2007 in the sense that the future will not necessarily resemble observations poveda and álvarez 2012 sivapalan et al 2003 however the assumption of time stationarity is inherent to many studies that consider scaling properties of long term river flow statistics an important exception is the study of lima and lall 2010 who proposed a framework for estimating uncertainty in hydrological scaling relationships and potential non stationarity due to climate change and other factors this assumption implies for example that the expected value of extreme river flows or first order statistical moment e q i k with k 1 as well as the scaling coefficient and exponent in eq 1 do not change with time which may not be valid for river flow regimes with significant alterations due to environmental change e g piao et al 2007 sterling et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 in this study we introduce a widely applicable physical interpretation that relates non stationarity in scaling laws with changes in the capacity of river basins to regulate extreme river flows section 3 regulation is defined here as the capacity of river basins to ameliorate extreme flows i e to dampen amplify high low flows more details in section 3 then we use river flow records to assess whether the scaling laws relating extreme river flows with drainage area agree with the stationarity assumption in five large basins of tropical south america and apply our proposed framework to interpret non stationarity in terms of changing regulation section 4 finally we discuss the potential mechanisms behind regulation change section 5 and conclude section 6 2 data and methods 2 1 data we fitted scaling laws eq 1 for five large river basins in tropical south america the amazon as a whole and three of its major tributaries treated as independent basins negro solimoes and madeira as well as the magdalena river basin in colombia the tapajos and xingu basins other major tributaries of the amazon were excluded because they did not have enough data to perform a time series analysis all river basins included in this study have gauging networks that cover multiple spatial scales fig 1 as required for the implementation of scaling analysis we used river flow records provided by the so hybam project cochonneau et al 2006 http www ore hybam org index php esl for the amazon basin and the institute for environmental and meteorological studies of colombia ideam http www ideam gov co for the magdalena basin these data include 58 gauging stations in the magdalena river basin covering a 38 year period 1974 2011 and 103 gauging stations in the amazon river basin and its tributaries covering the same 38 year period drainage areas range between 109 and 264 647 km2 in the magdalena and between 1 617 and 4680 000 km2 in the amazon detailed information of all gauging stations in table s1 for every gauging station we extracted time series for annual low and high flows low high flows were defined as the lowest highest daily river flow for each year for our analysis we only considered years with less than 12 5 missing data equivalent to half a 4 months season data from the land use harmonization project hurtt et al 2011 was reclassified according to the orchidee data assimilation system table s7 and used to support our discussion about forest loss in the amazon section 5 2 to further support this discussion we used data about dams from fundación proteger international rivers and ecoa http www dams info org the red amazónica de información socioambiental georreferenciada http raisg2 socioambiental org and national databases of colombia table s8 2 2 estimation of scaling laws power laws were fitted using 3 year moving average extreme river flows for all basins to evaluate potential changes in scaling parameters with time all fitted laws followed the general power law eq 1 which log transformed with k 1 is equivalent to 2 ln e q i ln α i β i ln a where e q i are 3 year moving average river flows for low i l or high i f flows and other factors are the same as in eq 1 the scaling coefficient α i and exponent β i were obtained through linear regressions fitted using the standard least squares method the statistical significance of these regressions was evaluated using t tests and mann whitney wilcoxon tests with a significant level of α 0 05 for each basin time series of scaling coefficients and exponents for low and high flows were obtained tables s2 s6 to investigate temporal changes of the scaling laws we tested for significant trends slope different from 0 0 in the time series of scaling parameters using t tests and the non parametric mann kendall trend test both at a significance level of α 0 05 3 conceptual framework for inferring changes in extreme river flows regulation from scaling laws the scaling properties of river flows values of the coefficient and scaling exponent cannot always be assumed as either static they can vary with time or universal they can vary with space e g among different basins this is a consequence of river flow generating processes being spatially heterogeneous dynamic and sensitive to environmental change piao et al 2007 sterling et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 this together with the idea that scaling properties relate to the capacity of river basins to regulate their flow regime i e to reduce the severity of extreme river flows by means of dampening high flows and amplifying low flows salazar et al 2018 imply that temporal variations in the scaling properties can be related to changes in the capacity of river basins for regulating their extreme river flows to account for temporal variations traditional scaling laws eq 1 with k 1 should be written as 3 e q i α i t a β i t with α i t and β i t being time dependent i l or i f here we assume that a is time stationary which is reasonable for policy relevant timescales years to decades for simplicity in the equations we leave implicit that e q i can vary with time too 3 1 regulation of high river flows the scaling exponent β f t describes how high flow grows with increasing spatial scale in a river basin downstream the river network and such growth can be either a dampening or amplification process depending on the value of β f t salazar et al 2018 if a basin has regulation capacity then high flows are dampened as the spatial scale increases therefore temporal changes in the value of the scaling exponent β f t are indicative of variations in the capacity of a river basin to regulate high river flows dampening of high flows does not mean reducing e q f as the spatial scale increases river flows generally increase downstream as a consequence of mass continuity but reducing the rate at which river flows grow with space 4 e q f a α f t β f t a β f t 1 a reduction of this growth rate means that the production of high flow per unit area is smaller in the lower part of the basin than it is in the upper part this spatial difference in high flow production is characteristic of a dampening process that describes the capacity of a basin to ameliorate high flows mathematically this behavior is summarized by the scaling exponent β f t because it determines whether e q f a increases or decreases with a this follows from the sign of the second derivative 5 2 e q f a 2 α f t β f t β f t 1 a β f t 2 which is entirely determined by the value of the scaling exponent 6 2 e q f a 2 0 if 0 β f t 1 regulation high flows dampening 0 if β f t 1 critical point 0 if β f t 1 unregulation high flows amplification the occurrence of high flows dampening or amplification in a river basin is described by the value of β f t relative to the critical value β f 1 this value represents a critical point that distinguishes the functional form of the power law eq 3 between concave β f t 1 and convex β f t 1 in a therefore a temporal change from β f t 1 to β f t 1 indicates that a river basin has transitioned from a state in which high flows are dampened regulated to a state in which they are amplified non regulated and a temporal increase decrease of β f t represents a weakening strengthening of the capacity of a river basin to regulate high flows from this perspective a temporal trend in β f t represented by 7 β f t δ t β f t 0 d β f t dt δ t with d β f t dt 0 indicates weakening or strengthening of the regulation capacity if d β f t dt 0 or d β f t dt 0 respectively β f t 0 is defined here as the value of the scaling exponent for high flows at the initial time t 0 and t δ t represents a time step δ t after t 3 2 regulation of low river flows in contrast to high flows regulation of low flows does not require a dampening but rather an amplification process regulation means that a basin has the capacity to amplify low flows with increasing spatial scale this behavior is mathematically represented by the spatial rate of change 8 2 e q l a 2 α l t β l t β l t 1 a β l t 2 whose sign depends entirely on the value of the scaling exponent β l t as follows 9 2 e q l a 2 0 if 0 β l t 1 unregulation low flows dampening 0 if β l t 1 critical point 0 if β l t 1 regulation low flows amplification contrary to the case of high flows values of the scaling exponent β l t above 1 indicate the capacity of a river basin to regulate amplify low flows therefore a decrease increase of the value of β l t with time represents a weakening strengthening of the capacity of a river basin to ameliorate to increase low flows with spatial scale therefore a temporal change from β l t 1 to β l t 1 indicates a shift from regulation to unregulation in the capacity of a river basin to regulate low flows and a temporal trend in β l t represented by 10 β l t δ t β l t 0 d β l t dt δ t with d β l t dt 0 indicates weakening or strengthening of the basin s capacity for regulating low flows if d β l t dt 0 or d β l t dt 0 respectively β l t 0 represents the value of the low flow scaling exponent at the initial time notably the interpretation of this trend is opposite in sign to that of high flows 4 scaling laws and river flows regulation change in large basins of tropical south america the scaling properties coefficients and exponents of extreme river flows have changed through time as evidenced by changes in the scaling laws during the study period fig 2 and figs s1 s10 as well as by the statistical distribution of all of the estimated scaling exponents fig 3 these temporal variations confirm that scaling properties are non stationary indicating that the mechanisms that affect the production of extreme river flows have also changed with time in the studied basins this non stationarity in the scaling properties is consistent with and potentially relates to large human induced alterations of both the amazon davidson et al 2012 and magdalena restrepo et al 2006 river basins this will be discussed in section 5 2 depending on the distribution of the scaling exponents values fig 3 the studied basins can be classified in two different groups basins in the first group negro solimoes and amazon green rectangles in fig 3 are characterized by the condition that β l t 1 β f t which is persistent throughout the observation period based on eqs 6 and 9 this distribution of the scaling exponents β f t 1 and β l t 1 indicates persistent regulation of both high and low flows basins in this group have maintained their capacity for regulating extreme river flows i e their dual capacity for dampening high flows β f t 1 and amplifying low flows β l t 1 the second group includes basins madeira and magdalena red rectangles in fig 3 in which regulation of extreme river flows has been less prevalent as indicated by the distribution of the scaling exponents in these two basins high flows have remained regulated β f t 1 but low flows have not always been regulated with 61 and 34 of cases with β l t 1 in madeira and magdalena respectively in accordance with eqs 6 and 9 this indicates that the madeira and magdalena basins have maintained their capacity to dampen high flows while their capacity to amplify low flows has been less prevalent during the observation period these two basins have been closer to the critical point β l 1 in which low flows amplification and dampening processes are shifted eq 9 indeed β l t 1 describes cases in which these basins have not amplified but dampened low flows the regulation capacity has been changing differently among the basins and also between high and low flows most river basins exhibit significant trends in the temporal evolution of their scaling properties fig 4 in all but the negro basin the scaling parameters all of the exponents and some of the coefficients exhibit significant trends along the 1974 2011 period based on eqs 7 and 10 trends in the scaling exponents right column of fig 4 indicate either strengthening or weakening of the basins regulation capacity through time in the solimoes basin scaling exponents for low flows have been increasing and exponents for high flows have been decreasing through the observation period these trends are consistent with an strengthening of the basin s capacity for regulating both high and low flows as indicated by eqs 7 and 10 with d β f t dt 0 and d β l t dt 0 respectively in the amazon and madeira basins the scaling exponents for both high and low flows have been decreasing with time this implies contrasting effects for the regulation of high and low flows in these basins d β f t dt 0 indicates strengthening of the capacity for regulating high flows while d β l t dt 0 indicates weakening of low flows regulation trends in the magdalena river basin d β l t dt 0 and d β f t dt 0 indicate that the regulation capacity for low high flows has been strengthening weakening figs 5 and 6 show the estimated variations of the spatial growth rates of high and low flows respectively at different times around the beginning 1977 and end 2010 of the study period fig 5 confirms that all basins have maintained their capacity to dampen high flows in all cases e q f a decreases with a in contrast not all basins have maintained their capacity to amplify low flows throug the study period fig 6 the most noticeable changes have occurred in the madeira and magdalena basins where dampening and amplification processes have shifted as indicated by a reversal of the e q l a vs a curve concavity madeira has shifted from a state in which low flows were amplified e q l a increases with a in 1977 to one in which they are dampened e q l a decreases with a in 2010 this shift from a regulated to an unregulated state is consistent with the interpretation of the negative trend in β l t as a weakening of the basin s capacity to amplify regulate low flows fig 4 notably madeira is the only basin in which the value of the scaling exponent for low flows has shifted in time from β l t 1 to β l t 1 contrary to madeira the magdalena basin has experienced an increase in their capacity to regulate low flows as indicated by its positive trend in β l t fig 4 as well as by the concavity change in the e q l a vs a curve fig 6 such changes are consistent with a shift from an unregulated state in which low flows are dampened β l t 1 to a regulated state in which low flows are amplified β l t 1 however values of β l t in the magdalena basin have remained close the critical value β l 1 fig 3 notably in the amazon river basin as a whole the negative trend in β l t fig 4 indicates that the basin s capacity to amplify low flows has been decreasing and therefore the state of the basin has been approaching the critical point in which β l 1 and the e q l a vs a curve has been approaching an horizontal line fig 6 a continuation of this trend would lead to a transition from amplification regulation to dampening unregulation of low flows in the whole amazon basin as already occurred in the madeira basin fig 4 5 discussion 5 1 water storage and release dynamics a first level explanation of regulation a river basin system is a complex system which is not isolated from the surrounding environment so its response e g river flows is not independent of external forcings e g large scale climatic variations however the capacity of such a system to regulate its response is an internal property i e it can only be a consequence of the system s internal dynamics otherwise if the system s response were entirely determined by external forcings e g if variations in river flows were entirely determined by variations in large scale climatic phenomena then its regulation capacity would be null all these imply that defining the boundaries of a basin system i e defining what is internal or external to the system is crucial for understanding its regulation capacity an usual perspective to study the hydrological response of river basins is to consider only the land surface part of the water balance and therefore to assume that precipitation and evapotranspiration fluxes are not internal to the system applied to a large basin this view implicitly assumes that precipitation is independent of processes occurring within the same basin e g land cover change this assumption is challenged by increasing scientific evidence that for example forest cover change can significantly alter precipitation patterns in tropical south america lawrence and vandecar 2015 spracklen and garcia carreras 2015 zemp et al 2017 and that a large amount of terrestrial precipitation is recycled i e it originates from land evapotranspiration van der ent et al 2010 which may be a crucial feedback mechanism in the water balance of large basins such as the amazon eltahir and bras 1994 indeed disregarding such land atmosphere interactions may lead to contradictory model results about the effect of forest loss on river flows coe et al 2009 here we adopt the same view that we proposed in salazar et al 2018 in which the control volume for a basin s water balance comprises the coupled land atmosphere system and therefore precipitation p and evapotranspiration e are treated as internal fluxes fig 7 this view is consistent with evidence that the potential impact of forests cover change on river flows can occur not only through effects on surface properties e g infiltrability zimmermann et al 2006 but also through effects on precipitation patterns coe et al 2009 lawrence and vandecar 2015 spracklen and garcia carreras 2015 zemp et al 2017 the importance of land atmosphere interactions for the continental water balance in tropical south america is further highlighted by increasing evidence that forest loss could force the amazon beyond a tipping point boers et al 2017 lovejoy and nobre 2018 from this perspective fig 7 river flows r are affected by external forcings through their influence on the net atmospheric moisture convergence q and depend on the system s internal dynamics that determine the occurrence of non equilibrium states in which q r water is stored within the system or q r previously stored water is released these alternative behaviors are determinant for high and low flows regulation regulation of high flows dampening of floods is a consequence of the capacity of river basins to retain store water during wet seasons this is analogous to the capacity of flood control reservoirs to reduce high flows via water storage regulation of low flows amplification results from a related but not identical capacity of river basins to store water during wet seasons releasing it into streams during dry seasons this is also analogous to the capacity of artificial reservoirs to increase low flows through a combination of water storage and controlled release high flows dampening regulation is described by β f t 1 because it implies that e q f a decreases with a this dampening can only occur if the river basin system retains water d s l s a dt 0 particularly when the atmospheric moisture convergence is large q f r f under script f refers to fluxes associated with high flows or floods even under the same external forcing q f a river basin can behave as regulated or unregulated depending on its internal dynamics because it determines whether water storage s l s a increases or decreases fig 8 low flows amplification regulation is described by β l t 1 because it implies that e q l a increases with a this amplification occurs when the atmospheric moisture convergence is small dry season and a river basin system releases water that was previously stored during the wet season consistent with d s l s a dt 0 and q l r l under script l relates to low flows for a given external forcing q l the occurrence of such an amplification process depends on the internal dynamics that determines whether a river basin releases d s l s a dt 0 or retains d s l s a dt 0 water fig 9 variations in how a river basin system stores and releases water allow the occurrence of different extreme flow regimes even under the same external forcings figs 8 and 9 this is because both amplification and dampening processes can occur for any given input of water q depending on the spatial aggregation of processes runoff generating processes occurring within the basin system therefore environmental change impacts on the water storage and release dynamics i e on the spatial and temporal distribution of water within the system in river basins can cause transitions which are revealed by variations of the scaling exponents section 3 between regulated and unregulated extreme flow regimes 5 2 environmental change impacts on regulation the factors that affect water storage and release dynamics in large river basins are manifold can be natural or human induced and are not equally sensitive to environmental change for instance geological e g soil types and aquifers structure and morphological e g basin size and shape properties exert important effects on regulation because of their influence on surface hydrology and groundwater dynamics bruijnzeel 2004 miguez macho and fan 2012 however such a properties are not highly sensitive to environmental change and therefore it is unlikely that temporal variations in basins regulation capacity result from changes in for instance aquifers structure and or drainage areas instead it is more likely that regulation changes in a basin are associated with variations in properties that meet two conditions to be significantly influential on river flow regimes and to be sensitive to environmental change especially at policy relevant time scales basin properties affected by land cover change piao et al 2007 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 sterling et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 and rivers damming poff et al 2007 meet these conditions in many basins of the world and particularly in the amazon and magdalena basins restrepo et al 2006 davidson et al 2012 latrubesse et al 2017 the most pronounced reduction in regulation capacity has occurred for low flows in the madeira basin d β l dt 0 fig 4 resulting in a transition from a regulated state in which low flows are amplified β l t 1 to an unregulated state in which they are dampened β l t 1 among the amazon tributaries the madeira basin has also experienced the most pronounced land cover change specifically forest loss fig s11 trancoso et al 2009 and a continuing increase in the presence of dams fig s12 latrubesse et al 2017 a reduction of regulation capacity with decreasing forest cover is consistent with our hypothesis of the forest reservoir which describes the natural capacity of river basins specially in the amazon to store water and control its release through land atmosphere interactions mainly precipitation recycling that depend strongly on the presence of forests and weaken with forest loss salazar et al 2018 it might seem counterintuitive that an increased presence of dams coincides with a reduced regulation of low flows in the madeira basin however construction of dams does not necessarily enhance and may even reduce the regulation capacity of large river basins reasons for this are first that the environmental impacts of damming large rivers amazonian rivers do not occur only in the vicinity of each dam but can spread throughout the whole river basin latrubesse et al 2017 second that in a large and relatively flat basin the madeira basin the volume of artificial reservoirs is relatively small as compared to the magnitude of river flows even low flows and therefore their regulation capacity is limited third the operation rules of dams can be and typically are based on criteria other than hydrological regulation such as economic criteria poff et al 2016 an fourth the construction of dam reservoir systems is usually linked to other human activities e g road construction and associated agricultural expansion and deforestation soares filho et al 2006 trancoso et al 2009 finer and jenkins 2012 that can have widespread impacts on the natural capacity of river basins to regulate river flows a related counterintuitive effect was observed in the nakambe river africa in which the severity of floods has increased with time despite a decrease in precipitation and an increase in the number of dams in the river mahe et al 2005 all this points out that the potential effects of dam reservoir systems on river flow regulation may be contrasting and are not limited to neither the space in the vicinity of dams nor the time immediately after dams construction low flows regulation has also weakened in the whole amazon basin d β l dt 0 but not in the solimoes and negro basins d β l dt 0 fig 4 this indicates that such regulation weakening in the amazon is attributable to a corresponding weakening in their southern and eastern tributaries some of these tributaries including the madeira basin have experienced the highest rates of forest loss especially along the so called arc of deforestation trancoso et al 2009 and contain the largest dams in the amazon basin latrubesse et al 2017 this is consistent with our idea that regulation weakening in the madeira and amazon basins is likely related to forest loss a weakening of the natural forest reservoir salazar et al 2018 in spite of or in addition to the contrasting impacts of damming amazonian rivers the magdalena river basin has also experienced intensive deforestation this is not included in fig s11 because the data is too coarse for this basin which is about 5 6 times smaller than the madeira basin and damming of rivers restrepo and syvitski 2006 as in the madeira basin in the magdalena basin a weak capacity to regulate low flows fig 3 coincides with a relatively low forest cover equivalent to less than 30 of the drainage area in 1990 restrepo and syvitski 2006 which again agrees with our hypothesis of relating regulation to forest cover in large basins salazar et al 2018 however in contrast to madeira there is not a low flow regulation weakening trend in magdalena figs 4 and 6 we think that this contrast is related to four fundamental differences between both basins first while madeira has experienced increasing deforestation and damming during our study period 1974 2011 most dams in the magdalena basin were constructed before 1974 fig s12 and a very large fraction of the basin was already deforested by 1974 restrepo and syvitski 2006 the impacts of these old deforestation and damming may be related to the reduced capacity of the magdalena basin for regulating low flows fig 3 but cannot be directly related to regulation trends during our study period second while deforestation in the madeira basin has been substantially concentrated around the arc of deforestation aguiar et al 2007 deforestation in the magdalena basin has occurred in sparser areas restrepo and syvitski 2006 further complex social factors such as the armed conflict in colombia may have unintentionally promoted forest recovery in the andes particularly between 2001 and 2010 sánchez cuervo et al 2012 third the smaller size and steeper topography of the magdalena basin allow for artificial reservoirs to have a relatively larger volume and therefore and enhanced regulation capacity this may have had an impact on the observed increase in the low flows regulation capacity in the magdalena basin figs 4 and 6 but uncertainties about the operation rules of reservoirs do not allow to confirm this fourth there is a fundamental difference in how the madeira and magdalena basins are fed by moisture from the neighboring oceans through the atmosphere precipitation in the madeira basin depends on atmospheric moisture transported from the atlantic ocean through the continent over very long distances on the order of 10 3 km whereby precipitation recycling likely plays a crucial role zemp et al 2014 zemp et al 2017 in contrast the magdalena river flows approximately parallel to ocean sources the pacific ocean and caribbean sea of continental precipitation poveda et al 2014 this difference implies that precipitation over the madeira basin may be more sensitive to impacts of deforestation not only within the basin but also in surrounding areas which can propagate throughout the continent spracklen and garcia carreras 2015 zemp et al 2014 zemp et al 2017 6 conclusions we have developed a conceptual framework for inferring changes in the capacity of river basins to regulate extreme river flows from temporal changes in their scaling properties in particular a weakening of high or low flows regulation is associated respectively with an increase or decrease of the corresponding scaling exponent this framework is widely applicable to different basins because it is only based on the general assumption that extreme river flows scale with drainage area in river basins after applying the proposed conceptual framework to five large basins in tropical south america we found evidence of changes in their hydrological regulation capacity of particular importance is that the madeira and magdalena river basins have the lower capacity to regulate i e amplify low flows and that this capacity has been reducing in the amazon basin as a whole since the basins regulation capacity depends on how water is stored and released the observed changes in the scaling properties can be conceptually related to environmental change processes such as deforestation and damming of rivers although more detailed studies are required to characterize temporal changes of hydrological regimes and their causes our study provides widely applicable foundations for using the scaling laws as empirical tools for inferring temporal changes of hydrological regulation more generally our

7237,extreme flows are key components of river flow regimes that affect manifold hydrological geomorphological and ecological processes with societal relevance one fundamental characteristic of extreme flows in river basins is that they exhibit scaling properties which can be identified through scaling power laws understanding the physical mechanisms behind such scaling laws is a continuing challenge in hydrology with potential implications for the prediction of river flow regimes in a changing environment and ungauged basins after highlighting that the scaling properties are sensitive to environmental change we develop a physical interpretation of how temporal changes in scaling exponents relate to the capacity of river basins to regulate extreme river flows regulation is defined here as the basins capacity to either dampen high flows or to enhance low flows further we use this framework to infer temporal changes in the regulation capacity of five large basins in tropical south america our results indicate that during the last few decades the amazon river basin has been reducing its capacity to enhance low flows likely as a consequence of pronounced environmental change in its south and south eastern sub basins the proposed framework is widely applicable to different basins and provides foundations for using scaling laws as empirical tools for inferring temporal changes of hydrological regulation particularly relevant for identifying and managing hydrological consequences of environmental change keywords spatial scaling low flow high flow large basin hydrological regulation amazon 1 introduction in last decades it has been recognized that many systems in nature exhibit scaling or fractal properties chave and levin 2003 enquist et al 2007 gupta et al 2007 havlin et al 1999 the scaling concept is rooted on the idea that the behavior of many systems involving both natural and social phenomena needs to be understood at multiple scales of space and time blöschl and sivapalan 1995 havlin et al 1999 and that those systems can have properties that do not vary within a wide range of scales i e scaling properties mandelbrot 1983 identifying scaling properties and their relationship with the underlying physical processes provide a basis for the understanding and prediction of complex systems operating at multiple scales chave and levin 2003 enquist et al 2007 gupta et al 2007 the scale invariance of a system property is a consequence of the system s internal dynamics self organization and implies power law correlation between the system response e g river flow in a river basin and a scale parameter e g drainage area gupta et al 1996 gupta 2004 in river basins scaling properties have been identified for mean vogel and

the world e g eaton et al 2002 gupta et al 2010 poveda et al 2007 suggests that they have a common mechanistic origin that has been related to conservation principles and the fractal nature of river networks brown et al 2002 gupta et al 2007 sivapalan 2006 understanding the physical mechanisms of runoff generation behind empirical scaling laws is a fundamental challenge of the scaling theory in hydrology ayalew et al 2014 gupta and dawdy 1995 gupta et al 2007 gupta et al 2010 medhi and tripathi 2015 with potential implications for the theoretical development of hydrology dooge 1986 gupta et al 1996 sivapalan 2005 as well as for applications in the prediction of river flows in ungauged basins the pub problem hrachowitz et al 2013 and in a changing environment the panta rhei debate highlighted by the international association of hydrological sciences iahs montanari et al 2013 advances in linking scaling properties and physical processes include the notable example of gupta and dawdy 1995 who hypothesized that scaling exponents are indicators of differences between rainfall generated and snowmelt generated floods despite this and recent advances e g ayalew et al 2014 medhi and tripathi 2015 linking the scaling exponents with physical processes remains a continuing challenge further from the panta rhei perspective hydrological processes cannot be generally assumed as stationary montanari et al 2013 and all basins might be considered as ungauged gupta et al 2007 in the sense that the future will not necessarily resemble observations poveda and álvarez 2012 sivapalan et al 2003 however the assumption of time stationarity is inherent to many studies that consider scaling properties of long term river flow statistics an important exception is the study of lima and lall 2010 who proposed a framework for estimating uncertainty in hydrological scaling relationships and potential non stationarity due to climate change and other factors this assumption implies for example that the expected value of extreme river flows or first order statistical moment e q i k with k 1 as well as the scaling coefficient and exponent in eq 1 do not change with time which may not be valid for river flow regimes with significant alterations due to environmental change e g piao et al 2007 sterling et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 in this study we introduce a widely applicable physical interpretation that relates non stationarity in scaling laws with changes in the capacity of river basins to regulate extreme river flows section 3 regulation is defined here as the capacity of river basins to ameliorate extreme flows i e to dampen amplify high low flows more details in section 3 then we use river flow records to assess whether the scaling laws relating extreme river flows with drainage area agree with the stationarity assumption in five large basins of tropical south america and apply our proposed framework to interpret non stationarity in terms of changing regulation section 4 finally we discuss the potential mechanisms behind regulation change section 5 and conclude section 6 2 data and methods 2 1 data we fitted scaling laws eq 1 for five large river basins in tropical south america the amazon as a whole and three of its major tributaries treated as independent basins negro solimoes and madeira as well as the magdalena river basin in colombia the tapajos and xingu basins other major tributaries of the amazon were excluded because they did not have enough data to perform a time series analysis all river basins included in this study have gauging networks that cover multiple spatial scales fig 1 as required for the implementation of scaling analysis we used river flow records provided by the so hybam project cochonneau et al 2006 http www ore hybam org index php esl for the amazon basin and the institute for environmental and meteorological studies of colombia ideam http www ideam gov co for the magdalena basin these data include 58 gauging stations in the magdalena river basin covering a 38 year period 1974 2011 and 103 gauging stations in the amazon river basin and its tributaries covering the same 38 year period drainage areas range between 109 and 264 647 km2 in the magdalena and between 1 617 and 4680 000 km2 in the amazon detailed information of all gauging stations in table s1 for every gauging station we extracted time series for annual low and high flows low high flows were defined as the lowest highest daily river flow for each year for our analysis we only considered years with less than 12 5 missing data equivalent to half a 4 months season data from the land use harmonization project hurtt et al 2011 was reclassified according to the orchidee data assimilation system table s7 and used to support our discussion about forest loss in the amazon section 5 2 to further support this discussion we used data about dams from fundación proteger international rivers and ecoa http www dams info org the red amazónica de información socioambiental georreferenciada http raisg2 socioambiental org and national databases of colombia table s8 2 2 estimation of scaling laws power laws were fitted using 3 year moving average extreme river flows for all basins to evaluate potential changes in scaling parameters with time all fitted laws followed the general power law eq 1 which log transformed with k 1 is equivalent to 2 ln e q i ln α i β i ln a where e q i are 3 year moving average river flows for low i l or high i f flows and other factors are the same as in eq 1 the scaling coefficient α i and exponent β i were obtained through linear regressions fitted using the standard least squares method the statistical significance of these regressions was evaluated using t tests and mann whitney wilcoxon tests with a significant level of α 0 05 for each basin time series of scaling coefficients and exponents for low and high flows were obtained tables s2 s6 to investigate temporal changes of the scaling laws we tested for significant trends slope different from 0 0 in the time series of scaling parameters using t tests and the non parametric mann kendall trend test both at a significance level of α 0 05 3 conceptual framework for inferring changes in extreme river flows regulation from scaling laws the scaling properties of river flows values of the coefficient and scaling exponent cannot always be assumed as either static they can vary with time or universal they can vary with space e g among different basins this is a consequence of river flow generating processes being spatially heterogeneous dynamic and sensitive to environmental change piao et al 2007 sterling et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 this together with the idea that scaling properties relate to the capacity of river basins to regulate their flow regime i e to reduce the severity of extreme river flows by means of dampening high flows and amplifying low flows salazar et al 2018 imply that temporal variations in the scaling properties can be related to changes in the capacity of river basins for regulating their extreme river flows to account for temporal variations traditional scaling laws eq 1 with k 1 should be written as 3 e q i α i t a β i t with α i t and β i t being time dependent i l or i f here we assume that a is time stationary which is reasonable for policy relevant timescales years to decades for simplicity in the equations we leave implicit that e q i can vary with time too 3 1 regulation of high river flows the scaling exponent β f t describes how high flow grows with increasing spatial scale in a river basin downstream the river network and such growth can be either a dampening or amplification process depending on the value of β f t salazar et al 2018 if a basin has regulation capacity then high flows are dampened as the spatial scale increases therefore temporal changes in the value of the scaling exponent β f t are indicative of variations in the capacity of a river basin to regulate high river flows dampening of high flows does not mean reducing e q f as the spatial scale increases river flows generally increase downstream as a consequence of mass continuity but reducing the rate at which river flows grow with space 4 e q f a α f t β f t a β f t 1 a reduction of this growth rate means that the production of high flow per unit area is smaller in the lower part of the basin than it is in the upper part this spatial difference in high flow production is characteristic of a dampening process that describes the capacity of a basin to ameliorate high flows mathematically this behavior is summarized by the scaling exponent β f t because it determines whether e q f a increases or decreases with a this follows from the sign of the second derivative 5 2 e q f a 2 α f t β f t β f t 1 a β f t 2 which is entirely determined by the value of the scaling exponent 6 2 e q f a 2 0 if 0 β f t 1 regulation high flows dampening 0 if β f t 1 critical point 0 if β f t 1 unregulation high flows amplification the occurrence of high flows dampening or amplification in a river basin is described by the value of β f t relative to the critical value β f 1 this value represents a critical point that distinguishes the functional form of the power law eq 3 between concave β f t 1 and convex β f t 1 in a therefore a temporal change from β f t 1 to β f t 1 indicates that a river basin has transitioned from a state in which high flows are dampened regulated to a state in which they are amplified non regulated and a temporal increase decrease of β f t represents a weakening strengthening of the capacity of a river basin to regulate high flows from this perspective a temporal trend in β f t represented by 7 β f t δ t β f t 0 d β f t dt δ t with d β f t dt 0 indicates weakening or strengthening of the regulation capacity if d β f t dt 0 or d β f t dt 0 respectively β f t 0 is defined here as the value of the scaling exponent for high flows at the initial time t 0 and t δ t represents a time step δ t after t 3 2 regulation of low river flows in contrast to high flows regulation of low flows does not require a dampening but rather an amplification process regulation means that a basin has the capacity to amplify low flows with increasing spatial scale this behavior is mathematically represented by the spatial rate of change 8 2 e q l a 2 α l t β l t β l t 1 a β l t 2 whose sign depends entirely on the value of the scaling exponent β l t as follows 9 2 e q l a 2 0 if 0 β l t 1 unregulation low flows dampening 0 if β l t 1 critical point 0 if β l t 1 regulation low flows amplification contrary to the case of high flows values of the scaling exponent β l t above 1 indicate the capacity of a river basin to regulate amplify low flows therefore a decrease increase of the value of β l t with time represents a weakening strengthening of the capacity of a river basin to ameliorate to increase low flows with spatial scale therefore a temporal change from β l t 1 to β l t 1 indicates a shift from regulation to unregulation in the capacity of a river basin to regulate low flows and a temporal trend in β l t represented by 10 β l t δ t β l t 0 d β l t dt δ t with d β l t dt 0 indicates weakening or strengthening of the basin s capacity for regulating low flows if d β l t dt 0 or d β l t dt 0 respectively β l t 0 represents the value of the low flow scaling exponent at the initial time notably the interpretation of this trend is opposite in sign to that of high flows 4 scaling laws and river flows regulation change in large basins of tropical south america the scaling properties coefficients and exponents of extreme river flows have changed through time as evidenced by changes in the scaling laws during the study period fig 2 and figs s1 s10 as well as by the statistical distribution of all of the estimated scaling exponents fig 3 these temporal variations confirm that scaling properties are non stationary indicating that the mechanisms that affect the production of extreme river flows have also changed with time in the studied basins this non stationarity in the scaling properties is consistent with and potentially relates to large human induced alterations of both the amazon davidson et al 2012 and magdalena restrepo et al 2006 river basins this will be discussed in section 5 2 depending on the distribution of the scaling exponents values fig 3 the studied basins can be classified in two different groups basins in the first group negro solimoes and amazon green rectangles in fig 3 are characterized by the condition that β l t 1 β f t which is persistent throughout the observation period based on eqs 6 and 9 this distribution of the scaling exponents β f t 1 and β l t 1 indicates persistent regulation of both high and low flows basins in this group have maintained their capacity for regulating extreme river flows i e their dual capacity for dampening high flows β f t 1 and amplifying low flows β l t 1 the second group includes basins madeira and magdalena red rectangles in fig 3 in which regulation of extreme river flows has been less prevalent as indicated by the distribution of the scaling exponents in these two basins high flows have remained regulated β f t 1 but low flows have not always been regulated with 61 and 34 of cases with β l t 1 in madeira and magdalena respectively in accordance with eqs 6 and 9 this indicates that the madeira and magdalena basins have maintained their capacity to dampen high flows while their capacity to amplify low flows has been less prevalent during the observation period these two basins have been closer to the critical point β l 1 in which low flows amplification and dampening processes are shifted eq 9 indeed β l t 1 describes cases in which these basins have not amplified but dampened low flows the regulation capacity has been changing differently among the basins and also between high and low flows most river basins exhibit significant trends in the temporal evolution of their scaling properties fig 4 in all but the negro basin the scaling parameters all of the exponents and some of the coefficients exhibit significant trends along the 1974 2011 period based on eqs 7 and 10 trends in the scaling exponents right column of fig 4 indicate either strengthening or weakening of the basins regulation capacity through time in the solimoes basin scaling exponents for low flows have been increasing and exponents for high flows have been decreasing through the observation period these trends are consistent with an strengthening of the basin s capacity for regulating both high and low flows as indicated by eqs 7 and 10 with d β f t dt 0 and d β l t dt 0 respectively in the amazon and madeira basins the scaling exponents for both high and low flows have been decreasing with time this implies contrasting effects for the regulation of high and low flows in these basins d β f t dt 0 indicates strengthening of the capacity for regulating high flows while d β l t dt 0 indicates weakening of low flows regulation trends in the magdalena river basin d β l t dt 0 and d β f t dt 0 indicate that the regulation capacity for low high flows has been strengthening weakening figs 5 and 6 show the estimated variations of the spatial growth rates of high and low flows respectively at different times around the beginning 1977 and end 2010 of the study period fig 5 confirms that all basins have maintained their capacity to dampen high flows in all cases e q f a decreases with a in contrast not all basins have maintained their capacity to amplify low flows throug the study period fig 6 the most noticeable changes have occurred in the madeira and magdalena basins where dampening and amplification processes have shifted as indicated by a reversal of the e q l a vs a curve concavity madeira has shifted from a state in which low flows were amplified e q l a increases with a in 1977 to one in which they are dampened e q l a decreases with a in 2010 this shift from a regulated to an unregulated state is consistent with the interpretation of the negative trend in β l t as a weakening of the basin s capacity to amplify regulate low flows fig 4 notably madeira is the only basin in which the value of the scaling exponent for low flows has shifted in time from β l t 1 to β l t 1 contrary to madeira the magdalena basin has experienced an increase in their capacity to regulate low flows as indicated by its positive trend in β l t fig 4 as well as by the concavity change in the e q l a vs a curve fig 6 such changes are consistent with a shift from an unregulated state in which low flows are dampened β l t 1 to a regulated state in which low flows are amplified β l t 1 however values of β l t in the magdalena basin have remained close the critical value β l 1 fig 3 notably in the amazon river basin as a whole the negative trend in β l t fig 4 indicates that the basin s capacity to amplify low flows has been decreasing and therefore the state of the basin has been approaching the critical point in which β l 1 and the e q l a vs a curve has been approaching an horizontal line fig 6 a continuation of this trend would lead to a transition from amplification regulation to dampening unregulation of low flows in the whole amazon basin as already occurred in the madeira basin fig 4 5 discussion 5 1 water storage and release dynamics a first level explanation of regulation a river basin system is a complex system which is not isolated from the surrounding environment so its response e g river flows is not independent of external forcings e g large scale climatic variations however the capacity of such a system to regulate its response is an internal property i e it can only be a consequence of the system s internal dynamics otherwise if the system s response were entirely determined by external forcings e g if variations in river flows were entirely determined by variations in large scale climatic phenomena then its regulation capacity would be null all these imply that defining the boundaries of a basin system i e defining what is internal or external to the system is crucial for understanding its regulation capacity an usual perspective to study the hydrological response of river basins is to consider only the land surface part of the water balance and therefore to assume that precipitation and evapotranspiration fluxes are not internal to the system applied to a large basin this view implicitly assumes that precipitation is independent of processes occurring within the same basin e g land cover change this assumption is challenged by increasing scientific evidence that for example forest cover change can significantly alter precipitation patterns in tropical south america lawrence and vandecar 2015 spracklen and garcia carreras 2015 zemp et al 2017 and that a large amount of terrestrial precipitation is recycled i e it originates from land evapotranspiration van der ent et al 2010 which may be a crucial feedback mechanism in the water balance of large basins such as the amazon eltahir and bras 1994 indeed disregarding such land atmosphere interactions may lead to contradictory model results about the effect of forest loss on river flows coe et al 2009 here we adopt the same view that we proposed in salazar et al 2018 in which the control volume for a basin s water balance comprises the coupled land atmosphere system and therefore precipitation p and evapotranspiration e are treated as internal fluxes fig 7 this view is consistent with evidence that the potential impact of forests cover change on river flows can occur not only through effects on surface properties e g infiltrability zimmermann et al 2006 but also through effects on precipitation patterns coe et al 2009 lawrence and vandecar 2015 spracklen and garcia carreras 2015 zemp et al 2017 the importance of land atmosphere interactions for the continental water balance in tropical south america is further highlighted by increasing evidence that forest loss could force the amazon beyond a tipping point boers et al 2017 lovejoy and nobre 2018 from this perspective fig 7 river flows r are affected by external forcings through their influence on the net atmospheric moisture convergence q and depend on the system s internal dynamics that determine the occurrence of non equilibrium states in which q r water is stored within the system or q r previously stored water is released these alternative behaviors are determinant for high and low flows regulation regulation of high flows dampening of floods is a consequence of the capacity of river basins to retain store water during wet seasons this is analogous to the capacity of flood control reservoirs to reduce high flows via water storage regulation of low flows amplification results from a related but not identical capacity of river basins to store water during wet seasons releasing it into streams during dry seasons this is also analogous to the capacity of artificial reservoirs to increase low flows through a combination of water storage and controlled release high flows dampening regulation is described by β f t 1 because it implies that e q f a decreases with a this dampening can only occur if the river basin system retains water d s l s a dt 0 particularly when the atmospheric moisture convergence is large q f r f under script f refers to fluxes associated with high flows or floods even under the same external forcing q f a river basin can behave as regulated or unregulated depending on its internal dynamics because it determines whether water storage s l s a increases or decreases fig 8 low flows amplification regulation is described by β l t 1 because it implies that e q l a increases with a this amplification occurs when the atmospheric moisture convergence is small dry season and a river basin system releases water that was previously stored during the wet season consistent with d s l s a dt 0 and q l r l under script l relates to low flows for a given external forcing q l the occurrence of such an amplification process depends on the internal dynamics that determines whether a river basin releases d s l s a dt 0 or retains d s l s a dt 0 water fig 9 variations in how a river basin system stores and releases water allow the occurrence of different extreme flow regimes even under the same external forcings figs 8 and 9 this is because both amplification and dampening processes can occur for any given input of water q depending on the spatial aggregation of processes runoff generating processes occurring within the basin system therefore environmental change impacts on the water storage and release dynamics i e on the spatial and temporal distribution of water within the system in river basins can cause transitions which are revealed by variations of the scaling exponents section 3 between regulated and unregulated extreme flow regimes 5 2 environmental change impacts on regulation the factors that affect water storage and release dynamics in large river basins are manifold can be natural or human induced and are not equally sensitive to environmental change for instance geological e g soil types and aquifers structure and morphological e g basin size and shape properties exert important effects on regulation because of their influence on surface hydrology and groundwater dynamics bruijnzeel 2004 miguez macho and fan 2012 however such a properties are not highly sensitive to environmental change and therefore it is unlikely that temporal variations in basins regulation capacity result from changes in for instance aquifers structure and or drainage areas instead it is more likely that regulation changes in a basin are associated with variations in properties that meet two conditions to be significantly influential on river flow regimes and to be sensitive to environmental change especially at policy relevant time scales basin properties affected by land cover change piao et al 2007 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 sterling et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 and rivers damming poff et al 2007 meet these conditions in many basins of the world and particularly in the amazon and magdalena basins restrepo et al 2006 davidson et al 2012 latrubesse et al 2017 the most pronounced reduction in regulation capacity has occurred for low flows in the madeira basin d β l dt 0 fig 4 resulting in a transition from a regulated state in which low flows are amplified β l t 1 to an unregulated state in which they are dampened β l t 1 among the amazon tributaries the madeira basin has also experienced the most pronounced land cover change specifically forest loss fig s11 trancoso et al 2009 and a continuing increase in the presence of dams fig s12 latrubesse et al 2017 a reduction of regulation capacity with decreasing forest cover is consistent with our hypothesis of the forest reservoir which describes the natural capacity of river basins specially in the amazon to store water and control its release through land atmosphere interactions mainly precipitation recycling that depend strongly on the presence of forests and weaken with forest loss salazar et al 2018 it might seem counterintuitive that an increased presence of dams coincides with a reduced regulation of low flows in the madeira basin however construction of dams does not necessarily enhance and may even reduce the regulation capacity of large river basins reasons for this are first that the environmental impacts of damming large rivers amazonian rivers do not occur only in the vicinity of each dam but can spread throughout the whole river basin latrubesse et al 2017 second that in a large and relatively flat basin the madeira basin the volume of artificial reservoirs is relatively small as compared to the magnitude of river flows even low flows and therefore their regulation capacity is limited third the operation rules of dams can be and typically are based on criteria other than hydrological regulation such as economic criteria poff et al 2016 an fourth the construction of dam reservoir systems is usually linked to other human activities e g road construction and associated agricultural expansion and deforestation soares filho et al 2006 trancoso et al 2009 finer and jenkins 2012 that can have widespread impacts on the natural capacity of river basins to regulate river flows a related counterintuitive effect was observed in the nakambe river africa in which the severity of floods has increased with time despite a decrease in precipitation and an increase in the number of dams in the river mahe et al 2005 all this points out that the potential effects of dam reservoir systems on river flow regulation may be contrasting and are not limited to neither the space in the vicinity of dams nor the time immediately after dams construction low flows regulation has also weakened in the whole amazon basin d β l dt 0 but not in the solimoes and negro basins d β l dt 0 fig 4 this indicates that such regulation weakening in the amazon is attributable to a corresponding weakening in their southern and eastern tributaries some of these tributaries including the madeira basin have experienced the highest rates of forest loss especially along the so called arc of deforestation trancoso et al 2009 and contain the largest dams in the amazon basin latrubesse et al 2017 this is consistent with our idea that regulation weakening in the madeira and amazon basins is likely related to forest loss a weakening of the natural forest reservoir salazar et al 2018 in spite of or in addition to the contrasting impacts of damming amazonian rivers the magdalena river basin has also experienced intensive deforestation this is not included in fig s11 because the data is too coarse for this basin which is about 5 6 times smaller than the madeira basin and damming of rivers restrepo and syvitski 2006 as in the madeira basin in the magdalena basin a weak capacity to regulate low flows fig 3 coincides with a relatively low forest cover equivalent to less than 30 of the drainage area in 1990 restrepo and syvitski 2006 which again agrees with our hypothesis of relating regulation to forest cover in large basins salazar et al 2018 however in contrast to madeira there is not a low flow regulation weakening trend in magdalena figs 4 and 6 we think that this contrast is related to four fundamental differences between both basins first while madeira has experienced increasing deforestation and damming during our study period 1974 2011 most dams in the magdalena basin were constructed before 1974 fig s12 and a very large fraction of the basin was already deforested by 1974 restrepo and syvitski 2006 the impacts of these old deforestation and damming may be related to the reduced capacity of the magdalena basin for regulating low flows fig 3 but cannot be directly related to regulation trends during our study period second while deforestation in the madeira basin has been substantially concentrated around the arc of deforestation aguiar et al 2007 deforestation in the magdalena basin has occurred in sparser areas restrepo and syvitski 2006 further complex social factors such as the armed conflict in colombia may have unintentionally promoted forest recovery in the andes particularly between 2001 and 2010 sánchez cuervo et al 2012 third the smaller size and steeper topography of the magdalena basin allow for artificial reservoirs to have a relatively larger volume and therefore and enhanced regulation capacity this may have had an impact on the observed increase in the low flows regulation capacity in the magdalena basin figs 4 and 6 but uncertainties about the operation rules of reservoirs do not allow to confirm this fourth there is a fundamental difference in how the madeira and magdalena basins are fed by moisture from the neighboring oceans through the atmosphere precipitation in the madeira basin depends on atmospheric moisture transported from the atlantic ocean through the continent over very long distances on the order of 10 3 km whereby precipitation recycling likely plays a crucial role zemp et al 2014 zemp et al 2017 in contrast the magdalena river flows approximately parallel to ocean sources the pacific ocean and caribbean sea of continental precipitation poveda et al 2014 this difference implies that precipitation over the madeira basin may be more sensitive to impacts of deforestation not only within the basin but also in surrounding areas which can propagate throughout the continent spracklen and garcia carreras 2015 zemp et al 2014 zemp et al 2017 6 conclusions we have developed a conceptual framework for inferring changes in the capacity of river basins to regulate extreme river flows from temporal changes in their scaling properties in particular a weakening of high or low flows regulation is associated respectively with an increase or decrease of the corresponding scaling exponent this framework is widely applicable to different basins because it is only based on the general assumption that extreme river flows scale with drainage area in river basins after applying the proposed conceptual framework to five large basins in tropical south america we found evidence of changes in their hydrological regulation capacity of particular importance is that the madeira and magdalena river basins have the lower capacity to regulate i e amplify low flows and that this capacity has been reducing in the amazon basin as a whole since the basins regulation capacity depends on how water is stored and released the observed changes in the scaling properties can be conceptually related to environmental change processes such as deforestation and damming of rivers although more detailed studies are required to characterize temporal changes of hydrological regimes and their causes our study provides widely applicable foundations for using the scaling laws as empirical tools for inferring temporal changes of hydrological regulation more generally our

7238,reference evapotranspiration et 0 plays a fundamental role in agronomic forestry and water resources management estimating and forecasting et 0 have long been recognized as a major challenge for researchers and practitioners in these communities this work explored the potential of multiple leading numerical weather predictions nwps for estimating and forecasting summer et 0 at 101 u s regional climate reference network stations over nine climate regions across the contiguous united states conus three leading global nwp model forecasts from thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge dataset were used in this study including the single model ensemble forecasts from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ec the national centers for environmental prediction global forecast system ncep and the united kingdom meteorological office forecasts mo as well as multi model ensemble forecasts from the combinations of these nwp models a regression calibration was employed to bias correct the et 0 forecasts impact of individual forecast variables on et 0 forecasts were also evaluated the results showed that the ec forecasts provided the least error and highest skill and reliability followed by the mo and ncep forecasts the multi model ensembles constructed from the combination of ec and mo forecasts provided slightly better performance than the single model ec forecasts the regression process greatly improved et 0 forecast performances particularly for the regions involving stations near the coast or with a complex orography the performance of ec forecasts was only slightly influenced by the size of the ensemble members particularly at short lead times even with less ensemble members ec still performed better than the other two nwps errors in the radiation forecasts followed by those in the wind had the most detrimental effects on the et 0 forecast performances keywords evapotranspiration numerical weather prediction multi model ensemble tigge forecast verification 1 introduction accurate evapotranspiration et forecasting is important for assessing agricultural water demand driving hydrologic and crop simulation models and enhancing agricultural and water management decision making evapotranspiration is often derived as a function of the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 which is the evapotranspiration from a well watered reference crop an internationally recognized standard method for computing et 0 is the penman monteith equation as specified by the food and agriculture organization in the irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 this method hereinafter referred to as fao 56 pm is considered as one of the best methods for estimating daily et 0 under different climate conditions since fao 56 pm equation is a physically based approach incorporating both physiological and aerodynamic parameters it does not require any local calibration e g garcia et al 2004 however fao 56 pm equation requires the availability of a complete set of meteorological data including air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity forecast outputs from numerical weather prediction nwp models can be used for et 0 forecasting the improvements in resolution parameterization and physical representation of the main processes and phenomena has prompted the use of medium range 1 10 days nwp forecasts in many weather dependent activities hamill et al 2013 forecast skill in the range from 3 to 10 days has been increasing by about one day per decade meaning that today s 6 day forecast is as accurate as the 5 day forecast ten years ago bauer et al 2015 medium range forecasts are crucial for agronomy forestry and water resources management as they provide more time for decision making and planning compared with short range forecasts as well as producing considerably more accurate estimations than seasonal forecasts thielen et al 2009 nevertheless implementing medium range nwp forecasts is not straightforward correction methods are often needed to reduce forecast errors and account for local meteorological conditions that are not resolved at spatial scale of the nwp model grid e g delle monache et al 2011 glahn and lowry 1972 gneiting 2014 gneiting et al 2005 pelosi et al 2017 wilks 2006 using multiple model ensembles instead of a single model and statistical post processing of nwp models outputs are two of the several correction methods used to improve weather related forecasts hamill 2012 hagedorn et al 2012 found that the post processing procedure based on a simple bias correction approach can be particularly useful at locations affected by systematic errors including areas with complex landscape or coastal grid points in addition studies showed that the multi model ensemble approach by combining multiple nwps often have higher skill than any individual model due to compensation effects through combining models with different physics numeric and initial conditions e g hagedorn et al 2005 recent studies have explored global numerical weather model outputs for forecasting medium range et 0 in real time for example perera et al 2014 used accesss g global model outputs to estimate et 0 with lead times up to 9 days this model is operated by the australian bureau of meteorology with a spatial resolution of 80 km in this study the et 0 forecasts showed an average rmse less than 1 mm day 1 for lead time up to 4 days after removing systematic bias of the model outputs tian and martinez 2012a b employed ncep global forecast system gfs retrospective forecast reforecast data to generate 1 15 day probabilistic daily et 0 forecast and then statistically downscaled the forecasts by means of different analog based approaches in the southeastern united states the results showed that most of the forecasts were skillful in the first 5 lead days tian and martinez 2014 also generated the forecasts with the second generation ncep gfs reforecast dataset which was operationally available from 2012 and included a complete set of meteorological data for the et 0 estimation with 11 ensemble members and a spatial resolution of 100 km compared with the previous studies tian and martinez 2014 improved the skill of the probabilistic et 0 forecasts as well as the performance of the soil water deficit estimation for irrigation scheduling in the first 5 lead days due to the availability of a complete meteorological dataset produced by a more advanced nwp model at higher spatial resolution nonetheless all the nwp based et 0 studies focused on either a single model or a specific climate region or a single aspect of forecast performance pelosi et al 2016 perera et al 2014 tian and martinez 2012a b tian and martinez 2014 perera et al 2014 it is still lacking a comprehensive assessment of medium range et 0 forecasts based on multiple global nwp models over diverse climate regions forecasts provided by the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge project provide an opportunity to produce next generation medium range et 0 forecasting given its multi model ensemble feature real time accessibility complete coverage in space and time and fully archived near surface variables swinbank et al 2016 tigge is an unprecedented effort to accelerate improvements in the accuracy of 1 day to 2 week high impact weather forecasts the tigge archive contains medium range forecasts from nine operational global ensembles produced by the most important forecast systems including the ncep system more importantly tigge databases enable combining multiple model ensembles as an alternative for reducing et 0 forecast errors which has not been explored in previous studies hagedorn et al 2012 found that a multi model ensemble combining all nine models from the tigge archive did not outperform the best single model for temperature forecasts however a reduced multi model system consisting of only the best four model systems the canadian meteorological centre cmc the ncep the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ec or ecmwf and the united kingdom meteorological office model mo showed an improved performance with the ec model contributing the most to the added benefits of the multi model and the cmc practically adding a negligible contribution the ec and mo models are accessible in real time and have similar overall levels of skill buizza 2014 buizza et al 2005 johnson and swinbank 2009 matsueda and endo 2011 titley et al 2008 therefore the multi model ensembles through combining ncep models with ec and mo models would potentially improve et 0 forecast performance this study aims to produce and evaluate deterministic and probabilistic et 0 forecasts from both single and multi model combinations of ec ncep and mo forecasts from the tigge dataset this study also evaluates the effects of different ensemble sizes on et 0 forecast performance as well as the impact of the individual weather forecast variable on et 0 forecasts further the study focused on the summer season and includes sites distributed over all climate regions in the contiguous united states conus this is the first study explicitly examining both probabilistic and deterministic forecasts from leading global nwp models from the tigge dataset and the first exploring the potential of using multi model forecasts for improving medium range et 0 predictions 2 datasets and methods 2 1 measurement dataset in this study daily measurements from 101 quality controlled u s climate reference network uscrn weather stations were used as the observational reference as shown in fig 1 these stations are distributed over nine climatologically consistent regions in conus divided by scientists of the national centers for environmental information ncei karl and koss 1984 we used uscrn stations instead of the agricultural weather stations for facilitating the comparisons among forecasting methods in different climate regions the agricultural weather stations have a modified near surface boundary layer compared to the surrounding landscape providing a source of bias between observations and forecasts whereas the uscrn stations have been deployed in the locations that are representative of the climate of the region and not heavily influenced by unique local factors noaa nesdis 2003 high quality observational climate datasets with a thorough quality control are important for accurate et 0 estimations the uscrn meets the highest standards for instrument exposure menne et al 2010 and is consistent in time and by sensor type leeper et al 2015 the quality controls of the uscrn observations are periodically performed by noaa s atmospheric turbulence and diffusion division to calibrate the sensors against national institute of standards and technology traceable standards that are re certified annually automated uscrn field observations are monitored by the national centers for environmental information where indications of missing messages or questionable observation data are identified and addressed previous studies have shown that the quality controlled uscrn observations such as solar radiation performed very well compared to the other observational references at daily timescale e g wang et al 2012 the quality controlled uscrn observations would therefore be sufficient for providing high quality et 0 estimations the reader can refer to the ncei portal https www ncdc noaa gov crn for detailed information related to the uscrn data and data collection process the dataset used in this study comprised the period between may 1 and september 9 from 2014 to 2016 the retrieved data included daily observations of minimum and maximum temperature t min and t max c respectively minimum and maximum relative humidity rh min and rh max and time integrated surface incoming solar radiation r s mj m 2 five minute average wind speed values u m s 1 at a height of 1 5 m were also retrieved and aggregated to daily values the latitude longitude and altitude m of the involved stations were also included in the original dataset data of stations with a considerable number of missing records in a year were excluded from the dataset nv baker 5 w data of year 2014 tx austin 33 nw data of year 2015 fl sebring 23 sse and co montrose 11 en data of year 2016 days accounting for missing measurements in the remaining stations were removed from the analyses these days represented a negligible portion of the total period 2 2 forecast dataset the basic forecast datasets used in this study included perturbed ensemble forecasts issued by the ec ncep and mo models these forecasts are freely available in the tigge data portal see http apps ecmwf int datasets data tigge over the period from october 2006 to present table 1 provides some important features about these three forecast systems the retrieved variables included 2 m air maximum and minimum temperatures t max and t min k 2 m dew point temperature t d k time integrated surface net solar radiation r ns j m 2 and the 10 m u and v components of the wind vector u m s 1 the retrieved datasets comprised the 00 utc coordinated universal time perturbed forecasts issued between may 1 and august 31 from 2014 to 2016 ec and ncep datasets had a maximum lead time of 10 days while mo consisted of a maximum lead time of 7 days as the verification data uscrn is recorded every day at local time the measurements for a given day d were matched with the forecast values comprised between the 6 utc hours of the day d and the 6 utc hours of the day d 1 all the retrieved forecasts were interpolated to the same 0 5 0 5 grid via the tigge data portal there were missing values in the retrieved ncep and mo forecasts the ncep forecasts had 23 days missing in 2016 and four days missing in 2015 the mo forecasts of 2014 were available only up to july 15 the days with missing values were all discarded the retrieved datasets included nine large grib2 format data files one per system per year each grib2 file included perturbed forecast members for the grid cells between 26 and 49 north and 74 and 124 west forecasts from grib2 data files were interpolated to the uscrn stations using nearest neighbor approach and were converted into manageable csv format data files one per station per system and per year wgrib2 a ncep utility specifically designed to manipulate grib2 files was used for processing the grib2 data all the codes for data manipulation analysis and representation were scripted in r r core team 2014 2 3 et 0 estimation et 0 estimates based on uscrn measurements and nwp forecasts were computed using the fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 allen et al 2005 equation which was available in the evapotranspiration r package guo et al 2016 the fao 56 pm equation is recommended as the standard method for estimating et 0 it applies energy balance and mass transfer principles to estimate the evapotranspiration from a uniform grass reference surface specific parameters are employed to model the surface and aerodynamic resistance from vegetation allen et al 1998 the pm equation is expressed as follows 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is the net surface radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the daily mean air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the input variables for the fao 56 pm equation included minimum and maximum temperatures c minimum and maximum relative humidity surface incoming solar radiation mj m 2 and the wind speed m s 1 net solar radiation forecast should be transformed to incoming solar radiations using the expression r s r n 1 α where α 0 23 is the albedo of the reference crop evaporative surface minimum and maximum relative humidity forecasts were estimated using the maximum and minimum temperature and the dew point temperature forecasts following lawrence 2005 daily 10 m wind speed forecasts were adjusted to the same height of the uscrn measurements assuming a vertical log wind profile allen et al 1998 details about the implementation of the routine for computing et 0 can be found in guo et al 2016 or as part of the r package guo and westra 2017 2 4 bias correction of et 0 forecasts to investigate the effect of post processing on et 0 forecasts a simple deterministic correction a k a calibration was conducted by fitting a linear regression between observations and ensemble mean forecasts from a training dataset and applying the regression to the current mean forecast value the correction factor given by the difference between the regression adjusted forecast and the raw ensemble mean forecast was added to all ensemble members of the raw forecast in a way that the ensemble distribution was shifted the training data included the forecast observation pairs corresponding to the 30 days prior to the forecast initial day the calibration procedure was applied at all stations and lead times 2 5 forecast evaluation hereafter we refer to the measurement based et 0 estimations as observed et 0 or observations to et 0 forecasts before calibration as raw forecasts and to the et 0 forecasts after bias correction either as bias corrected or calibrated forecasts both raw and calibrated et 0 forecasts were evaluated against uscrn based observations for each lead time year station and system the different statistics were averaged over each ncei climate region fig 1 to show the performance of each forecast in climatologically different regions the forecasts were assessed using both deterministic and probabilistic metrics deterministic metrics were used for evaluating the ensemble mean forecasts probabilistic metrics were used to evaluate probabilistic forecasts which were converted from the ensemble forecasts detailed information for each forecast metric is described below 2 5 1 deterministic forecast metrics for the deterministic metrics we used the mean error me and the root mean square error rmse which are among the most commonly reported measures of agreement between forecasts and observations me provides an estimate of the model bias while rmse is an accuracy measuring criteria for unbiased models rmse is an estimator of the square root of the ensemble variance let f l r d l t represent the mean of the forecast variable at location l r l r 1 n l r and day d l d l 1 n d l with a lead time t n l r is the number of locations belonging to a region r while n d l is the total number of available forecast days for a specific location let o l r d l denote the observed variable at the corresponding location and day the me and rmse for the specific region r and lead time t me r t and rmse r t respectively are then computed as 2 me r t 1 n l r 1 n l r d l 1 n d l f l r d l t o l r d l 3 rmse r t 1 n l r 1 n l r d l 1 n d l f l r d l t o l r d l 2 where n is the total number of pairs of forecasts and observations in a specific region 2 5 2 probabilistic forecast metrics the skill of the probabilistic forecast was evaluated using the brier skill score bss associated to the tercile events of the ensemble forecasts upper or 1st middle or 2nd and lower or 3rd terciles let p l r d l t represent the forecast probability of the considered event occurring at location l r and day d l with lead time t let o l r d l be equal to 1 if the event occurs at the specific location and day and 0 otherwise similarly to rmse in the deterministic case the brier score bs measures the mean squared probability error murphy 1973 of the forecast associated to a given threshold value or event the bs for the specific region r with lead time t bs r t is then calculated as follows 4 bs r t 1 n l r 1 n l r d l 1 n d l p l r d l t o l r d l 2 the corresponding brier skill score bss r t then measures the improvement of the probabilistic forecast relative to a reference forecast usually called the sample climatological distribution or the sample climatology wilks 2011 5 bss r t 1 bs r t bs clim r where bs clim r refers to the brier scores of the sample climatology which is defined in this study as a function of the relative frequencies of the n observations o l r d l in the verification data set wilks 2010 6 bs clim r o l r d l 1 o l r d l where o l r d l is the event relative frequency within the n member sample of observations the bss ranges from to 1 and values of bss equal to 1 indicate perfect skill since in this study the bss was used to evaluate the skill associated to the tercile events of the ensemble forecasts the event relative frequency o l r d l is in all cases constant and equal to 0 33 and bs clim r 0 2 2 and consequently the bss values for the different regions and lead times are inversely proportional to the corresponding bs values binary events highlight only one aspect of the forecast the continuous rank probability score crps which is recommended to obtain a broader overall view of performance hersbach 2000 was also used to evaluate the probabilistic forecast performance the crps is precisely the integral of the brier scores at all possible threshold values for the continuous predictand gneiting et al 2005 hersbach 2000 it measures the integrated square by all possible threshold values h of difference between the cumulative distribution function cdf of the forecast variable f f and the corresponding cdf of the observed variable f o following gneiting et al 2005 the crps of an ensemble forecast for lead time t location l r and day d l crps l r d l t is computed as 7 crps l r d l t f l r d l t f h f l r d l o h 2 dh where f l r d l o h h h o l r d l h being heaviside function which takes the value 0 when h o l r d l and the value 1 otherwise the aggregated continuous rank probability score for a region r and lead time t crps r t is then computed as 8 crps r t 1 n l r 1 n l r d l 1 n d l crps l r d l t the crps variates between 0 and smaller value indicate better performances reliability diagrams as a measure of systematic and conditional bias were also computed to investigate the reliability of the forecasts the reliability diagram plots the observed frequency of an event defined by the threshold h against its forecasted probability the range of forecast probabilities is divided into k bins then on the x axis we plot the average probability of the forecasts that falls in the k th bin while on the y axis the fraction of the corresponding observations that are below the threshold is plotted perfect reliability is achieved along the 45 diagonal line on the reliability diagram when the observed frequency of the given event within each bin equals the average of the corresponding forecast probabilities the deviation from the diagonal gives the conditional bias on the reliability diagram it is also possible to show the sharpness of the forecast which is a measure of the forecast confidence by means of a histogram representing the frequency of forecasts in each probability bin sharper forecasts mean more concentrated frequency distributions of the ensemble forecasts sharper forecasts usually indicate better forecasts if they have good reliability or calibration gneiting et al 2007 a bootstrapping analysis was also included in the reliability diagrams in order to assess the uncertainty of the sampled pairs of points random sampling was performed 1000 times with replacement in a standard way error bars accounting for the 5 and 95 percent of the values distribution were indicated in the reliability diagrams 2 6 inter comparison of forecast schemes the study compared the performance of single et 0 raw forecasts of the ec ncep and mo as well as the multi model et 0 forecasts arising from the simple combination of the three ensemble forecasts hereinafter referred as ec necp mo and the combination of the two ensemble forecasts the ec and mo ensembles hereinafter referred as ec mo the differences between the performance of calibrated forecasts and raw forecasts for each system and the multi model ensemble system were also investigated all the comparisons were conducted over the same period between may 31 and august 31 from 2014 to 2016 with a bootstrapping analysis as specified below applied to assess if the differences were statistically significant when assessing the difference the weather forecast data should be treated as paired since it accounts for the error correlation between two samples hamill 1999 when performing the bootstrapping analysis each of the system forecasts and observations were simultaneously sampled from the same randomly chosen dates the bootstrapping analysis relied on 1000 random sampling with replacement the differences were considered as significant if at least 95 of the bootstrapped differences had the same sign positive or negative the reliability diagrams also included a bootstrap analysis in order to assess the uncertainty of the sampled pairs of points it is included by default in the corresponding routine of the specsverification r package error bars accounting for the 5 and 95 percent of the values distribution are represented sampling was performed in the standard way and also included 1000 random sampling with replacement we also examined the effects of different number of ec perturbed members on the performance of et 0 forecasts considering the large ensemble size of this nwp system this is useful from both a theoretical and practical point of view for example it is important to know how a nwp system behaves when it has the same number of ensemble members as the other systems also a reduced number of ensemble members is more efficient in operational schemes where computation is time consuming this study compared the performance of a nwp forecast with different number of randomly sampled ensemble members applied to both raw and calibrated forecasts 2 7 impact of the individual weather forecast variable on et 0 forecasts we also evaluated the forecast performance for individual weather variables and investigated how the forecast uncertainty of the individual weather variable affected the et 0 forecasts the analysis was performed by comparing the error distributions of the raw forecasts for four individual weather variables t rh rs and u with the corresponding error distributions of the raw et 0 forecasts the et 0 forecasts were calculated using one forecast variable and three observed variables i e by replacing one observation at a time with one forecast so that the impacts of single forecast variable on et 0 forecasts can be separated when perturbing t and rh we simultaneously replaced the maximum and minimum observed values by the corresponding forecasts while we assessed the impact of individual weather variables on et 0 forecast skill we did not evaluate the skill of individual weather variables the reasons were twofold first the scope of this paper is to produce and assess multi model et 0 forecasts which includes multiple experiments and procedures that provide ample information for understanding and improving et 0 forecasts second while the bias of the et 0 forecast is caused by individual weather variables bias correcting calculated et 0 is computationally more efficient and addresses the biases from both individual weather variables as well as the correlations among variables previous studies have found that bias corrected et 0 forecasts performed better than any individual input variables e g lewis et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 variability of et 0 observations the et 0 observations based on the uscrn measurements show diverse distributions over the ncei climate regions fig 2 the mean values approximately vary between a minimum of 3 2 and a maximum of 6 3 mm day 1 while the standard deviation ranged from 1 to 1 8 mm day 1 both mean and variance of et 0 forecasts are consistently higher in southern regions which comprise coastal and continental stations and a complex orography like the w and sw regions june and july et 0 values tend to be higher than those in may and august while may and june et 0 values show higher variability 3 2 performance of raw et 0 forecasts here we provide a comparative assessment of the performances of the single and multi model raw et 0 forecasts across regions and for different lead times fig 3 shows the me and rmse for the different system forecasts all systems tend to over predict et 0 observations for different lead times and regions the raw ncep forecasts are more biased and less accurate than the raw ec and mo forecasts the raw ec forecasts show slightly higher me but much lower rmse than the mo forecasts for longer lead times the performances of the raw et 0 forecasts also vary among the different regions all systems perform sensibly better in the northern regions than in southern regions and the west region the performance is poor in the w region which is characterized by a very complex landscape the simplified terrain heights of the forecast model may probably affect the quality of the forecasts in regions like this hagedorn et al 2008 fig 4 shows the bss of the raw ec forecasts for the three terciles of the ensemble forecasts as well as the differences between the bss of the ncep mo ec mo and ec ncep mo systems and the bss of the ec system the results indicate that for probabilistic et 0 forecasts the bss is generally better for the lower tercile event compared with the upper and middle tercile events most of the middle tercile forecasts show low bss and reliability since the changes or shifts in the middle tercile are not as sizeable as in the lower or upper terciles as found and discussed in previous studies e g barnston et al 2003 van den dool and toth 1991 in figs 5 and 6 we compare the reliability diagrams related to the different et 0 systems forecasts for the upper and lower tercile events respectively considering for the comparison in the former case different regions at the same lead time i e three days and in the latter case different lead times at the same region i e the s region the ensemble forecasts show an over forecasting bias when predicting et 0 values in the upper tercile fig 5 and an under forecasting bias for the lower tercile event fig 6 et 0 forecasts for the first tercile events are generally more reliable and sharper than for the third tercile events the reliability for short and middle lead times is similar in most experiments see fig 6 in general all the systems forecasts particularly the ncep forecasts seem fairly sharp the results reported in figs 4 6 indicate that ncep ensembles are considerably less skillful and reliable than any other ensemble the ec and mo performances are comparable the ec forecasts are on average more skillful and reliable although mo performs similarly or slightly better in experiments for the northern regions and the west region as a result the ec mo forecasts guarantee equal or higher bss compared with ec and ec ncep mo in most cases the overall statistics for the multi model ec ncep mo are presumably affected by the poor performance of ncep hagedorn et al 2008 and mathiesen and kleissl 2011 showed that original ec forecasts of temperature and radiation respectively outperformed the corresponding ncep forecasts in the continental u s table 2 summarizes the median values of different metrics over all regions for the forecasts at 1 and 7 day leads the median values using ec mo forecasts are consistently better than for ec forecasts at 1 day lead while behave similarly at 7 day lead the reason is that mo forecasts tend to degrade more than ec forecasts over lead time the ec ncep mo multi model practically provides no improvement with respect ec mo and ec given the unfavorable performance of the ncep forecasts 3 3 performance of calibrated forecasts the regression calibrations substantially improve the probabilistic performance of the ensemble forecasts especially regions and forecast systems with less skillful raw forecasts as it is shown in fig 7 the differences in terms of bss between calibrated forecasts and raw forecasts are mostly positive and significant for each model and for all three terciles with some exceptions for the middle tercile the skill of the ncep forecasts considerably improves after bias corrections more than other forecast systems the southern and western regions also gain more from calibrations than the northern regions which were characterized by better performances for the raw forecasts in particular the w region goes from being the worse to being the best through the simple bias correction meanwhile the increments in terms of bss for the upper tercile are at least twice as much as those for the lower event we further compare the bss for the calibrated single and multi model forecast systems in fig 8 the ncep forecasts are still less skillful than the ec forecasts or any other systems forecasts the calibrated ec mo and ec ncep mo forecasts are significantly more skillful than the calibrated ec forecasts in the experiments where ec and mo showed similar performances and mostly for short lead times and or in the case of the w and nw regions on the other hand the multi models are as skillful as ec in the experiments where ec outperformed mo the maximum improvements in terms of bss from the multi model systems represent a gain in forecast skill of less than one day compared with the single model systems in addition to the bss the reliability of all the forecasts is also improved through the regression calibration process with the third tercile events experiencing the highest improvements as shown in fig 9 the calibrated ec forecasts are more reliable but slightly less sharp than the ncep and mo forecasts and are equally reliable and sharp as ec mo and ec ncep mo it is worth noting that the reliability assessments might be affected by the sample size in regions such as w ne and nw because the diagrams with relatively small sample size are prone to be noisy e g hamill 1997 in table 3 we summarize the median values of the evaluated metrics for the calibrated forecasts at 1 and 7 day lead times by comparing tables 2 and 3 we find that the bss in terciles the me rmse and crps values are considerably improved after calibration the ec mo and ec ncep mo forecasts seem to be consistently better than the ec forecasts at 1 day lead but not at 7 day lead since the forecast performance from the three systems are consistently low at 7 day lead ec ncep mo is not recommended for implementation system as it does not bring additional improvements with respect to either ec or ec mo it is worth noting that the rmse values from calibrated forecasts are mostly lower than the other nwp based et 0 forecasts reported in australia using access g model perera et al 2014 and chile using mm5 silva et al 2010 on the other hand the bss assessments for the se region from the ec and the multi model forecasts are similar to those found by tian and martinez 2014 using ncep based analog forecasts hamill and whitaker 2006 hamill et al 2006 the nwp based et 0 forecasts have been implemented in operational advisory systems to assist farmer s decision making chirico et al 2018 studies like this provide a basis for an operational system of agronomic decision making nevertheless the bias correction approach used in this study is applied to the forecast at the uscrn stations which are representative of the climate of the region but are not in agricultural settings the bias corrected forecasts based on the uscrn settings will likely be biased warm and dry compared to agricultural settings therefore a different bias correction i e based on agricultural stations will be needed to take into account the microclimate in agricultural settings this can be done by removing the air temperature and relative humidity errors as part of a preprocessing analysis e g lewis and allen 2017 or by directly bias correcting the calculated et 0 forecasts e g tian et al 2014 at agricultural weather stations 3 4 the effect of ensemble size on ec based et 0 forecasts model systems with a greater number of ensemble members are expected to have better probabilistic forecasts ferro et al 2008 as well as greater impacts on the multi model predictions than model systems with fewer members hagedorn et al 2012 this section analyzes in what extension the ec based et 0 forecasts are affected by the ensemble size fig 10 shows the bss for the first and third tercile events using 10 20 30 40 and 50 ensemble members of the raw and calibrated ec forecasts in agreement with ferro et al 2008 the larger the size of the ensemble the higher the skill of the probabilistic forecasts however the changing rate of bss is almost negligible for 1 day lead and increases just slightly with the increasing lead time for 5 and 10 day leads an ensemble size of 20 and 30 members respectively seems to reach the same performance as with 50 members the forecasting scheme raw or bias corrected scarcely affects the functional dependence between bss or crps and ensemble size the improvements for the third tercile events through calibration suggested that it was more efficient using a calibrated forecast with 10 ensemble members than using a raw forecast model with full ensemble members regardless of the lead times we further examine the median crps and bss values of the 10 member ec forecasts and the full member mo forecasts for the first and third tercile events as a function of lead time fig 11 the ec forecasts perform better than the mo forecasts even with much less forecast members except for the bss of the raw forecasts for the first tercile notice that the ec calibrated forecasts still improves the skill by approximately one day relative to the calibrated mo forecasts for 3 day lead or more 3 5 impact of the weather parameter forecast errors from different nwp in this section we analyze how the individual daily weather forecasts t rh rs and u from different nwps here only ec and ncep are shown influence the daily et 0 forecasts by replacing one observed weather variable at a time with the forecasts when estimating et 0 the results show that solar radiation forecasts have the uppermost impact on et 0 forecast errors regardless of the forecast system considered fig 12 similarly to what was found by perera et al 2014 and ishak et al 2010 the influence of solar radiation forecasts is dominant even for the regions where the calibrations had minimal effects such as in the wnc region fig 13 c suggesting that the impact is also high using calibrated forecasts in fact considering for instance the large et 0 errors for the se region i e the one with the worse performance after calibration it seems that bad performances in the radiation forecasts are not properly addressed through the post processing of the et 0 forecasts fig 12a and b show that both models tend to overestimate the solar radiation forecasts probably due to model distortions in the representation of surface downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation bodas salcedo et al 2008 bodas salcedo et al 2012 mathiesen and kleissl 2011 wild 2008 nevertheless the radiation forecast errors using ncep are systematically high and are associated with et 0 forecast errors perez et al 2013 found that the ec model provided significantly better irradiance forecasts than a ncep gfs driven mesoscale model for all tested sites in different climate conditions wind speed forecasts show the highest relative errors among weather parameter forecasts but they commonly have a lower influence on predicted et 0 values than solar radiation forecasts similar results have been reported in other studies ishak et al 2010 pelosi et al 2016 these forecasts errors are sensibly higher in the southern regions and especially in the w region for which the rmse s of the associated et 0 forecasts tend to be higher than those relative to the solar radiation forecasts fig 13c and d it is worth noting that this study uses a one variable at a time replacement method to examine the impact of individual drivers on et 0 forecast skill it measures the impact of the individual variables on forecast skill but does not reflect the actual drivers of daily et 0 variability over conus hobbins 2016 provided a decomposition of et 0 over conus variability for each month of the year and showed that during the summer wind speed is the dominant driver over much of the western us and solar radiation is the dominant driver of the southeast it could explain the fact that the errors in wind speed and solar radiation forecasts have such detrimental impact on the et 0 forecasts in the west and southeast respectively in contrast temperature forecasts show the lowest bias and highest accuracy among all weather variables and have a limited impact on the et 0 forecasts only surpassing that of relative humidity forecasts fig 12 the sensitivity of predicted et 0 to the errors on t and rh forecasts might be affected by the fact that the biases in minimum and maximum values can compensate each other when evaluating et 0 with the penman monteith equation eq 1 it is worth noting that temperature forecasts contributed most to the et 0 forecast errors in the w region suggesting that the unfavorable performance of raw forecasts in this region is determined by the joint effects of large errors in radiation wind speed and temperature forecasts an arising question considering the contrasting patterns for the et 0 forecast errors associated with temperature and solar radiation forecasts is whether simpler et 0 models such as the hargreaves samani allen et al 1998 hargreaves and samani 1985 can perform as well as the fao 56 pm model by circumventing the errors associated with wind and solar radiation forecasts pelosi et al 2016 found that the hargreaves samani and the priestley and taylor models priestley and taylor 1972 performed well in locations of southern italy when they were not close to the coastline 4 conclusions in summary this study produced and assessed et 0 forecasts calculated using the leading ec ncep and mo model predictions based on fao 56 pm equation at 101 stations over nine climate regions in conus it examined the probabilistic and deterministic forecasting ability of single model ensembles as well as two multi model ensemble systems ec mo and ec mo ncep and also pondered the effects of ensemble member size on a single model forecast skill it also identified sources of errors contributing to et 0 forecasts caused by individual weather forecast variables from different nwp models this work is helpful for the implementation of reliable operational algorithms for medium range et 0 forecasting it contributes to understand the strengths and weaknesses of three leading forecasting systems when dealing with an agricultural meteorological variable et 0 which is a complex nonlinear function of multiple weather parameters major conclusions of this study are highlighted below first of all the results revealed that both raw and bias corrected ec forecasts generally had the lowest errors and the highest skill and reliability among all the nwp models being considered followed by mo and ncep forecasts the ec mo multi model ensemble showed consistently better performance than the ec forecasts in experiments where ec and mo performed similarly most comprehending short lead times and or the w and nw regions ec mo performed as well as or better than ec ncep mo that was found to be unsuitable for implementation secondly the study also showed that even a simple bias correction procedure would remarkably improve the forecast performance particularly in those regions involving coastal stations or with a complex orography while the statistical calibration reduced discrepancies between model performances it did not change the ranking of their performances thirdly the performance of ec forecasts was only slightly influenced by the size of the sampled ensemble when the number of members was equal to or higher than 10 in particular at short lead times in addition ec forecasts with only 10 ensemble members provided better performance than the full mo forecast ensembles these results suggested that a statistical calibrated forecast with less members could be more beneficial than using raw forecasts with full ensemble members finally our results suggested that the errors of the radiation forecasts followed by those of the wind forecasts had the most detrimental effect on the et 0 forecasts temperature forecasts showed the lowest bias and highest accuracy among all individual weather variables while contributed slightly more to the et 0 forecast errors than humidity forecasts this result suggested that a simpler model with less meteorological input may perform as well as fao 56 pm model by avoiding additional errors

7238,reference evapotranspiration et 0 plays a fundamental role in agronomic forestry and water resources management estimating and forecasting et 0 have long been recognized as a major challenge for researchers and practitioners in these communities this work explored the potential of multiple leading numerical weather predictions nwps for estimating and forecasting summer et 0 at 101 u s regional climate reference network stations over nine climate regions across the contiguous united states conus three leading global nwp model forecasts from thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge dataset were used in this study including the single model ensemble forecasts from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ec the national centers for environmental prediction global forecast system ncep and the united kingdom meteorological office forecasts mo as well as multi model ensemble forecasts from the combinations of these nwp models a regression calibration was employed to bias correct the et 0 forecasts impact of individual forecast variables on et 0 forecasts were also evaluated the results showed that the ec forecasts provided the least error and highest skill and reliability followed by the mo and ncep forecasts the multi model ensembles constructed from the combination of ec and mo forecasts provided slightly better performance than the single model ec forecasts the regression process greatly improved et 0 forecast performances particularly for the regions involving stations near the coast or with a complex orography the performance of ec forecasts was only slightly influenced by the size of the ensemble members particularly at short lead times even with less ensemble members ec still performed better than the other two nwps errors in the radiation forecasts followed by those in the wind had the most detrimental effects on the et 0 forecast performances keywords evapotranspiration numerical weather prediction multi model ensemble tigge forecast verification 1 introduction accurate evapotranspiration et forecasting is important for assessing agricultural water demand driving hydrologic and crop simulation models and enhancing agricultural and water management decision making evapotranspiration is often derived as a function of the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 which is the evapotranspiration from a well watered reference crop an internationally recognized standard method for computing et 0 is the penman monteith equation as specified by the food and agriculture organization in the irrigation and drainage paper 56 allen et al 1998 this method hereinafter referred to as fao 56 pm is considered as one of the best methods for estimating daily et 0 under different climate conditions since fao 56 pm equation is a physically based approach incorporating both physiological and aerodynamic parameters it does not require any local calibration e g garcia et al 2004 however fao 56 pm equation requires the availability of a complete set of meteorological data including air temperature wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity forecast outputs from numerical weather prediction nwp models can be used for et 0 forecasting the improvements in resolution parameterization and physical representation of the main processes and phenomena has prompted the use of medium range 1 10 days nwp forecasts in many weather dependent activities hamill et al 2013 forecast skill in the range from 3 to 10 days has been increasing by about one day per decade meaning that today s 6 day forecast is as accurate as the 5 day forecast ten years ago bauer et al 2015 medium range forecasts are crucial for agronomy forestry and water resources management as they provide more time for decision making and planning compared with short range forecasts as well as producing considerably more accurate estimations than seasonal forecasts thielen et al 2009 nevertheless implementing medium range nwp forecasts is not straightforward correction methods are often needed to reduce forecast errors and account for local meteorological conditions that are not resolved at spatial scale of the nwp model grid e g delle monache et al 2011 glahn and lowry 1972 gneiting 2014 gneiting et al 2005 pelosi et al 2017 wilks 2006 using multiple model ensembles instead of a single model and statistical post processing of nwp models outputs are two of the several correction methods used to improve weather related forecasts hamill 2012 hagedorn et al 2012 found that the post processing procedure based on a simple bias correction approach can be particularly useful at locations affected by systematic errors including areas with complex landscape or coastal grid points in addition studies showed that the multi model ensemble approach by combining multiple nwps often have higher skill than any individual model due to compensation effects through combining models with different physics numeric and initial conditions e g hagedorn et al 2005 recent studies have explored global numerical weather model outputs for forecasting medium range et 0 in real time for example perera et al 2014 used accesss g global model outputs to estimate et 0 with lead times up to 9 days this model is operated by the australian bureau of meteorology with a spatial resolution of 80 km in this study the et 0 forecasts showed an average rmse less than 1 mm day 1 for lead time up to 4 days after removing systematic bias of the model outputs tian and martinez 2012a b employed ncep global forecast system gfs retrospective forecast reforecast data to generate 1 15 day probabilistic daily et 0 forecast and then statistically downscaled the forecasts by means of different analog based approaches in the southeastern united states the results showed that most of the forecasts were skillful in the first 5 lead days tian and martinez 2014 also generated the forecasts with the second generation ncep gfs reforecast dataset which was operationally available from 2012 and included a complete set of meteorological data for the et 0 estimation with 11 ensemble members and a spatial resolution of 100 km compared with the previous studies tian and martinez 2014 improved the skill of the probabilistic et 0 forecasts as well as the performance of the soil water deficit estimation for irrigation scheduling in the first 5 lead days due to the availability of a complete meteorological dataset produced by a more advanced nwp model at higher spatial resolution nonetheless all the nwp based et 0 studies focused on either a single model or a specific climate region or a single aspect of forecast performance pelosi et al 2016 perera et al 2014 tian and martinez 2012a b tian and martinez 2014 perera et al 2014 it is still lacking a comprehensive assessment of medium range et 0 forecasts based on multiple global nwp models over diverse climate regions forecasts provided by the thorpex interactive grand global ensemble tigge project provide an opportunity to produce next generation medium range et 0 forecasting given its multi model ensemble feature real time accessibility complete coverage in space and time and fully archived near surface variables swinbank et al 2016 tigge is an unprecedented effort to accelerate improvements in the accuracy of 1 day to 2 week high impact weather forecasts the tigge archive contains medium range forecasts from nine operational global ensembles produced by the most important forecast systems including the ncep system more importantly tigge databases enable combining multiple model ensembles as an alternative for reducing et 0 forecast errors which has not been explored in previous studies hagedorn et al 2012 found that a multi model ensemble combining all nine models from the tigge archive did not outperform the best single model for temperature forecasts however a reduced multi model system consisting of only the best four model systems the canadian meteorological centre cmc the ncep the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ec or ecmwf and the united kingdom meteorological office model mo showed an improved performance with the ec model contributing the most to the added benefits of the multi model and the cmc practically adding a negligible contribution the ec and mo models are accessible in real time and have similar overall levels of skill buizza 2014 buizza et al 2005 johnson and swinbank 2009 matsueda and endo 2011 titley et al 2008 therefore the multi model ensembles through combining ncep models with ec and mo models would potentially improve et 0 forecast performance this study aims to produce and evaluate deterministic and probabilistic et 0 forecasts from both single and multi model combinations of ec ncep and mo forecasts from the tigge dataset this study also evaluates the effects of different ensemble sizes on et 0 forecast performance as well as the impact of the individual weather forecast variable on et 0 forecasts further the study focused on the summer season and includes sites distributed over all climate regions in the contiguous united states conus this is the first study explicitly examining both probabilistic and deterministic forecasts from leading global nwp models from the tigge dataset and the first exploring the potential of using multi model forecasts for improving medium range et 0 predictions 2 datasets and methods 2 1 measurement dataset in this study daily measurements from 101 quality controlled u s climate reference network uscrn weather stations were used as the observational reference as shown in fig 1 these stations are distributed over nine climatologically consistent regions in conus divided by scientists of the national centers for environmental information ncei karl and koss 1984 we used uscrn stations instead of the agricultural weather stations for facilitating the comparisons among forecasting methods in different climate regions the agricultural weather stations have a modified near surface boundary layer compared to the surrounding landscape providing a source of bias between observations and forecasts whereas the uscrn stations have been deployed in the locations that are representative of the climate of the region and not heavily influenced by unique local factors noaa nesdis 2003 high quality observational climate datasets with a thorough quality control are important for accurate et 0 estimations the uscrn meets the highest standards for instrument exposure menne et al 2010 and is consistent in time and by sensor type leeper et al 2015 the quality controls of the uscrn observations are periodically performed by noaa s atmospheric turbulence and diffusion division to calibrate the sensors against national institute of standards and technology traceable standards that are re certified annually automated uscrn field observations are monitored by the national centers for environmental information where indications of missing messages or questionable observation data are identified and addressed previous studies have shown that the quality controlled uscrn observations such as solar radiation performed very well compared to the other observational references at daily timescale e g wang et al 2012 the quality controlled uscrn observations would therefore be sufficient for providing high quality et 0 estimations the reader can refer to the ncei portal https www ncdc noaa gov crn for detailed information related to the uscrn data and data collection process the dataset used in this study comprised the period between may 1 and september 9 from 2014 to 2016 the retrieved data included daily observations of minimum and maximum temperature t min and t max c respectively minimum and maximum relative humidity rh min and rh max and time integrated surface incoming solar radiation r s mj m 2 five minute average wind speed values u m s 1 at a height of 1 5 m were also retrieved and aggregated to daily values the latitude longitude and altitude m of the involved stations were also included in the original dataset data of stations with a considerable number of missing records in a year were excluded from the dataset nv baker 5 w data of year 2014 tx austin 33 nw data of year 2015 fl sebring 23 sse and co montrose 11 en data of year 2016 days accounting for missing measurements in the remaining stations were removed from the analyses these days represented a negligible portion of the total period 2 2 forecast dataset the basic forecast datasets used in this study included perturbed ensemble forecasts issued by the ec ncep and mo models these forecasts are freely available in the tigge data portal see http apps ecmwf int datasets data tigge over the period from october 2006 to present table 1 provides some important features about these three forecast systems the retrieved variables included 2 m air maximum and minimum temperatures t max and t min k 2 m dew point temperature t d k time integrated surface net solar radiation r ns j m 2 and the 10 m u and v components of the wind vector u m s 1 the retrieved datasets comprised the 00 utc coordinated universal time perturbed forecasts issued between may 1 and august 31 from 2014 to 2016 ec and ncep datasets had a maximum lead time of 10 days while mo consisted of a maximum lead time of 7 days as the verification data uscrn is recorded every day at local time the measurements for a given day d were matched with the forecast values comprised between the 6 utc hours of the day d and the 6 utc hours of the day d 1 all the retrieved forecasts were interpolated to the same 0 5 0 5 grid via the tigge data portal there were missing values in the retrieved ncep and mo forecasts the ncep forecasts had 23 days missing in 2016 and four days missing in 2015 the mo forecasts of 2014 were available only up to july 15 the days with missing values were all discarded the retrieved datasets included nine large grib2 format data files one per system per year each grib2 file included perturbed forecast members for the grid cells between 26 and 49 north and 74 and 124 west forecasts from grib2 data files were interpolated to the uscrn stations using nearest neighbor approach and were converted into manageable csv format data files one per station per system and per year wgrib2 a ncep utility specifically designed to manipulate grib2 files was used for processing the grib2 data all the codes for data manipulation analysis and representation were scripted in r r core team 2014 2 3 et 0 estimation et 0 estimates based on uscrn measurements and nwp forecasts were computed using the fao 56 pm allen et al 1998 allen et al 2005 equation which was available in the evapotranspiration r package guo et al 2016 the fao 56 pm equation is recommended as the standard method for estimating et 0 it applies energy balance and mass transfer principles to estimate the evapotranspiration from a uniform grass reference surface specific parameters are employed to model the surface and aerodynamic resistance from vegetation allen et al 1998 the pm equation is expressed as follows 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et 0 is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 r n is the net surface radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the daily mean air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychometric constant kpa c 1 the input variables for the fao 56 pm equation included minimum and maximum temperatures c minimum and maximum relative humidity surface incoming solar radiation mj m 2 and the wind speed m s 1 net solar radiation forecast should be transformed to incoming solar radiations using the expression r s r n 1 α where α 0 23 is the albedo of the reference crop evaporative surface minimum and maximum relative humidity forecasts were estimated using the maximum and minimum temperature and the dew point temperature forecasts following lawrence 2005 daily 10 m wind speed forecasts were adjusted to the same height of the uscrn measurements assuming a vertical log wind profile allen et al 1998 details about the implementation of the routine for computing et 0 can be found in guo et al 2016 or as part of the r package guo and westra 2017 2 4 bias correction of et 0 forecasts to investigate the effect of post processing on et 0 forecasts a simple deterministic correction a k a calibration was conducted by fitting a linear regression between observations and ensemble mean forecasts from a training dataset and applying the regression to the current mean forecast value the correction factor given by the difference between the regression adjusted forecast and the raw ensemble mean forecast was added to all ensemble members of the raw forecast in a way that the ensemble distribution was shifted the training data included the forecast observation pairs corresponding to the 30 days prior to the forecast initial day the calibration procedure was applied at all stations and lead times 2 5 forecast evaluation hereafter we refer to the measurement based et 0 estimations as observed et 0 or observations to et 0 forecasts before calibration as raw forecasts and to the et 0 forecasts after bias correction either as bias corrected or calibrated forecasts both raw and calibrated et 0 forecasts were evaluated against uscrn based observations for each lead time year station and system the different statistics were averaged over each ncei climate region fig 1 to show the performance of each forecast in climatologically different regions the forecasts were assessed using both deterministic and probabilistic metrics deterministic metrics were used for evaluating the ensemble mean forecasts probabilistic metrics were used to evaluate probabilistic forecasts which were converted from the ensemble forecasts detailed information for each forecast metric is described below 2 5 1 deterministic forecast metrics for the deterministic metrics we used the mean error me and the root mean square error rmse which are among the most commonly reported measures of agreement between forecasts and observations me provides an estimate of the model bias while rmse is an accuracy measuring criteria for unbiased models rmse is an estimator of the square root of the ensemble variance let f l r d l t represent the mean of the forecast variable at location l r l r 1 n l r and day d l d l 1 n d l with a lead time t n l r is the number of locations belonging to a region r while n d l is the total number of available forecast days for a specific location let o l r d l denote the observed variable at the corresponding location and day the me and rmse for the specific region r and lead time t me r t and rmse r t respectively are then computed as 2 me r t 1 n l r 1 n l r d l 1 n d l f l r d l t o l r d l 3 rmse r t 1 n l r 1 n l r d l 1 n d l f l r d l t o l r d l 2 where n is the total number of pairs of forecasts and observations in a specific region 2 5 2 probabilistic forecast metrics the skill of the probabilistic forecast was evaluated using the brier skill score bss associated to the tercile events of the ensemble forecasts upper or 1st middle or 2nd and lower or 3rd terciles let p l r d l t represent the forecast probability of the considered event occurring at location l r and day d l with lead time t let o l r d l be equal to 1 if the event occurs at the specific location and day and 0 otherwise similarly to rmse in the deterministic case the brier score bs measures the mean squared probability error murphy 1973 of the forecast associated to a given threshold value or event the bs for the specific region r with lead time t bs r t is then calculated as follows 4 bs r t 1 n l r 1 n l r d l 1 n d l p l r d l t o l r d l 2 the corresponding brier skill score bss r t then measures the improvement of the probabilistic forecast relative to a reference forecast usually called the sample climatological distribution or the sample climatology wilks 2011 5 bss r t 1 bs r t bs clim r where bs clim r refers to the brier scores of the sample climatology which is defined in this study as a function of the relative frequencies of the n observations o l r d l in the verification data set wilks 2010 6 bs clim r o l r d l 1 o l r d l where o l r d l is the event relative frequency within the n member sample of observations the bss ranges from to 1 and values of bss equal to 1 indicate perfect skill since in this study the bss was used to evaluate the skill associated to the tercile events of the ensemble forecasts the event relative frequency o l r d l is in all cases constant and equal to 0 33 and bs clim r 0 2 2 and consequently the bss values for the different regions and lead times are inversely proportional to the corresponding bs values binary events highlight only one aspect of the forecast the continuous rank probability score crps which is recommended to obtain a broader overall view of performance hersbach 2000 was also used to evaluate the probabilistic forecast performance the crps is precisely the integral of the brier scores at all possible threshold values for the continuous predictand gneiting et al 2005 hersbach 2000 it measures the integrated square by all possible threshold values h of difference between the cumulative distribution function cdf of the forecast variable f f and the corresponding cdf of the observed variable f o following gneiting et al 2005 the crps of an ensemble forecast for lead time t location l r and day d l crps l r d l t is computed as 7 crps l r d l t f l r d l t f h f l r d l o h 2 dh where f l r d l o h h h o l r d l h being heaviside function which takes the value 0 when h o l r d l and the value 1 otherwise the aggregated continuous rank probability score for a region r and lead time t crps r t is then computed as 8 crps r t 1 n l r 1 n l r d l 1 n d l crps l r d l t the crps variates between 0 and smaller value indicate better performances reliability diagrams as a measure of systematic and conditional bias were also computed to investigate the reliability of the forecasts the reliability diagram plots the observed frequency of an event defined by the threshold h against its forecasted probability the range of forecast probabilities is divided into k bins then on the x axis we plot the average probability of the forecasts that falls in the k th bin while on the y axis the fraction of the corresponding observations that are below the threshold is plotted perfect reliability is achieved along the 45 diagonal line on the reliability diagram when the observed frequency of the given event within each bin equals the average of the corresponding forecast probabilities the deviation from the diagonal gives the conditional bias on the reliability diagram it is also possible to show the sharpness of the forecast which is a measure of the forecast confidence by means of a histogram representing the frequency of forecasts in each probability bin sharper forecasts mean more concentrated frequency distributions of the ensemble forecasts sharper forecasts usually indicate better forecasts if they have good reliability or calibration gneiting et al 2007 a bootstrapping analysis was also included in the reliability diagrams in order to assess the uncertainty of the sampled pairs of points random sampling was performed 1000 times with replacement in a standard way error bars accounting for the 5 and 95 percent of the values distribution were indicated in the reliability diagrams 2 6 inter comparison of forecast schemes the study compared the performance of single et 0 raw forecasts of the ec ncep and mo as well as the multi model et 0 forecasts arising from the simple combination of the three ensemble forecasts hereinafter referred as ec necp mo and the combination of the two ensemble forecasts the ec and mo ensembles hereinafter referred as ec mo the differences between the performance of calibrated forecasts and raw forecasts for each system and the multi model ensemble system were also investigated all the comparisons were conducted over the same period between may 31 and august 31 from 2014 to 2016 with a bootstrapping analysis as specified below applied to assess if the differences were statistically significant when assessing the difference the weather forecast data should be treated as paired since it accounts for the error correlation between two samples hamill 1999 when performing the bootstrapping analysis each of the system forecasts and observations were simultaneously sampled from the same randomly chosen dates the bootstrapping analysis relied on 1000 random sampling with replacement the differences were considered as significant if at least 95 of the bootstrapped differences had the same sign positive or negative the reliability diagrams also included a bootstrap analysis in order to assess the uncertainty of the sampled pairs of points it is included by default in the corresponding routine of the specsverification r package error bars accounting for the 5 and 95 percent of the values distribution are represented sampling was performed in the standard way and also included 1000 random sampling with replacement we also examined the effects of different number of ec perturbed members on the performance of et 0 forecasts considering the large ensemble size of this nwp system this is useful from both a theoretical and practical point of view for example it is important to know how a nwp system behaves when it has the same number of ensemble members as the other systems also a reduced number of ensemble members is more efficient in operational schemes where computation is time consuming this study compared the performance of a nwp forecast with different number of randomly sampled ensemble members applied to both raw and calibrated forecasts 2 7 impact of the individual weather forecast variable on et 0 forecasts we also evaluated the forecast performance for individual weather variables and investigated how the forecast uncertainty of the individual weather variable affected the et 0 forecasts the analysis was performed by comparing the error distributions of the raw forecasts for four individual weather variables t rh rs and u with the corresponding error distributions of the raw et 0 forecasts the et 0 forecasts were calculated using one forecast variable and three observed variables i e by replacing one observation at a time with one forecast so that the impacts of single forecast variable on et 0 forecasts can be separated when perturbing t and rh we simultaneously replaced the maximum and minimum observed values by the corresponding forecasts while we assessed the impact of individual weather variables on et 0 forecast skill we did not evaluate the skill of individual weather variables the reasons were twofold first the scope of this paper is to produce and assess multi model et 0 forecasts which includes multiple experiments and procedures that provide ample information for understanding and improving et 0 forecasts second while the bias of the et 0 forecast is caused by individual weather variables bias correcting calculated et 0 is computationally more efficient and addresses the biases from both individual weather variables as well as the correlations among variables previous studies have found that bias corrected et 0 forecasts performed better than any individual input variables e g lewis et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 variability of et 0 observations the et 0 observations based on the uscrn measurements show diverse distributions over the ncei climate regions fig 2 the mean values approximately vary between a minimum of 3 2 and a maximum of 6 3 mm day 1 while the standard deviation ranged from 1 to 1 8 mm day 1 both mean and variance of et 0 forecasts are consistently higher in southern regions which comprise coastal and continental stations and a complex orography like the w and sw regions june and july et 0 values tend to be higher than those in may and august while may and june et 0 values show higher variability 3 2 performance of raw et 0 forecasts here we provide a comparative assessment of the performances of the single and multi model raw et 0 forecasts across regions and for different lead times fig 3 shows the me and rmse for the different system forecasts all systems tend to over predict et 0 observations for different lead times and regions the raw ncep forecasts are more biased and less accurate than the raw ec and mo forecasts the raw ec forecasts show slightly higher me but much lower rmse than the mo forecasts for longer lead times the performances of the raw et 0 forecasts also vary among the different regions all systems perform sensibly better in the northern regions than in southern regions and the west region the performance is poor in the w region which is characterized by a very complex landscape the simplified terrain heights of the forecast model may probably affect the quality of the forecasts in regions like this hagedorn et al 2008 fig 4 shows the bss of the raw ec forecasts for the three terciles of the ensemble forecasts as well as the differences between the bss of the ncep mo ec mo and ec ncep mo systems and the bss of the ec system the results indicate that for probabilistic et 0 forecasts the bss is generally better for the lower tercile event compared with the upper and middle tercile events most of the middle tercile forecasts show low bss and reliability since the changes or shifts in the middle tercile are not as sizeable as in the lower or upper terciles as found and discussed in previous studies e g barnston et al 2003 van den dool and toth 1991 in figs 5 and 6 we compare the reliability diagrams related to the different et 0 systems forecasts for the upper and lower tercile events respectively considering for the comparison in the former case different regions at the same lead time i e three days and in the latter case different lead times at the same region i e the s region the ensemble forecasts show an over forecasting bias when predicting et 0 values in the upper tercile fig 5 and an under forecasting bias for the lower tercile event fig 6 et 0 forecasts for the first tercile events are generally more reliable and sharper than for the third tercile events the reliability for short and middle lead times is similar in most experiments see fig 6 in general all the systems forecasts particularly the ncep forecasts seem fairly sharp the results reported in figs 4 6 indicate that ncep ensembles are considerably less skillful and reliable than any other ensemble the ec and mo performances are comparable the ec forecasts are on average more skillful and reliable although mo performs similarly or slightly better in experiments for the northern regions and the west region as a result the ec mo forecasts guarantee equal or higher bss compared with ec and ec ncep mo in most cases the overall statistics for the multi model ec ncep mo are presumably affected by the poor performance of ncep hagedorn et al 2008 and mathiesen and kleissl 2011 showed that original ec forecasts of temperature and radiation respectively outperformed the corresponding ncep forecasts in the continental u s table 2 summarizes the median values of different metrics over all regions for the forecasts at 1 and 7 day leads the median values using ec mo forecasts are consistently better than for ec forecasts at 1 day lead while behave similarly at 7 day lead the reason is that mo forecasts tend to degrade more than ec forecasts over lead time the ec ncep mo multi model practically provides no improvement with respect ec mo and ec given the unfavorable performance of the ncep forecasts 3 3 performance of calibrated forecasts the regression calibrations substantially improve the probabilistic performance of the ensemble forecasts especially regions and forecast systems with less skillful raw forecasts as it is shown in fig 7 the differences in terms of bss between calibrated forecasts and raw forecasts are mostly positive and significant for each model and for all three terciles with some exceptions for the middle tercile the skill of the ncep forecasts considerably improves after bias corrections more than other forecast systems the southern and western regions also gain more from calibrations than the northern regions which were characterized by better performances for the raw forecasts in particular the w region goes from being the worse to being the best through the simple bias correction meanwhile the increments in terms of bss for the upper tercile are at least twice as much as those for the lower event we further compare the bss for the calibrated single and multi model forecast systems in fig 8 the ncep forecasts are still less skillful than the ec forecasts or any other systems forecasts the calibrated ec mo and ec ncep mo forecasts are significantly more skillful than the calibrated ec forecasts in the experiments where ec and mo showed similar performances and mostly for short lead times and or in the case of the w and nw regions on the other hand the multi models are as skillful as ec in the experiments where ec outperformed mo the maximum improvements in terms of bss from the multi model systems represent a gain in forecast skill of less than one day compared with the single model systems in addition to the bss the reliability of all the forecasts is also improved through the regression calibration process with the third tercile events experiencing the highest improvements as shown in fig 9 the calibrated ec forecasts are more reliable but slightly less sharp than the ncep and mo forecasts and are equally reliable and sharp as ec mo and ec ncep mo it is worth noting that the reliability assessments might be affected by the sample size in regions such as w ne and nw because the diagrams with relatively small sample size are prone to be noisy e g hamill 1997 in table 3 we summarize the median values of the evaluated metrics for the calibrated forecasts at 1 and 7 day lead times by comparing tables 2 and 3 we find that the bss in terciles the me rmse and crps values are considerably improved after calibration the ec mo and ec ncep mo forecasts seem to be consistently better than the ec forecasts at 1 day lead but not at 7 day lead since the forecast performance from the three systems are consistently low at 7 day lead ec ncep mo is not recommended for implementation system as it does not bring additional improvements with respect to either ec or ec mo it is worth noting that the rmse values from calibrated forecasts are mostly lower than the other nwp based et 0 forecasts reported in australia using access g model perera et al 2014 and chile using mm5 silva et al 2010 on the other hand the bss assessments for the se region from the ec and the multi model forecasts are similar to those found by tian and martinez 2014 using ncep based analog forecasts hamill and whitaker 2006 hamill et al 2006 the nwp based et 0 forecasts have been implemented in operational advisory systems to assist farmer s decision making chirico et al 2018 studies like this provide a basis for an operational system of agronomic decision making nevertheless the bias correction approach used in this study is applied to the forecast at the uscrn stations which are representative of the climate of the region but are not in agricultural settings the bias corrected forecasts based on the uscrn settings will likely be biased warm and dry compared to agricultural settings therefore a different bias correction i e based on agricultural stations will be needed to take into account the microclimate in agricultural settings this can be done by removing the air temperature and relative humidity errors as part of a preprocessing analysis e g lewis and allen 2017 or by directly bias correcting the calculated et 0 forecasts e g tian et al 2014 at agricultural weather stations 3 4 the effect of ensemble size on ec based et 0 forecasts model systems with a greater number of ensemble members are expected to have better probabilistic forecasts ferro et al 2008 as well as greater impacts on the multi model predictions than model systems with fewer members hagedorn et al 2012 this section analyzes in what extension the ec based et 0 forecasts are affected by the ensemble size fig 10 shows the bss for the first and third tercile events using 10 20 30 40 and 50 ensemble members of the raw and calibrated ec forecasts in agreement with ferro et al 2008 the larger the size of the ensemble the higher the skill of the probabilistic forecasts however the changing rate of bss is almost negligible for 1 day lead and increases just slightly with the increasing lead time for 5 and 10 day leads an ensemble size of 20 and 30 members respectively seems to reach the same performance as with 50 members the forecasting scheme raw or bias corrected scarcely affects the functional dependence between bss or crps and ensemble size the improvements for the third tercile events through calibration suggested that it was more efficient using a calibrated forecast with 10 ensemble members than using a raw forecast model with full ensemble members regardless of the lead times we further examine the median crps and bss values of the 10 member ec forecasts and the full member mo forecasts for the first and third tercile events as a function of lead time fig 11 the ec forecasts perform better than the mo forecasts even with much less forecast members except for the bss of the raw forecasts for the first tercile notice that the ec calibrated forecasts still improves the skill by approximately one day relative to the calibrated mo forecasts for 3 day lead or more 3 5 impact of the weather parameter forecast errors from different nwp in this section we analyze how the individual daily weather forecasts t rh rs and u from different nwps here only ec and ncep are shown influence the daily et 0 forecasts by replacing one observed weather variable at a time with the forecasts when estimating et 0 the results show that solar radiation forecasts have the uppermost impact on et 0 forecast errors regardless of the forecast system considered fig 12 similarly to what was found by perera et al 2014 and ishak et al 2010 the influence of solar radiation forecasts is dominant even for the regions where the calibrations had minimal effects such as in the wnc region fig 13 c suggesting that the impact is also high using calibrated forecasts in fact considering for instance the large et 0 errors for the se region i e the one with the worse performance after calibration it seems that bad performances in the radiation forecasts are not properly addressed through the post processing of the et 0 forecasts fig 12a and b show that both models tend to overestimate the solar radiation forecasts probably due to model distortions in the representation of surface downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation bodas salcedo et al 2008 bodas salcedo et al 2012 mathiesen and kleissl 2011 wild 2008 nevertheless the radiation forecast errors using ncep are systematically high and are associated with et 0 forecast errors perez et al 2013 found that the ec model provided significantly better irradiance forecasts than a ncep gfs driven mesoscale model for all tested sites in different climate conditions wind speed forecasts show the highest relative errors among weather parameter forecasts but they commonly have a lower influence on predicted et 0 values than solar radiation forecasts similar results have been reported in other studies ishak et al 2010 pelosi et al 2016 these forecasts errors are sensibly higher in the southern regions and especially in the w region for which the rmse s of the associated et 0 forecasts tend to be higher than those relative to the solar radiation forecasts fig 13c and d it is worth noting that this study uses a one variable at a time replacement method to examine the impact of individual drivers on et 0 forecast skill it measures the impact of the individual variables on forecast skill but does not reflect the actual drivers of daily et 0 variability over conus hobbins 2016 provided a decomposition of et 0 over conus variability for each month of the year and showed that during the summer wind speed is the dominant driver over much of the western us and solar radiation is the dominant driver of the southeast it could explain the fact that the errors in wind speed and solar radiation forecasts have such detrimental impact on the et 0 forecasts in the west and southeast respectively in contrast temperature forecasts show the lowest bias and highest accuracy among all weather variables and have a limited impact on the et 0 forecasts only surpassing that of relative humidity forecasts fig 12 the sensitivity of predicted et 0 to the errors on t and rh forecasts might be affected by the fact that the biases in minimum and maximum values can compensate each other when evaluating et 0 with the penman monteith equation eq 1 it is worth noting that temperature forecasts contributed most to the et 0 forecast errors in the w region suggesting that the unfavorable performance of raw forecasts in this region is determined by the joint effects of large errors in radiation wind speed and temperature forecasts an arising question considering the contrasting patterns for the et 0 forecast errors associated with temperature and solar radiation forecasts is whether simpler et 0 models such as the hargreaves samani allen et al 1998 hargreaves and samani 1985 can perform as well as the fao 56 pm model by circumventing the errors associated with wind and solar radiation forecasts pelosi et al 2016 found that the hargreaves samani and the priestley and taylor models priestley and taylor 1972 performed well in locations of southern italy when they were not close to the coastline 4 conclusions in summary this study produced and assessed et 0 forecasts calculated using the leading ec ncep and mo model predictions based on fao 56 pm equation at 101 stations over nine climate regions in conus it examined the probabilistic and deterministic forecasting ability of single model ensembles as well as two multi model ensemble systems ec mo and ec mo ncep and also pondered the effects of ensemble member size on a single model forecast skill it also identified sources of errors contributing to et 0 forecasts caused by individual weather forecast variables from different nwp models this work is helpful for the implementation of reliable operational algorithms for medium range et 0 forecasting it contributes to understand the strengths and weaknesses of three leading forecasting systems when dealing with an agricultural meteorological variable et 0 which is a complex nonlinear function of multiple weather parameters major conclusions of this study are highlighted below first of all the results revealed that both raw and bias corrected ec forecasts generally had the lowest errors and the highest skill and reliability among all the nwp models being considered followed by mo and ncep forecasts the ec mo multi model ensemble showed consistently better performance than the ec forecasts in experiments where ec and mo performed similarly most comprehending short lead times and or the w and nw regions ec mo performed as well as or better than ec ncep mo that was found to be unsuitable for implementation secondly the study also showed that even a simple bias correction procedure would remarkably improve the forecast performance particularly in those regions involving coastal stations or with a complex orography while the statistical calibration reduced discrepancies between model performances it did not change the ranking of their performances thirdly the performance of ec forecasts was only slightly influenced by the size of the sampled ensemble when the number of members was equal to or higher than 10 in particular at short lead times in addition ec forecasts with only 10 ensemble members provided better performance than the full mo forecast ensembles these results suggested that a statistical calibrated forecast with less members could be more beneficial than using raw forecasts with full ensemble members finally our results suggested that the errors of the radiation forecasts followed by those of the wind forecasts had the most detrimental effect on the et 0 forecasts temperature forecasts showed the lowest bias and highest accuracy among all individual weather variables while contributed slightly more to the et 0 forecast errors than humidity forecasts this result suggested that a simpler model with less meteorological input may perform as well as fao 56 pm model by avoiding additional errors

7239,extreme precipitation can cause flooding and may result in great economic losses and deaths the return level is a commonly used measure of extreme precipitation events and is required for hydrological engineer designs including those of sewerage systems dams reservoirs and bridges in this paper we propose a two step method to estimate the return level and its uncertainty for a study region in the first step we use the generalized extreme value distribution the l moment method and the stationary bootstrap to estimate the return level and its uncertainty at the site with observations in the second step a spatial model incorporating the heterogeneous measurement errors and covariates is trained to estimate return levels at sites with no observations and to improve the estimates at sites with limited information the proposed method is applied to the daily rainfall data from 273 weather stations in the haihe river basin of north china we compare the proposed method with two alternatives the first one is based on the ordinary kriging method without measurement error and the second one smooths the estimated location and scale parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution by the universal kriging method results show that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts we also propose a novel approach to assess the two step method by comparing it with the at site estimation method with a series of reduced length of observations estimates of the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return level maps and the corresponding uncertainties are provided for the haihe river basin and a comparison with those released by the hydrology bureau of ministry of water resources of china is made keywords gev distribution heterogeneous measurement error l moment return level estimate stationary bootstrap two step method 1 introduction although extreme precipitation events are rare they usually cause serious economic losses and deaths zhao et al 2013 and they are also one of the major concerns for hydrological engineering designs asadieh and krakauer 2015 showed that there has been an increasing trend of extreme precipitation since 1901 and the risk of flooding associated with extreme precipitation is expected to increase there is extensive research about extreme precipitation chow et al 1988 veneziano et al 2006 madsen et al 2014 return level maps are used to demonstrate the extreme rainfall information within a study region and they are usually provided by government agencies who deal with hydrology ih 1999 bonnin et al 2006 2011 regional frequency analysis rfa is a multi step procedure to generate return level maps dalrymple 1960 ih 1999 ouardaa et al 2008 bonnin et al 2006 2011 it starts by defining the homogeneous sub regions through a cluster analysis and pools data within each sub region to estimate model parameters using the l moment method hosking and wallis 1997 ih 1999 fowler and kilsby 2003 bonnin et al 2006 2011 a simpler way to get return level maps is to interpolate the estimates at sites with observations using a spatial model to be specific an extreme value distribution such as the pearson iii distribution and the generalized extreme value gev distribution is statistically fitted for each site with observations first and then either the estimated parameters of the extreme value distribution beguería and vicente serrano 2006 ceresetti et al 2012 or return levels weisse and bois 2002 hb 2006 are spatially interpolated over the study region szolgay et al 2009 compared four estimation approaches including 1 interpolating daily precipitation data and generating return level maps by fitting an extreme value distribution individually using information at each site within the study region 2 interpolating three parameters of the gev distribution and generating return level maps through the interpolated parameters for each site 3 interpolating the estimates of return levels to generate return level maps and 4 the rfa method the result showed that the rfa outperforms its alternatives but it requires a subjective predetermination of the homogeneous sub regions however the discontinuity on the borders of sub regions is a problem for the rfa method szolgay et al 2009 also pointed out that the uncertainty of the estimated return level varies with the extreme value distribution chosen and the length and quality of the observations at each site and such uncertainty would invalidate the estimated return level maps davison et al 2012 and cooley et al 2012 surveyed the progress on the spatial extremes padoan et al 2010 and mannshardt shamseldin et al 2010 used univariate models to estimate parameters at sites with observations under a conditional independence assumption and simple regression models to characterize spatial uncertainties of the estimated parameters ribatet et al 2012 showed that simple regression models are sometimes unable to capture complex spatial behaviors many authors have studied bayesian hierarchical models cooley et al 2007 gaetan and grigoletto 2007 sang and gelfand 2009 cooley and sain 2010 and applied markov chain monte carlo algorithms to produce return level maps as well as the measures of uncertainty davison et al 2012 however assumptions made in the bayesian models are not easy to verify and the calculation of the bayesian model is complex and not easy to implement in practice besides the extreme rainfall data usually have heterogeneous variances in space szolgay et al 2009 and the application of max stable processes is very challenging ceresetti et al 2010 in this paper we propose a two step method to generate return level maps and uncertainty estimates in the first step the estimates of the return level and its uncertainty are obtained by the gev distribution the l moment method and stationary bootstrap politis and romano 1994 for each site with observations in the second step we use a universal kriging with heterogeneous measurement error model to estimate return levels at sites with no observations and improve the estimates at sites with limited information in addition the site elevation information is incorporated in this model creutin and obled 1982 goovaerts 2000 the proposed method is applied to the daily rainfall data from 273 weather stations in the haihe river basin of north china and compared with the universal kriging model with measurement error for the estimated parameters of the gev distribution at sites with observations and the commonly used ordinary kriging model we propose a novel assessment approach to evaluate the two step method by comparing it with the at site estimation method based on a series of reduced length of observations maps for 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels and corresponding uncertainty maps were constructed by the proposed two step method for the haihe river basin the generated return level maps are compared with the existing ones provided by the hydrology bureau of ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 2 data and methods 2 1 database the haihe river basin is in north china within the ranges of longitude of 112 120 e and latitude of 35 43 n fig 1 the total area is about 31 8 104 km2 with hills and plateaus occupying 60 of the region the northeast to southwest taihang moutains lies in the western part with an elevation of about 1000 1700 m and the east to west yanshan mountains are in the northern part with an elevation of 500 800 m in the lower elevationsand 1400 1600 m in the higher elevations three main rivers including the haihe river luanhe river and tuhaimajiahe river provide vital water sources for north china mega cities including beijing and tianjin are also located in this region meteorology data from 273 weather stations within this basin are available from the national meteorological information center nmic china meteorological administration cma in this paper we analyze the extreme precipitation based on the annual maximums of daily rainfall data between 1951 and 2012 for this region the daily precipitation data are collected by the standard rain gauge with a diameter of 20 cm the collection process is conducted at 08 00 and 20 00 beijing local time each day and the daily rainfall datum is the summation of these two measurements the average annual precipitation amount ranged from 358 9 mm to 776 4 mm for the 273 weather stations and there was a decreasing trend from the southeastern part to northwestern part influenced by the east asian monsoon system 52 3 72 7 of precipitation occurs in the summer jja the number of annual maximum daily rainfalls ranges from 34 to 62 observations for different stations and the average number is 52 there are 202 stations with observations no less than 50 and 258 stations no less than 40 the averaged distance between pairs of stations is 291 2 km and the maximum is about 1000 km note that the stations are unevenly distributed and the density in the mountainous area is lower which may lead to the higher uncertainty in those areas however these are all data accessible at present and there is a need to have more stations in the lower density area 2 2 two step method for generating return level maps in this section we propose a two step method for generating return level maps first we briefly review the gev distribution and l moment method which are the building blocks of the proposed method then for each weather station we use the stationary bootstrap a version of block bootstrap methods with replacement lahiri 2003 to estimate the return level and its variance which is treated as the variance of the measurement error at last a universal kriging with heterogeneous measurement error model incorporating the elevation information is applied to estimate return levels at sites with no observations and improve the estimates at sites with limited information 2 2 1 gev distribution and l moment method the gev distribution jenkinson 1955 is commonly used for modelling extreme events and its probability density function is 1 f x σ μ ξ 1 σ exp 1 ξ ϑ e ϑ 2 ϑ ξ 1 log 1 ξ x μ σ ξ 0 x μ σ ξ 0 where σ 0 ξ μ are the scale shape and location parameters respectively the r year return level is the 1 r 1 th quantile of the gev distribution and it can be estimated by 3 y 1 r 1 σ μ ξ μ σ ξ 1 log 1 r 1 ξ ξ 0 μ σ log log 1 r 1 ξ 0 where σ μ ξ are the estimated parameters in eq 1 by the l moment hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 2 2 2 estimation of the r year return level and its variance at the site with observations hosking 1986 discussed the variance estimator of the estimated l moment and a delta method was suggested to implement for obtaining the variance estimator of the estimated r year return level athreya and lahiri 2006 instead we use the stationary bootstrap method politis and romano 1994 to estimate the r year return level and its variance since it is easier to implement and produces similar variance estimates of l moments comparing with the delta method based on a small simulation study conducted without making the expressions too complicated we omit r explicitly for the return level estimates let d be the spatial domain of the haihe river basin we have n weather stations scattered in the domain as shown in fig 1 and their locations are indexed by s 1 s 2 s n d for station s i we have l i observations of the annual maximum daily rainfall and denote them as x i j j 1 2 l i note that the lengths of observations may differ for different weather stations we use the following steps to estimate the r year return level and its variance step 1 for b th iteration obtain a i b x i j b j 1 l i using the stationary bootstrap based on the original observations step 2 use a i b to estimate the r year return level denoted as y i b by the gev distribution and l moment mentioned in 2 2 1 step 3 repeat step 1 and step 2 for b times and estimate the r year return level and its variance by 4 y i 1 b b 1 b y i b 5 v i 1 b 1 b 1 b y i b y i 2 2 2 3 construction of the return level map based on the estimated r year return levels and variances at sites with observations we use the universal kriging with measurement error model to generate the r year return level map within the study region consider 6 y s μ s τ s ε s for s d where y s is the estimated r year return level of location s μ s β 0 β 1 h s is the trend effect h s is the elevation of location s τ s is an intrinsic stationary spatial process with a parametric semi variogram function indexed by the nugget sill and range parameters c 0 c s a cressie 1993 and ε s is the measurement error with mean 0 and variance v s for station at location s i the estimated r year return level is y i and an estimate of v s i is v i for this study we use the following spherical semi variogram for τ s s d that is 7 1 2 var τ s i τ s j c 0 c s a 0 d ij 0 c 0 c s 3 2 d ij a 1 2 d ij a 3 0 d ij a c 0 c s d ij a where d ij is the euclidean distance between the i th and j th stations and we compare the estimated spherical semi variogram and the empirical one in section 3 kriging for the data contaminated with heterogeneous measurement errors has been investigated by many researchers cressie 1993 delhomme 1978 kleijnen et al 2005 christensen 2011 and ignoring the heterogeneity of the measurement errors leads to invalid inference in this study we use the heterogeneous variance measurement error filtered kriging method hvmfk christensen 2011 to estimate the parameters in the eqs 6 and 7 by the following iterative steps step 1 use universal kriging without measurement error to estimate β 0 β 1 say β 0 1 β 1 1 step 2 for the t th iteration with t 1 obtain z t s i y i β 0 t β 1 t h s i i 1 n by which we can estimate parameters of the semi variogram model that is eq 7 by hvmfk and denote the estimated results to be c 0 t c s t a t the estimated nugget and sill parameters are calibrated based on the homogeneous measurement errors see christensen 2011 for details step 3 based on c 0 t c s t a t and v i i 1 n update the estimate of β 0 β 1 and denote it as β 0 t 1 β 1 t 1 step 4 repeat step 2 and step 3 until convergence notice that parameters of the theoretical spherical semi variogram are only for the intrinsic stationary spatial process and they characterize the dependence structure of the return level estimates by incorporating the heterogeneous measurement error specifically the microscale variance cressie 1993 of the return level estimate is the summation of the nugget and the variance of the measurement error for each location in the study region the estimated theoretical semi variogram would affect the estimation of the regression parameters and vice versa thus we use an iterative estimation procedure to estimate the parameters in eqs 6 and 7 instead of using universal kriging we can also use ordinary least square to get β 0 1 β 1 1 in step 1 based on the estimated parameters in the eqs 6 and 7 a universal kriging with measurement error model is used to produce the r year return level map and its uncertainty remark haas 1990a b discussed several moving window methods and pointed out that the moving window method can be used to attenuate the trend effects and handle the nonstationarity of the spatial process as an alternative we propose to use the two step method to handle the trend effects and heterogeneous measurement error at the same time and the latter one is one source to cause the nonstationarity of the estimated return levels one advantage of the proposed two step method is that we can study the influence of the elevation on the return level estimates in the study region however the moving window methods can only provide a localized analysis in a small area haas 1990b besides the proposed two step method is more computationally efficient than moving window methods based on our dataset we have compared the moving window method with 35 nearest neighbors haas 1990a and the proposed two step method and it turns out that the proposed two step method works better than the moving window method with 35 nearest neighbors most of the time with one exception for the case of 100 year return level one reason the moving window method does not work well is that the range of the spatial dependence is pretty large compared to the region of interest the estimated range parameters are around or larger than 500 km while the maximum distance between pairs of stations in our study region is about 1000 km since the moving window method does not lead to improve the performance we did not include the table in the paper 2 3 ordinary kriging method and kriging parameter method for comparison in addition to the proposed two step method we also consider the following two approaches the ordinary kriging method and a kriging parameter method based on the estimated return levels at site with observations by the gev distribution return level maps can be generated using ordinary kriging method although it is well known that the universal kriging method outperforms the ordinary kriging method when there exist a linear trend with respect to the covariates the latter is easy to implement and has been widely used in practice specifically the hydrology bureau of ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 uses a simple interpolation method to generate the return level maps since no more information about the simple interpolation method can be obtained we treat it to be ordinary kriging method and compare it with the proposed two step method the kriging parameter method interpolates the estimated parameters of the gev distribution within the study region first the l moment method and the stationary bootstrap method are used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution and their corresponding variance at site with observations then a universal kriging with measurement error model using the elevation information as the covariate is applied to predict each parameter at sites within the study region finally we estimate the return levels based on the predicted parameters see section 3 for details 2 4 at site estimation method with a reduced length of observations we propose an at site estimation method with a reduced series to estimate the return level and compare it with that from the proposed two step method as a novel assessment of the proposed method one question we want to answer is how much information is needed for the at site estimation method so that its estimate of the return level has the same uncertainty as the proposed two step method to mitigate the sample size effect among the 273 stations the comparison is made among the ones with more than 50 observations the at site estimation method estimates the r year return level and the uncertainty using a reduced length m of the observations based on the following three steps where m l i recall that we have l i observations for station s i this method first generates k series of pseudo observations of length m independently based on the l i observations by the stationary bootstrap for each series of the pseudo observations we use the stationary bootstrap to estimate the r year return level and its uncertainty then the estimators of the r year return level and uncertainty is obtained by taking the average the proposed at site estimation method is summarized by the following steps that is step 1 for the k th iteration obtain the bootstrap version of observations x i j k j 1 l i by the stationary bootstrap and get a i m k x i j k j 1 m by collecting the first m elements step 2 based on a i m k use the method discussed in 2 2 2 to get y i m k and v i m k where the subscript m explicitly denotes the length of observations step 3 repeat step 1 and step 2 for k times and estimate the r year return level and its variance by y i m 1 k k 1 k y i m k and v i m 1 k k 1 k v i m k recall that y i and v i are the results when m l i 2 5 assessment of the estimates for the proposed two step method and the at site estimation method we compare the square root of the pseudo mean square error rpmse that is 8 rpmse ts 1 n i 1 n y i ts 1 y i 2 v i ts 1 1 2 9 rpmse m 1 n i 1 n y i m y i 2 v i m 1 2 where y i ts 1 and v i ts 1 are the prediction of the r year return level and variance for station s i obtained by the proposed two step method using all observations except for the one for this station similar as 13 we can define the rpmse for the ordinary kriging method and denote it to be rpmse ok if rpmse ts rpmse m for some m we conclude that the estimate of the r year return level by the two step method is better than that obtained by the at site estimation method with m observations this criterion is used to assess the proposed two step model since we cannot estimate the variance of the estimated r year return level by the kriging parameter method we use the square root of the predicted residual error sum of squares rpress statistic to compare the two step method and the kriging parameter method that is 10 rpress kp 1 n i 1 n y i kp 1 y i 2 1 2 where y i kp 1 is the estimate of the r year return level for station s i by the kriging parameter method using all observations except for the one for this station similarly we can have rpress ts defined for the two step method the relative error re is another commonly used measure to compare the r year return level estimates and it is defined by 11 re r est y i est y i 2 where est is an estimate such as y i m or y i ts 1 3 result 3 1 characteristics of at site return levels and gev parameters fig 2 shows the estimates of the return levels fig 2a and the corresponding standard errors fig 2b by the method discussed in 2 2 2 by a standard representation of box and whisker plot the estimates of return levels and standard errors become greater as the year of return level increases among the estimated parameters of the gev distribution for 273 stations the location parameter ranged from 30 3 to 85 4 with a mean of 57 7 scale parameter ranged from 7 5 to 36 3 with a mean of 22 6 and the shape parameter ranged from 0 41 to 0 21 with 212 negative values 3 2 semi variogram models for return levels and gev parameters fig 3 a and c show the relationship between the elevation and 10 and 50 year return level estimates respectively and fig 3b and d show the corresponding empirical semi variograms and the estimated theoretical spherical semi variograms matheron 1963 based on fig 3a and c the 10 and 50 year return level estimates decrease as the elevation increases such a decreasing trend holds for other return level estimates as well thus the mean part of the proposed model in eq 6 is reasonable from fig 3b and d we conclude that the estimated theoretical spherical semi variograms fit the empirical ones well for the 10 and 50 year return level similar conclusions hold for other return levels fig 4 a and c show the relationship between the elevation and the estimated location and scale parameters of the gev model respectively and fig 4b and d show the corresponding empirical semi variograms and the estimated theoretical spherical semi variogram we can have similar conclusions as the return level estimates above that is the mean part of the proposed model in eq 6 is reasonable for the location and scale estimates of the gev distribution and the estimated theoretical spherical semi variograms fit the empirical ones well however based on fig 4e and f there are no strong trend and spatial dependence for the estimated shape parameter of the gev distribution thus we estimated the shape parameter using the sample mean the estimated parameters of the theoretical spherical semi variogram models for the return levels and parameters of the gev distribution are listed in table 1 for the return level estimates the estimated nuggets of the intrinsic stationary spatial process τ s equal to 0 except for the 100 year return level in other words the measurement errors account for the microscale variance for the 2 5 10 20 and 50 year return level estimates but the microscale variance of the 100 year return level estimate is larger than the variance of the measurement error for each location in the study region the estimated sill parameter increases as r increases and the estimated range parameter decreases at the same time thus the dependence structure of the estimated return level becomes weaker as r increases the estimated nugget parameters of the location and scale of the gev model are 0 so the measurement error variance account for all the microscale variance based on table 1 we can also conclude that all of the estimated range parameters are greater than 500 km that is they are greater than half of the maximum distance between two locations in the haihe river basin 3 3 comparison of different estimation methods first we compare the proposed two step method with the ordinary kriging approach to rule out the uncertainty of y i in eqs 8 and 9 we exclude the observations from 1993 through 2012 for each weather station before we implement two methods in other words we can only treat y i based on all observations as the truth since its variability is much smaller than the one based on the reduced series 1951 1992 for the lower return levels such as 2 5 and 10 year return levels table 2 shows the comparison result for the 2 5 and 10 year return level estimation the proposed two step method outperforms ordinary kriging method since it has the smallest rpmse next we compare the proposed two step method with the kriging parameter method by the rpress statistic since it is difficult to derive the variance estimates from the kriging parameter method table 3 shows the comparison result and the rpress of the kriging parameter method is larger than the one for the proposed two step method except the 2 year return level thus the proposed two step method performs better than the kriging parameter method the location parameter fig 5 a and scale parameter fig 5b tended to decrease from the southeastern part to the northwestern part 3 4 assessment of the proposed two step method the assessment is made using rpmse ts and rpmse m where m 10 15 20 25 30 and table 4 and fig 6 show the comparison result as m increases rpmse m decreases for all return level estimates table 4 fig 6 for example values of rpmse m decreases from 11 5 to 5 6 mm for estimating the 2 year return level table 4 fig 6a and from 58 9 to 40 3 mm for estimating the 100 year return level table 4 fig 6f meanwhile as r increases both rpmse ts and rpmse m with the same length of observation series increase table 4 we take the estimate of 2 year return level as an example to assess the proposed two step method the value of rpmse ts is less than those of rpmse m when m 25 fig 6a which suggests that for a site without observation information the estimate by the proposed two step method will be equivalent to the at site estimate if there are approximately 25 observations the same result holds for the estimates of 5 10 and 20 year return levels fig 6b d similarly the proposed method is equivalent to the at site estimate with approximately 20 and 15 observations for estimating the 50 and 100 year return level at sites without information respectively fig 6e and f for a specific r year return level we compare the at site estimation method with reduced series and the one using all observations fig 7 shows the comparison result for estimating the 2 year and 50 year return levels based on stations with no less than 50 observations for the 2 year return level estimation when the length of observations is 10 the values of rer for all stations are below 11 9 when length is 30 the corresponding values are less than 7 0 fig 7a for the 50 year return level when the length of annual observations is 10 rer ranges from 3 7 to 61 4 with a mean of 25 9 when the length of annual observations is 30 it ranges from 0 02 to 51 8 with a mean of 12 6 fig 7b fig 8 demonstrates the comparison of the relative errors of the return level estimates for the at site estimation method with m 30 and the proposed method using all observations although there are some stations with significant differences the overall performance of the at site estimation method with m 30 is satisfactory for example when 30 annual observations are used to estimate the 100 year return level by the at site estimation method the mean of re100 is 15 7 and there are 75 of stations with re100 less than 22 2 and 50 of stations with re100 less than 13 2 the mean of the re100 based on the leave one out cross validation results for the proposed two step method is 14 7 which is slightly smaller than the one for the at site estimation method with reduced length m 30 there were 75 of stations with re100 less than 21 8 and 50 of stations less than 11 4 3 5 return level maps and the uncertainty maps for the haihe river basin the proposed two step method was used to generate return level maps for the haihe river basin and results of 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return level are shown in fig 9 the spatial patterns of the return level estimates are similar and there is a decreasing trend from the southeastern part to the northwestern part there exists a small area with more than 90 mm in the eastern part of the 2 year return level map in the 5 year return level map the largest value in the eastern part increases to approximately 110 mm and another area with values more than 110 mm shows up in the southern part for the 20 year return level the high values of the eastern and southern part are similar both are about 170 mm in addition a new area with high values emerges in the southeastern part the 50 year return level map is similar with the one for 20 year return level for the 100 year return level the region with more than 250 mm extreme precipitation in the southern part is larger than that one in the eastern part the standard error maps of return level estimates are shown in fig 10 the uncertainty in the northeastern part is greatest especially along the boundary area the standard error is also large in the region along the transition belt from the northwestern part to the southeastern part see fig 1 for geographical information sites with observations have lesser standard errors compared with their surrounding areas 4 discussion return level maps released by the hydrology bureau of ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 include estimates of the 100 year 24 h rainfall which is different from the daily rainfall data in this study maximum 24 h rainfall in each year is selected by a sliding window integration with one hour as the step and it is used to fit the pearson iii distribution maximum daily rainfall in this study is the summation of rainfall depths measured at 08 00 and 20 00 beijing local time for each day and it is never greater than maximum 24 h rainfall the data used by the hydrology bureau hb 2006 are mainly from hydrology stations which are different from those used in this study to make a fair comparison between the proposed two step method and the one applied by hb we use the daily rainfall observations from the 273 stations in this study to generate two return level maps hb 2006 uses the pearson iii distribution to estimate the return levels at sites with observations and a simple spatial method to generate the return level maps within the study region however there is no more information about the simple spatial model in hb 2006 so an ordinary kriging without measurement error model is used as the simple spatial model in this study fig 11 demonstrates the differences of the estimated return levels using the two methods the general patterns are similar since the differences are within 5 to 5 mm for the 10 year return level estimates and 10 to 10 mm for the 100 year return level estimates in most areas in the transition regions from yanshan mountains and taihang mountains to the plain our estimates are 10 30 mm lower for the 10 year return level and 10 40 mm lower for the 100 year return level compared with the ones from the hydrology bureau hb 2006 the proposed two step method takes the elevation information as the covariate and it can generate more reliable results in areas with dramatic topography variations compared with simple interpolation methods table 2 another advantage of the proposed method is that uncertainty maps can be provided in addition to the return level maps which is important in the study of potential flooding and other applications cooley et al 2007 most existing researches assume that the climate is stationary when the return levels are estimated the basic concept is that the climate may be variable with variations that are constant with respect to time and vary around a constant mean state klein tank et al 2009 the 1 day annual maximum series is analyzed to determine whether the climate change is significant during the period of record by a linear regression model and t test of the correlation coefficient at the 95 confidence level maidment 1993 the results showed that it is valid to assume no significant effect on precipitation frequency estimates because of climate change the proposed method needs to be modified if it is implemented in areas with a significant trend of the extreme precipitation 5 conclusions we propose a two step method to estimate the regional precipitation return levels in the first step we use a univariate extreme precipitation model to estimate the return level at site with observations in the second step we use a universal kriging with heterogeneous measurement error model to exploit the spatial dependence among the estimated return levels and predict the return levels at locations without observations this method is applied to estimate extreme precipitation return levels for the haihe river basin based on 273 stations with daily precipitation data from 1951 through 2012 the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the method is objective and can generate return level maps as well as uncertainty measures the systematic spatial pattern generally decreases from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin for all return levels and there are some areas with high estimated return levels existing in the southeastern part greater uncertainty for the return level estimate occurs in the northeastern part of the basin with a lower density of stations and the transition belt with higher variation of topography 2 the proposed two step method incorporates the elevation as the auxiliary information and outperforms the ordinary kriging method without measurement error and the universal kriging method with measurement error for the parameters 3 values of the square root of the pseudo mean square error decrease for all return level estimates as the length of data series gets larger but they increase as we estimate a longer return frequency 4 for the sites with no information the accuracy for the 2 5 10 and 20 year return level estimates by the proposed two step method were equivalent to that by the at site estimation based on about 25 annual observations and it was equivalent to the one with 20 and 15 annual observations for the 50 and 100 year return level estimate respectively acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the project supported by state key laboratory of earth surface processes and resource ecology the national

7239,extreme precipitation can cause flooding and may result in great economic losses and deaths the return level is a commonly used measure of extreme precipitation events and is required for hydrological engineer designs including those of sewerage systems dams reservoirs and bridges in this paper we propose a two step method to estimate the return level and its uncertainty for a study region in the first step we use the generalized extreme value distribution the l moment method and the stationary bootstrap to estimate the return level and its uncertainty at the site with observations in the second step a spatial model incorporating the heterogeneous measurement errors and covariates is trained to estimate return levels at sites with no observations and to improve the estimates at sites with limited information the proposed method is applied to the daily rainfall data from 273 weather stations in the haihe river basin of north china we compare the proposed method with two alternatives the first one is based on the ordinary kriging method without measurement error and the second one smooths the estimated location and scale parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution by the universal kriging method results show that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts we also propose a novel approach to assess the two step method by comparing it with the at site estimation method with a series of reduced length of observations estimates of the 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return level maps and the corresponding uncertainties are provided for the haihe river basin and a comparison with those released by the hydrology bureau of ministry of water resources of china is made keywords gev distribution heterogeneous measurement error l moment return level estimate stationary bootstrap two step method 1 introduction although extreme precipitation events are rare they usually cause serious economic losses and deaths zhao et al 2013 and they are also one of the major concerns for hydrological engineering designs asadieh and krakauer 2015 showed that there has been an increasing trend of extreme precipitation since 1901 and the risk of flooding associated with extreme precipitation is expected to increase there is extensive research about extreme precipitation chow et al 1988 veneziano et al 2006 madsen et al 2014 return level maps are used to demonstrate the extreme rainfall information within a study region and they are usually provided by government agencies who deal with hydrology ih 1999 bonnin et al 2006 2011 regional frequency analysis rfa is a multi step procedure to generate return level maps dalrymple 1960 ih 1999 ouardaa et al 2008 bonnin et al 2006 2011 it starts by defining the homogeneous sub regions through a cluster analysis and pools data within each sub region to estimate model parameters using the l moment method hosking and wallis 1997 ih 1999 fowler and kilsby 2003 bonnin et al 2006 2011 a simpler way to get return level maps is to interpolate the estimates at sites with observations using a spatial model to be specific an extreme value distribution such as the pearson iii distribution and the generalized extreme value gev distribution is statistically fitted for each site with observations first and then either the estimated parameters of the extreme value distribution beguería and vicente serrano 2006 ceresetti et al 2012 or return levels weisse and bois 2002 hb 2006 are spatially interpolated over the study region szolgay et al 2009 compared four estimation approaches including 1 interpolating daily precipitation data and generating return level maps by fitting an extreme value distribution individually using information at each site within the study region 2 interpolating three parameters of the gev distribution and generating return level maps through the interpolated parameters for each site 3 interpolating the estimates of return levels to generate return level maps and 4 the rfa method the result showed that the rfa outperforms its alternatives but it requires a subjective predetermination of the homogeneous sub regions however the discontinuity on the borders of sub regions is a problem for the rfa method szolgay et al 2009 also pointed out that the uncertainty of the estimated return level varies with the extreme value distribution chosen and the length and quality of the observations at each site and such uncertainty would invalidate the estimated return level maps davison et al 2012 and cooley et al 2012 surveyed the progress on the spatial extremes padoan et al 2010 and mannshardt shamseldin et al 2010 used univariate models to estimate parameters at sites with observations under a conditional independence assumption and simple regression models to characterize spatial uncertainties of the estimated parameters ribatet et al 2012 showed that simple regression models are sometimes unable to capture complex spatial behaviors many authors have studied bayesian hierarchical models cooley et al 2007 gaetan and grigoletto 2007 sang and gelfand 2009 cooley and sain 2010 and applied markov chain monte carlo algorithms to produce return level maps as well as the measures of uncertainty davison et al 2012 however assumptions made in the bayesian models are not easy to verify and the calculation of the bayesian model is complex and not easy to implement in practice besides the extreme rainfall data usually have heterogeneous variances in space szolgay et al 2009 and the application of max stable processes is very challenging ceresetti et al 2010 in this paper we propose a two step method to generate return level maps and uncertainty estimates in the first step the estimates of the return level and its uncertainty are obtained by the gev distribution the l moment method and stationary bootstrap politis and romano 1994 for each site with observations in the second step we use a universal kriging with heterogeneous measurement error model to estimate return levels at sites with no observations and improve the estimates at sites with limited information in addition the site elevation information is incorporated in this model creutin and obled 1982 goovaerts 2000 the proposed method is applied to the daily rainfall data from 273 weather stations in the haihe river basin of north china and compared with the universal kriging model with measurement error for the estimated parameters of the gev distribution at sites with observations and the commonly used ordinary kriging model we propose a novel assessment approach to evaluate the two step method by comparing it with the at site estimation method based on a series of reduced length of observations maps for 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return levels and corresponding uncertainty maps were constructed by the proposed two step method for the haihe river basin the generated return level maps are compared with the existing ones provided by the hydrology bureau of ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 2 data and methods 2 1 database the haihe river basin is in north china within the ranges of longitude of 112 120 e and latitude of 35 43 n fig 1 the total area is about 31 8 104 km2 with hills and plateaus occupying 60 of the region the northeast to southwest taihang moutains lies in the western part with an elevation of about 1000 1700 m and the east to west yanshan mountains are in the northern part with an elevation of 500 800 m in the lower elevationsand 1400 1600 m in the higher elevations three main rivers including the haihe river luanhe river and tuhaimajiahe river provide vital water sources for north china mega cities including beijing and tianjin are also located in this region meteorology data from 273 weather stations within this basin are available from the national meteorological information center nmic china meteorological administration cma in this paper we analyze the extreme precipitation based on the annual maximums of daily rainfall data between 1951 and 2012 for this region the daily precipitation data are collected by the standard rain gauge with a diameter of 20 cm the collection process is conducted at 08 00 and 20 00 beijing local time each day and the daily rainfall datum is the summation of these two measurements the average annual precipitation amount ranged from 358 9 mm to 776 4 mm for the 273 weather stations and there was a decreasing trend from the southeastern part to northwestern part influenced by the east asian monsoon system 52 3 72 7 of precipitation occurs in the summer jja the number of annual maximum daily rainfalls ranges from 34 to 62 observations for different stations and the average number is 52 there are 202 stations with observations no less than 50 and 258 stations no less than 40 the averaged distance between pairs of stations is 291 2 km and the maximum is about 1000 km note that the stations are unevenly distributed and the density in the mountainous area is lower which may lead to the higher uncertainty in those areas however these are all data accessible at present and there is a need to have more stations in the lower density area 2 2 two step method for generating return level maps in this section we propose a two step method for generating return level maps first we briefly review the gev distribution and l moment method which are the building blocks of the proposed method then for each weather station we use the stationary bootstrap a version of block bootstrap methods with replacement lahiri 2003 to estimate the return level and its variance which is treated as the variance of the measurement error at last a universal kriging with heterogeneous measurement error model incorporating the elevation information is applied to estimate return levels at sites with no observations and improve the estimates at sites with limited information 2 2 1 gev distribution and l moment method the gev distribution jenkinson 1955 is commonly used for modelling extreme events and its probability density function is 1 f x σ μ ξ 1 σ exp 1 ξ ϑ e ϑ 2 ϑ ξ 1 log 1 ξ x μ σ ξ 0 x μ σ ξ 0 where σ 0 ξ μ are the scale shape and location parameters respectively the r year return level is the 1 r 1 th quantile of the gev distribution and it can be estimated by 3 y 1 r 1 σ μ ξ μ σ ξ 1 log 1 r 1 ξ ξ 0 μ σ log log 1 r 1 ξ 0 where σ μ ξ are the estimated parameters in eq 1 by the l moment hosking 1990 hosking and wallis 1997 2 2 2 estimation of the r year return level and its variance at the site with observations hosking 1986 discussed the variance estimator of the estimated l moment and a delta method was suggested to implement for obtaining the variance estimator of the estimated r year return level athreya and lahiri 2006 instead we use the stationary bootstrap method politis and romano 1994 to estimate the r year return level and its variance since it is easier to implement and produces similar variance estimates of l moments comparing with the delta method based on a small simulation study conducted without making the expressions too complicated we omit r explicitly for the return level estimates let d be the spatial domain of the haihe river basin we have n weather stations scattered in the domain as shown in fig 1 and their locations are indexed by s 1 s 2 s n d for station s i we have l i observations of the annual maximum daily rainfall and denote them as x i j j 1 2 l i note that the lengths of observations may differ for different weather stations we use the following steps to estimate the r year return level and its variance step 1 for b th iteration obtain a i b x i j b j 1 l i using the stationary bootstrap based on the original observations step 2 use a i b to estimate the r year return level denoted as y i b by the gev distribution and l moment mentioned in 2 2 1 step 3 repeat step 1 and step 2 for b times and estimate the r year return level and its variance by 4 y i 1 b b 1 b y i b 5 v i 1 b 1 b 1 b y i b y i 2 2 2 3 construction of the return level map based on the estimated r year return levels and variances at sites with observations we use the universal kriging with measurement error model to generate the r year return level map within the study region consider 6 y s μ s τ s ε s for s d where y s is the estimated r year return level of location s μ s β 0 β 1 h s is the trend effect h s is the elevation of location s τ s is an intrinsic stationary spatial process with a parametric semi variogram function indexed by the nugget sill and range parameters c 0 c s a cressie 1993 and ε s is the measurement error with mean 0 and variance v s for station at location s i the estimated r year return level is y i and an estimate of v s i is v i for this study we use the following spherical semi variogram for τ s s d that is 7 1 2 var τ s i τ s j c 0 c s a 0 d ij 0 c 0 c s 3 2 d ij a 1 2 d ij a 3 0 d ij a c 0 c s d ij a where d ij is the euclidean distance between the i th and j th stations and we compare the estimated spherical semi variogram and the empirical one in section 3 kriging for the data contaminated with heterogeneous measurement errors has been investigated by many researchers cressie 1993 delhomme 1978 kleijnen et al 2005 christensen 2011 and ignoring the heterogeneity of the measurement errors leads to invalid inference in this study we use the heterogeneous variance measurement error filtered kriging method hvmfk christensen 2011 to estimate the parameters in the eqs 6 and 7 by the following iterative steps step 1 use universal kriging without measurement error to estimate β 0 β 1 say β 0 1 β 1 1 step 2 for the t th iteration with t 1 obtain z t s i y i β 0 t β 1 t h s i i 1 n by which we can estimate parameters of the semi variogram model that is eq 7 by hvmfk and denote the estimated results to be c 0 t c s t a t the estimated nugget and sill parameters are calibrated based on the homogeneous measurement errors see christensen 2011 for details step 3 based on c 0 t c s t a t and v i i 1 n update the estimate of β 0 β 1 and denote it as β 0 t 1 β 1 t 1 step 4 repeat step 2 and step 3 until convergence notice that parameters of the theoretical spherical semi variogram are only for the intrinsic stationary spatial process and they characterize the dependence structure of the return level estimates by incorporating the heterogeneous measurement error specifically the microscale variance cressie 1993 of the return level estimate is the summation of the nugget and the variance of the measurement error for each location in the study region the estimated theoretical semi variogram would affect the estimation of the regression parameters and vice versa thus we use an iterative estimation procedure to estimate the parameters in eqs 6 and 7 instead of using universal kriging we can also use ordinary least square to get β 0 1 β 1 1 in step 1 based on the estimated parameters in the eqs 6 and 7 a universal kriging with measurement error model is used to produce the r year return level map and its uncertainty remark haas 1990a b discussed several moving window methods and pointed out that the moving window method can be used to attenuate the trend effects and handle the nonstationarity of the spatial process as an alternative we propose to use the two step method to handle the trend effects and heterogeneous measurement error at the same time and the latter one is one source to cause the nonstationarity of the estimated return levels one advantage of the proposed two step method is that we can study the influence of the elevation on the return level estimates in the study region however the moving window methods can only provide a localized analysis in a small area haas 1990b besides the proposed two step method is more computationally efficient than moving window methods based on our dataset we have compared the moving window method with 35 nearest neighbors haas 1990a and the proposed two step method and it turns out that the proposed two step method works better than the moving window method with 35 nearest neighbors most of the time with one exception for the case of 100 year return level one reason the moving window method does not work well is that the range of the spatial dependence is pretty large compared to the region of interest the estimated range parameters are around or larger than 500 km while the maximum distance between pairs of stations in our study region is about 1000 km since the moving window method does not lead to improve the performance we did not include the table in the paper 2 3 ordinary kriging method and kriging parameter method for comparison in addition to the proposed two step method we also consider the following two approaches the ordinary kriging method and a kriging parameter method based on the estimated return levels at site with observations by the gev distribution return level maps can be generated using ordinary kriging method although it is well known that the universal kriging method outperforms the ordinary kriging method when there exist a linear trend with respect to the covariates the latter is easy to implement and has been widely used in practice specifically the hydrology bureau of ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 uses a simple interpolation method to generate the return level maps since no more information about the simple interpolation method can be obtained we treat it to be ordinary kriging method and compare it with the proposed two step method the kriging parameter method interpolates the estimated parameters of the gev distribution within the study region first the l moment method and the stationary bootstrap method are used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution and their corresponding variance at site with observations then a universal kriging with measurement error model using the elevation information as the covariate is applied to predict each parameter at sites within the study region finally we estimate the return levels based on the predicted parameters see section 3 for details 2 4 at site estimation method with a reduced length of observations we propose an at site estimation method with a reduced series to estimate the return level and compare it with that from the proposed two step method as a novel assessment of the proposed method one question we want to answer is how much information is needed for the at site estimation method so that its estimate of the return level has the same uncertainty as the proposed two step method to mitigate the sample size effect among the 273 stations the comparison is made among the ones with more than 50 observations the at site estimation method estimates the r year return level and the uncertainty using a reduced length m of the observations based on the following three steps where m l i recall that we have l i observations for station s i this method first generates k series of pseudo observations of length m independently based on the l i observations by the stationary bootstrap for each series of the pseudo observations we use the stationary bootstrap to estimate the r year return level and its uncertainty then the estimators of the r year return level and uncertainty is obtained by taking the average the proposed at site estimation method is summarized by the following steps that is step 1 for the k th iteration obtain the bootstrap version of observations x i j k j 1 l i by the stationary bootstrap and get a i m k x i j k j 1 m by collecting the first m elements step 2 based on a i m k use the method discussed in 2 2 2 to get y i m k and v i m k where the subscript m explicitly denotes the length of observations step 3 repeat step 1 and step 2 for k times and estimate the r year return level and its variance by y i m 1 k k 1 k y i m k and v i m 1 k k 1 k v i m k recall that y i and v i are the results when m l i 2 5 assessment of the estimates for the proposed two step method and the at site estimation method we compare the square root of the pseudo mean square error rpmse that is 8 rpmse ts 1 n i 1 n y i ts 1 y i 2 v i ts 1 1 2 9 rpmse m 1 n i 1 n y i m y i 2 v i m 1 2 where y i ts 1 and v i ts 1 are the prediction of the r year return level and variance for station s i obtained by the proposed two step method using all observations except for the one for this station similar as 13 we can define the rpmse for the ordinary kriging method and denote it to be rpmse ok if rpmse ts rpmse m for some m we conclude that the estimate of the r year return level by the two step method is better than that obtained by the at site estimation method with m observations this criterion is used to assess the proposed two step model since we cannot estimate the variance of the estimated r year return level by the kriging parameter method we use the square root of the predicted residual error sum of squares rpress statistic to compare the two step method and the kriging parameter method that is 10 rpress kp 1 n i 1 n y i kp 1 y i 2 1 2 where y i kp 1 is the estimate of the r year return level for station s i by the kriging parameter method using all observations except for the one for this station similarly we can have rpress ts defined for the two step method the relative error re is another commonly used measure to compare the r year return level estimates and it is defined by 11 re r est y i est y i 2 where est is an estimate such as y i m or y i ts 1 3 result 3 1 characteristics of at site return levels and gev parameters fig 2 shows the estimates of the return levels fig 2a and the corresponding standard errors fig 2b by the method discussed in 2 2 2 by a standard representation of box and whisker plot the estimates of return levels and standard errors become greater as the year of return level increases among the estimated parameters of the gev distribution for 273 stations the location parameter ranged from 30 3 to 85 4 with a mean of 57 7 scale parameter ranged from 7 5 to 36 3 with a mean of 22 6 and the shape parameter ranged from 0 41 to 0 21 with 212 negative values 3 2 semi variogram models for return levels and gev parameters fig 3 a and c show the relationship between the elevation and 10 and 50 year return level estimates respectively and fig 3b and d show the corresponding empirical semi variograms and the estimated theoretical spherical semi variograms matheron 1963 based on fig 3a and c the 10 and 50 year return level estimates decrease as the elevation increases such a decreasing trend holds for other return level estimates as well thus the mean part of the proposed model in eq 6 is reasonable from fig 3b and d we conclude that the estimated theoretical spherical semi variograms fit the empirical ones well for the 10 and 50 year return level similar conclusions hold for other return levels fig 4 a and c show the relationship between the elevation and the estimated location and scale parameters of the gev model respectively and fig 4b and d show the corresponding empirical semi variograms and the estimated theoretical spherical semi variogram we can have similar conclusions as the return level estimates above that is the mean part of the proposed model in eq 6 is reasonable for the location and scale estimates of the gev distribution and the estimated theoretical spherical semi variograms fit the empirical ones well however based on fig 4e and f there are no strong trend and spatial dependence for the estimated shape parameter of the gev distribution thus we estimated the shape parameter using the sample mean the estimated parameters of the theoretical spherical semi variogram models for the return levels and parameters of the gev distribution are listed in table 1 for the return level estimates the estimated nuggets of the intrinsic stationary spatial process τ s equal to 0 except for the 100 year return level in other words the measurement errors account for the microscale variance for the 2 5 10 20 and 50 year return level estimates but the microscale variance of the 100 year return level estimate is larger than the variance of the measurement error for each location in the study region the estimated sill parameter increases as r increases and the estimated range parameter decreases at the same time thus the dependence structure of the estimated return level becomes weaker as r increases the estimated nugget parameters of the location and scale of the gev model are 0 so the measurement error variance account for all the microscale variance based on table 1 we can also conclude that all of the estimated range parameters are greater than 500 km that is they are greater than half of the maximum distance between two locations in the haihe river basin 3 3 comparison of different estimation methods first we compare the proposed two step method with the ordinary kriging approach to rule out the uncertainty of y i in eqs 8 and 9 we exclude the observations from 1993 through 2012 for each weather station before we implement two methods in other words we can only treat y i based on all observations as the truth since its variability is much smaller than the one based on the reduced series 1951 1992 for the lower return levels such as 2 5 and 10 year return levels table 2 shows the comparison result for the 2 5 and 10 year return level estimation the proposed two step method outperforms ordinary kriging method since it has the smallest rpmse next we compare the proposed two step method with the kriging parameter method by the rpress statistic since it is difficult to derive the variance estimates from the kriging parameter method table 3 shows the comparison result and the rpress of the kriging parameter method is larger than the one for the proposed two step method except the 2 year return level thus the proposed two step method performs better than the kriging parameter method the location parameter fig 5 a and scale parameter fig 5b tended to decrease from the southeastern part to the northwestern part 3 4 assessment of the proposed two step method the assessment is made using rpmse ts and rpmse m where m 10 15 20 25 30 and table 4 and fig 6 show the comparison result as m increases rpmse m decreases for all return level estimates table 4 fig 6 for example values of rpmse m decreases from 11 5 to 5 6 mm for estimating the 2 year return level table 4 fig 6a and from 58 9 to 40 3 mm for estimating the 100 year return level table 4 fig 6f meanwhile as r increases both rpmse ts and rpmse m with the same length of observation series increase table 4 we take the estimate of 2 year return level as an example to assess the proposed two step method the value of rpmse ts is less than those of rpmse m when m 25 fig 6a which suggests that for a site without observation information the estimate by the proposed two step method will be equivalent to the at site estimate if there are approximately 25 observations the same result holds for the estimates of 5 10 and 20 year return levels fig 6b d similarly the proposed method is equivalent to the at site estimate with approximately 20 and 15 observations for estimating the 50 and 100 year return level at sites without information respectively fig 6e and f for a specific r year return level we compare the at site estimation method with reduced series and the one using all observations fig 7 shows the comparison result for estimating the 2 year and 50 year return levels based on stations with no less than 50 observations for the 2 year return level estimation when the length of observations is 10 the values of rer for all stations are below 11 9 when length is 30 the corresponding values are less than 7 0 fig 7a for the 50 year return level when the length of annual observations is 10 rer ranges from 3 7 to 61 4 with a mean of 25 9 when the length of annual observations is 30 it ranges from 0 02 to 51 8 with a mean of 12 6 fig 7b fig 8 demonstrates the comparison of the relative errors of the return level estimates for the at site estimation method with m 30 and the proposed method using all observations although there are some stations with significant differences the overall performance of the at site estimation method with m 30 is satisfactory for example when 30 annual observations are used to estimate the 100 year return level by the at site estimation method the mean of re100 is 15 7 and there are 75 of stations with re100 less than 22 2 and 50 of stations with re100 less than 13 2 the mean of the re100 based on the leave one out cross validation results for the proposed two step method is 14 7 which is slightly smaller than the one for the at site estimation method with reduced length m 30 there were 75 of stations with re100 less than 21 8 and 50 of stations less than 11 4 3 5 return level maps and the uncertainty maps for the haihe river basin the proposed two step method was used to generate return level maps for the haihe river basin and results of 2 5 10 20 50 and 100 year return level are shown in fig 9 the spatial patterns of the return level estimates are similar and there is a decreasing trend from the southeastern part to the northwestern part there exists a small area with more than 90 mm in the eastern part of the 2 year return level map in the 5 year return level map the largest value in the eastern part increases to approximately 110 mm and another area with values more than 110 mm shows up in the southern part for the 20 year return level the high values of the eastern and southern part are similar both are about 170 mm in addition a new area with high values emerges in the southeastern part the 50 year return level map is similar with the one for 20 year return level for the 100 year return level the region with more than 250 mm extreme precipitation in the southern part is larger than that one in the eastern part the standard error maps of return level estimates are shown in fig 10 the uncertainty in the northeastern part is greatest especially along the boundary area the standard error is also large in the region along the transition belt from the northwestern part to the southeastern part see fig 1 for geographical information sites with observations have lesser standard errors compared with their surrounding areas 4 discussion return level maps released by the hydrology bureau of ministry of water resources in china hb 2006 include estimates of the 100 year 24 h rainfall which is different from the daily rainfall data in this study maximum 24 h rainfall in each year is selected by a sliding window integration with one hour as the step and it is used to fit the pearson iii distribution maximum daily rainfall in this study is the summation of rainfall depths measured at 08 00 and 20 00 beijing local time for each day and it is never greater than maximum 24 h rainfall the data used by the hydrology bureau hb 2006 are mainly from hydrology stations which are different from those used in this study to make a fair comparison between the proposed two step method and the one applied by hb we use the daily rainfall observations from the 273 stations in this study to generate two return level maps hb 2006 uses the pearson iii distribution to estimate the return levels at sites with observations and a simple spatial method to generate the return level maps within the study region however there is no more information about the simple spatial model in hb 2006 so an ordinary kriging without measurement error model is used as the simple spatial model in this study fig 11 demonstrates the differences of the estimated return levels using the two methods the general patterns are similar since the differences are within 5 to 5 mm for the 10 year return level estimates and 10 to 10 mm for the 100 year return level estimates in most areas in the transition regions from yanshan mountains and taihang mountains to the plain our estimates are 10 30 mm lower for the 10 year return level and 10 40 mm lower for the 100 year return level compared with the ones from the hydrology bureau hb 2006 the proposed two step method takes the elevation information as the covariate and it can generate more reliable results in areas with dramatic topography variations compared with simple interpolation methods table 2 another advantage of the proposed method is that uncertainty maps can be provided in addition to the return level maps which is important in the study of potential flooding and other applications cooley et al 2007 most existing researches assume that the climate is stationary when the return levels are estimated the basic concept is that the climate may be variable with variations that are constant with respect to time and vary around a constant mean state klein tank et al 2009 the 1 day annual maximum series is analyzed to determine whether the climate change is significant during the period of record by a linear regression model and t test of the correlation coefficient at the 95 confidence level maidment 1993 the results showed that it is valid to assume no significant effect on precipitation frequency estimates because of climate change the proposed method needs to be modified if it is implemented in areas with a significant trend of the extreme precipitation 5 conclusions we propose a two step method to estimate the regional precipitation return levels in the first step we use a univariate extreme precipitation model to estimate the return level at site with observations in the second step we use a universal kriging with heterogeneous measurement error model to exploit the spatial dependence among the estimated return levels and predict the return levels at locations without observations this method is applied to estimate extreme precipitation return levels for the haihe river basin based on 273 stations with daily precipitation data from 1951 through 2012 the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the method is objective and can generate return level maps as well as uncertainty measures the systematic spatial pattern generally decreases from the southeastern part to the northwestern part of the basin for all return levels and there are some areas with high estimated return levels existing in the southeastern part greater uncertainty for the return level estimate occurs in the northeastern part of the basin with a lower density of stations and the transition belt with higher variation of topography 2 the proposed two step method incorporates the elevation as the auxiliary information and outperforms the ordinary kriging method without measurement error and the universal kriging method with measurement error for the parameters 3 values of the square root of the pseudo mean square error decrease for all return level estimates as the length of data series gets larger but they increase as we estimate a longer return frequency 4 for the sites with no information the accuracy for the 2 5 10 and 20 year return level estimates by the proposed two step method were equivalent to that by the at site estimation based on about 25 annual observations and it was equivalent to the one with 20 and 15 annual observations for the 50 and 100 year return level estimate respectively acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the project supported by state key laboratory of earth surface processes and resource ecology the national
