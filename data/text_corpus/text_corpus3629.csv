18145,in decision making processes today it is typically economic considerations that are the focus and that dictate what decisions are made however this approach neglects significant potential impacts these decisions can have namely environmental impacts one way to incorporate environmental considerations into current decision making processes is through monetary valuation this work surveys environmental economics literature that quantifies the monetary valuation of nutrients and nutrient pollution and applies monetary valuation of phosphorus to a case study of nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment the literature review catalogues three different monetary valuation methods economic consequences mitigation and restoration and willingness to pay and highlights the different perspectives each of these methods addresses additionally the case study demonstrates how monetary valuation can be applied in a realistic decision making scenario and highlights how variability in monetary valuation methods and results can affect decision making from this literature and case study assessment a call can be made to establish more standardized methods for determining the monetary valuation of nutrients in an effort to promote and encourage the consideration of nutrient pollution issues in future decision making graphical abstract image 1 keywords nutrient recovery wastewater treatment environmental economics 1 introduction phosphorus p and nitrogen n in the environment are critical in supporting the growth and development of healthy ecosystems however excessive amounts of these nutrients can create nutrient pollution leading to excessive plant and algae growth eutrophication and in extreme cases hypoxic or dead zones can develop us epa 2015 pretty et al 2003 nutrient pollution is a pervasive problem whose impacts are wide spread and in recent decades this issue has become of increasing concern with impairment of waterways becoming more severe and a growing focus on protecting and maintaining freshwater resources state epa nutrient innovations task group 2009 united nations 2018 despite these increasing nutrient management concerns economic considerations have traditionally been the driving force in decision making processes tiwari et al 1999 cost benefit analysis and economic payback period calculations often dictate the selection of new products or implementation of new systems and processes from a sustainability perspective however this approach is very narrow and neglects significant potential impacts these decisions can have namely environmental impacts which can have more widespread consequences one way in which these two perspectives can be evaluated and compared is through monetary valuation of environmental impacts or environmental damages this work focuses specifically on monetary valuation of nutrients and nutrient pollution a literature search identifying evaluating and comparing different monetary valuation methods was conducted in an effort to further understanding of the different perspectives or approaches that can be taken and highlighting areas for improvement additionally this work seeks to demonstrate how monetary valuation methods can be incorporated in traditional decision making processes and how they can impact decision making outcomes through a case study of nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment 2 literature analysis using the academic search engines google scholar and scopus a literature search was conducted focusing on economic valuation studies of nutrients and nutrient pollution in the united states search terms and phrases nutrients phosphorus nitrogen cost eutrophication monetary valuation environmental economics environmental cost mitigation economic cost willingness to pay nutrient pollution etc were used in combination to identify relevant literature detailing studies from the 1980s through the present with sufficient information to make specific comparisons which are detailed below these searches uncovered a wide range of different valuation methods related to nutrient pollution however for this analysis it was decided to focus on studies in three main areas economic consequences of nutrient pollution mitigation and restoration costs and willingness to pay wtp for removal or reduction each category addresses a different perspective of the costs of nutrient pollution economic consequences highlight the potential impacts in different economic sectors if nutrient pollution is not controlled mitigation and restoration studies detail the actual costs to remove nutrients once they have entered the environment and lastly wtp literature focuses on the realities of what the public is actually willing to pay to address the problem 2 1 economic consequences at the beginning of the literature search the 2015 united states environmental protection agency us epa report us epa 2015 was identified as a resource for nutrient pollution related environmental economic literature it was assumed that this collection of studies accurately represented the scope of literature on economic consequences of nutrient pollution in general from both p and n from this literature database studies focusing on the economic costs of nutrients in five different areas were analyzed to establish an understanding of the potential consequences of allowing nutrient pollution to occur these five areas area property value fisheries tourism health effects and drinking water treatment and to improve comparability amongst these studies the costs found in each were converted into 2017 united states dollars usd using inflation calculators to determine the buying power of money over time from coinnews media group llc 2018 and united states department of labor 2019 the property value subcategory focuses on the relationship between water quality and property value that has been previously established in literature specifically water clarity steinnes 1992 leggett and bockstael 2000 in this group all considered studies used hedonic property valuation models that take into account the characteristics of the specific property the location and the environment sirmans et al 2005 additionally each study considered the price decrease due to a 1 m change in water clarity measured as secchi depth a metric of water quality assessed using a black and white circular plate called a secchi disk the only property value focused studies from us epa 2015 that were not considered were those focusing on property value that considered a functional unit other than per 1 m change in secchi depth in an effort to maintain uniformity in addition to the unpleasant aesthetics nutrient pollution can cause the growth of hazardous algae blooms habs which may have adverse effects on human health as a result of ingestion or consumption of contaminated water fish shellfish or through direct contact with skin cdc 2018 according to the us epa 2015 only one health effect related study was identified that considered the marginal cost of health effects for respiratory illness related to algae bloom events the results from the study hoagland et al 2009 looking at the costs of health effects from nutrients showed a range of 20 000 to 140 000 per year for annual marginal cost of illness from specific red tide events in sarasota florida usa these values correspond to different amounts of emergency department visits for high and low algae bloom levels respectively growth of habs and eutrophication in general also have deleterious effects on aquatic species eutrophication causes excessive growth of plants and algae which deplete dissolved oxygen levels in the water that are essential for supporting aquatic life us epa 2019c and habs as their name suggests can produce toxins that can be harmful and even deadly to people and animals us epa 2019a the studies considered in the fisheries category looked at the economic losses for different aquatic species such as softshell clam brown shrimp or oysters detailed in table s2 of the si as a function of specific nutrient pollution related events or conditions i e red tide events habs hypoxia or a drop in dissolved oxygen levels etc tourism and tourism related spending is a large economic sector with 945 billion in direct tourism spending and 683 billion in indirect tourism related spending for the third quarter of 2017 in the united states alone bureau of economic analysis 2017 here direct tourism spending specifically encompasses travel and recreation expenses whereas indirect tourism related spending includes costs that are impacted by the amount of travel or tourism in an area such as restaurant or local business sales it has been shown previously that environmental quality impacts competition amongst different tourist destinations buckley 2003 mihalic 2000 since nutrient pollution affects the usability and quality of water resources it can therefore be connected to losses in the tourism sector similar to the fishery studies the tourism literature considers the economic consequences as a function of nutrient pollution related events or conditions and not specifically from some quantity of nutrients the final economic category considered is drinking water treatment costs as mentioned there can be serious public health consequences related to nutrient pollution specifically from ingesting contaminated water however older drinking water treatment plants that draw from contaminated surface waters are often not equipped to treat and remove the toxins produced by habs us epa 2019b and treatment demands even for modern plants increase during large bloom events one of the two considered studies davenport and drake 2011 calculated 13 920 000 in costs for increased treatment for a blue green algae outbreak and the other study the cadmus group inc 2014 calculated 74 970 000 in costs for increased treatment and monitoring to improve water quality issues due to excess nutrients table 1 summarizes the results found in each category but the variety of functional units across and amongst these different economic categories prevents direct comparison however qualitatively an understanding of the breadth of impact economically that nutrient pollution can have is developed these studies show that damages from nutrient pollution not only have an effect over a variety of different economic areas but also in a wide range of different locations and under a wide range of different conditions additionally the breadth of values observed within each category serves to demonstrate the scope of potential impacts in each of the considered areas the complete group of considered economic consequences studies is listed in detail in table s2 of the supplementary information si 2 2 mitigation and restoration in the second category of monetary valuation methods mitigation and restoration the focus of nutrient pollution was narrowed down to look only at p selection of literature focused only on studies that provided specific information about the costs of mitigation or restoration efforts and the amount of p removed or estimated to be removed therefore studies with insufficient data and information to calculate the dollars per kilogram kg of p removed were excluded this pool of sources excluded those studies from us epa 2015 examining nutrient trading programs overall ten different studies were identified from the literature search which are listed table s1 of the si additionally a list of nutrient mitigation and restoration studies that were considered but ultimately not included in the literature analysis here is provided in section 1 of the si with a more detailed explanation of the exclusion the majority of these mitigation and restoration studies six out of the ten focused on the costs of alum treatments of polluted lakes which is a common p management method us epa 2018 alum treatments are a popular choice for p removal since it removes p from the water column and helps control internal p loadings alum acts as a coagulant settling out cyanobacteria in the top layers of a water body which then forms a layer at the bottom of the water body and creates a barrier preventing p in the sediment from releasing into the water us epa 2018 while most of the studies in this group focused on alum treatments several studies considered other p mitigation and restoration options the suck the muck program detailed in verburg 2019 discusses a dredging project to remove legacy p at the bottom of rivers and streams feeding into area lakes dunne et al 2015 focuses on the cost effectiveness of a large scale constructed wetland at a lake in florida and sano et al 2004 considered two different stormwater treatment areas sta systems in florida in addition to managed aquatic plant systems maps along with variability in the methods there was a larger range amongst the locations of these studies as compared to the wtp literature in the next section with studies evaluating mitigation and restoration activities in minnesota wisconsin washington florida and south dakota information about overall costs and estimated or calculated removal of p was collected form the reports and used to determine a cost per kg of p removed or recovered in 2017 usd in this group the overall range in cost per kg of p removed was just over 4615 with the minimum cost calculated at 14 15 from hoyman 2012 and the maximum at 4630 from burgdhoff and williams 2012 2 3 willingness to pay the final category of studies included in this analysis are studies utilizing the contingent valuation method wtp contingent valuation is a method of valuation that involves surveying people to determine the maximum amount a person would be willing to pay for a good or service wtp or the minimum amount a person would be willing to accept to go without something willingness to accept wta historically contingent valuation methods have been used broadly in environmental economics but are also commonly used in health economics and cultural economics venkatachalam 2004 similar to the mitigation and restoration studies it was decided to narrow the focus to only studies looking at p nutrient pollution four different wtp studies and no wta studies were identified that provided enough information to calculate dollars per kg of p removed or reduced mathews et al 1999 mathews et al 2002 stumborg et al 2001 and welle and hodgson 2011 using the inflation calculators from coinnews media group llc 2018 and united states department of labor 2019 costs were converted to 2017 usd and then divided by the total removal of p proposed in kilograms all of wtp studies considered were all conducted in the midwest region of the united states specifically in minnesota and wisconsin combined these studies each surveyed residents about their willingness to pay for p reduction through a variety of different payment methods for example in mathews et al 1999 residents were asked about two different payment methods for reducing p pollution in the minnesota river by 40 first as an increase in state income tax and second as a surcharge on their water bill other studies surveyed residents about wtp for a proposed government program to reduce the frequency of algae blooms in lake mendota wi stumborg et al 2001 or focused on wtp for a nutrient reduction policy in two different watersheds welle and hodgson 2011 the overall range in values for p from these studies is from less than 0 01 kg of p but not zero mathews homans easter 1999 2002 welle and hodgson 2011 to 4630 kg of p burgdhoff and williams 2012 however in addition to the distinct characteristics of the specific population one important consideration in these wtp studies that can have a major impact on what people are willing to pay is the mechanism by which they would be paying for nutrient pollution control different payment methods such as an increase in local water utility bills could be received differently than an increase in community taxes or simply a voluntary annual donation to specific projects 2 4 summary direct comparison of all the literature findings is not reasonable due to the varied functional units in each area however the magnitude of costs in each area can provide valuable insight from table 2 it is shown that the range in economic consequences from nutrient pollution spans hundreds to hundreds of millions of dollars in total depending on the economic sector considered as well as perhaps the location and severity of the pollution with the wtp and mitigation and restoration studies it appears that the costs or value for p from wtp studies are considerably smaller than those from the mitigation and restoration literature however with wtp studies the value being considered is the value per kg of p willing to be paid per person or per household whereas the values found in the mitigation and restoration literature are a total per kg of p not a split amongst a population from this perspective depending on the size of the community or group the wtp values could be comparable to those found in the mitigation and restoration studies an important piece that was found to be missing from this literature is the calculation of totaled economic consequences across many different sectors as the economic consequences literature demonstrated impacts from nutrient pollution are not limited to one area however only one of the studies analyzed here davenport and drake 2011 evaluated the impacts in more than one economic area from the studies considered here it is reasonable to conclude that the overall economic consequences related to nutrient pollution exceed the individual values or estimates examined here furthermore no studies were identified that considered the combined economic consequences of nutrient pollution and restoration costs in a scenario where a community recognizes the economic impacts of the nutrient pollution issue and seeks to reduce the pollution or remediate an affected area these two areas represent more realistic scenarios and would be important next steps to build upon and expand this area of analysis what can be taken from this literature analysis is that the economic costs of allowing nutrient pollution to occur or of not taking care of it once it occurs can reach hundreds of millions of dollars additionally the costs to remove nutrients specifically p once they have entered the environment can also be high up to thousands of dollars per kg of p therefore it can be concluded that there is some value in preventing this pollution from occurring in the first place and this value can be used to be used to determine a monetary value for these nutrients from an environmental perspective 3 case study although the amount of damage nutrients can cause is at least in part influenced by the specific conditions of the particular location being considered from the literature analysis above it is evident that there can be significant variability in the valuation of nutrients in the environment depending on the specific valuation method being used to better illustrate these discrepancies and understand how they can impact decision making results from the literature examined above will be applied to a case study of nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment in 2009 the nine springs wwtp in madison wi usa evaluated options for improving their biosolids handling processes as part of this upgrade they explored different ways to manage unwanted precipitation of struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate n h 4 m g p o 4 ultimately they chose to implement a system that recovers struvite as an alternative fertilizer thus removing p and n from the biosolids stream applied technologies 2010 this case study will focus on incorporating values for avoided nutrient pollution specifically avoided p pollution since wisconsin does not border any oceans into the economic decision making used by the madison metropolitan sewerage district mmsd when they were evaluating the struvite recovery system 3 1 case study set up the nine springs wastewater treatment plant wwtp is a 158 million liter per day 42 million gallon per day plant that serves around 380 000 people in the madison area treated effluent is discharged to two separate creeks with each being in a different watershed within the plant s service area additionally the wwtp anaerobically digests its sludge producing class b biosolids that are sent to local farms for spreading on agricultural land as fertilizer the addition of the struvite recovery system from ostara nutrient recovery technology inc in 2014 removes nutrients both p and n from the biosolids and precipitates them as struvite which is then sold as an alternative fertilizer product from a nutrient management perspective a major benefit of struvite recovery in this case is that the nutrient are captured in a form that can be more easily transported than the biosolids which are heavier and therefore more expensive to move since the transportation of these nutrients is less restricted with regards to cost and therefore distance as with biosolids it is assumed that they will be sent where they are needed thus avoiding an overload of nutrients in the areas surrounding the wwtp and allowing for nutrient balancing on a larger scale future research is looking to incorporate similar nutrient recovery technologies into multi objective optimization work to balance urban and rural waste management hu et al 2018 the environmental impact that is being valued in this case is therefore the environmental benefit of avoided nutrient pollution from p in their decision making process the madison metropolitan sewerage district mmsd included economic estimates for each alternative the specific cost data from applied technologies 2010 related to the struvite recovery system that was selected is summarized in table 3 and using online inflation calculators coinnews media group llc 2018 and united states department of labor 2019 these costs were converted into 2017 usd to understand and visualize one time versus re occurring costs of the system over the assumed 20 year lifetime applied technologies 2010 a cash flow diagram can be constructed in this case the present or year 0 is considered to be 2017 and the only cost at that time is the initial capital investment of 22 772 000 while the capital costs are considered to be one time costs operation and maintenance o m costs are better understood as re occurring annual costs using the capital recovery formula shown in equation 1 n is the assumed 20 year lifetime of the system applied technologies 2010 and i is the inflation rate of 4 88 applied technologies 2010 the present worth o m cost from table 3 which is denoted by p in the formula can be converted to an annual value a in the formula of 255 500 however what can be misleading here is that the o m cost reported in table 3 from applied technologies 2010 is actually a net cost that includes the agreed upon credit that the nine springs wwtp gets from selling their recovered struvite to ostara as a fertilizer in addition to the estimated o m costs equation 1 a p e i n e i 1 e i n 1 in order to be able to separate these two costs the annual revenue from struvite fertilizer sales needs to be calculated using the estimated annual production of struvite and the selling price of the fertilizer in the initial evaluation report applied technologies 2010 mmsd estimated 1 942 283 kg 2 141 us tons of struvite would be produced each year next from the 2017 report madison metropolitan sewerage district 2017 it is documented that the nine springs wwtp recovered approximately 530 703 kg 585 us tons of struvite making 205 600 using this information the selling price of struvite is calculated to be 0 39 per kg multiplying the estimated annual struvite production 1 942 283 kg by the selling price 0 39 per kg the annual revenue from struvite production is estimated to be about 752 300 from here it can be calculated that the actual o m costs estimated for applied technologies 2010 are around 1 008 000 fig 1 displays the capital cost and re occurring annual costs discussed above in a cash flow diagram the focus of this case study however is about incorporating the environmental benefit of avoided nutrient overloading so in addition to the three direct costs the dashed green arrows in fig 1 illustrate the potential annual value of the environmental benefit from struvite recovery 3 2 payback period as a preliminary analysis step a payback period study can be conducted using different values for p in the environment from literature although this payback period analysis ignores the change in value of money over time it is a relatively simple analysis tool that allows for quick evaluation of alternatives to represent the full range of p values collected from the literature analysis three different studies were selected mathews et al 1999 burgdhoff and williams 2012 and chandler 2013 which give the maximum minimum and median costs found respectively additionally two more studies verburg 2019 and stumborg et al 2001 were included for comparison as they are specific to dane county wi where the wwtp is located these five studies are summarized in table 4 to calculate the payback period here the annual costs from o m 1 008 000 and revenues from struvite fertilizer sales 752 400 and the environmental benefit value are combined into a net value referred here as the net annual benefit nab this value is then used to determine how many years it would take to pay back or recoup the present worth capital costs the results of this payback period analysis based on the group of studies identified in table 4 above are shown in table 5 the results in table 5 show that the three values of p based on the costs of restoration treatments result in a positive payback period whereas the two values coming from wtp studies show negative payback periods since negative years are not possible here conceptually what a negative payback period conveys is that the benefits from struvite recovery will never outweigh the combined costs of the system if the value of avoided p overloading is based on the potential cost to remove it from the environment the struvite system would recoup benefits equal to the initial and annual costs before the end of its lifetime 3 3 breakeven analysis another valuable assessment method that can be employed is breakeven analysis where the value of p at which the system breaks even is calculated to begin the breakeven price of the struvite system can be calculated ignoring the change in value of money over time starting with the capital cost of 22 772 000 and dividing it by the assumed 20 year lifetime of the system the annual revenue from struvite fertilizer sales is subtracted and the annual o m costs are added to obtain the required annual environmental benefit necessary to breakeven approximately 883 100 this value is then divided by the amount of p estimated to be recovered per year as struvite 245 139 kg resulting in a value of 3 60 per kg conceptually this price represents the cut off value of p above which the benefits of struvite recovery outweigh the cost and below which the costs outweigh the benefits at the end of the system s lifetime a more comprehensive breakeven analysis can also be performed where the change in value of money over time is considered equation 2 where f is the future value p is the present value i is the interest rate and n is the number of years can be used to move the capital cost of the system to the end of its lifetime or year 20 as well as the o m costs and revenue from struvite sales each year shown in table s3 of si these values are then summed equaling 67 340 000 negative because the net value is a cost equation 2 f p 1 i n to find the breakeven value for p the net costs must be equal to the net benefits from avoided nutrient pollution setting the total above to the future value f of the environmental benefits calculated based on the estimated recovery of 245 140 kg of p as struvite and the 4 88 interest rate applied technologies 2010 the solver tool in microsoft excel can be used to solve for the breakeven value of 8 41 per kg 4 discussion this case study of nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment shows different ways in which the value of nutrients specifically p can be considered in a realistic decision making scenario however in each phase of the analysis slightly different values were obtained which impact the conclusions that can be made about the system for example looking at the payback period analysis comparison of the two dane county specific studies verburg 2019 and stumborg et al 2001 can be highlighted based on the findings of stumborg et al 2001 study if the value of avoided nutrient pollution from p comes from what the people in dane county say that they are willing to pay as increased income and or property taxes increased housing costs due to changes in construction rules to reduce sediment runoff costs incurred under cost share pollution reduction programs with the state government and voluntary contributions to environmental organizations the struvite recovery system will never payback the initial costs and annual o m if however the value of p is considered to be equivalent to the cost to remove it from the environment based on verburg 2019 the system would certainly recover benefits that outweigh the total system costs before its end of life in the breakeven analysis considering the value of avoided p overloading the breakeven value for p was calculated to be 8 41 per kg when considering the change in value of money over time and 3 60 per kg when ignoring the change comparing these values with the specific subset of wtp and mitigation and restoration literature identified table 5 shows that both breakeven values falls almost exactly between the two sets of literature with values calculated from mitigation and restoration activities being larger and values calculated from wtp studies being smaller focusing on comparison with the mitigation and restoration literature a meaningful conclusion can be made that having control over where these nutrients are going breakeven value is lower than what it is costing to move or remove p once it is already in the environment mitigation and restoration values from the perspective of decision makers it would be reasonable to assume that the value of avoided p overloading is 30 41 per kg based on the dredging project since that is an established value for this specific community thus the struvite recovery system would prove to be a worthwhile investment recouping benefits from both struvite sales and environmental benefits that outweigh the capital and annual costs of the system in less than four years shown in si in total at the end of its assumed 20 year lifetime the struvite recovery system would recover benefits equivalent to 176 100 000 which is more than seven times the initial capital investment 22 772 000 an important point to bring up about the analysis above is that the responsibility of wwtps is preventing pollution and not environmental clean up a major hurdle in environmental economics in general is justifying the environmental costs which are considered to be externalities consequences that are not reflected in the actual cost of the goods or services involved though the nine springs wwtp is not responsible for environmental clean up or restoration and the money for the dane county dredging project is separate from the wastewater treatment costs the dane county community is paying for both services thus for this analysis using the perspective of the community allows for consideration of both pollution prevention and environmental clean up in this case however as mentioned in the literature survey it is also important to consider that the different mechanisms by which the public is paying for these different services increase in taxes water utility bill optional donations etc influence public opinion and can therefore affect the end decision making mitchell and carson 1989 moving forward there is room for improvement in the calculation and incorporation of these nutrient values in decision making ideally a more standardized methodology for computing the monetary value of nutrients could be established and new projects would each come up with location specific values to incorporate into decision making while location specific values would most accurately reflect the actual value of nutrients for specific projects it is not reasonable to assume that all communities businesses corporations etc have the time money or resources available to conduct and put together comprehensive studies such as those explored in the literature review to develop accurate monetary estimates to promote and encourage consideration of nutrient pollution issues in decision making one recommendation would be to come up with a single consistent value for nutrients in the environment similar to that of air pollution and the social cost of carbon environmental defense fund 2018 that could be used in the absence of a location specific value in the actual calculation of nutrient pollution values one area for improvement would be to differentiate between the different forms of nutrients i e soluble insoluble particulate etc as explored in macintosh et al 2018 the form that nutrients are in affects how they act in the environment where they end up and what specific issues they may cause therefore influencing the decision making process for example nutrient removal at the wwtp and dredging of p in lake or river sediment do not address exactly the same nutrient pollution issues because the latter removes only particulate p whereas the former focuses on removing both soluble and particulate p finally future research could also focus on broadening the inclusion of these values into decision making processes and working with decision makers on how to use and understand the information themselves and how to communicate its importance with the general public since environmental impacts and environmental damage are often considered to be externalities their cost to society has long been ignored in decision making processes however these environmental impacts and damages ultimately have consequences that affect future opportunities and impact future decision making and there should at least be consideration of these consequences when making decisions in the first place 5 conclusions this analysis of literature and case study demonstrate how monetary valuation of nutrients and nutrient pollution can be conducted and integrated into decision making the literature survey highlights variability in estimates of economic consequences from nutrient pollution wtp for p removal or reduction and the costs for mitigation and restoration of p once it has entered the environment based on the large differences in range of scope possible in these types of studies from the literature analysis it is evident that there are significant economic costs associated with nutrient pollution and the removal of nutrients once they have entered the environment however there is a lack of information about total economic costs across multiple sectors and the potential economic costs in combination with the costs of restoration or nutrient removal efforts in applying monetary valuation of p to the wastewater nutrient recovery case study it was demonstrated how monetary valuation can be utilized in a realistic decision making scenario breakeven analysis showed that when considering the change in value of money over time at a value of 8 41 per kg of p the overall benefits from struvite recovery at the nine springs wwtp outweigh the costs by the end of the 20 year assumed lifetime based on the current p dredging project verburg 2019 in dane county the value of p could actually be assumed to be 30 41 per kg greater than the 20 year breakeven value thus the struvite system would recoup benefits in both struvite sales and environmental benefits worth more than 7 times the capital investment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

treatment environmental economics 1 introduction phosphorus p and nitrogen n in the environment are critical in supporting the growth and development of healthy ecosystems however excessive amounts of these nutrients can create nutrient pollution leading to excessive plant and algae growth eutrophication and in extreme cases hypoxic or dead zones can develop us epa 2015 pretty et al 2003 nutrient pollution is a pervasive problem whose impacts are wide spread and in recent decades this issue has become of increasing concern with impairment of waterways becoming more severe and a growing focus on protecting and maintaining freshwater resources state epa nutrient innovations task group 2009 united nations 2018 despite these increasing nutrient management concerns economic considerations have traditionally been the driving force in decision making processes tiwari et al 1999 cost benefit analysis and economic payback period calculations often dictate the selection of new products or implementation of new systems and processes from a sustainability perspective however this approach is very narrow and neglects significant potential impacts these decisions can have namely environmental impacts which can have more widespread consequences one way in which these two perspectives can be evaluated and compared is through monetary valuation of environmental impacts or environmental damages this work focuses specifically on monetary valuation of nutrients and nutrient pollution a literature search identifying evaluating and comparing different monetary valuation methods was conducted in an effort to further understanding of the different perspectives or approaches that can be taken and highlighting areas for improvement additionally this work seeks to demonstrate how monetary valuation methods can be incorporated in traditional decision making processes and how they can impact decision making outcomes through a case study of nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment 2 literature analysis using the academic search engines google scholar and scopus a literature search was conducted focusing on economic valuation studies of nutrients and nutrient pollution in the united states search terms and phrases nutrients phosphorus nitrogen cost eutrophication monetary valuation environmental economics environmental cost mitigation economic cost willingness to pay nutrient pollution etc were used in combination to identify relevant literature detailing studies from the 1980s through the present with sufficient information to make specific comparisons which are detailed below these searches uncovered a wide range of different valuation methods related to nutrient pollution however for this analysis it was decided to focus on studies in three main areas economic consequences of nutrient pollution mitigation and restoration costs and willingness to pay wtp for removal or reduction each category addresses a different perspective of the costs of nutrient pollution economic consequences highlight the potential impacts in different economic sectors if nutrient pollution is not controlled mitigation and restoration studies detail the actual costs to remove nutrients once they have entered the environment and lastly wtp literature focuses on the realities of what the public is actually willing to pay to address the problem 2 1 economic consequences at the beginning of the literature search the 2015 united states environmental protection agency us epa report us epa 2015 was identified as a resource for nutrient pollution related environmental economic literature it was assumed that this collection of studies accurately represented the scope of literature on economic consequences of nutrient pollution in general from both p and n from this literature database studies focusing on the economic costs of nutrients in five different areas were analyzed to establish an understanding of the potential consequences of allowing nutrient pollution to occur these five areas area property value fisheries tourism health effects and drinking water treatment and to improve comparability amongst these studies the costs found in each were converted into 2017 united states dollars usd using inflation calculators to determine the buying power of money over time from coinnews media group llc 2018 and united states department of labor 2019 the property value subcategory focuses on the relationship between water quality and property value that has been previously established in literature specifically water clarity steinnes 1992 leggett and bockstael 2000 in this group all considered studies used hedonic property valuation models that take into account the characteristics of the specific property the location and the environment sirmans et al 2005 additionally each study considered the price decrease due to a 1 m change in water clarity measured as secchi depth a metric of water quality assessed using a black and white circular plate called a secchi disk the only property value focused studies from us epa 2015 that were not considered were those focusing on property value that considered a functional unit other than per 1 m change in secchi depth in an effort to maintain uniformity in addition to the unpleasant aesthetics nutrient pollution can cause the growth of hazardous algae blooms habs which may have adverse effects on human health as a result of ingestion or consumption of contaminated water fish shellfish or through direct contact with skin cdc 2018 according to the us epa 2015 only one health effect related study was identified that considered the marginal cost of health effects for respiratory illness related to algae bloom events the results from the study hoagland et al 2009 looking at the costs of health effects from nutrients showed a range of 20 000 to 140 000 per year for annual marginal cost of illness from specific red tide events in sarasota florida usa these values correspond to different amounts of emergency department visits for high and low algae bloom levels respectively growth of habs and eutrophication in general also have deleterious effects on aquatic species eutrophication causes excessive growth of plants and algae which deplete dissolved oxygen levels in the water that are essential for supporting aquatic life us epa 2019c and habs as their name suggests can produce toxins that can be harmful and even deadly to people and animals us epa 2019a the studies considered in the fisheries category looked at the economic losses for different aquatic species such as softshell clam brown shrimp or oysters detailed in table s2 of the si as a function of specific nutrient pollution related events or conditions i e red tide events habs hypoxia or a drop in dissolved oxygen levels etc tourism and tourism related spending is a large economic sector with 945 billion in direct tourism spending and 683 billion in indirect tourism related spending for the third quarter of 2017 in the united states alone bureau of economic analysis 2017 here direct tourism spending specifically encompasses travel and recreation expenses whereas indirect tourism related spending includes costs that are impacted by the amount of travel or tourism in an area such as restaurant or local business sales it has been shown previously that environmental quality impacts competition amongst different tourist destinations buckley 2003 mihalic 2000 since nutrient pollution affects the usability and quality of water resources it can therefore be connected to losses in the tourism sector similar to the fishery studies the tourism literature considers the economic consequences as a function of nutrient pollution related events or conditions and not specifically from some quantity of nutrients the final economic category considered is drinking water treatment costs as mentioned there can be serious public health consequences related to nutrient pollution specifically from ingesting contaminated water however older drinking water treatment plants that draw from contaminated surface waters are often not equipped to treat and remove the toxins produced by habs us epa 2019b and treatment demands even for modern plants increase during large bloom events one of the two considered studies davenport and drake 2011 calculated 13 920 000 in costs for increased treatment for a blue green algae outbreak and the other study the cadmus group inc 2014 calculated 74 970 000 in costs for increased treatment and monitoring to improve water quality issues due to excess nutrients table 1 summarizes the results found in each category but the variety of functional units across and amongst these different economic categories prevents direct comparison however qualitatively an understanding of the breadth of impact economically that nutrient pollution can have is developed these studies show that damages from nutrient pollution not only have an effect over a variety of different economic areas but also in a wide range of different locations and under a wide range of different conditions additionally the breadth of values observed within each category serves to demonstrate the scope of potential impacts in each of the considered areas the complete group of considered economic consequences studies is listed in detail in table s2 of the supplementary information si 2 2 mitigation and restoration in the second category of monetary valuation methods mitigation and restoration the focus of nutrient pollution was narrowed down to look only at p selection of literature focused only on studies that provided specific information about the costs of mitigation or restoration efforts and the amount of p removed or estimated to be removed therefore studies with insufficient data and information to calculate the dollars per kilogram kg of p removed were excluded this pool of sources excluded those studies from us epa 2015 examining nutrient trading programs overall ten different studies were identified from the literature search which are listed table s1 of the si additionally a list of nutrient mitigation and restoration studies that were considered but ultimately not included in the literature analysis here is provided in section 1 of the si with a more detailed explanation of the exclusion the majority of these mitigation and restoration studies six out of the ten focused on the costs of alum treatments of polluted lakes which is a common p management method us epa 2018 alum treatments are a popular choice for p removal since it removes p from the water column and helps control internal p loadings alum acts as a coagulant settling out cyanobacteria in the top layers of a water body which then forms a layer at the bottom of the water body and creates a barrier preventing p in the sediment from releasing into the water us epa 2018 while most of the studies in this group focused on alum treatments several studies considered other p mitigation and restoration options the suck the muck program detailed in verburg 2019 discusses a dredging project to remove legacy p at the bottom of rivers and streams feeding into area lakes dunne et al 2015 focuses on the cost effectiveness of a large scale constructed wetland at a lake in florida and sano et al 2004 considered two different stormwater treatment areas sta systems in florida in addition to managed aquatic plant systems maps along with variability in the methods there was a larger range amongst the locations of these studies as compared to the wtp literature in the next section with studies evaluating mitigation and restoration activities in minnesota wisconsin washington florida and south dakota information about overall costs and estimated or calculated removal of p was collected form the reports and used to determine a cost per kg of p removed or recovered in 2017 usd in this group the overall range in cost per kg of p removed was just over 4615 with the minimum cost calculated at 14 15 from hoyman 2012 and the maximum at 4630 from burgdhoff and williams 2012 2 3 willingness to pay the final category of studies included in this analysis are studies utilizing the contingent valuation method wtp contingent valuation is a method of valuation that involves surveying people to determine the maximum amount a person would be willing to pay for a good or service wtp or the minimum amount a person would be willing to accept to go without something willingness to accept wta historically contingent valuation methods have been used broadly in environmental economics but are also commonly used in health economics and cultural economics venkatachalam 2004 similar to the mitigation and restoration studies it was decided to narrow the focus to only studies looking at p nutrient pollution four different wtp studies and no wta studies were identified that provided enough information to calculate dollars per kg of p removed or reduced mathews et al 1999 mathews et al 2002 stumborg et al 2001 and welle and hodgson 2011 using the inflation calculators from coinnews media group llc 2018 and united states department of labor 2019 costs were converted to 2017 usd and then divided by the total removal of p proposed in kilograms all of wtp studies considered were all conducted in the midwest region of the united states specifically in minnesota and wisconsin combined these studies each surveyed residents about their willingness to pay for p reduction through a variety of different payment methods for example in mathews et al 1999 residents were asked about two different payment methods for reducing p pollution in the minnesota river by 40 first as an increase in state income tax and second as a surcharge on their water bill other studies surveyed residents about wtp for a proposed government program to reduce the frequency of algae blooms in lake mendota wi stumborg et al 2001 or focused on wtp for a nutrient reduction policy in two different watersheds welle and hodgson 2011 the overall range in values for p from these studies is from less than 0 01 kg of p but not zero mathews homans easter 1999 2002 welle and hodgson 2011 to 4630 kg of p burgdhoff and williams 2012 however in addition to the distinct characteristics of the specific population one important consideration in these wtp studies that can have a major impact on what people are willing to pay is the mechanism by which they would be paying for nutrient pollution control different payment methods such as an increase in local water utility bills could be received differently than an increase in community taxes or simply a voluntary annual donation to specific projects 2 4 summary direct comparison of all the literature findings is not reasonable due to the varied functional units in each area however the magnitude of costs in each area can provide valuable insight from table 2 it is shown that the range in economic consequences from nutrient pollution spans hundreds to hundreds of millions of dollars in total depending on the economic sector considered as well as perhaps the location and severity of the pollution with the wtp and mitigation and restoration studies it appears that the costs or value for p from wtp studies are considerably smaller than those from the mitigation and restoration literature however with wtp studies the value being considered is the value per kg of p willing to be paid per person or per household whereas the values found in the mitigation and restoration literature are a total per kg of p not a split amongst a population from this perspective depending on the size of the community or group the wtp values could be comparable to those found in the mitigation and restoration studies an important piece that was found to be missing from this literature is the calculation of totaled economic consequences across many different sectors as the economic consequences literature demonstrated impacts from nutrient pollution are not limited to one area however only one of the studies analyzed here davenport and drake 2011 evaluated the impacts in more than one economic area from the studies considered here it is reasonable to conclude that the overall economic consequences related to nutrient pollution exceed the individual values or estimates examined here furthermore no studies were identified that considered the combined economic consequences of nutrient pollution and restoration costs in a scenario where a community recognizes the economic impacts of the nutrient pollution issue and seeks to reduce the pollution or remediate an affected area these two areas represent more realistic scenarios and would be important next steps to build upon and expand this area of analysis what can be taken from this literature analysis is that the economic costs of allowing nutrient pollution to occur or of not taking care of it once it occurs can reach hundreds of millions of dollars additionally the costs to remove nutrients specifically p once they have entered the environment can also be high up to thousands of dollars per kg of p therefore it can be concluded that there is some value in preventing this pollution from occurring in the first place and this value can be used to be used to determine a monetary value for these nutrients from an environmental perspective 3 case study although the amount of damage nutrients can cause is at least in part influenced by the specific conditions of the particular location being considered from the literature analysis above it is evident that there can be significant variability in the valuation of nutrients in the environment depending on the specific valuation method being used to better illustrate these discrepancies and understand how they can impact decision making results from the literature examined above will be applied to a case study of nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment in 2009 the nine springs wwtp in madison wi usa evaluated options for improving their biosolids handling processes as part of this upgrade they explored different ways to manage unwanted precipitation of struvite magnesium ammonium phosphate n h 4 m g p o 4 ultimately they chose to implement a system that recovers struvite as an alternative fertilizer thus removing p and n from the biosolids stream applied technologies 2010 this case study will focus on incorporating values for avoided nutrient pollution specifically avoided p pollution since wisconsin does not border any oceans into the economic decision making used by the madison metropolitan sewerage district mmsd when they were evaluating the struvite recovery system 3 1 case study set up the nine springs wastewater treatment plant wwtp is a 158 million liter per day 42 million gallon per day plant that serves around 380 000 people in the madison area treated effluent is discharged to two separate creeks with each being in a different watershed within the plant s service area additionally the wwtp anaerobically digests its sludge producing class b biosolids that are sent to local farms for spreading on agricultural land as fertilizer the addition of the struvite recovery system from ostara nutrient recovery technology inc in 2014 removes nutrients both p and n from the biosolids and precipitates them as struvite which is then sold as an alternative fertilizer product from a nutrient management perspective a major benefit of struvite recovery in this case is that the nutrient are captured in a form that can be more easily transported than the biosolids which are heavier and therefore more expensive to move since the transportation of these nutrients is less restricted with regards to cost and therefore distance as with biosolids it is assumed that they will be sent where they are needed thus avoiding an overload of nutrients in the areas surrounding the wwtp and allowing for nutrient balancing on a larger scale future research is looking to incorporate similar nutrient recovery technologies into multi objective optimization work to balance urban and rural waste management hu et al 2018 the environmental impact that is being valued in this case is therefore the environmental benefit of avoided nutrient pollution from p in their decision making process the madison metropolitan sewerage district mmsd included economic estimates for each alternative the specific cost data from applied technologies 2010 related to the struvite recovery system that was selected is summarized in table 3 and using online inflation calculators coinnews media group llc 2018 and united states department of labor 2019 these costs were converted into 2017 usd to understand and visualize one time versus re occurring costs of the system over the assumed 20 year lifetime applied technologies 2010 a cash flow diagram can be constructed in this case the present or year 0 is considered to be 2017 and the only cost at that time is the initial capital investment of 22 772 000 while the capital costs are considered to be one time costs operation and maintenance o m costs are better understood as re occurring annual costs using the capital recovery formula shown in equation 1 n is the assumed 20 year lifetime of the system applied technologies 2010 and i is the inflation rate of 4 88 applied technologies 2010 the present worth o m cost from table 3 which is denoted by p in the formula can be converted to an annual value a in the formula of 255 500 however what can be misleading here is that the o m cost reported in table 3 from applied technologies 2010 is actually a net cost that includes the agreed upon credit that the nine springs wwtp gets from selling their recovered struvite to ostara as a fertilizer in addition to the estimated o m costs equation 1 a p e i n e i 1 e i n 1 in order to be able to separate these two costs the annual revenue from struvite fertilizer sales needs to be calculated using the estimated annual production of struvite and the selling price of the fertilizer in the initial evaluation report applied technologies 2010 mmsd estimated 1 942 283 kg 2 141 us tons of struvite would be produced each year next from the 2017 report madison metropolitan sewerage district 2017 it is documented that the nine springs wwtp recovered approximately 530 703 kg 585 us tons of struvite making 205 600 using this information the selling price of struvite is calculated to be 0 39 per kg multiplying the estimated annual struvite production 1 942 283 kg by the selling price 0 39 per kg the annual revenue from struvite production is estimated to be about 752 300 from here it can be calculated that the actual o m costs estimated for applied technologies 2010 are around 1 008 000 fig 1 displays the capital cost and re occurring annual costs discussed above in a cash flow diagram the focus of this case study however is about incorporating the environmental benefit of avoided nutrient overloading so in addition to the three direct costs the dashed green arrows in fig 1 illustrate the potential annual value of the environmental benefit from struvite recovery 3 2 payback period as a preliminary analysis step a payback period study can be conducted using different values for p in the environment from literature although this payback period analysis ignores the change in value of money over time it is a relatively simple analysis tool that allows for quick evaluation of alternatives to represent the full range of p values collected from the literature analysis three different studies were selected mathews et al 1999 burgdhoff and williams 2012 and chandler 2013 which give the maximum minimum and median costs found respectively additionally two more studies verburg 2019 and stumborg et al 2001 were included for comparison as they are specific to dane county wi where the wwtp is located these five studies are summarized in table 4 to calculate the payback period here the annual costs from o m 1 008 000 and revenues from struvite fertilizer sales 752 400 and the environmental benefit value are combined into a net value referred here as the net annual benefit nab this value is then used to determine how many years it would take to pay back or recoup the present worth capital costs the results of this payback period analysis based on the group of studies identified in table 4 above are shown in table 5 the results in table 5 show that the three values of p based on the costs of restoration treatments result in a positive payback period whereas the two values coming from wtp studies show negative payback periods since negative years are not possible here conceptually what a negative payback period conveys is that the benefits from struvite recovery will never outweigh the combined costs of the system if the value of avoided p overloading is based on the potential cost to remove it from the environment the struvite system would recoup benefits equal to the initial and annual costs before the end of its lifetime 3 3 breakeven analysis another valuable assessment method that can be employed is breakeven analysis where the value of p at which the system breaks even is calculated to begin the breakeven price of the struvite system can be calculated ignoring the change in value of money over time starting with the capital cost of 22 772 000 and dividing it by the assumed 20 year lifetime of the system the annual revenue from struvite fertilizer sales is subtracted and the annual o m costs are added to obtain the required annual environmental benefit necessary to breakeven approximately 883 100 this value is then divided by the amount of p estimated to be recovered per year as struvite 245 139 kg resulting in a value of 3 60 per kg conceptually this price represents the cut off value of p above which the benefits of struvite recovery outweigh the cost and below which the costs outweigh the benefits at the end of the system s lifetime a more comprehensive breakeven analysis can also be performed where the change in value of money over time is considered equation 2 where f is the future value p is the present value i is the interest rate and n is the number of years can be used to move the capital cost of the system to the end of its lifetime or year 20 as well as the o m costs and revenue from struvite sales each year shown in table s3 of si these values are then summed equaling 67 340 000 negative because the net value is a cost equation 2 f p 1 i n to find the breakeven value for p the net costs must be equal to the net benefits from avoided nutrient pollution setting the total above to the future value f of the environmental benefits calculated based on the estimated recovery of 245 140 kg of p as struvite and the 4 88 interest rate applied technologies 2010 the solver tool in microsoft excel can be used to solve for the breakeven value of 8 41 per kg 4 discussion this case study of nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment shows different ways in which the value of nutrients specifically p can be considered in a realistic decision making scenario however in each phase of the analysis slightly different values were obtained which impact the conclusions that can be made about the system for example looking at the payback period analysis comparison of the two dane county specific studies verburg 2019 and stumborg et al 2001 can be highlighted based on the findings of stumborg et al 2001 study if the value of avoided nutrient pollution from p comes from what the people in dane county say that they are willing to pay as increased income and or property taxes increased housing costs due to changes in construction rules to reduce sediment runoff costs incurred under cost share pollution reduction programs with the state government and voluntary contributions to environmental organizations the struvite recovery system will never payback the initial costs and annual o m if however the value of p is considered to be equivalent to the cost to remove it from the environment based on verburg 2019 the system would certainly recover benefits that outweigh the total system costs before its end of life in the breakeven analysis considering the value of avoided p overloading the breakeven value for p was calculated to be 8 41 per kg when considering the change in value of money over time and 3 60 per kg when ignoring the change comparing these values with the specific subset of wtp and mitigation and restoration literature identified table 5 shows that both breakeven values falls almost exactly between the two sets of literature with values calculated from mitigation and restoration activities being larger and values calculated from wtp studies being smaller focusing on comparison with the mitigation and restoration literature a meaningful conclusion can be made that having control over where these nutrients are going breakeven value is lower than what it is costing to move or remove p once it is already in the environment mitigation and restoration values from the perspective of decision makers it would be reasonable to assume that the value of avoided p overloading is 30 41 per kg based on the dredging project since that is an established value for this specific community thus the struvite recovery system would prove to be a worthwhile investment recouping benefits from both struvite sales and environmental benefits that outweigh the capital and annual costs of the system in less than four years shown in si in total at the end of its assumed 20 year lifetime the struvite recovery system would recover benefits equivalent to 176 100 000 which is more than seven times the initial capital investment 22 772 000 an important point to bring up about the analysis above is that the responsibility of wwtps is preventing pollution and not environmental clean up a major hurdle in environmental economics in general is justifying the environmental costs which are considered to be externalities consequences that are not reflected in the actual cost of the goods or services involved though the nine springs wwtp is not responsible for environmental clean up or restoration and the money for the dane county dredging project is separate from the wastewater treatment costs the dane county community is paying for both services thus for this analysis using the perspective of the community allows for consideration of both pollution prevention and environmental clean up in this case however as mentioned in the literature survey it is also important to consider that the different mechanisms by which the public is paying for these different services increase in taxes water utility bill optional donations etc influence public opinion and can therefore affect the end decision making mitchell and carson 1989 moving forward there is room for improvement in the calculation and incorporation of these nutrient values in decision making ideally a more standardized methodology for computing the monetary value of nutrients could be established and new projects would each come up with location specific values to incorporate into decision making while location specific values would most accurately reflect the actual value of nutrients for specific projects it is not reasonable to assume that all communities businesses corporations etc have the time money or resources available to conduct and put together comprehensive studies such as those explored in the literature review to develop accurate monetary estimates to promote and encourage consideration of nutrient pollution issues in decision making one recommendation would be to come up with a single consistent value for nutrients in the environment similar to that of air pollution and the social cost of carbon environmental defense fund 2018 that could be used in the absence of a location specific value in the actual calculation of nutrient pollution values one area for improvement would be to differentiate between the different forms of nutrients i e soluble insoluble particulate etc as explored in macintosh et al 2018 the form that nutrients are in affects how they act in the environment where they end up and what specific issues they may cause therefore influencing the decision making process for example nutrient removal at the wwtp and dredging of p in lake or river sediment do not address exactly the same nutrient pollution issues because the latter removes only particulate p whereas the former focuses on removing both soluble and particulate p finally future research could also focus on broadening the inclusion of these values into decision making processes and working with decision makers on how to use and understand the information themselves and how to communicate its importance with the general public since environmental impacts and environmental damage are often considered to be externalities their cost to society has long been ignored in decision making processes however these environmental impacts and damages ultimately have consequences that affect future opportunities and impact future decision making and there should at least be consideration of these consequences when making decisions in the first place 5 conclusions this analysis of literature and case study demonstrate how monetary valuation of nutrients and nutrient pollution can be conducted and integrated into decision making the literature survey highlights variability in estimates of economic consequences from nutrient pollution wtp for p removal or reduction and the costs for mitigation and restoration of p once it has entered the environment based on the large differences in range of scope possible in these types of studies from the literature analysis it is evident that there are significant economic costs associated with nutrient pollution and the removal of nutrients once they have entered the environment however there is a lack of information about total economic costs across multiple sectors and the potential economic costs in combination with the costs of restoration or nutrient removal efforts in applying monetary valuation of p to the wastewater nutrient recovery case study it was demonstrated how monetary valuation can be utilized in a realistic decision making scenario breakeven analysis showed that when considering the change in value of money over time at a value of 8 41 per kg of p the overall benefits from struvite recovery at the nine springs wwtp outweigh the costs by the end of the 20 year assumed lifetime based on the current p dredging project verburg 2019 in dane county the value of p could actually be assumed to be 30 41 per kg greater than the 20 year breakeven value thus the struvite system would recoup benefits in both struvite sales and environmental benefits worth more than 7 times the capital investment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

18146,biological activated carbon bac is widely used as a polishing step at full scale drinking water plants to remove taste and odor compounds and assimilable organic carbon bac especially with pre ozonation has been previously studied to control regulated disinfection by products dbps and dbp precursors however most previous studies only include regulated or a limited number of unregulated dbps this study explored two full scale drinking water plants that use pre chloramination followed by bac and chloramine as the final disinfectant while chloramine generally produces lower concentrations of regulated dbps it may form increased levels of unregulated nitrogenous and iodinated dbps we evaluated 71 dbps from ten dbp classes including haloacetonitriles haloacetamides halonitromethanes haloacetaldehydes haloketones iodinated acetic acids iodinated trihalomethanes nitrosamines trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids along with speciated total organic halogen total organic chlorine bromine and iodine across six different bac filters of increasing age most preformed dbps were well removed by bac with different ages i e operation times however some preformed dbps were poorly removed or increased following treatment with bac including chloroacetaldehyde dichloronitromethane bromodichloronitromethane n nitrosodimethylamine dibromochloromethane tribromomethane dibromochloroacetic acid and tribromoacetic acid some compounds including dibromoacetaldehyde bromochloroacetamide and dibromoacetamide were formed only after treatment with bac total organic halogen removal was variable in both plants and increases in tocl or toi were observable on one occasion at each plant while calculated genotoxicity decreased in all filters decreases in overall dbp formation did not correlate with decreases in calculated cytotoxicity in three of the six filters calculated toxicity increased by 4 27 these results highlight that dbp concentration alone may not always provide an adequate basis for risk assessment graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological activated carbon drinking water disinfection by products gac total organic halogen calculated cytotoxicity genotoxicity 1 introduction chemical disinfection is vital in providing safe drinking water and preventing waterborne illness but an unintended consequence is the formation of disinfection by products dbps from the reaction of disinfectants with organic matter bromide and iodide present in water richardson 2011 several adverse health effects have been associated with dbps including bladder cancer colorectal cancer miscarriage and birth defects richardson et al 2007 cantor et al 2010 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 savitz et al 2005 villanueva et al 2004 2007 waller et al 1998 costet et al 2011 rahman et al 2007 the main chemical disinfectant used for drinking water is chlorine but to comply with dbp regulations in the u s many drinking water treatment plants have switched from chlorine to alternative disinfectants like chloramine zhang et al 2000 richardson et al 2008 chloramine is less reactive with dissolved organic matter dom compared to chlorine and therefore lowers the formation of regulated dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas seidel et al 2005 hua and reckhow 2007 allard et al 2015 however chloramine can form increased levels of more toxic unregulated

there are two ways in which chloramination is conducted either a free chlorine contact time is allowed before ammonia is added to form chloramines most common or chloramines are preformed before addition to water while in line preparation is common in wastewater treatment plants it is uncommon in drinking water treatment plants depending on the source water quality and treatment process a drinking plant employs varying concentrations of dbps can be formed for example one study showed that in water containing dom with low aromaticity higher levels of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms were formed when employing preformed monochloramine nh2cl while in water containing dom with higher aromaticity higher levels of i thms were formed when a free chlorine contact time was allowed allard et al 2015 jones et al 2011 while chloramination generally results in lower levels of total organic halogen tox than chlorination hua and reckhow 2007 it can increase total organic iodine toi levels kristiana et al 2009 in several studies measured dbp species accounted for only 30 of the tox in chloraminated drinking water krasner et al 2006 hua and reckhow 2007 kristiana et al 2009 tian et al 2013 in addition some studies have shown that known quantified dbps typically account for only a fraction of the overall toxicity of disinfected water and therefore it is widely suspected that unknown or unquantified tox contains toxicologically relevant dbps krasner et al 2006 hua and reckhow 2007 bull et al 2011 granular activated carbon gac can remove dom by both adsorption and biodegradation the dom adsorption process is a non steady state process in which the effluent concentrations of dom increases with time until all accessible adsorption sites are occupied for the biodegradable dom

conditions are constant e g temperature ph servais et al 1994 after most of the adsorption capacity is exhausted biodegradation is the dominant dom removal mechanism and the gac process is often termed biological activated carbon bac shukairy and summers 1992 miltner et al 1992 operation in the bac mode has the advantage of not requiring gac change out and while effectively controlling biodegradable compounds including taste and odor compounds and a wide range of other organic compounds of concern ho et al 2007 suffet et al 1995 greenstein et al 2018 it is well established that a fraction of organic thm and haa precursors can be removed by biofilters including bac columns shukairy and summers 1992 miltner et al 1992 however in two studies bac yielded an increased dissolved organic nitrogen don to doc ratio resulting in higher formation of n dbps shukairy and summers 1992 chu et al 2012 there is some information on the effect of bac on the formation of unregulated dbps

polymeric substances eps excreted by microbes and released from the biofilm dead cells smps and eps may serve as dbp precursors particularly for n dbps krasner et al 2015 important parameters to consider for effective bac treatment include substrate concentration ph dissolved oxygen do biofilm thickness empty bed contact time ebct shear stress and backwash water quality with or without oxidant intensity and frequency some studies have shown that pre disinfection with chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide or ozone can potentially decrease the removal efficiency of organic matter and may disturb or destroy the biofilm on the activated carbon at higher concentrations lechevallier and cawthon 1988 korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 furthermore eps may be produced by the biofilm as a protective response to chemical oxidants one study reported the critical residual chlorine concentration that does not have an adverse effect on biological activity was approximately 0 2 mg l lohwacharin et al 2015 korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 another study showed that chloramine is more efficient in penetrating biofilms than free chlorine although they both show similar biocidal activity lechevallier and cawthon 1988 while there are many studies on the use of pre ozonation with bac only seven full scale studies evaluated the use of bac on the formation of dbps without pre ozonation liu et al 2017 price et al 1993 delatolla et al 2015 page et al 2016 zeng et al 2016a gerrity et al 2011 bukhari et al 2016 lyon et al 2014 vatankhah et al 2019 four of these studies evaluated a few unregulated dbps including nitrosamines gerrity et al 2015 bukhari et al 2016 page et al 2016 and a few haloketones haloacetaldehydes halonitromethanes haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides zha et al 2016 zeng et al 2016a liu et al 2017 the current study provided an opportunity to investigate the biodegradation capacity of bac with chloramine as the pre oxidant to degrade many unregulated bromo iodo and n dbps including many dbps that have not been previously investigated to the best of our knowledge no full scale studies have evaluated regulated and unregulated dbp formation along with tox in plants that carry a chloramine residual prior to bac without the use of pre ozonation as is the case with the full scale drinking plants evaluated in this study however a similar study from our group cuthbertson et al 2019 investigated the effectiveness of full scale gac systems to reduce tox and 70 regulated and unregulated dbps when free chlorine served as the disinfectant this study showed promising reductions in concentrations of regulated and unregulated dbps and that drivers of calculated toxicity were unlikely to be regulated dbps this study seeks to address the question of whether bac is effective in controlling toxic unregulated dbps and whether it impacts calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity from a dbp perspective the goals of this study were to assess the effectiveness of full scale bac treatment for controlling 1 dbps formed during pre chloramination 2 formation of dbps following final disinfection after treatment with bac 3 formation of speciated tox including total organic chlorine bromine and iodine tocl tobr toi and 4 calculated toxicity associated with quantified dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of drinking water treatment plants water samples were collected at two full scale plants in the united states that use chloramine for pre oxidation and as a secondary disinfectant for distribution dbp precursor control was evaluated across a range of bac service lives at each plant table s2 source waters of both plants were impacted by industry wastewater and agriculture both plants also use amine based polymers during coagulation which can impact the formation of n dbps wilczak et al 2003 zeng et al 2016c zhao et al 2017 formation of 71 regulated and unregulated dbps were studied in bench scale

acids iaas i thms nitrosamines ndma thms and haas to the best of our knowledge this is the first full scale study evaluating the removal of many of these dbps and their precursors in systems that employ bac tocl tobr and toi were also measured and compared to the total concentration of quantified dbps with the balance representing a quantitative measure of unknown or unquantified dbps krasner et al 2006 smith et al 2010 echigo et al 2000 daiber et al 2016 based on the available toxicity information for the 71 dbps quantified cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were calculated using the tic tox method plewa et al 2017 2 1 1 operational conditions for both plants the gac media had not been replaced for at least 1 year table s2 prior to sampling at plant a bac filters were typically operated

bac filters were operated at a loading rate of 2 1 gpm ft2 with 2 0 4 0 mg l as cl2 of chloramines present in the feed water the gac media depth was similar to underlying sand media so the ebct of the

extraction and analysis of the remaining 57 dbps table s3 were conducted using previously published procedures allen et al 2017 kimura et al 2017 cuthbertson et al 2019 hals hans hks hnms i thms and

3 3 total organic halogen tox tocl tobr and toi were determined using a mitsubishi tox analyzer mitsubishi chemical analytech chigasaki japan cosa xentaur yaphank usa according to previously published procedures smith et al 2010 echigo et al 2000 daiber et al 2016 kimura et al 2017 with a few modifications described in text s2 allen et al 2017 2 3 4 water toxicity and percent tox calculations the contribution of each dbp class to tox was calculated by first multiplying the molar concentration of each compound that pertained to a specific dbp class by its corresponding number of halogens i e 1 4 halogen atoms these values were then added and this sum was divided by the sum molar concentration of tocl tobr and toi the water toxicity of each sample was based on the tic tox method published by plewa et al 2017 in brief the molar concentration of each dbp was multiplied by its corresponding cyto or genotoxicity index value in chinese hamster ovary cho cells available in the literature plewa et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 the total cyto and genotoxicity value for each water sample was the sum of all the measured dbps toxicity values all comparisons of compound concentrations were subjected to a two tailed t test with 1 degree of freedom d f at the 95 confidence interval ci to show statistical differences 3 results and discussion the use of pre chloramination provided an opportunity to study the adsorption and biodegradation of pre formed unregulated dbps directly using bac in real world conditions post final disinfection chloraminated influent samples simulate the concentration of dbps expected at a consumer s tap without the use of bac while chloraminated effluent samples simulate dbp concentrations with the use of bac since disinfection procedures were based on the plants dosing and distribution times this study provided an opportunity to assess realistic exposure concentrations many of these compounds have never been studied in full scale bac systems including i haas i hams and i thms to assess precursor removal chloramination sds procedures were conducted on settled influent samples and three different aged bac contactor effluents within each plant for a total of 6 full scale bac contactors table s2 3 1 removal of preformed dbps by bac at plant a 27 dbps formed at detectable levels during pre oxidation with chloramine table s5 while 24 were formed at plant b table s7 these included hals hams hans hks hnms i haas i thms ndma thms and haas fig s3 concentrations ranged from 5 ng l to 27 3 μg l at plant a the quantifiable dbps formed during pre oxidation accounted for approximately 14 32 of the tocl 37 97 of the tobr and 0 2 of the toi on a molar basis tox removal by bac showed mixed results in terms of concentration figs s3 and s4 bac treatment reduced tocl by 16 19 in the middle aged and oldest bac 93 500 and 140 200 bv but there was no removal of tocl in the youngest bac contactor 46 700 bv tobr removal was 7 21 and toi removal was 37 57 classes of compounds that were well removed include hals 71 88 hams 64 95 iaas 66 100 and haas 75 81 fig s3 also preformed ndma was well removed in both plant a 70 and plant b 83 87 hnms had mixed results with 83 removal in the youngest and middle aged filters but bdcnm concentrations increased in the oldest filter 140 200 bv at plant a dichloronitromethane dcnm was not removed at all and increased from 200 to 300 ng l in the oldest filter it is possible that reductive de halogenation of trichloronitromethane tcnm which was known to biodegrade resulted in the increased formation of dcnm yates et al 2015 li et al 2016 yin et al 2018 bromodichloronitromethane bdcnm also increased from 800 to 1000 ng l in the oldest filter another possibility is that chloramine in the influent feed water may react with precursors on the influent side of the bac filter forming dbps thm removal in plant a was limited to 2 5 with 0 3 removal of trichloromethane tcm and no removal of bromodichloromethane bdcm this is consistent with previous studies indicating poor biodegradation of some thms zainudin et al 2018 quantifiable dbps formed during pre oxidation at plant b table s7 accounted for 36 65 of the tocl 56 66 of the tobr and 1 of the toi bac showed limited removal of preformed tox 3 28 tocl 8 26 tobr and 0 37 toi removal fig s4 dbps that were well removed 70 100 at all bac contactor ages included trichloroacetaldehyde tcal bromodichloroacetaldehyde bdcal bromochloroacetamide bcam 1 1 dichloropropanone 11dcp tcnm chloroiodoacetic acid ciaa dichloroiodomethane dcim ndma bromoacetic acid baa dichloroacetic acid dcaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa and tribromoacetic acid tbaa many n and i dbps had high removal with bac e g bcam tcnm ciaa dcim and ndma others were less readily removed 30 70 including dichloroacetamide dcam 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 111tcp 1 1 3 3 tetrachloropropanone 1133tecp bromochloromethane bcm trichloroacetic acid tcaa and bromodichloromethane bdcm compounds that were reduced less than 10 included dcnm bdcaa tcm and bdcm furthermore concentrations of some compounds increased following bac as eluded to earlier for plant a these included concentrations of dcnm which increased by 50 from 0 2 μg l and bdcnm which increased by 25 from 0 8 μg l in plant b concentrations of dibromochloromethane dbcm doubled in concentration in the middle and oldest contactors from 0 2 μg l and dibromochloroacetic acid dbcaa increased 63 in the youngest contactor from 0 8 μg l the presence of nitrifying bacteria in both plants as indicated by the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate table 1 may account for the increased formation of some n dbps following bac treatment including nitrosamines hans and hams zeng and mitch 2016b it is also possible that chloramine may be reacting with sorbed precursors on the bac another pilot study showed that increasing halogenation on haas decreased biodegradation rates in the presence of suspended bacteria zhou and xie 2002 for example chloroacetic acid caa had the highest biodegradation rates while tcaa had the slowest rates findings from this study show that the unregulated haas bdcaa and dbcaa have poor biodegradation capacity under full scale plant conditions for many of the quantified dbps including mono and di hals hams i thms and i haas and tri hnms including bdcnm and dibromochloronitromethane dbcnm this is the first time that their removal is reported using bac 3 2 removal of dbp precursors many dbps formed at similar concentrations during pre oxidation preformed and following simulated secondary disinfection for example in terms of molarity preformed dbps were between 65 and 86 of the total dbp formation following sds treatment at both plants tables s6 and s8 comparing the removal of preformed dbps with their formation following sds chloramination allows the determination of whether a dbp or a corresponding precursor is better removed for example at plant a preformed dcnm had the same concentration in the influent as in the youngest and middle aged filter effluents and then increased in the oldest bac filter effluent indicating that it is not well removed following sds treatment of both bac influent and effluent dcnm levels in the bac effluent were 50 of that in the bac influent indicating that the precursors for this compound were either removed by bac or that transformation of this compound occurred with increased chloramination treatment previous studies have shown that bac is efficient at removing low molecular weight mw natural organic matter nom including some dbp precursors as well as algal toxins ammonia and trace level organics but it is less effective for removing higher mw hydrophilic fractions compounds that formed only during sds treatment include tribromomethane tbm chloroacetaldehyde cal dibromoacetaldehyde dbal bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dbcnm plant a and bromoacetic acid baa cal dichloroacetaldehyde dcal bcan bcam dibromoacetamide dbam and dcnm plant b several compounds were only observed after bac treatment and final disinfection including dbal 1 5 2 μg l bcam 0 2 0 4 μg l and dbam 0 2 0 6 μg l at plant a total preformed tox constituted approximately 93 135 of sds tox m with toi 160 283 preformed at plant b total preformed tox constituted 34 84 of the tox formed following sds treatment with toi 99 148 preformed i dbps can undergo base catalyzed hydrolysis zhu and zhang 2016 which may explain the loss of toi during sds conditions with relatively long holding times 3 3 impact of bac on dbp formation following sds treatment plants a and b achieved reductions in total dbp formation of 37 46 and 12 32 respectively fig 1 toc removal for these plants was relatively low and was similar for all filter ages with 8 11 and 4 5 toc removal for plants a and b respectively table 2 it is possible that some adsorption capacity of gac for dbp precursors was exhausted given the gac age table s2 total summed cl dbps were reduced 39 49 at plant a and 30 52 at plant b total summed n dbps levels decreased by 37 55 at plant a and by 32 62 at plant b total summed br dbp levels decreased by 25 30 at plant a and by 48 67 at plant b interestingly total i dbps had significant removal at plant a 90 indicating high removal for these compounds and their precurors these results complement a pilot study fu et al 2017 which showed significant reduction via biodegration of precursors for a subset of similar compounds including 36 unregulated dbps tocl tobr and toi sometimes increased following bac filtration and patterns did not match with reductions in quantified dbps fig 2 and s5 for example plant a had reductions of tocl tobr and toi of 19 31 15 26 and 22 28 respectively in the youngest 46 700 bv and middle aged bac 93 500 bv but toi levels increased slightly by 10 in the oldest bac 140 200 bv there was not a significant increase in the quantified i dbps suggesting the formation of unknown i dbps on the other hand plant b saw higher levels of tocl and tobr by 15 143 and 1 17 respectively following bac with a toi removal of 19 31 figs s5 and s7 in all three bacs the variation in the results for these two plants highlights how dynamic and difficult to predict bac systems can be it should be noted that neither facility used bac as a dbp compliance strategy but rather as a taste and odor control strategy while the formation of many dbps was reduced by bac some dbps were unaffected concentrations were not significantly different between bac influent and effluent after sds chloramination tables s6 and s8 in plant a these included dcam bcan and dcim some dbp levels increased following the use bac and chloramine including caa dbal cal bcam dbam bcan and ndma the increases of br and n dbps are consistent with earlier studies that showed increases in regulated brominated thms as well as more recent work by chiu et al 2012 krasner et al 2016 and cuthbertson et al 2019 who showed an increase in dban as a result of gac treatment at plant a there was a shift in speciation to more toxic br dbps following bac despite relatively stable br doc ratios for example dcal levels decreased and dbal formed with the use of bac while ndma levels decreased significantly following plant b sds 36 84 ndma increased after sds treatment following bac at plant a by 76 in the youngest filter 46 700 bv and by 10 in the oldest filter 140 200 bv from 50 to 88 and 55 ng l respectively plant a had significantly more don than plant b 0 74 0 86 mg l as n for plant a compared to mrl for plant b don precursors such as dimethylamine tertiary amines and quaternary amines can form significant amounts of ndma upon chloramination mitch and sedlak 2004 these types of precursors may also be released by the biofilms into effluent waters previous studies have also shown increases of nitrosamines through nitrification via the presence of nitrifying bacteria teng and mitch 2016 in both plants there was a dramatic decrease in ammonia with an accompanying increase in nitrite and nitrate after the use of bac table 1 a possible reason is that ammonia promotes the growth of nitrifying bacteria on the surface of gac which in turn converts ammonia to nitrite and nitrate vahala et al 1999 carrico et al 2008 nitrite and nitrate have been shown to be important precursors in the formation of many dbps including halonitromethanes trihalomethanes and cyanogen chloride choi and richardson 2004 lyon et al 2012 this may partially explain increases in n dbps e g bcam dbam bcan and ndma following bac in these plants 3 4 calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity given the concerns for the formation of more toxic br i and n dbps with chloramine along with increased don doc ratios found in waters treated with bac it is important to assess whether water treated in this manner is in fact safer to address this question we used an approach termed tic tox in which the concentration of each dbp is multiplied by corresponding cytotoxicity and genotoxicity index values reported in the literature plewa et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 this method has been used in several published studies to assess potential toxicity of treated waters plewa et al 2017 smith et al 2010 allard et al 2015 krasner et al 2016 cuthbertson et al 2019 the total calculated water toxicity and percent contribution by dbp class for both plants analyzed in this study are shown in figs 1 and 3 and s8 tic tox is useful as a screening test to prioritize dbps for additional toxicity testing and can be used to identify potential trade offs in treatment however these tradeoffs should be considered possible only when supported by real toxicity data 3 4 1 calculated toxicity for preformed dbps in bac influent and effluent preformed calculated cytotoxicity at plant a was reduced by 45 87 while calculated genotoxicity was reduced 37 94 over the lifetime of the bac filters at plant b preformed calculated cytotoxicity was reduced by 77 80 across bac filter lifetime and calculated genotoxicity was reduced 60 85 preformed calculated toxicity was driven by hnms and haas at plant a and hams hnms and haas in plant b at plant a preformed calculated cytotoxicity accounted for 39 of the sds cytotoxicity in the influent but only 4 21 of the calculated cytotoxicity following treatment with bac at plant b preformed calculated cytotoxicity only accounted for 10 of the influent water and 2 3 of the bac effluents 3 4 2 calculated toxicity for dbps following sds testing calculated cytotoxicity at both bac plants following sds treatment showed mixed results with both increases and decreases in calculated cytotoxicity following bac treatment and with no apparent correlation to gac age fig 1 at plant a calculated cytotoxicity increased in the youngest filter 46 700 bv by 27 decreased by 37 in the middle aged filter 93 500 bv and remained virtually unchanged in the oldest filter 140 200 bv with a slight increase of 4 these increases of calculated toxicity at plant a occurred despite a total reduction in quantified dbp levels of 30 35 indicating shifts to more toxic dbps following treatment with bac plant b had calculated cytotoxicity reductions of 1 22 in the youngest 157 400 bv and middle aged filter 333 200 bv but a slight increase of 9 in the oldest contactor 555 300 bvs the variations in the results for these two plants indicate these types of bac systems should be studied further the calculated genotoxicity decreased at both plants in all six filters and regardless of bac age a promising result plant a saw a decrease of calculated genotoxicity by 38 65 and plant b genotoxicity decreased by 82 87 3 5 drivers of toxicity at both plants thms and haas constituted a majority of the quantified dbps contributing 22 26 of the tox at plant a and 10 43 of the tox at plant b across bac filter age while 64 75 at plant a and 32 83 at plant b remains unknown fig 3 and s8 classes of dbps that contributed the most to calculated cytotoxicity at plant a following bac were hals 72 86 and hans 8 16 where cal and dbal were the specific species responsible for 22 55 and 49 53 respectively of the calculated cytotoxicity following bac for plant b calculated cytotoxicity was driven by hals 68 79 hams 8 13 hans 5 8 and hnms 6 11 cal bcan and dcnm were the drivers of increased cytotoxicity in the oldest contactor of plant b while ndma continues to be a compound of concern for potential regulation it had less impact on calculated genotoxicity compared to other unregulated toxic dbps that formed at higher concentrations such as cal despite this a concentration of 50 80 ng l of ndma is considered significant especially when some states are considering regulations at 10 ng l hrudey et al 2013 while calculated genotoxicity decreased significantly following treatment with bac at both plants drivers of genotoxicity at plant a included hals 37 62 hnms 8 21 and haas 22 32 at plant b calculated genotoxicity in the bac influent was driven largely by baa 87 which was removed 90 following treatment with bac calculated genotoxicity then shifted to hals hams hans and hnms following a similar profile to calculated cytotoxicity these results are supported by previous studies indicating that unregulated dbps are predicted toxicity drivers in these types of systems krasner et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 cuthbertson et al 2019 while most of the dbps that increased in formation following bac likely formed by the reaction of chloramine with nom and bromide some dbps may have formed from other dbps on the bac surface for example an increase in cal formation was observed following bac treatment for plant a cal was a driver of calculated cytotoxicity and calculated genotoxicity for this drinking water following bac and chloramination it is possible that trihaloaldehydes were reduced and dehalogenated on the bac surface forming increased levels of cal this may be signified by the decrease of tcal following bac aldehydes may also form from higher molecular weight phenolic compounds that are not readily removed by bac filtration chuang et al 2019 dbal also increased following bac in plant a and contributed significantly to both calculated cytotoxicity 53 in the youngest filter and 49 in the oldest and genotoxicity 46 in the youngest filter and 38 in the oldest though its formation was not consistent these results highlight that the dbp concentration alone may not always provide an adequate basis for risk assessment 3 6 effectiveness of bac compared to gac in comparison to a similar study cuthbertson et al 2019 which analyzed three drinking water plants that employed gac with chlorination both gac and bac showed promising overall reductions of total dbp formation filter age had greater impacts in gac systems where the youngest gac filters performed best bac systems had less pronounced differences in dbp concentration between filter ages as the filters had reached steady state preformed dbps in both types of systems were well removed while some compounds were poorly removed or increased in either gac or bac for example thms are well removed in gac systems but were poorly removed by bac which is also supported by previous literature zainudin et al 2018 dbp formation and calculated toxicity is highly dependent on source water precursor material and disinfectant type making comparisons between plants difficult regardless both studies showed that total dbp reduction does not necessarily correlate with calculated toxicity calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was not driven by regulated dbps in either study 4 conclusions key findings of this study include most of the preformed regulated and unregulated dbps were removed by bac likely due to biodegradation bac reduced regulated and unregulated dbp precursors as determined by sds testing some dbp levels increased following bac chloroacetaldehyde dichloronitromethane bromodichloronitromethane ndma dibromochloromethane tribromomethane dibromochloroacetic acid and tribromoacetic acid following sds testing reductions in cytotoxicity across bac filters did not correlate with decreases in dbp concentrations bac showed promising reductions in calculated genotoxicity across 6 different bac filter ages while calculated cytotoxicity was more variable a large portion of total organic halogen remains unknown in chloraminated waters pre and post bac therefore future studies must include unknown analysis to close the mass balance on these systems the tic tox method is a useful comparative tool but it is based on in vitro toxicity studies and does not account for metabolism of these compounds future studies should include real toxicity measurements to assess whole water mixtures especially since quantified dbps only account for a portion of the overall tox declaration of

18146,biological activated carbon bac is widely used as a polishing step at full scale drinking water plants to remove taste and odor compounds and assimilable organic carbon bac especially with pre ozonation has been previously studied to control regulated disinfection by products dbps and dbp precursors however most previous studies only include regulated or a limited number of unregulated dbps this study explored two full scale drinking water plants that use pre chloramination followed by bac and chloramine as the final disinfectant while chloramine generally produces lower concentrations of regulated dbps it may form increased levels of unregulated nitrogenous and iodinated dbps we evaluated 71 dbps from ten dbp classes including haloacetonitriles haloacetamides halonitromethanes haloacetaldehydes haloketones iodinated acetic acids iodinated trihalomethanes nitrosamines trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids along with speciated total organic halogen total organic chlorine bromine and iodine across six different bac filters of increasing age most preformed dbps were well removed by bac with different ages i e operation times however some preformed dbps were poorly removed or increased following treatment with bac including chloroacetaldehyde dichloronitromethane bromodichloronitromethane n nitrosodimethylamine dibromochloromethane tribromomethane dibromochloroacetic acid and tribromoacetic acid some compounds including dibromoacetaldehyde bromochloroacetamide and dibromoacetamide were formed only after treatment with bac total organic halogen removal was variable in both plants and increases in tocl or toi were observable on one occasion at each plant while calculated genotoxicity decreased in all filters decreases in overall dbp formation did not correlate with decreases in calculated cytotoxicity in three of the six filters calculated toxicity increased by 4 27 these results highlight that dbp concentration alone may not always

dbps from the reaction of disinfectants with organic matter bromide and iodide present in water richardson 2011 several adverse health effects have been associated with dbps including bladder cancer colorectal cancer miscarriage and birth defects richardson et al 2007 cantor et al 2010 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 savitz et al 2005 villanueva et al 2004 2007 waller et al 1998 costet et al 2011 rahman et al 2007 the main chemical disinfectant used for drinking water is chlorine but to comply with dbp regulations in the u s many drinking water treatment plants have switched from chlorine to alternative disinfectants like chloramine zhang et al 2000 richardson et al 2008 chloramine is less reactive with dissolved organic matter dom compared to chlorine and therefore lowers the formation of regulated dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas seidel et al 2005 hua and reckhow 2007 allard et al 2015 however chloramine can form increased levels of more toxic unregulated iodinated and nitrogenous dbps i dbps and n dbps respectively mitch and sedlak 2002 choi and valentine 2002 plewa et al 2004 2008 krasner et al 2006 richardson et al 2008 chu et al 2013 huang et al 2012 n dbps are currently unregulated but they are often the driver for toxicity with regulated thms and haas accounting for only a small percentage of the toxicological effects bond et al 2012 plewa et al 2017 krasner et al 2016 cuthbertson et al 2019 n dbps include n nitrosodimethylamine ndma haloacetonitriles hans halonitromethanes hnms haloacetamides hams and cyanogen halides cx typically there are two ways in which chloramination is conducted either a free chlorine contact time is allowed before ammonia is added to form chloramines most common or chloramines are preformed before addition to water while in line preparation is common in wastewater treatment plants it is uncommon in drinking water treatment plants depending on the source water quality and treatment process a drinking plant employs varying concentrations of dbps can be formed for example one study showed that in water containing dom with low aromaticity higher levels of iodinated trihalomethanes i thms were formed when employing preformed monochloramine nh2cl while in water containing dom with higher aromaticity higher levels of i thms were formed when a free chlorine contact time was allowed allard et al 2015 jones et al 2011 while chloramination generally results in lower levels of total organic halogen tox than chlorination hua and reckhow 2007 it can increase total organic iodine toi levels kristiana et al 2009 in several studies measured dbp species accounted for only 30 of the tox in chloraminated drinking water krasner et al 2006 hua and reckhow 2007 kristiana et al 2009 tian et al 2013 in addition some studies have shown that known quantified dbps typically account for only a fraction of the overall toxicity of disinfected water and therefore it is widely suspected that unknown or unquantified tox contains toxicologically relevant dbps krasner et al 2006 hua and reckhow 2007 bull et al 2011 granular activated carbon gac can remove dom by both adsorption and biodegradation the dom adsorption process is a non steady state process in which the effluent concentrations of dom increases with time until all accessible adsorption sites are occupied for the biodegradable dom fractions a bio acclimation process is required which might last from a few weeks to several months zearley and summers 2012 after acclimation biodegradation is a steady state process when influent conditions are constant e g temperature ph servais et al 1994 after most of the adsorption capacity is exhausted biodegradation is the dominant dom removal mechanism and the gac process is often termed biological activated carbon bac shukairy and summers 1992 miltner et al 1992 operation in the bac mode has the advantage of not requiring gac change out and while effectively controlling biodegradable compounds including taste and odor compounds and a wide range of other organic compounds of concern ho et al 2007 suffet et al 1995 greenstein et al 2018 it is well established that a fraction of organic thm and haa precursors can be removed by biofilters including bac columns shukairy and summers 1992 miltner et al 1992 however in two studies bac yielded an increased dissolved organic nitrogen don to doc ratio resulting in higher formation of n dbps shukairy and summers 1992 chu et al 2012 there is some information on the effect of bac on the formation of unregulated dbps table s1 korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 liu et al 2017 liu et al 2017 zainudin et al 2018 hua and reckhow 2007 chuang et al 2015 kimura et al 2013 shah and mitch 2012 bond et al 2012 chu et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 however many unregulated dbps have not been studied one potential drawback of bac is that effluents can contain microbes soluble microbial products smps and extracellular polymeric substances eps excreted by microbes and released from the biofilm dead cells smps and eps may serve as dbp precursors particularly for n dbps krasner et al 2015 important parameters to consider for effective bac treatment include substrate concentration ph dissolved oxygen do biofilm thickness empty bed contact time ebct shear stress and backwash water quality with or without oxidant intensity and frequency some studies have shown that pre disinfection with chlorine chloramine chlorine dioxide or ozone can potentially decrease the removal efficiency of organic matter and may disturb or destroy the biofilm on the activated carbon at higher concentrations lechevallier and cawthon 1988 korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 furthermore eps may be produced by the biofilm as a protective response to chemical oxidants one study reported the critical residual chlorine concentration that does not have an adverse effect on biological activity was approximately 0 2 mg l lohwacharin et al 2015 korotta gamage and sathasivan 2017 another study showed that chloramine is more efficient in penetrating biofilms than free chlorine although they both show similar biocidal activity lechevallier and cawthon 1988 while there are many studies on the use of pre ozonation with bac only seven full scale studies evaluated the use of bac on the formation of dbps without pre ozonation liu et al 2017 price et al 1993 delatolla et al 2015 page et al 2016 zeng et al 2016a gerrity et al 2011 bukhari et al 2016 lyon et al 2014 vatankhah et al 2019 four of these studies evaluated a few unregulated dbps including nitrosamines gerrity et al 2015 bukhari et al 2016 page et al 2016 and a few haloketones haloacetaldehydes halonitromethanes haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides zha et al 2016 zeng et al 2016a liu et al 2017 the current study provided an opportunity to investigate the biodegradation capacity of bac with chloramine as the pre oxidant to degrade many unregulated bromo iodo and n dbps including many dbps that have not been previously investigated to the best of our knowledge no full scale studies have evaluated regulated and unregulated dbp formation along with tox in plants that carry a chloramine residual prior to bac without the use of pre ozonation as is the case with the full scale drinking plants evaluated in this study however a similar study from our group cuthbertson et al 2019 investigated the effectiveness of full scale gac systems to reduce tox and 70 regulated and unregulated dbps when free chlorine served as the disinfectant this study showed promising reductions in concentrations of regulated and unregulated dbps and that drivers of calculated toxicity were unlikely to be regulated dbps this study seeks to address the question of whether bac is effective in controlling toxic unregulated dbps and whether it impacts calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity from a dbp perspective the goals of this study were to assess the effectiveness of full scale bac treatment for controlling 1 dbps formed during pre chloramination 2 formation of dbps following final disinfection after treatment with bac 3 formation of speciated tox including total organic chlorine bromine and iodine tocl tobr toi and 4 calculated toxicity associated with quantified dbps 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling of drinking water treatment plants water samples were collected at two full scale plants in the united states that use chloramine for pre oxidation and as a secondary disinfectant for distribution dbp precursor control was evaluated across a range of bac service lives at each plant table s2 source waters of both plants were impacted by industry wastewater and agriculture both plants also use amine based polymers during coagulation which can impact the formation of n dbps wilczak et al 2003 zeng et al 2016c zhao et al 2017 formation of 71 regulated and unregulated dbps were studied in bench scale simulated distribution system sds tests for dbps from eight dbp classes haloacetonitriles hans haloacetamides hams halonitromethanes hnms haloacetaldehydes hals haloketones hks iodinated haloacetic acids iaas i thms nitrosamines ndma thms and haas to the best of our knowledge this is the first full scale study evaluating the removal of many of these dbps and their precursors in systems that employ bac tocl tobr and toi were also measured and compared to the total concentration of quantified dbps with the balance representing a quantitative measure of unknown or unquantified dbps krasner et al 2006 smith et al 2010 echigo et al 2000 daiber et al 2016 based on the available toxicity information for the 71 dbps quantified cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were calculated using the tic tox method plewa et al 2017 2 1 1 operational conditions for both plants the gac media had not been replaced for at least 1 year table s2 prior to sampling at plant a bac filters were typically operated at a loading rate of 1 5 gpm ft2 to achieve an ebct of 10 15 min in general 1 5 2 0 mg l as cl2 of chloramines were present in the bac feed water plant b operated under similar conditions typically bac filters were operated at a loading rate of 2 1 gpm ft2 with 2 0 4 0 mg l as cl2 of chloramines present in the feed water the gac media depth was similar to underlying sand media so the ebct of the bac was approximately 2 5 min process flow diagrams for plant a and b can be found in figs s1 and s2 in supplementary information si 2 1 2 simulated distribution system sds conditions in plant a

extraction and analysis of the remaining 57 dbps table s3 were conducted using previously published procedures allen et al 2017 kimura et al 2017 cuthbertson et al 2019 hals hans hks hnms i thms and

3 3 total organic halogen tox tocl tobr and toi were determined using a mitsubishi tox analyzer mitsubishi chemical analytech chigasaki japan cosa xentaur yaphank usa according to previously published procedures smith et al 2010 echigo et al 2000 daiber et al 2016 kimura et al 2017 with a few modifications described in text s2 allen et al 2017 2 3 4 water toxicity and percent tox calculations the contribution of each dbp class to tox was calculated by first multiplying the molar concentration of each compound that pertained to a specific dbp class by its corresponding number of halogens i e 1 4 halogen atoms these values were then added and this sum was divided by the sum molar concentration of tocl tobr and toi the water toxicity of each sample was based on the tic tox method published by plewa et al 2017 in brief the molar concentration of each dbp was multiplied by its corresponding cyto or genotoxicity index value in chinese hamster ovary cho cells available in the literature plewa et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 the total cyto and genotoxicity value for each water sample was the sum of all the measured dbps toxicity values all comparisons of compound concentrations were subjected to a two tailed t test with 1 degree of freedom d f at the 95 confidence interval ci to show statistical differences 3 results and discussion the use of pre chloramination provided an opportunity to study the adsorption and biodegradation of pre formed unregulated dbps directly using bac in real world conditions post final disinfection chloraminated influent samples simulate the concentration of dbps expected at a consumer s tap without the use of bac while chloraminated effluent samples simulate dbp concentrations with the use of bac since disinfection procedures were based on the plants dosing and distribution times this study provided an opportunity to assess realistic exposure concentrations many of these compounds have never been studied in full scale bac systems including i haas i hams and i thms to assess precursor removal chloramination sds procedures were conducted on settled influent samples and three different aged bac contactor effluents within each plant for a total of 6 full scale bac contactors table s2 3 1 removal of preformed dbps by bac at plant a 27 dbps formed at detectable levels during pre oxidation with chloramine table s5 while 24 were formed at plant b table s7 these included hals hams hans hks hnms i haas i thms ndma thms and haas fig s3 concentrations ranged from 5 ng l to 27 3 μg l at plant a the quantifiable dbps formed during pre oxidation accounted for approximately 14 32 of the tocl 37 97 of the tobr and 0 2 of the toi on a molar basis tox removal by bac showed mixed results in terms of concentration figs s3 and s4 bac treatment reduced tocl by 16 19 in the middle aged and oldest bac 93 500 and 140 200 bv but there was no removal of tocl in the youngest bac contactor 46 700 bv tobr removal was 7 21 and toi removal was 37 57 classes of compounds that were well removed include hals 71 88 hams 64 95 iaas 66 100 and haas 75 81 fig s3 also preformed ndma was well removed in both plant a 70 and plant b 83 87 hnms had mixed results with 83 removal in the youngest and middle aged filters but bdcnm concentrations increased in the oldest filter 140 200 bv at plant a dichloronitromethane dcnm was not removed at all and increased from 200 to 300 ng l in the oldest filter it is possible that reductive de halogenation of trichloronitromethane tcnm which was known to biodegrade resulted in the increased formation of dcnm yates et al 2015 li et al 2016 yin et al 2018 bromodichloronitromethane bdcnm also increased from 800 to 1000 ng l in the oldest filter another possibility is that chloramine in the influent feed water may react with precursors on the influent side of the bac filter forming dbps thm removal in plant a was limited to 2 5 with 0 3 removal of trichloromethane tcm and no removal of bromodichloromethane bdcm this is consistent with previous studies indicating poor biodegradation of some thms zainudin et al 2018 quantifiable dbps formed during pre oxidation at plant b table s7 accounted for 36 65 of the tocl 56 66 of the tobr and 1 of the toi bac showed limited removal of preformed tox 3 28 tocl 8 26 tobr and 0 37 toi removal fig s4 dbps that were well removed 70 100 at all bac contactor ages included trichloroacetaldehyde tcal bromodichloroacetaldehyde bdcal bromochloroacetamide bcam 1 1 dichloropropanone 11dcp tcnm chloroiodoacetic acid ciaa dichloroiodomethane dcim ndma bromoacetic acid baa dichloroacetic acid dcaa bromochloroacetic acid bcaa and tribromoacetic acid tbaa many n and i dbps had high removal with bac e g bcam tcnm ciaa dcim and ndma others were less readily removed 30 70 including dichloroacetamide dcam 1 1 1 trichloropropanone 111tcp 1 1 3 3 tetrachloropropanone 1133tecp bromochloromethane bcm trichloroacetic acid tcaa and bromodichloromethane bdcm compounds that were reduced less than 10 included dcnm bdcaa tcm and bdcm furthermore concentrations of some compounds increased following bac as eluded to earlier for plant a these included concentrations of dcnm which increased by 50 from 0 2 μg l and bdcnm which increased by 25 from 0 8 μg l in plant b concentrations of dibromochloromethane dbcm doubled in concentration in the middle and oldest contactors from 0 2 μg l and dibromochloroacetic acid dbcaa increased 63 in the youngest contactor from 0 8 μg l the presence of nitrifying bacteria in both plants as indicated by the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate table 1 may account for the increased formation of some n dbps following bac treatment including nitrosamines hans and hams zeng and mitch 2016b it is also possible that chloramine may be reacting with sorbed precursors on the bac another pilot study showed that increasing halogenation on haas decreased biodegradation rates in the presence of suspended bacteria zhou and xie 2002 for example chloroacetic acid caa had the highest biodegradation rates while tcaa had the slowest rates findings from this study show that the unregulated haas bdcaa and dbcaa have poor biodegradation capacity under full scale plant conditions for many of the quantified dbps including mono and di hals hams i thms and i haas and tri hnms including bdcnm and dibromochloronitromethane dbcnm this is the first time that their removal is reported using bac 3 2 removal of dbp precursors many dbps formed at similar concentrations during pre oxidation preformed and following simulated secondary disinfection for example in terms of molarity preformed dbps were between 65 and 86 of the total dbp formation following sds treatment at both plants tables s6 and s8 comparing the removal of preformed dbps with their formation following sds chloramination allows the determination of whether a dbp or a corresponding precursor is better removed for example at plant a preformed dcnm had the same concentration in the influent as in the youngest and middle aged filter effluents and then increased in the oldest bac filter effluent indicating that it is not well removed following sds treatment of both bac influent and effluent dcnm levels in the bac effluent were 50 of that in the bac influent indicating that the precursors for this compound were either removed by bac or that transformation of this compound occurred with increased chloramination treatment previous studies have shown that bac is efficient at removing low molecular weight mw natural organic matter nom including some dbp precursors as well as algal toxins ammonia and trace level organics but it is less effective for removing higher mw hydrophilic fractions compounds that formed only during sds treatment include tribromomethane tbm chloroacetaldehyde cal dibromoacetaldehyde dbal bromochloroacetonitrile bcan and dbcnm plant a and bromoacetic acid baa cal dichloroacetaldehyde dcal bcan bcam dibromoacetamide dbam and dcnm plant b several compounds were only observed after bac treatment and final disinfection including dbal 1 5 2 μg l bcam 0 2 0 4 μg l and dbam 0 2 0 6 μg l at plant a total preformed tox constituted approximately 93 135 of sds tox m with toi 160 283 preformed at plant b total preformed tox constituted 34 84 of the tox formed following sds treatment with toi 99 148 preformed i dbps can undergo base catalyzed hydrolysis zhu and zhang 2016 which may explain the loss of toi during sds conditions with relatively long holding times 3 3 impact of bac on dbp formation following sds treatment plants a and b achieved reductions in total dbp formation of 37 46 and 12 32 respectively fig 1 toc removal for these plants was relatively low and was similar for all filter ages with 8 11 and 4 5 toc removal for plants a and b respectively table 2 it is possible that some adsorption capacity of gac for dbp precursors was exhausted given the gac age table s2 total summed cl dbps were reduced 39 49 at plant a and 30 52 at plant b total summed n dbps levels decreased by 37 55 at plant a and by 32 62 at plant b total summed br dbp levels decreased by 25 30 at plant a and by 48 67 at plant b interestingly total i dbps had significant removal at plant a 90 indicating high removal for these compounds and their precurors these results complement a pilot study fu et al 2017 which showed significant reduction via biodegration of precursors for a subset of similar compounds including 36 unregulated dbps tocl tobr and toi sometimes increased following bac filtration and patterns did not match with reductions in quantified dbps fig 2 and s5 for example plant a had reductions of tocl tobr and toi of 19 31 15 26 and 22 28 respectively in the youngest 46 700 bv and middle aged bac 93 500 bv but toi levels increased slightly by 10 in the oldest bac 140 200 bv there was not a significant increase in the quantified i dbps suggesting the formation of unknown i dbps on the other hand plant b saw higher levels of tocl and tobr by 15 143 and 1 17 respectively following bac with a toi removal of 19 31 figs s5 and s7 in all three bacs the variation in the results for these two plants highlights how dynamic and difficult to predict bac systems can be it should be noted that neither facility used bac as a dbp compliance strategy but rather as a taste and odor control strategy while the formation of many dbps was reduced by bac some dbps were unaffected concentrations were not significantly different between bac influent and effluent after sds chloramination tables s6 and s8 in plant a these included dcam bcan and dcim some dbp levels increased following the use bac and chloramine including caa dbal cal bcam dbam bcan and ndma the increases of br and n dbps are consistent with earlier studies that showed increases in regulated brominated thms as well as more recent work by chiu et al 2012 krasner et al 2016 and cuthbertson et al 2019 who showed an increase in dban as a result of gac treatment at plant a there was a shift in speciation to more toxic br dbps following bac despite relatively stable br doc ratios for example dcal levels decreased and dbal formed with the use of bac while ndma levels decreased significantly following plant b sds 36 84 ndma increased after sds treatment following bac at plant a by 76 in the youngest filter 46 700 bv and by 10 in the oldest filter 140 200 bv from 50 to 88 and 55 ng l respectively plant a had significantly more don than plant b 0 74 0 86 mg l as n for plant a compared to mrl for plant b don precursors such as dimethylamine tertiary amines and quaternary amines can form significant amounts of ndma upon chloramination mitch and sedlak 2004 these types of precursors may also be released by the biofilms into effluent waters previous studies have also shown increases of nitrosamines through nitrification via the presence of nitrifying bacteria teng and mitch 2016 in both plants there was a dramatic decrease in ammonia with an accompanying increase in nitrite and nitrate after the use of bac table 1 a possible reason is that ammonia promotes the growth of nitrifying bacteria on the surface of gac which in turn converts ammonia to nitrite and nitrate vahala et al 1999 carrico et al 2008 nitrite and nitrate have been shown to be important precursors in the formation of many dbps including halonitromethanes trihalomethanes and cyanogen chloride choi and richardson 2004 lyon et al 2012 this may partially explain increases in n dbps e g bcam dbam bcan and ndma following bac in these plants 3 4 calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity given the concerns for the formation of more toxic br i and n dbps with chloramine along with increased don doc ratios found in waters treated with bac it is important to assess whether water treated in this manner is in fact safer to address this question we used an approach termed tic tox in which the concentration of each dbp is multiplied by corresponding cytotoxicity and genotoxicity index values reported in the literature plewa et al 2017 wagner and plewa 2017 this method has been used in several published studies to assess potential toxicity of treated waters plewa et al 2017 smith et al 2010 allard et al 2015 krasner et al 2016 cuthbertson et al 2019 the total calculated water toxicity and percent contribution by dbp class for both plants analyzed in this study are shown in figs 1 and 3 and s8 tic tox is useful as a screening test to prioritize dbps for additional toxicity testing and can be used to identify potential trade offs in treatment however these tradeoffs should be considered possible only when supported by real toxicity data 3 4 1 calculated toxicity for preformed dbps in bac influent and effluent preformed calculated cytotoxicity at plant a was reduced by 45 87 while calculated genotoxicity was reduced 37 94 over the lifetime of the bac filters at plant b preformed calculated cytotoxicity was reduced by 77 80 across bac filter lifetime and calculated genotoxicity was reduced 60 85 preformed calculated toxicity was driven by hnms and haas at plant a and hams hnms and haas in plant b at plant a preformed calculated cytotoxicity accounted for 39 of the sds cytotoxicity in the influent but only 4 21 of the calculated cytotoxicity following treatment with bac at plant b preformed calculated cytotoxicity only accounted for 10 of the influent water and 2 3 of the bac effluents 3 4 2 calculated toxicity for dbps following sds testing calculated cytotoxicity at both bac plants following sds treatment showed mixed results with both increases and decreases in calculated cytotoxicity following bac treatment and with no apparent correlation to gac age fig 1 at plant a calculated cytotoxicity increased in the youngest filter 46 700 bv by 27 decreased by 37 in the middle aged filter 93 500 bv and remained virtually unchanged in the oldest filter 140 200 bv with a slight increase of 4 these increases of calculated toxicity at plant a occurred despite a total reduction in quantified dbp levels of 30 35 indicating shifts to more toxic dbps following treatment with bac plant b had calculated cytotoxicity reductions of 1 22 in the youngest 157 400 bv and middle aged filter 333 200 bv but a slight increase of 9 in the oldest contactor 555 300 bvs the variations in the results for these two plants indicate these types of bac systems should be studied further the calculated genotoxicity decreased at both plants in all six filters and regardless of bac age a promising result plant a saw a decrease of calculated genotoxicity by 38 65 and plant b genotoxicity decreased by 82 87 3 5 drivers of toxicity at both plants thms and haas constituted a majority of the quantified dbps contributing 22 26 of the tox at plant a and 10 43 of the tox at plant b across bac filter age while 64 75 at plant a and 32 83 at plant b remains unknown fig 3 and s8 classes of dbps that contributed the most to calculated cytotoxicity at plant a following bac were hals 72 86 and hans 8 16 where cal and dbal were the specific species responsible for 22 55 and 49 53 respectively of the calculated cytotoxicity following bac for plant b calculated cytotoxicity was driven by hals 68 79 hams 8 13 hans 5 8 and hnms 6 11 cal bcan and dcnm were the drivers of increased cytotoxicity in the oldest contactor of plant b while ndma continues to be a compound of concern for potential regulation it had less impact on calculated genotoxicity compared to other unregulated toxic dbps that formed at higher concentrations such as cal despite this a concentration of 50 80 ng l of ndma is considered significant especially when some states are considering regulations at 10 ng l hrudey et al 2013 while calculated genotoxicity decreased significantly following treatment with bac at both plants drivers of genotoxicity at plant a included hals 37 62 hnms 8 21 and haas 22 32 at plant b calculated genotoxicity in the bac influent was driven largely by baa 87 which was removed 90 following treatment with bac calculated genotoxicity then shifted to hals hams hans and hnms following a similar profile to calculated cytotoxicity these results are supported by previous studies indicating that unregulated dbps are predicted toxicity drivers in these types of systems krasner et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 cuthbertson et al 2019 while most of the dbps that increased in formation following bac likely formed by the reaction of chloramine with nom and bromide some dbps may have formed from other dbps on the bac surface for example an increase in cal formation was observed following bac treatment for plant a cal was a driver of calculated cytotoxicity and calculated genotoxicity for this drinking water following bac and chloramination it is possible that trihaloaldehydes were reduced and dehalogenated on the bac surface forming increased levels of cal this may be signified by the decrease of tcal following bac aldehydes may also form from higher molecular weight phenolic compounds that are not readily removed by bac filtration chuang et al 2019 dbal also increased following bac in plant a and contributed significantly to both calculated cytotoxicity 53 in the youngest filter and 49 in the oldest and genotoxicity 46 in the youngest filter and 38 in the oldest though its formation was not consistent these results highlight that the dbp concentration alone may not always provide an adequate basis for risk assessment 3 6 effectiveness of bac compared to gac in comparison to a similar study cuthbertson et al 2019 which analyzed three drinking water plants that employed gac with chlorination both gac and bac showed promising overall reductions of total dbp formation filter age had greater impacts in gac systems where the youngest gac filters performed best bac systems had less pronounced differences in dbp concentration between filter ages as the filters had reached steady state preformed dbps in both types of systems were well removed while some compounds were poorly removed or increased in either gac or bac for example thms are well removed in gac systems but were poorly removed by bac which is also supported by previous literature zainudin et al 2018 dbp formation and calculated toxicity is highly dependent on source water precursor material and disinfectant type making comparisons between plants difficult regardless both studies showed that total dbp reduction does not necessarily correlate with calculated toxicity calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity was not driven by regulated dbps in either study 4 conclusions key findings of this study include most of the preformed regulated and unregulated dbps were removed by bac likely due to biodegradation bac reduced regulated and unregulated dbp precursors as determined by sds testing some dbp levels increased following bac chloroacetaldehyde dichloronitromethane bromodichloronitromethane ndma dibromochloromethane tribromomethane dibromochloroacetic acid and tribromoacetic acid following sds testing reductions in cytotoxicity across bac filters did not correlate with decreases in dbp concentrations bac showed promising reductions in calculated genotoxicity across 6 different bac filter ages while calculated cytotoxicity was more variable a large portion of total organic halogen remains unknown in chloraminated waters pre and post bac therefore future studies must include unknown analysis to close the mass balance on these systems the tic tox method is a useful comparative tool but it is based on in vitro toxicity studies and does not account for metabolism of these compounds future studies should include real toxicity measurements to assess whole water mixtures especially since quantified dbps only account for a portion of the overall tox declaration of

18147,the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater effluents is recognized as the main factor limiting the adsorption of organic micropollutants omps onto activated carbon the degree of the negative effect that dom depending on its quality exerts on omps adsorption is still unclear the influence of the interactions between dom and omps on their removal is also not fully understood adsorption isotherms and conventional batch tests were performed in ultra pure water and in wastewater effluent to study the influence of dom on the adsorption of 12 omps onto powdered activated carbon best fit of adsorption pseudo isotherms was obtained with the freundlich equation and showed as expected that omps adsorption was higher in ultra pure water than in wastewater effluent due to the presence of dom leading to pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites lc ocd analysis revealed that biopolymers and hydrophobic molecules were the most adsorbed fractions while humic acids were not removed after a contact time of either 30 min or 72 h the presence of dom had a negative impact on the removal of all omps after 30 min of adsorption but similar removals to ultra pure water were obtained for 6 omps after 72 h of adsorption this demonstrated that competition between dom and omps for adsorption sites was not a major mechanism as compared to pore blockage which only slowed down the adsorption and did not prevent it the charge of omps had a clear impact the adsorption of negatively charged compounds was reduced in the presence of wastewater effluent due to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed dom and the pac surface on the other hand the removal of positively charged compounds was improved a 24 h pre equilibrium between omps and dom improved their removal onto pac which suggest that omps and dom interacted in solution which decreased the negative effects caused by the presence of dom e g through co adsorption of an omp dom complex

range of compounds and of being easy to use and flexible with no risk of toxic byproducts generation kårelid et al 2017 mailler et al 2016a 2015 meinel et al 2015 adsorption is a complex process driven by the properties of omps and the properties of activated carbon and is also influenced by the water quality mainly the presence of dissolved organic matter dom some authors proposed that activated carbon adsorption was driven by the hydrophobicity of omps de ridder et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2005 but this was mostly observed for neutral compounds and not for charged compounds de ridder et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2015 margot et al 2013 dom affects the adsorption of omps onto activated carbon through direct competition for available surface adsorption sites and pore blockage depending on its nature i e average molecular weight hydrophobicity and the activated carbon porosity newcombe et al 1997 newcombe et al 2002 reported that low molecular weight dom 200 da reduced the equilibrium adsorption capacity of 2 methylisoborneol by competition for adsorption sites and blockage of micropores the medium 200 600 da and high molecular weight dom 1000 da could not access micropores but reduced the adsorption rate by restricting direct access to adsorption sites through macro and mesopores necessitating a more tortuous diffusion path for 2 methylisoborneol omps can also interact through electrostatic attraction repulsion van der waals π π or hydrogen bonds with dom interactions between dom and omps in the dissolved phase were observed during the treatment of effluents by membrane filtration leading to an increase of omps rejection majewska nowak et al 2002 tödtheide et al 1997 many studies have been conducted on the interactions between pesticides and dom caupos et al 2015 ilani et al 2005 lee et al 2003 but little data is available for other omp families such as pharmaceuticals hernandez ruiz et al 2012 demonstrated that bisphenol a could interact with microbial byproduct like and humic acid like dom components from wastewater and carbamazepine and ibuprofen with fulvic acid like components the influence of these interactions on the adsorption by activated carbon has been barely studied especially with wastewater dom jin et al 2018 observed that zwitterionic compounds could interact with humic acids in solution be adsorbed onto activated carbon and also interact with humic acids adsorbed on the activated carbon surface the presence of humic acids increased the removal of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin thanks to interactions with humic acids which trapped omps however these interactions between omps and dom were observed under specific conditions low dose of activated carbon and very high concentrations of dom and omps that are not representative of the real conditions encountered in drinking water plants or wastewater treatment plants only a few studies were conducted to assess the influence of dom originating from wastewater effluents on the adsorption of omps onto activated carbon wastewater dom is a complex mixture generally considered to be composed of large organic molecules biopolymers humic substances and building blocks and smaller molecules low molecular weight acids and neutrals de ridder et al 2011 pernet coudrier et al 2008 some authors proposed that the main negative effect of dom was the competition for adsorption sites rather than pore blockage zietzschmann et al 2014 fractionated dom using nanofiltration and obtained a lower adsorption of 5 omps in the presence of low molecular weight dom competition for adsorption sites phenomenon compared to raw and high molecular weight dom pore blockage phenomenon they reported that the impact of the small dom molecules was more important for medium and weakly adsorbing omps moreover the dom adsorbed onto the activated carbon is globally negatively charged at the ph of the wastewater and can decrease the adsorption of negatively charged omps through repulsive electrostatic interactions de ridder et al 2011 a negative influence of dom on the adsorption of negatively charged compounds was also observed by hu et al 2016 alves et al 2018 reported that in the absence of dom the textural properties i e the porosity of micro grain activated carbons μgacs played the most important role in the adsorption of omps while in the presence of dom the surface chemistry of μgacs i e point of zero charge surface functional groups had a predominant impact and positively charged compounds were better removed while the negative effect of dom on omps adsorption is known the degree of this effect i e quantification of the decrease in adsorption rates in relation to the dom composition is still unclear the influence of omps dom interactions on omps adsorption is also not fully understood and was not comprehensively studied in conditions close to realistic wastewater treatment applications i e synthetic water low omps concentrations and activated carbon doses in this context the present work evaluated the adsorption of 12 omps onto powdered activated carbon pac under various conditions by following 3 approaches as a first step short term adsorption capacity at various concentrations of the 12 omps i e pseudo isotherms was evaluated in two different matrices ultra pure water and wastewater effluent to assess the influence of dom on omps removal batch tests in ultra pure and wastewater effluent were then performed at short and long contact times with pac 30 min and 72 h to compare the short term capacity with a long term adsorption equilibrium and thus to characterize the underlying adsorption mechanisms dom adsorption was examined in parallel through lc ocd uv254 and fluorescence excitation emission analyses to better understand its adsorption and its effect on omps removal finally the influence of a pre equilibrium between omps and dom before adsorption was examined to study the possible interactions between omps and dom the links between omps physico chemical properties and their adsorption were discussed for each experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials wastewater effluent samples were punctually collected from the seine centre wwtp siaap colombes france treating wastewater of about 800 000 inhabitant equivalents with a flow of 240 000 m3 day after pre treatment screening grit and oil removal a physico chemical lamellar settling unit removes particles and colloids 3 biofiltration stages remove nutrients then the effluent is discharged into the seine river rocher et al 2012 the ph of the wastewater effluent ranges from 7 8 to 8 siaap data the pac used for all adsorption experiments was pb 170 dacarb see physico chemical properties summarized in table s1 and was previously studied in a large scale pilot and in batch experiments mailler et al 2016b 2015 organic micropollutants were purchased from sigma aldrich and their physico chemical properties are described in table 1 molecular weight hydrophobicity log d and charge and table s2 van der waals volume minimal projection area polar surface area and hydrogen bonds 2 2 experimental methods the 12 employed omps table 1 were selected based on their occurrence and concentrations in parisian wastewater effluents mailler et al 2015 they were commonly found in wwtp effluents and present a broad range of physical and chemical properties i e charge size hydrophobicity short term adsorption capacity of the 12 omps was studied after 30 min at room temperature 20 c and at 8 different concentrations ranging from 0 04 1 7 μg l to 1 2 52 μg l depending on the omps concentrations c1 c8 in table s3 in ultra pure water ph adjusted to 8 0 and wastewater effluent resulting in pseudo isotherm curves since an adsorption isotherm is assumed to be obtained at reaction equilibrium which was not reached after 30 min experiment 1 the freundlich equation freundlich 1906 was used to model adsorption pseudo isotherms equation 1 1 q t k f c t 1 n where q t μg mg is the amount of adsorbate uptake k f μg mg μg l 1 n is the freundlich constant c t μg l is the adsorbate concentration and 1 n dimensionless is the freundlich intensity parameter related to the intensity of the adsorption driving force or the surface heterogeneity the modelling parameters k f and 1 n and p values from the student test were obtained for each omp and each matrix ultra pure water or wastewater effluent via non linear least squares regression with the nlstools package baty et al 2015 using r software r core team 2007 the influence of contact time was studied by conducting comparative adsorption tests in ultra pure water and wastewater effluent during 30 min and 72 h at an average omps concentration 0 48 20 μg l depending on the omps concentration c5 in table s3 experiment 2 doc dom fractions from lc ocd chromatograms uv254 and the intensity of 6 fluorescence indexes from excitation emission matrices were determined before and after adsorption finally adsorption experiments were performed with and without a 24 h pre equilibrium between the wastewater effluent and spiked omps at the lowest working concentrations i e 0 04 1 7 μg l depending on the omps concentration c1 in table s3 to study the influence of the contact between dom and omps prior to adsorption during 30 min and 72 h experiment 3 a dose of 10 mg l of pac was added to the working solutions during all the experiments this dose was previously demonstrated to maximize differences between molecules in terms of removal which allows the observation of relationships between physico chemical properties of omps and their removal mailler et al 2016b experiments were conducted only one time because previous results indicated that the variability of omps removal was low 10 in similar conditions guillossou et al 2020 batch systems were placed under strong stirring during the required contact time pre determined volumes of the stock solution containing the 12 omps were spiked in working solutions of 1 5 l to reach the targeted concentrations for each experiment volumes of the spiked solution were chosen to maintain a low percentage of solvent methanol added to the working solution 0 05 the targeted concentrations of omps in the working solution were chosen to ensure that all omps were not completely adsorbed onto the pac after the chosen contact times and that residual concentrations were above limits of quantification loq table 1 unless specifically mentioned omps were always spiked in the wastewater effluent 24 h prior to pac addition to simulate the interactions between dom and omps occurring during sewer transfer and inside wwtps 2 3 analytical procedures omps were analyzed within 48 h at the institute of analytical sciences isa villeurbanne france by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy prior to analysis all samples were homogenized and filtered on 0 7 μm gf f glass filters whatman more information on the analytical methods can be found in the literature vulliet et al 2011 loqs of the 12 omps ranged between 0 5 and 6 ng l table 1 if the concentration of some pharmaceuticals was below the loq after adsorption their removal from the liquid phase and the quantity adsorbed onto the solid phase were estimated as if their concentration was equal to loq 2 dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed for each experiment by the certified siaap laboratory after filtration on 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride filters milex merck limit of quantification 0 3 mgc l liquid size exclusion chromatography was coupled with organic carbon detection lc ocd doc labor dr huber germany to study the adsorption of different dom

from 240 nm to 450 nm with an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths ranging from 250 nm to 600 nm with an interval of 2 nm when uv254 was higher than 0 080 1 cm the samples were diluted with ultrapure water to avoid inner filter effects due to adsorbing species present in the wastewater alberts and takács 2004 eems of ultrapure water were subtracted from the sample eems which were also normalized by the raman peak of ultrapure water excitation wavelength of 350 nm to obtain fluorescence data in raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 eems were characterized by using a set of

a recent biological activity and c5 360 434 nm and c6 275 464 nm to humic like compounds 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption pseudo isotherms pseudo isotherms representing the short term 30 min adsorption capacity of omps in each matrix are presented in fig 1 and the best fit isotherms parameters are summarized in table 2 experiment 1 most pseudo isotherms were correctly fitted with the freundlich equation student test p value 0 05 for the estimated k f or 1 n in ultra pure water only lorazepam could not be fitted by the freundlich equation because no residual concentration was detected in most bottles after 30 min of contact time in wastewater effluent diclofenac ibuprofen oxazepam and roxithromycin were not correctly fitted p value 0 05 for the estimated k f or 1 n and their freundlich parameters were therefore not reported in table 2 as expected the adsorption capacity i e q t value for a given initial concentration was systematically higher in ultra pure water than in wastewater effluent for all omps and all freundlich constants k f obtained after fitting the data were higher in ultra pure water than in wastewater effluent accordingly for most omps the freundlich intensity parameter 1 n was also higher in wastewater effluent than in ultra pure water which shows that the presence of dom makes adsorption less favorable the freundlich intensity parameter was lower in wastewater effluent than in ultra pure water only for carbamazepine and ofloxacin this could be due to modelling issues because of analytical errors at some concentrations leading to shifted points on the isotherm c t and q t values the adsorption isotherm is favorable when 1 n 1 which suggests a good affinity between the adsorbate and the adsorbent i e chemisorption while it is unfavorable when 1 n 1 the first adsorbate molecules are hardly adsorbed but improve the adsorption of the following probably through multilayer adsorption favorized by van der waals interactions i e physisorption the adsorption of sulfadiazine was unfavorable 1 n 1 44 and the adsorption of erythromycin and lorazepam was almost linear 1 n 0 98 and 1 05 respectively erythromycin is positively charged and one of the largest molecules mw 700 g mol and could be more impacted by the presence of dom i e by pore blockage and steric hindrance attractive electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged dom were probably not sufficient to counterbalance pore blockage sulfadiazine is negatively charged and thus was probably subjected to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed dom as well as diclofenac and ibuprofen no correlation was obtained between freundlich parameters and any physico chemical property of the 12 omps table 1 and table s2 suggesting that the adsorption of omps depends on various mechanisms and parameters governing their affinity with the pac and also their interactions with the dom both present in solution and adsorbed at the surface of the activated carbon 3 2 influence of the contact time with pac 3 2 1 dom adsorption doc removal was low 4 after 30 min of adsorption and close to values obtained in a previous study mailler et al 2016b table 3 experiment 2 the doc removal was higher after 72 h 15 but was still low despite a longer contact time lc ocd analyses see fig 2 showed that the wastewater effluent dom was mainly composed of humic like substances 2 58 mgc l followed by biopolymers building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals 1 26 1 38 mgc l and to a lesser extent of hydrophobic molecules 0 75 mgc l only biopolymers especially the smallest biopolymers eluted at 33 40 min of retention time were significantly removed after 30 min of adsorption 11 while almost no removal 3 was observed for humic acids building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals the hydrophobic fraction which is the remaining fraction of doc retained on the chromatographic column and not eluted reached similar removal as biopolymers 8 these results show that only specific dom fractions are adsorbed and are thus responsible for the mechanisms preventing omps adsorption and occurring at the surface of the ac i e competition for adsorption sites and pore blockage the removal of most dom fractions increased after a 72 h contact time with pac the most adsorbed fractions were again biopolymers 34 and hydrophobic molecules 32 followed by building blocks 10 and low molecular weight neutrals 14 however humic acids were still not removed 2 despite being the main dom fraction the lc ocd effluent profile shows a much lower proportion of humic like substances compared to a natural water schulz et al 2017 and conventional wastewater profile zietzschmann et al 2014 and humic acid adsorption was more important in these two studies the lower adsorption in this study could be due to the presence of biopolymers unlike the other studies which are much larger and could hinder the diffusion of humic acids to the adsorption sites the difference in pac used could also explain the observed differences for the adsorption of humic acids particularly the point of zero charge a removal of 12 was obtained for uv254 after 30 min of adsorption while the intensity of fluorescence indexes was slightly more affected 15 18 except for the index c6 6 after 72 h of adsorption the decrease in uv254 intensity 24 and fluorescence indexes 34 46 was in agreement with the higher removal of dom observed from doc and lc ocd measurements however at both contact time the decrease in uv254 intensity and fluorescence indexes was proportionally higher than the removal of doc and dom fractions especially 3 fluorescence indexes related to humic substances i e c4 c5 c6 exhibited a decrease higher than 30 after 72 h of adsorption while only 2 of humic acids as analyzed by lc ocd were removed fluorescing molecules represent a very small portion of the dom wünsch et al 2015 and these results indicate that they were preferentially adsorbed as compared to the bulk of humic substances 3 2 2 omps removal the removal of omps by activated carbon was determined after 30 min and 72 h of contact time in ultra pure water and wastewater effluent table 4 experiment 2 in ultra pure water removals were important 94 and similar between 30 min and 72 h less than 6 difference for almost all omps with the exception of diclofenac 89 and 97 at 30 min and 72 h respectively and ofloxacin 77 and 91 respectively diclofenac and ofloxacin being negatively charged compounds their lower removal at 30 min was possibly due to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged pac phpzc 5 0 however ibuprofen and sulfadiazine are also negatively charged molecules but their removal was not affected which suggests that other mechanisms favored their adsorption ofloxacin has a higher mw than ibuprofen and sulfadiazine and diclofenac comprises large chlorine atoms so differences in the diffusion rates into the activated carbon pores due to both repulsive interactions and steric hindrance effects may explain the various removals obtained for these negatively charged compounds in the wastewater effluent and after 30 min removals were low 40 except for atenolol and carbamazepine 60 and 57 respectively these low removals could be attributed to pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites caused by the presence of dom biopolymers consisting of very large molecules 10 kda were the main dom fraction adsorbed onto pac and thus are potentially responsible for the pore blockage the hydrophobic fraction of dom which was also better adsorbed onto pac and can be considered in the case of wastewater as a mixture of lipids fatty acids and lipopolysaccharides of various sizes could also be responsible of pore blockage but also competition for adsorption sites the positively charged and the neutral compounds were better removed than the negatively charged compounds average removal of 40 30 and 10 respectively as already observed in ultra pure water the occurrence of repulsive interactions between anionic omps and the negatively charged pac surface can explain these results and these interactions can be intensified by the negatively charged dom adsorbed onto pac conversely the better adsorption of atenolol presenting a positive charge at the ph of the wastewater effluent could be attributed to attractive electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged pac surface and the adsorbed dom erythromycin and roxithromycin were again poorly removed because of steric hindrance with the dom adsorbed in the pac pores after 72 h the removal of all omps increased and the highest removals ranging from 86 to 99 were achieved for atenolol carbamazepine erythromycin ofloxacin roxithromycin and trimethoprim which indicates that as expected 30 min of contact time was not sufficient to reach the equilibrium the difference between adsorption rates at 30 min and 72 h suggests that for these 6 compounds the negative effect of dom was negligible and that the adsorbed fractions of dom which should exacerbate higher pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites did not prevent their adsorption in the long term the access to adsorption sites was thus not totally prevented by dom and no competition inside the pores occurred in the long term another possible mechanism is the formation of dom omps complexes that are progressively adsorbed onto the pac surface pore blockage was thus the main negative effect of dom inhibiting the adsorption of these omps at 30 min which was finally counterbalanced by their slow diffusion either through the adsorbed dom or inside pac pores the removal of the 6 other omps was lower which indicates that dom still had a negative effect on their adsorption either by pore blockage competition for adsorption sites or electrostatic repulsion from dom moieties the positively charged and the neutral compounds were better removed than the negatively charged compounds average removal of 95 75 and 42 respectively erythromycin and roxithromycin were well removed despite their size probably because of attractive interactions with both the adsorbed dom and the pac rather than diffusion into the pac pores on the contrary low removals ranging from 24 to 31 were still observed for the negatively charged compounds diclofenac ibuprofen and sulfadiazine and may be attributed to repulsive electrostatic interactions with both the adsorbed dom and the pac in addition to competition for adsorption sites even after a longer contact time the presence of dom had a higher negative effect on the adsorption of negatively charged compounds despite its predominant negative charge ofloxacin was well removed in the presence of dom 86 after 72 h and it could be due to interactions with dom favored by its high polar surface and number of possible hydrogen bonds in comparison to other negative omps no trend was observed between the physical and chemical properties of neutral pharmaceuticals and their removals after 30 min and 72 h 3 3 influence of the pre equilibrium between dom and omps on adsorption the removal of omps by adsorption onto pac for 30 min and 72 h was examined with and without a pre equilibrium time of 24 h between the wastewater effluent and omps table 5 experiment 3 the 24 h pre equilibrium between dom and omps increased the removal of all omps after 30 min of adsorption the increase was particularly high for lorazepam 38 but also acetaminophen 26 diclofenac 27 and roxithromycin 22 which were poorly or not removed without precontact with dom 0 11 a significant increase was observed for atenolol 15 erythromycin 15 ibuprofen 13 oxazepam 18 sulfadiazine 13 and trimethoprim 14 these omps were also poorly removed without a pre equilibrium with dom 4 23 except atenolol 34 and trimethoprim 45 however the pre equilibrium with dom had little impact on the removal of carbamazepine 7 and ofloxacin 8 which were already well adsorbed without a pre equilibrium with dom 41 and 47 respectively those results confirm that omps and dom interacted in solution such association between omps and dom through hydrophobic hydrogen bonding van der waals or dipole dipole interactions has been extensively studied especially with natural organic matter caupos et al 2015 hernandez ruiz et al 2012 mott 2002 its influence on the adsorption of omps specifically onto activated carbon is however scarcely documented some studies demonstrated that dom prevent the adsorption of organic compounds on river or wastewater particles but this effect could not be attributed to either dom omp association in solution or to competitive adsorption hassett and anderson 1982 the co adsorption of dom and hydrophobic organic compounds has been reported at the surface of mineral materials e g clay kaolinite and found to be enhanced by ionic strength i e the presence of divalent cations brunk et al 1996 wu et al 2011 one study reported the enhanced adsorption of pentachlorophenol by pac after a 3 day pre equilibrium with fulvic acids which was attributed to binding at the surface of pac or to the modification of pac surface properties by fulvic acid adsorption lafrance et al 1991 our results demonstrate that the dom omp complexes formed after some pre equilibration time could be subsequently adsorbed onto the pac the pre equilibrium with dom thus balances the negative effects caused by dom presence further investigations would be needed to determine the potential role of inorganic ions present in wastewater effluents on the formation of these dom omp complexes and their adsorption the precontact of 24 h between dom and omps had no impact on the removal of most omps after 72 h of adsorption an increase was only observed for ibuprofen 28 and sulfadiazine 36 and in a lesser extent for lorazepam 9 and roxithromycine 8 the removal of these 4 omps after 72 h of adsorption and without a precontact with dom was low 16 68 in comparison to the other omps 77 98 which didn t need interactions with dom to be well adsorbed these results suggest that the precontact time between dom and omps occurring during sewer transfer and inside wwtps therefore the processes used for primary and biological treatment could have an impact on omps removal by activated carbon adsorption dom omps complexes could also be formed at the surface of the pac after long contact times allowing the high removals obtained after 72 h even without the 24 h pre equilibrium these results also imply that a pre equilibrium time between dom and omps may be necessary in laboratory experiments when omps are spiked e g adsorption isotherms in order to have similar dom omps interactions to what can be expected in wastewater effluents 4 conclusion adsorption pseudo isotherms showed as expected that omps adsorption was higher in ultra pure water than in wastewater effluent due to the presence of dom leading to pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites various molecular properties e g charge mw solubility hydrophobicity are involved in the adsorption mechanisms of omps leading to differences in the adsorption capacity of different omps lc ocd analysis revealed that biopolymers and hydrophobic molecules were the two major fractions of dom adsorbed on the pac 30 after 72 h other fractions were adsorbed after a contact time of 72 h 10 except humic acids despite being the main dom fraction the removal of dom as analyzed by uv254 and fluorescence indexes was higher than the removal calculated from lc ocd analyses which could be explained by different adsorption behaviors between the spectroscopically active dom and the non active one the presence of dom had a negative impact on the removal of all omps after 30 min of adsorption but similar removals to ultra pure water were obtained after a contact time of 72 h for 6 omps a sufficient contact time was thus able to allow high removals of these omps despite an increase of dom adsorption either by slow diffusion of omps through the adsorbed dom or the pac pores another possible mechanism is the formation of dom omps complexes that are progressively adsorbed at the pac surface competition for adsorption sites is thus not always the main negative effect in the presence of dom pore blockage due to the adsorption of biopolymers hydrophobic molecules of dom first strongly prevents the adsorption of omps but is compensated at longer contact times by the potential mechanisms described above omps charge had an impact on their adsorption both in the presence and absence of dom the adsorption rate of negatively charged compounds in the presence of wastewater effluent was reduced due to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed dom and the pac surface i e both negatively charged positively charged compounds were globally better adsorbed possibly due to attractive electrostatic interactions but steric hindrance hindered the adsorption rate of some large molecules a pre equilibrium of 24 h between omps and dom improved their removal onto pac which confirm that omps and dom interact in solution these results are in accordance with the formation of dom omps complexes in solution which increased the overall removal of omps especially at short contact times additional studies should be conducted to identify the nature of the interactions between dom and omps to determine the influence of various pre equilibrium times i e a kinetic study

18147,the presence of dissolved organic matter dom in wastewater effluents is recognized as the main factor limiting the adsorption of organic micropollutants omps onto activated carbon the degree of the negative effect that dom depending on its quality exerts on omps adsorption is still unclear the influence of the interactions between dom and omps on their removal is also not fully understood adsorption isotherms and conventional batch tests were performed in ultra pure water and in wastewater effluent to study the influence of dom on the adsorption of 12 omps onto powdered activated carbon best fit of adsorption pseudo isotherms was obtained with the freundlich equation and showed as expected that omps adsorption was higher in ultra pure water than in wastewater effluent due to the presence of dom leading to pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites lc ocd analysis revealed that biopolymers and hydrophobic molecules were the most adsorbed fractions while humic acids were not removed after a contact time of either 30 min or 72 h the presence of dom had a negative impact on the removal of all omps after 30 min of adsorption but similar removals to ultra pure water were obtained for 6 omps after 72 h of adsorption this demonstrated that competition between dom and omps for adsorption sites was not a major mechanism as compared to pore blockage which only slowed down the adsorption and did not prevent it the charge of omps had a clear impact the adsorption of negatively charged compounds was reduced in the presence of wastewater effluent due to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed dom and the pac surface on the other hand the removal of positively charged compounds was improved a 24 h pre equilibrium between omps and dom improved their removal onto pac which suggest that omps and dom interacted in solution which decreased the negative effects caused by the presence of dom e g through co adsorption of an omp dom complex

such as ozonation are gaining interest for wastewater treatment altmann et al 2014 bourgin et al 2018 margot et al 2013 activated carbon adsorption offers the advantage of being able to remove a wide range of compounds and of being easy to use and flexible with no risk of toxic byproducts generation kårelid et al 2017 mailler et al 2016a 2015 meinel et al 2015 adsorption is a complex process driven by the properties of omps and the properties of activated carbon and is also influenced by the water quality mainly the presence of dissolved organic matter dom some authors proposed that activated carbon adsorption was driven by the hydrophobicity of omps de ridder et al 2010 westerhoff et al 2005 but this was mostly observed for neutral compounds and not for charged compounds de ridder et al 2011 kovalova et al 2013 mailler et al 2015 margot et al 2013 dom affects the adsorption of omps onto activated carbon through direct competition for available surface adsorption sites and pore blockage depending on its nature i e average molecular weight hydrophobicity and the activated carbon porosity newcombe et al 1997 newcombe et al 2002 reported that low molecular weight dom 200 da reduced the equilibrium adsorption capacity of 2 methylisoborneol by competition for adsorption sites and blockage of micropores the medium 200 600 da and high molecular weight dom 1000 da could not access micropores but reduced the adsorption rate by restricting direct access to adsorption sites through macro and mesopores necessitating a more tortuous diffusion path for 2 methylisoborneol omps can also interact through electrostatic attraction repulsion van der waals π π or hydrogen bonds with dom interactions between dom and omps in the dissolved phase were observed during the treatment of effluents by membrane filtration leading to an increase of omps rejection majewska nowak et al 2002 tödtheide et al 1997 many studies have been conducted on the interactions between pesticides and dom caupos et al 2015 ilani et al 2005 lee et al 2003 but little data is available for other omp families such as pharmaceuticals hernandez ruiz et al 2012 demonstrated that bisphenol a could interact with microbial byproduct like and humic acid like dom components from wastewater and carbamazepine and ibuprofen with fulvic acid like components the influence of these interactions on the adsorption by activated carbon has been barely studied especially with wastewater dom jin et al 2018 observed that zwitterionic compounds could interact with humic acids in solution be adsorbed onto activated carbon and also interact with humic acids adsorbed on the activated carbon surface the presence of humic acids increased the removal of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin thanks to interactions with humic acids which trapped omps however these interactions between omps and dom were observed under specific conditions low dose of activated carbon and very high concentrations of dom and omps that are not representative of the real conditions encountered in drinking water plants or wastewater treatment plants only a few studies were conducted to assess the influence of dom originating from wastewater effluents on the adsorption of omps onto activated carbon wastewater dom is a complex mixture generally considered to be composed of large organic molecules biopolymers humic substances and building blocks and smaller molecules low molecular weight acids and neutrals de ridder et al 2011 pernet coudrier et al 2008 some authors proposed that the main negative effect of dom was the competition for adsorption sites rather than pore blockage zietzschmann et al 2014 fractionated dom using nanofiltration and obtained a lower adsorption of 5 omps in the presence of low molecular weight dom competition for adsorption sites phenomenon compared to raw and high molecular weight dom pore blockage phenomenon they reported that the impact of the small dom molecules was more important for medium and weakly adsorbing omps moreover the dom adsorbed onto the activated carbon is globally negatively charged at the ph of the wastewater and can decrease the adsorption of negatively charged omps through repulsive electrostatic interactions de ridder et al 2011 a negative influence of dom on the adsorption of negatively charged compounds was also observed by hu et al 2016 alves et al 2018 reported that in the absence of dom the textural properties i e the porosity of micro grain activated carbons μgacs played the most important role in the adsorption of omps while in the presence of dom the surface chemistry of μgacs i e point of zero charge surface functional groups had a predominant impact and positively charged compounds were better removed while the negative effect of dom on omps adsorption is known the degree of this effect i e quantification of the decrease in adsorption rates in relation to the dom composition is still unclear the influence of omps dom interactions on omps adsorption is also not fully understood and was not comprehensively studied in conditions close to realistic wastewater treatment applications i e synthetic water low omps concentrations and activated carbon doses in this context the present work evaluated the adsorption of 12 omps onto powdered activated carbon pac under various conditions by following 3 approaches as a first step short term adsorption capacity at various concentrations of the 12 omps i e pseudo isotherms was evaluated in two different matrices ultra pure water and wastewater effluent to assess the influence of dom on omps removal batch tests in ultra pure and wastewater effluent were then performed at short and long contact times with pac 30 min and 72 h to compare the short term capacity with a long term adsorption equilibrium and thus to characterize the underlying adsorption mechanisms dom adsorption was examined in parallel through lc ocd uv254 and fluorescence excitation emission analyses to better understand its adsorption and its effect on omps removal finally the influence of a pre equilibrium between omps and dom before adsorption was examined to study the possible interactions between omps and dom the links between omps physico chemical properties and their adsorption were discussed for each experiment 2 materials and methods 2 1

day after pre treatment screening grit and oil removal a physico chemical lamellar settling unit removes particles and colloids 3 biofiltration stages remove nutrients then the effluent is discharged into the seine river rocher et al 2012 the ph of the wastewater effluent ranges from 7 8 to 8 siaap data the pac used for all adsorption experiments was pb 170 dacarb see physico chemical properties summarized in table s1 and was previously studied in a large scale pilot and in batch experiments mailler et al 2016b 2015 organic micropollutants were purchased from sigma aldrich and their physico chemical properties are described in table 1 molecular weight hydrophobicity log d and charge and table s2 van der waals volume minimal projection area polar surface area and hydrogen bonds 2 2 experimental methods the 12 employed omps table 1 were selected based on their occurrence and concentrations in parisian wastewater effluents mailler et al 2015 they were commonly found in wwtp effluents and present a broad range of physical and chemical properties i e charge size hydrophobicity short term adsorption capacity of the 12 omps was studied after 30 min at room temperature 20 c and at 8 different concentrations ranging from 0 04 1 7 μg l to 1 2 52 μg l depending on the omps concentrations c1 c8 in table s3 in ultra pure water ph adjusted to 8 0 and wastewater effluent resulting in pseudo isotherm curves since an adsorption isotherm is assumed to be obtained at reaction equilibrium which was not reached after 30 min experiment 1 the freundlich equation freundlich 1906 was used to model adsorption pseudo isotherms equation 1 1 q t k f c t 1 n where q t μg mg is the amount of adsorbate uptake k f μg mg μg l 1 n is the freundlich constant c t μg l is the adsorbate concentration and 1 n dimensionless is the freundlich intensity parameter related to the intensity of the adsorption driving force or the surface heterogeneity the modelling parameters k f and 1 n and p values from the student test were obtained for each omp and each matrix ultra pure water or wastewater effluent via non linear least squares regression with the nlstools package baty et al 2015 using r software r core team 2007 the influence of contact time was studied by conducting comparative adsorption tests in ultra pure water and wastewater effluent during 30 min and 72 h at an average omps concentration 0 48 20 μg l depending on the omps concentration c5 in table s3 experiment 2 doc dom fractions from lc ocd chromatograms uv254 and the intensity of 6 fluorescence indexes from excitation emission matrices were determined before and after adsorption finally adsorption experiments were performed with and without a 24 h pre equilibrium between the wastewater effluent and spiked omps at the lowest working concentrations i e 0 04 1 7 μg l depending on the omps concentration c1 in table s3 to study the influence of the contact between dom and omps prior to adsorption during 30 min and 72 h experiment 3 a dose of 10 mg l of pac was added to the working solutions during all the experiments this dose was previously demonstrated to maximize differences between molecules in terms of removal which allows the observation of relationships between physico chemical properties of omps and their removal mailler et al 2016b experiments were conducted only one time because previous results indicated that the variability of omps removal was low 10 in similar conditions guillossou et al 2020 batch systems were placed under strong stirring during the required contact time pre determined volumes of the stock solution containing the 12 omps were spiked in working solutions of 1 5 l to reach the targeted concentrations for each experiment volumes of the spiked solution were chosen to maintain a low percentage of solvent methanol added to the working solution 0 05 the targeted concentrations of omps in the working solution were chosen to ensure that all omps were not completely adsorbed onto the pac after the chosen contact times and that residual concentrations were above limits of quantification loq table 1 unless specifically mentioned omps were always spiked in the wastewater effluent 24 h prior to pac addition to simulate the interactions between dom and omps occurring during sewer transfer and inside wwtps 2 3 analytical procedures omps were analyzed within 48 h at the institute of analytical sciences isa villeurbanne france by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectroscopy prior to analysis all samples were homogenized and filtered on 0 7 μm gf f glass filters whatman more information on the analytical methods can be found in the literature vulliet et al 2011 loqs of the 12 omps ranged between 0 5 and 6 ng l table 1 if the concentration of some pharmaceuticals was below the loq after adsorption their removal from the liquid phase and the quantity adsorbed onto the solid phase were estimated as if their concentration was equal to loq 2 dissolved organic carbon doc was analyzed for each experiment by the certified siaap laboratory after filtration on 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride filters milex

from 240 nm to 450 nm with an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths ranging from 250 nm to 600 nm with an interval of 2 nm when uv254 was higher than 0 080 1 cm the samples were diluted with ultrapure water to avoid inner filter effects due to adsorbing species present in the wastewater alberts and takács 2004 eems of ultrapure water were subtracted from the sample eems which were also

adsorption capacity of omps in each matrix are presented in fig 1 and the best fit isotherms parameters are summarized in table 2 experiment 1 most pseudo isotherms were correctly fitted with the freundlich equation student test p value 0 05 for the estimated k f or 1 n in ultra pure water only lorazepam could not be fitted by the freundlich equation because no residual concentration was detected in most bottles after 30 min of contact time in wastewater effluent diclofenac ibuprofen oxazepam and roxithromycin were not correctly fitted p value 0 05 for the estimated k f or 1 n and their freundlich parameters were therefore not reported in table 2 as expected the adsorption capacity i e q t value for a given initial concentration was systematically higher in ultra pure water than in wastewater effluent for all omps and all freundlich constants k f obtained after fitting the data were higher in ultra pure water than in wastewater effluent accordingly for most omps the freundlich intensity parameter 1 n was also higher in wastewater effluent than in ultra pure water which shows that the presence of dom makes adsorption less favorable the freundlich intensity parameter was lower in wastewater effluent than in ultra pure water only for carbamazepine and ofloxacin this could be due to modelling issues because of analytical errors at some concentrations leading to shifted points on the isotherm c t and q t values the adsorption isotherm is favorable when 1 n 1 which suggests a good affinity between the adsorbate and the adsorbent i e chemisorption while it is unfavorable when 1 n 1 the first adsorbate molecules are hardly adsorbed but improve the adsorption of the following probably through multilayer adsorption favorized by van der waals interactions i e physisorption the adsorption of sulfadiazine was unfavorable 1 n 1 44 and the adsorption of erythromycin and lorazepam was almost linear 1 n 0 98 and 1 05 respectively erythromycin is positively charged and one of the largest molecules mw 700 g mol and could be more impacted by the presence of dom i e by pore blockage and steric hindrance attractive electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged dom were probably not sufficient to counterbalance pore blockage sulfadiazine is negatively charged and thus was probably subjected to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed dom as well as diclofenac and ibuprofen no correlation was obtained between freundlich parameters and any physico chemical property of the 12 omps table 1 and table s2 suggesting that the adsorption of omps depends on various mechanisms and parameters governing their affinity with the pac and also their interactions with the dom both present in solution and adsorbed at the surface of the activated carbon 3 2 influence of the contact time with pac 3 2 1 dom adsorption doc removal was low 4 after 30 min of adsorption and close to values obtained in a previous study mailler et al 2016b table 3 experiment 2 the doc removal was higher after 72 h 15 but was still low despite a longer contact time lc ocd analyses see fig 2 showed that the wastewater effluent dom was mainly composed of humic like substances 2 58 mgc l followed by biopolymers building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals 1 26 1 38 mgc l and to a lesser extent of hydrophobic molecules 0 75 mgc l only biopolymers especially the smallest biopolymers eluted at 33 40 min of retention time were significantly removed after 30 min of adsorption 11 while almost no removal 3 was observed for humic acids building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals the hydrophobic fraction which is the remaining fraction of doc retained on the chromatographic column and not eluted reached similar removal as biopolymers 8 these results show that only specific dom fractions are adsorbed and are thus responsible for the mechanisms preventing omps adsorption and occurring at the surface of the ac i e competition for adsorption sites and pore blockage the removal of most dom fractions increased after a 72 h contact time with pac the most adsorbed fractions were again biopolymers 34 and hydrophobic molecules 32 followed by building blocks 10 and low molecular weight neutrals 14 however humic acids were still not removed 2 despite being the main dom fraction the lc ocd effluent profile shows a much lower proportion of humic like substances compared to a natural water schulz et al 2017 and conventional wastewater profile zietzschmann et al 2014 and humic acid adsorption was more important in these two studies the lower adsorption in this study could be due to the presence of biopolymers unlike the other studies which are much larger and could hinder the diffusion of humic acids to the adsorption sites the difference in pac used could also explain the observed differences for the adsorption of humic acids particularly the point of zero charge a removal of 12 was obtained for uv254 after 30 min of adsorption while the intensity of fluorescence indexes was slightly more affected 15 18 except for the index c6 6 after 72 h of adsorption the decrease in uv254 intensity 24 and fluorescence indexes 34 46 was in agreement with the higher removal of dom observed from doc and lc ocd measurements however at both contact time the decrease in uv254 intensity and fluorescence indexes was proportionally higher than the removal of doc and dom fractions especially 3 fluorescence indexes related to humic substances i e c4 c5 c6 exhibited a decrease higher than 30 after 72 h of adsorption while only 2 of humic acids as analyzed by lc ocd were removed fluorescing molecules represent a very small portion of the dom wünsch et al 2015 and these results indicate that they were preferentially adsorbed as compared to the bulk of humic substances 3 2 2 omps removal the removal of omps by activated carbon was determined after 30 min and 72 h of contact time in ultra pure water and wastewater effluent table 4 experiment 2 in ultra pure water removals were important 94 and similar between 30 min and 72 h less than 6 difference for almost all omps with the exception of diclofenac 89 and 97 at 30 min and 72 h respectively and ofloxacin 77 and 91 respectively diclofenac and ofloxacin being negatively charged compounds their lower removal at 30 min was possibly due to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged pac phpzc 5 0 however ibuprofen and sulfadiazine are also negatively charged molecules but their removal was not affected which suggests that other mechanisms favored their adsorption ofloxacin has a higher mw than ibuprofen and sulfadiazine and diclofenac comprises large chlorine atoms so differences in the diffusion rates into the activated carbon pores due to both repulsive interactions and steric hindrance effects may explain the various removals obtained for these negatively charged compounds in the wastewater effluent and after 30 min removals were low 40 except for atenolol and carbamazepine 60 and 57 respectively these low removals could be attributed to pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites caused by the presence of dom biopolymers consisting of very large molecules 10 kda were the main dom fraction adsorbed onto pac and thus are potentially responsible for the pore blockage the hydrophobic fraction of dom which was also better adsorbed onto pac and can be considered in the case of wastewater as a mixture of lipids fatty acids and lipopolysaccharides of various sizes could also be responsible of pore blockage but also competition for adsorption sites the positively charged and the neutral compounds were better removed than the negatively charged compounds average removal of 40 30 and 10 respectively as already observed in ultra pure water the occurrence of repulsive interactions between anionic omps and the negatively charged pac surface can explain these results and these interactions can be intensified by the negatively charged dom adsorbed onto pac conversely the better adsorption of atenolol presenting a positive charge at the ph of the wastewater effluent could be attributed to attractive electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged pac surface and the adsorbed dom erythromycin and roxithromycin were again poorly removed because of steric hindrance with the dom adsorbed in the pac pores after 72 h the removal of all omps increased and the highest removals ranging from 86 to 99 were achieved for atenolol carbamazepine erythromycin ofloxacin roxithromycin and trimethoprim which indicates that as expected 30 min of contact time was not sufficient to reach the equilibrium the difference between adsorption rates at 30 min and 72 h suggests that for these 6 compounds the negative effect of dom was negligible and that the adsorbed fractions of dom which should exacerbate higher pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites did not prevent their adsorption in the long term the access to adsorption sites was thus not totally prevented by dom and no competition inside the pores occurred in the long term another possible mechanism is the formation of dom omps complexes that are progressively adsorbed onto the pac surface pore blockage was thus the main negative effect of dom inhibiting the adsorption of these omps at 30 min which was finally counterbalanced by their slow diffusion either through the adsorbed dom or inside pac pores the removal of the 6 other omps was lower which indicates that dom still had a negative effect on their adsorption either by pore blockage competition for adsorption sites or electrostatic repulsion from dom moieties the positively charged and the neutral compounds were better removed than the negatively charged compounds average removal of 95 75 and 42 respectively erythromycin and roxithromycin were well removed despite their size probably because of attractive interactions with both the adsorbed dom and the pac rather than diffusion into the pac pores on the contrary low removals ranging from 24 to 31 were still observed for the negatively charged compounds diclofenac ibuprofen and sulfadiazine and may be attributed to repulsive electrostatic interactions with both the adsorbed dom and the pac in addition to competition for adsorption sites even after a longer contact time the presence of dom had a higher negative effect on the adsorption of negatively charged compounds despite its predominant negative charge ofloxacin was well removed in the presence of dom 86 after 72 h and it could be due to interactions with dom favored by its high polar surface and number of possible hydrogen bonds in comparison to other negative omps no trend was observed between the physical and chemical properties of neutral pharmaceuticals and their removals after 30 min and 72 h 3 3 influence of the pre equilibrium between dom and omps on adsorption the removal of omps by adsorption onto pac for 30 min and 72 h was examined with and without a pre equilibrium time of 24 h between the wastewater effluent and omps table 5 experiment 3 the 24 h pre equilibrium between dom and omps increased the removal of all omps after 30 min of adsorption the increase was particularly high for lorazepam 38 but also acetaminophen 26 diclofenac 27 and roxithromycin 22 which were poorly or not removed without precontact with dom 0 11 a significant increase was observed for atenolol 15 erythromycin 15 ibuprofen 13 oxazepam 18 sulfadiazine 13 and trimethoprim 14 these omps were also poorly removed without a pre equilibrium with dom 4 23 except atenolol 34 and trimethoprim 45 however the pre equilibrium with dom had little impact on the removal of carbamazepine 7 and ofloxacin 8 which were already well adsorbed without a pre equilibrium with dom 41 and 47 respectively those results confirm that omps and dom interacted in solution such association between omps and dom through hydrophobic hydrogen bonding van der waals or dipole dipole interactions has been extensively studied especially with natural organic matter caupos et al 2015 hernandez ruiz et al 2012 mott 2002 its influence on the adsorption of omps specifically onto activated carbon is however scarcely documented some studies demonstrated that dom prevent the adsorption of organic compounds on river or wastewater particles but this effect could not be attributed to either dom omp association in solution or to competitive adsorption hassett and anderson 1982 the co adsorption of dom and hydrophobic organic compounds has been reported at the surface of mineral materials e g clay kaolinite and found to be enhanced by ionic strength i e the presence of divalent cations brunk et al 1996 wu et al 2011 one study reported the enhanced adsorption of pentachlorophenol by pac after a 3 day pre equilibrium with fulvic acids which was attributed to binding at the surface of pac or to the modification of pac surface properties by fulvic acid adsorption lafrance et al 1991 our results demonstrate that the dom omp complexes formed after some pre equilibration time could be subsequently adsorbed onto the pac the pre equilibrium with dom thus balances the negative effects caused by dom presence further investigations would be needed to determine the potential role of inorganic ions present in wastewater effluents on the formation of these dom omp complexes and their adsorption the precontact of 24 h between dom and omps had no impact on the removal of most omps after 72 h of adsorption an increase was only observed for ibuprofen 28 and sulfadiazine 36 and in a lesser extent for lorazepam 9 and roxithromycine 8 the removal of these 4 omps after 72 h of adsorption and without a precontact with dom was low 16 68 in comparison to the other omps 77 98 which didn t need interactions with dom to be well adsorbed these results suggest that the precontact time between dom and omps occurring during sewer transfer and inside wwtps therefore the processes used for primary and biological treatment could have an impact on omps removal by activated carbon adsorption dom omps complexes could also be formed at the surface of the pac after long contact times allowing the high removals obtained after 72 h even without the 24 h pre equilibrium these results also imply that a pre equilibrium time between dom and omps may be necessary in laboratory experiments when omps are spiked e g adsorption isotherms in order to have similar dom omps interactions to what can be expected in wastewater effluents 4 conclusion adsorption pseudo isotherms showed as expected that omps adsorption was higher in ultra pure water than in wastewater effluent due to the presence of dom leading to pore blockage and competition for adsorption sites various molecular properties e g charge mw solubility hydrophobicity are involved in the adsorption mechanisms of omps leading to differences in the adsorption capacity of different omps lc ocd analysis revealed that biopolymers and hydrophobic molecules were the two major fractions of dom adsorbed on the pac 30 after 72 h other fractions were adsorbed after a contact time of 72 h 10 except humic acids despite being the main dom fraction the removal of dom as analyzed by uv254 and fluorescence indexes was higher than the removal calculated from lc ocd analyses which could be explained by different adsorption behaviors between the spectroscopically active dom and the non active one the presence of dom had a negative impact on the removal of all omps after 30 min of adsorption but similar removals to ultra pure water were obtained after a contact time of 72 h for 6 omps a sufficient contact time was thus able to allow high removals of these omps despite an increase of dom adsorption either by slow diffusion of omps through the adsorbed dom or the pac pores another possible mechanism is the formation of dom omps complexes that are progressively adsorbed at the pac surface competition for adsorption sites is thus not always the main negative effect in the presence of dom pore blockage due to the adsorption of biopolymers hydrophobic molecules of dom first strongly prevents the adsorption of omps but is compensated at longer contact times by the potential mechanisms described above omps charge had an impact on their adsorption both in the presence and absence of dom the adsorption rate of negatively charged compounds in the presence of wastewater effluent was reduced due to repulsive electrostatic interactions with the adsorbed dom and the pac surface i e both negatively charged positively charged compounds were globally better adsorbed possibly due to attractive electrostatic interactions but steric hindrance hindered the adsorption rate of some large molecules a pre equilibrium of 24 h between omps and dom improved their removal onto pac which confirm that omps and dom interact in solution these results are in accordance with the formation of dom omps complexes in solution which increased the overall removal of omps especially at short contact times additional studies should be conducted to identify the nature of the interactions between dom and omps to determine the influence of various pre equilibrium times i e a kinetic study

processes such as adsorption and advance oxidation processes aop can efficiently remove cip and sdz ect feng et al 2016 paul et al 2012 however the operational costs and system maintenance required for these physicochemical methods are much higher than that for biological treatments restricting their commercial viability homem and lúcia 2011 to date the fate of ppcps during biological treatment have been extensively investigated despite acquired advancement many previous reports indicated ppcps such as cip sdz and ext could only achieved a moderate 48 77 removal efficiency by using activated sludge processes in wastewater treatment plants wwtps deng et al 2016 oberoi et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 consequently the wwtps effluents has been identified as major source of ppcps entrance into aquatic environment he et al 2018 pereira et al 2015 meanwhile these results demonstrated reversible biosorption plays a critical role in ppcps elimination routes zhang et al 2018 and that extracellular polymeric substances eps have an important function contributing adsorption sites from hydrophobic protein components xiao and zheng 2016 eps often covers the cell surface and acts as a main linkage between microorganisms sheng et al 2010 under some circumstances eps can account for up to 60 of the dry weight of activated sludge in conventional wwtps liu and fang 2003 however although abundant eps facilitates sludge settling the shell shape of eps wrapped around cells might impede biodegradation peulen and wilkinson 2011 tang et al 2018 thus the risk of secondary release of ppcps into natural soil groundwater and waterbodies may enhanced from the eps of the toxic activated sludge chojnacka 2010 costa et al 2019 unlike activated sludge microalgae cells with a limited eps content of 3 5 are always well dispersed with a negative charge in suspension zhou et al 2015 2017 thus we hypothesize different morphologies of activated sludge and microalgae may result in different biosorption performance by microalgae cells and varying biodegradation removal efficiency for ppcps microalgae have exhibited high potential as a cost effective and environmentally friendly treatment process for high efficiency ppcps removal together with bioenergy production xie et al 2019 due to their high cell growth rate and environmental tolerance ho et al 2014 raja et al 2008 rich production of energy compounds and have ability to assimilate n and p down to very low concentrations ho et al 2012 2013 for example caffeine removal has been shown be improved by 40 using chlorella sp as compared to biological sludge treatment matamoros et al 2015 moreover the lipid content of chlamydomonas sp improved by 9 1 with addition of 5 mg l 1 tetracycline xie et al 2019 however comprehensive study of ppcps removal and bioenergy production optimization has not yet performed and the understanding of the mechanisms of elimination and degradation are still lacking this gap in knowledge significantly hampers the practical application of microalgal ppcps removal with bioenergy conversion in this study the carbohydrate rich microalgae chlamydomonas sp tai 03 was adopted for the removal of the typical ppcps cip and sdz to enhance its economic feasibility and application potential we used simulative municipal wastewater as the culture medium and the culture condition parameters of light intensity and temperature were optimized to obtain high endurance removal of the cip and sdz along with maximized n p removal efficiency and bioethanol production notably cip and sdz elimination routes and degradation mechanisms were comprehensively investigated by microscope imaging via raman spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms to the best of our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively analyzes cip and sdz elimination routes and degradation pathways in microalgal ppcps treatment these findings will help progress the development of novel strategies for simultaneous microalgal ppcps removal and bioenergy conversion establishing the mechanisms for understanding ppcps elimination routes and biodegradation pathways by microalgae 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae culture conditions the microalga chlamydomonas sp tai 03 was isolated from southern taiwan and pre cultured in modified municipal wastewater synthetic wastewater with continuous supply of 2 co2 at an aeration rate of 0 20 vvm for 5 6 days ho et al 2015 the photobioreactor pbr used to pre culture microalgae was illuminated continuously at 250 μmol m 2 s 1 and measured using a li 250 light meter with a li 190sa pyranometer sensor li cor inc lincoln ne usa synthetic wastewater medium was prepared as described by mennaa et al 2015 and its characterization used for the test was cod 384 00 mg o2 l 1 total n 54 58 mg l 1 total p 12 70 mg l 1 see page s5 in the supporting information si for further details to maximize cell growth n p removal and carbohydrate production the batch culture conditions e g light intensity and temperature were optimized see page s5 in the supporting information si for further details 2 2 cip and sdz removal by chlamydomonas sp tai 03 both cip 99 purity and sdz 99 purity were supplied by sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to investigate cip and sdz removal capacity the ppcps removal test was performed for 9 days with an 80 mg l 1 inoculation of strain tai 03 under synthetic wastewater in 500 ml pbrs the control group was also conducted for 9 days without the ppcps spiked as the ppcps are widely detected among the range of 0 1 50 mg l 1 in wastewaters abargues et al 2018 wang et al 2017 1 5 and 10 mg l 1 cip or sdz were selected in this study accordingly all tests were performed simultaneously under optimal cultivation conditions and co2 levels maintained at 2 0 by continuous supply at a flow rate of 0 5 vvm in triplicate 2 3 batch experiment design a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the elimination routes of cip and sdz at 10 mg l 1 in each pbr the microalgal elimination routes for ppcps were considered to be photolysis hydrolysis biosorption and biodegradation xiong et al 2018 all the batch tests were operated simultaneously using synthetic wastewater as a culture medium under optimal cultivation conditions for 9 days table 1 and all experiments were conducted in triplicate as shown in table 1 photolysis and hydrolysis tests based on the previous report li and zhang 2010 were conducted to investigate the contribution of photolysis and hydrolysis during cip and sdz removal process treatment i was conducted without strain tai 03 inoculation and co2 supply to examine the possible for both photolysis and hydrolysis of ppcps treatment ii was utilized to investigate the hydrolysis of ppcps without strain tai 03 inoculation co2 supply and illumination based on experimental results the fraction removed by photolysis can be calculated according to the differences between treatments as defined by equation 1 as follows xie et al 2019 1 photolysis i ii 50 ml of microalgal broth was collected from each pbr to evaluate the biosorption assessing the degree of adsorption by eps and intracellular accumulation the samples were washed with 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 2 zhang et al 2008 meanwhile 0 1 w v sodium azide nan3 jsk qingdao china was added into 50 ml of microalgal broth to inhibit the microbial activity and the possible biodegradation of cip and sdz by strain tai 03 xu et al 2013 after that eps of microalgal cells was extracted using a modified heating method see pages s7 s8 in the si for further details and the concentration of cip and sdz adsorbed by eps was then determined respectively li and yang 2007 eventually microalgal cell pellets were ultrasonically treated for ppcps quantification see page s6 in the si for details based on the experimental results the fraction removed by the intracellular accumulation can be calculated by equation 2 xie et al 2019 2 biosorption accumulation eps adsorption biodegradation tests were performed with all four elimination routes occurring in reactors shown as equation 3 gao et al 2011 3 c b c i c p c h c s c r 100 c i where c b is the percentage of the biodegradation c i is the initial concentration of ppcps 10 mgl 1 c p is the concentration of ppcps

after samples were freeze dried fdu 1200 tokyo rikakikai japan the calculations for conversion of od680 to biomass concentrations carbohydrate content and n p concentration are displayed in the si see pages s11 s12 the concentrations of cip and sdz were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent usa using an ec c18 column 2 7 μm particle size 4 6 100 mm agilent

results and all analyses were conducted by the spss software package ibm spss statistic 20 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of microalgae treatment and analysis of elimination routs 3 1 1 optimization of microalgal treatment to obtain satisfactory ppcps removal and carbohydrate production the optimal light intensity and temperature for strain tai 03 cultivation were established as shown in fig 1 a the biomass concentration remained constant at approximately 4 61 g l 1 within the light intensity range of 300 450 μmol m 2 s 1 combing with the obtained monod model figs s1 and s2 and table s2 a light intensity of 300 μmol m 2 s 1 was selected allowing a satisfactory cell growth with maximum carbohydrate content 83 72 the maximum carbohydrate content of 78 15 and carbohydrate productivity of 0 94 g l 1 d 1 were achieved at 30 c which are the highest values reported to date fig 1b and table s1 as shown in fig 2 a except for some minor inhibition caused by cip on the 1st day cip had no significantly restrictive effect on strain tai 03 the average maximum carbohydrate content and productivity of strain tai 03 were 9 46 and 6 59 higher than control respectively suggesting that cip could achieve effective carbohydrate productivity without any adverse effects fig 2b and table s4 meanwhile cip removal efficiency was improved with increasing cip concentrations with cip at different concentrations consistently completely consumed by the 6th day fig 2c sdz also induced no significant cell growth inhibition with final biomass concentration of 4 72 g l 1 achieved with addition of 10 mg l 1 sdz fig 1d and table s3 compared with the control the average maximum carbohydrate content of strain tai 03 increased by 6 97 with addition of sdz fig 1e however in contrast to cip removal only about half of total sdz could be removed by strain tai 03 at all sdz dosages fig 1f in order to dissect this phenomenon the elimination routes of hydrolysis biosorption photolysis and biodegradation were comprehensively investigated 3 1 2 analysis of elimination routs in general the removal of cip and sdz occurs via four main routes hydrolysis photolysis biosorption and biodegradation oberoi et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 baena nogueras et al 2017 due to the hydrophobic characteristics of these two ppcps the hydrolysis of cip and sdz only accounted for 2 38 and 1 34 of removal respectively fig 3 a and c for photolysis due to the higher second order rate constant of hydroxyl radicals oh of sdz its removal percentage was 8 53 higher than for cip boreen et al 2005 flores payán et al 2017 interestingly although only 54 51 of sdz was removed during cultivation the first order loss rates k due to photolysis reached 4 85 10 2 d 1 suggesting that irradiance may not only affect cell growth and carbohydrate accumulation but also preferentially support sdz removal fig 3d and tables s5 and s6 as nitrate consumed photolysis rate of cip and sdz were both slowed indicating that photolysis of nitrate in solution may lead to the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh mack and bolton 1999 zepp et al 1987 after photolysis the residues of both cip and sdz were gently removed through biodegradation the biodegradation of cip accounted for 65 05 of removal which was 48 00 higher than the contribution of sdz biodegradation fig 3a and c also due to the biodegradation of cip the first order loss rates reached 1 93 10 2 d 1 fig 3b obviously cip removal was mainly achieved by biodegradation 65 05 while sdz removal occurred mainly by photolysis 35 60 with this difference in the main elimination route potentially accounting for the disparate removal efficiencies interestingly the maximum biosorption of cip reached 0 55 mg 5 50 which was ten fold higher than sdz the difference of biosorption between cip and sdz indicated that biosorption may play a critical role in the biodegradation process therefore to comprehensively reveal biosorption mechanism we used confocal raman imaging microscopy and nan3 to investigate the association of ppcps with eps and intracellular adsorption 3 2 analysis of biosorption during ppcps removal 3 2 1 different adsorption by visualization proof the adsorption onto cell surfaces is the first step for ppcps biosorption the results provided by microscopic imaging raman spectrometer suggested that more cip was adsorbed on the surface of strain tai 03 as shown in fig 4 a and c two characteristic cip peaks peaks of 1450 and 1650 cm 1 could be observed on spectra of strain tai 03 in the presence of cip conversely due to the limited level of adsorption of sdz there were no sdz peaks detected in the spectra of surface of strain tai 03 fig 4b and d here the visualization proof of the adsorption of cip and sdz by microalgal cells was provided 3 2 2 analysis of electrostatic neutralization the adsorption process can be attributed to electrostatic neutralization and hydrophobicity mechanisms eps adsorption the adsorption of ppcps onto microalgae is mainly governed by electrostatic interactions which is related to their ionization behavior yang et al 2011 due to the acid dissociation constant pka of cip pka1 6 1 pka2 8 2 cip would be stated in zwitterionic form in the modified municipal wastewater ph 6 5 8 0 oberoi et al 2019 ku mmerer 2009 different from cip the pka2 of sdz was 6 35 and sdz would be existed as the anionic species under the similar wastewater condition li and zhang 2010 consistently in this study strain tai 03 has a zeta potential of 21 90 mv and unlike the negative zeta potential of sdz 2 55 mv zeta potential of cip is 10 20 mv therefore electrical neutralization between negatively charged surface of microalgae and positively charged cip is one dominant factor accounting for cell surface adsorption 3 2 3 analysis of hydrophobicity mechanism in addition to establishing the biosorption according to zeta potential eps on surface of strain tai 03 could also provide active binding sites for ppcps adsorption and thus form the stable eps ppcps complexes through hydrophobic interaction xu et al 2013 as shown in fig 4e f and 4g compared with the control group strain tai 03 eps secretion increased by 0 05 g in response to ppcps on 1st day while ros probe indicated that biological activity was not inhibited by ppcps moreover eps concentration with cip addition increased by only 3 89 as compared to sdz addition meanwhile the average pn ps of cip 0 33 was higher than that of sdz 0 22 during the ppcps removal process indicating that microalgae s eps could offer more availability of adsorption sites and binding strength during cip removal mei et al 2009 spath et al 1998 to further investigate the adsorption of ppcps by eps the eps concentrations were determined after extraction by addition of nan3 the results showed that eps content of microalgae was highly associated with ppcps adsorption as shown in fig 4h the low concentration of sdz 0 04 mg l 1 in eps resulted in the reduced importance of biosorption 0 52 and biodegradation 17 05 elimination routes table s6 in contrast the maximum adsorption of cip by eps reached 0 57 mg l 1 on the 2nd day interestingly unlike the entrapped adsorption tendency of eps by activated sludge cip adsorbed by eps was gradually reduced after the 2nd day indicating that fraction of cip in eps had been internalized by microalgal cells based on 3d eem analysis a peak at ex em of 270 290 300 375 nm corresponding to tryptophan was detected in eps samples treated with cip fig s3 chen et al 2003 these results indicate that tryptophan like proteins may play an important role in adsorption of cip by eps moreover ftir results further confirmed changes in chemical groups of proteins as shown in fig 4i the peaks at 1616 cm 1 1637 cm 1 and 3413 cm 1 were attributed to the co stretching vibration n h bending and o h or n h stretching vibrations of amine in proteins respectively jia et al 2017 liu and fang 2003 importantly co bond in proteins carries a negative charge ohko et al 2002 which also preferentially benefits cip adsorption with the intensities of above peaks weakening following exposure suggesting that eps amine groups were involved in cip adsorption it has been well established that n h and co functional groups are mainly derived from proteins in eps with proteins having strong hydrophobicity that may contribute to organic pollutants adsorption mei et al 2009 spath et al 1998 besides the band visible between 3200 and 3500 cm 1 and the peak at 1085 cm 1 indicate that hydroxyl groups of protein and stretching vibration of c o c in polysaccharides also participated in adsorption of ppcps to eps jia et al 2017 undoubtedly different biosorption mechanisms contribute to the distinctive elimination routes observed for cip and sdz resulting in clear differences in biodegradation efficiency due to the stable thickness biofilm blocking the ppcps transport routes massive ppcps was trapped in the eps of activated sludge torresi et al 2017 then the ppcps would consequently release into the surface water without further biodegradation costa et al 2019 fortunately due to the limited eps existed on the surface of microalgae the ppcps would be diffused smoothly into intracellular for complete biodegradation comparing to sludge microalgae would provide a promising potential to remove ppcps with satisfactory biodegradation efficiency 3 3 photolysis and biodegradation of cip and sdz by chlamydomonas sp tai 03 3 3 1 the photolysis and biodegradation pathway of cip as shown in fig 5 and table s7 five intermediates and two pathways were identified for cip photolysis process the result indicated that the direct attacks by hydroxyl radical and hydrated electron to cip were two main photocatalytic degradation pathway firstly hydroxylating the c10 site of cip could form the m z 348 intermediate after that the hydroxylation of c5 site followed by simultaneous defluorination and oxidation at c6 position for m z 348 would arouse to form the product m z 362 then the product m z 348 would endure the decarboxylation followed by hydroxylation at site c9 to form the compound m z 334 moreover cip contains more binding sites which may be more available for attack by hydrated electrons an et al 2010 according to the frontier orbital theory and calculated value of the frontier electron densities fed the first reaction site n12 has the highest value of 2fed2 highest occupied molecular orbital 2fed2 homo ohko et al 2002 zhang et al 2008 allowing electron to be easily extracted additionally sulfate could be reduced to sulfite by atp sulfurylase and adenosine 5 phosphosulfate while photolysis of sulfite in solution may produce the hydrated electrons e to attack cip an et al 2010 li et al 2012 through hydrated electron the piperazinyl ring of cip was partially and completely elimination after the n12 site was attacked generating intermediates m z 306 and 263 respectively in addition six intermediates were determined during cip biodegradation fig 5 due to the similar ms fragmentation patterns fig s4 the photolysis product of m z 306 might be defluorinated by cytochrome p450 and dioxygenase to form the intermediate m z 288 a maia et al 2014 wetzatein et al 1999 following this the product m z 190 might be formed by the direct cleavage of c n bond of the naphthalene group on c1 site of intermediate m z 288 a liao et al 2016 finally the pyridine ring on m z 190 could be broken by the dioxygenase and then formed intermediate m z 104 guengerich 2018 meanwhile after the fluoride group on the benzene ring and the cyclopropane group on the n36 site of m z 288 b were removed m z 243 could be produced by addition of a methyl group as previously reported gao et al 2018 moreover the benzene ring of m z 334 intermediate underwent a meta cleavage to form m z 113 in this study we clearly demonstrated two main biodegradation mechanisms for cip including a detoxification mechanism and enzymatic biodegradation via mono and dioxygenases gao et al 2018 guengerich 2018 wei et al 2019 meanwhile the intermediates e g m z 288 a and m z 243 resulting from loss of fluorine in the benzene ring indicated the toxicity was reduced to microalgal cells liao et al 2016 maia et al 2014 wang et al 2018 additionally it has been reported that phase ii enzymes e g glutathione s transferases can be used as a biocatalyst for conjugating glutathione into electrophilic compounds ding et al 2017 which may result in opening of the epoxide ring due to cleavage of the benzene ring by hydroxyl radical attack mono or dioxygenase was confirmed to be involved in biodegradation of cip e g m z 113 3 3 2 the photolysis and biodegradation pathway of sdz as shown in fig 6 and table s8 only three intermediates m z 281 m z 215 and m z 121 were detected during sdz photolysis degradation process suggesting that the structure of sdz was more stable than that of cip the oxidation of the amine group in the benzene ring of sdz will lead to form intermediate m z 281 then the intermediates at m z 215 and m z 121 were generated from m z 281 by opening the pyridine ring and cleavage of c n bonds respectively fig s5 zou et al 2014 five intermediates were identified during biodegradation fig 6 firstly three intermediates m z 243 m z 229 and m z 257 were produced via the loss of a pyridine ring with addition of a c3h4oo group c3h5o group and c4h10n2 group on the amino group site respectively then intermediate m z 157 was formed by cleavage of c n bond and m z 127 intermediate was formed by hydroxylation of benzene ring of m z 157 molecule by cytochrome p450 guengerich 2018 the higher molecular weight of intermediates generated from sdz as compared to cip may result from the relatively minor contributions of biosorption overall the total organic carbon toc removal percentage of cip and sdz were 60 29 and 27 49 at the 9th days of biodegradation respectively as shown in table s9 these results suggested that the above determined intermediates of cip and sdz would be further oxidized and then mineralized an et al 2010 in this study the cip and sdz degradation intermediates have been comprehensively identified which indicated that both the process of biosorption and characteristics of ppcps would obviously affect the following microalgal biodegradation meanwhile biodegradation and photolysis appear to be the main elimination routes for cip and sdz respectively overall strain tai 03 was found to be capable of efficiently removing cip providing a novel insight into microalgal ppcps treatment 3 4 the effect of cip and sdz on bioethanol production by chlamydomonas sp tai 03 3 4 1 estimation of the properties of cip and sdz degradation intermediates to date although ppcps degradation has attracted much attention environmental assessment of degraded intermediates are generally lacking according to the pbt criteria proposed by the usepa and european commission ec howard and muir 2010 li et al 2018 none of identified cip and sdz intermediates exhibited long range transport potential in water bodies table s10 additionally all intermediates presented a log kow of 5 and a bcf of 5000 l kg 1 indicating that both cip and sdz degradation products exhibited no risk of bioaccumulation meanwhile through preliminary toxicological impacts of these compounds were analyzed using ecosar analysis all intermediates were found to present a limited risk of toxicity to both fresh and saltwater fish li et al 2018 these results suggested that the intermediates of cip and sdz generated by microalgal treatment might effectively meet the practical demand 3 4 2 ethanol conversion from sugar rich chlamydomonas sp tai 03 to enhance the downstream application potential of microalgal ppcps treatment the conversion yield of hydrolyzed microalgal carbohydrates mainly starch to ethanol has previously been investigated the study evaluated the use of ethanol producing strain z mobilis atcc29191 through the shf process to further evaluate the biorefinery value of ppcps treated microalgal cells ho et al 2013 as shown in fig s6 the maximum microalgal ethanol production of 13 01 g l 1 was achieved with nearly 99 80 of theoretical ethanol yield achieved after cip treatment demonstrating that ppcps treated microalgal sugar rich biomass could provide a superior feedstock for bioenergy generation increasing commercial viability of microalgal ppcps removal process 4 conclusions this study comprehensively demonstrates that chlamydomonas sp tai 03 was capable of efficient cip and sdz removal by biodegradation and photolysis respectively notably during the ppcps removal process adsorption may play an essential role according to the zeta potential of the assessed ppcps the adsorption of cip was ten fold higher than sdz in cell secreted eps in addition these are the first results to show that microalgal eps prefers to absorb cip rather than sdz which further provided a novel insight into the transfer of ppcps charges from the negative to positive to improve adsorption by eps meanwhile these findings suggest that cip and sdz were mainly adsorbed on eps through binding to carbonyl and amine groups in tryptophan protein like substances and hydroxyl groups of eps although activated sludge can also absorb considerable amounts of cip and sdz its mass transfer efficiency is much lower than microalgae due to congestion from large amounts of eps more importantly these findings disclosed the cip and sdz photolysis and biodegradation pathways via microalgae which clearly confirm the microalgal ppcps removal mechanism consequently due to the limited toxicity of intermediates generated during the microalgal ppcps removal process these findings demonstrate that microalgae can be developed as a novel integrated biological system for ppcps removal in the municipal wastewater with n p removal efficiency and bioenergy generation therefore this method may achieve the goals of waste recycled bio circular economy design if the challenges of up scaled systems can be overcome

18148,pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps removal coupling with bioenergy production by microalgae has attracted growing attention however the biological interactions between ppcps and microalgae are unclear during microalgal biosorption and biodegradation of ppcps in this study an optimal ciprofloxacin cip and sulfadiazine sdz removal efficiency were achieved 100 and 54 53 with carbohydrate productivity of 1000 mg l 1 d 1 by chlamydomonas sp tai 03 respectively the elimination routes indicated that cip removal was mainly achieved by biodegradation 65 05 whereas sdz was mainly removed by photolysis 35 60 the visualization evidence of microscopic imaging raman spectrometer supported the favorable biosorption of cip due to its positive charge 10 20 mv meanwhile the tendency for gradual reduction of cip in extracellular polymeric substances eps indicated that suspended microalgal cell facilitated cip uptake and biodegradation furthermore photolysis and biodegradation pathways were thoroughly analyzed to demonstrate that intermediates were less toxic and had no adverse effect on the subsequent ethanol conversion this study provides valuable information for the development of a novel microalgal ppcps removal these findings reveal the possible biological mechanisms of biosorption and biodegradation of ppcps in microalgae which could further enhance the feasibility of microalgal applications for simultaneous ppcps remediation and alternative energy production graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae pharmaceutical and personal care products elimination routes biosorption biodegradation mechanisms extracellular polymeric substances 1 introduction pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps are responsible for a number of harmful pollutants such as the antibiotics ciprofloxacin cip and sulfadiazine sdz oberoi et al 2019 occurrence of cip and sdz in the surface water could achieved 5 02 and 0 17 mg l 1 respectively gothwal 2017 qin et al 2019 it is noting that cip could break replication and transcription of the dna zhanel et al 2002 while the potential long half life antibiotics sdz could alter the microbial community yadav et al 2018 both cip and sdi can persistently affect the ecological diversity while causing the severe problems of the human and environment westerhoff et al 2005 non biotic processes such as adsorption and advance oxidation processes aop can efficiently remove cip and sdz ect feng et al 2016 paul et al 2012 however the operational costs and system maintenance required for these physicochemical methods are much higher than that for biological treatments restricting their commercial viability homem and lúcia 2011 to date the fate of ppcps during biological treatment have been extensively investigated despite acquired advancement many previous reports indicated ppcps such as cip sdz and ext could only achieved a moderate 48 77 removal efficiency by using activated sludge processes in wastewater treatment plants wwtps deng et al 2016 oberoi et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 consequently the wwtps effluents has been identified as major source of ppcps entrance into aquatic environment he et al 2018 pereira et al 2015 meanwhile these results demonstrated reversible biosorption plays a critical role in ppcps elimination routes zhang et al 2018 and that extracellular polymeric substances eps have an important function contributing adsorption sites from hydrophobic protein components xiao and zheng 2016 eps often covers the cell surface and acts as a main linkage between microorganisms sheng et al 2010 under some circumstances eps can account for up to 60 of the dry weight of activated sludge in conventional wwtps liu and fang 2003 however although abundant eps facilitates sludge settling the shell shape of eps wrapped around cells might impede biodegradation peulen and wilkinson 2011 tang et al 2018 thus the risk of secondary release of ppcps into natural soil groundwater and waterbodies may enhanced from the eps of the toxic activated sludge chojnacka 2010 costa et al 2019 unlike activated sludge microalgae cells with a limited eps content of 3 5 are always well dispersed with a negative charge in suspension zhou et al 2015 2017 thus we hypothesize different morphologies of activated sludge and microalgae may result in different biosorption performance by microalgae cells and varying biodegradation removal efficiency for ppcps microalgae have exhibited high potential as a cost effective and environmentally friendly treatment process for high efficiency ppcps removal together with bioenergy production xie et al 2019 due to their high cell growth rate and environmental tolerance ho et al 2014 raja et al 2008 rich production of energy compounds and have ability to assimilate n and p down to very low concentrations ho et al 2012 2013 for example caffeine removal has been shown be improved by 40 using chlorella sp as compared to biological sludge treatment matamoros et al 2015 moreover the lipid content of chlamydomonas sp improved by 9 1 with addition of 5 mg l 1 tetracycline xie et al 2019 however comprehensive study of ppcps removal and bioenergy production optimization has not yet performed and the understanding of the mechanisms of elimination and degradation are still lacking this gap in knowledge significantly hampers the practical application of microalgal ppcps removal with bioenergy conversion in this study the carbohydrate rich microalgae chlamydomonas sp tai 03 was adopted for the removal of the typical ppcps cip and sdz to enhance its economic feasibility and application potential we used simulative municipal wastewater as the culture medium and the culture condition parameters of light intensity and temperature were optimized to obtain high endurance removal of the cip and sdz along with maximized n p removal efficiency and bioethanol production notably cip and sdz elimination routes and degradation mechanisms were comprehensively investigated by microscope imaging via raman spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms to the best of our knowledge this is the first report that comprehensively analyzes cip and sdz elimination routes and degradation pathways in microalgal ppcps treatment these findings will help progress the development of novel strategies for simultaneous microalgal ppcps removal and bioenergy conversion establishing the mechanisms for understanding ppcps elimination routes and biodegradation pathways by microalgae 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae culture conditions the microalga chlamydomonas sp tai 03 was isolated from southern taiwan and pre cultured in modified municipal wastewater synthetic wastewater with continuous supply of 2 co2 at an aeration rate of 0 20 vvm for 5 6 days ho et al 2015 the photobioreactor pbr used to pre culture microalgae was

details 2 2 cip and sdz removal by chlamydomonas sp tai 03 both cip 99 purity and sdz 99 purity were supplied by sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to investigate cip and sdz removal capacity the ppcps removal test was performed for 9 days with an 80 mg l 1 inoculation of strain tai 03 under synthetic wastewater in 500 ml pbrs the control group was also conducted for 9 days without the ppcps spiked as the ppcps are widely detected among the range of 0 1 50 mg l 1 in wastewaters abargues et al 2018 wang et al 2017 1 5 and 10 mg l 1 cip or sdz were selected in this study accordingly all tests were performed simultaneously under optimal cultivation conditions and co2 levels maintained at 2 0 by continuous supply at a flow rate of 0 5 vvm in triplicate 2 3 batch experiment design a series of batch experiments were conducted to investigate the elimination routes of cip and sdz at 10 mg l 1 in each pbr the microalgal elimination routes for ppcps were considered to be photolysis hydrolysis biosorption and biodegradation xiong et al 2018 all the batch tests were operated simultaneously using synthetic wastewater as a culture medium under optimal cultivation conditions for 9 days table 1 and all experiments were conducted in triplicate as shown in table 1 photolysis and hydrolysis tests based on the previous report li and zhang 2010 were conducted to investigate the contribution of photolysis and hydrolysis during cip and sdz removal process treatment i was conducted without strain tai 03 inoculation and co2 supply to examine the possible for both photolysis and hydrolysis of ppcps treatment ii was utilized to investigate the hydrolysis of ppcps without strain tai 03 inoculation co2 supply and illumination based on experimental results the fraction removed by photolysis can be calculated according to the differences between treatments as defined by equation 1 as follows xie et al 2019 1 photolysis i ii 50 ml of microalgal broth was collected from each pbr to evaluate the biosorption assessing the degree of adsorption by eps and intracellular accumulation the samples were washed with 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 2 zhang et al 2008 meanwhile 0 1 w v sodium azide nan3 jsk qingdao china was added into 50 ml of microalgal broth to inhibit the microbial activity and the possible biodegradation of cip and sdz by strain tai 03 xu et al 2013 after that eps of microalgal cells was extracted using a modified heating method see pages s7 s8 in the si for further details and the concentration of cip and sdz adsorbed by eps was then determined respectively li and yang 2007 eventually microalgal cell pellets were ultrasonically treated for ppcps quantification see page s6 in the si for details based on the experimental results the fraction removed by the intracellular accumulation can be calculated by equation 2 xie et al 2019 2 biosorption accumulation eps adsorption biodegradation tests were performed with all four elimination routes occurring in reactors shown as equation 3 gao et al 2011 3 c b c i c p c h c s c r 100 c i where c b is the percentage of the biodegradation c i is the initial concentration of ppcps 10 mgl 1 c p is the concentration of ppcps

after samples were freeze dried fdu 1200 tokyo rikakikai japan the calculations for conversion of od680 to biomass concentrations carbohydrate content and n p concentration are displayed in the si see pages s11 s12 the concentrations of cip and sdz were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 1260 infinity ii agilent usa using an ec c18 column 2 7 μm particle size 4 6 100 mm agilent

results and all analyses were conducted by the spss software package ibm spss statistic 20 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of microalgae treatment and analysis of elimination routs 3 1 1 optimization of microalgal treatment to obtain satisfactory ppcps removal and carbohydrate production the optimal light intensity and temperature for strain tai 03 cultivation were established as shown in fig 1 a the biomass concentration remained constant at approximately 4 61 g l 1 within the light intensity range of 300 450 μmol m 2 s 1 combing with the obtained monod model figs s1 and s2 and table s2 a light intensity of 300 μmol m 2 s 1 was selected allowing a satisfactory cell growth with maximum carbohydrate content 83 72 the maximum carbohydrate content of 78 15 and carbohydrate productivity of 0 94 g l 1 d 1 were achieved at 30 c which are the highest values reported to date fig 1b and table s1 as shown in fig 2 a except for some minor inhibition caused by cip on the 1st day cip had no significantly restrictive effect on strain tai 03 the average maximum carbohydrate content and productivity of strain tai 03 were 9 46 and 6 59 higher than control respectively suggesting that cip could achieve effective carbohydrate productivity without any adverse effects fig 2b and table s4 meanwhile cip removal efficiency was improved with increasing cip concentrations with cip at different concentrations consistently completely consumed by the 6th day fig 2c sdz also induced no significant cell growth inhibition with final biomass concentration of 4 72 g l 1 achieved with addition of 10 mg l 1 sdz fig 1d and table s3 compared with the control the average maximum carbohydrate content of strain tai 03 increased by 6 97 with addition of sdz fig 1e however in contrast to cip removal only about half of total sdz could be removed by strain tai 03 at all sdz dosages fig 1f in order to dissect this phenomenon the elimination routes of hydrolysis biosorption photolysis and biodegradation were comprehensively investigated 3 1 2 analysis of elimination routs in general the removal of cip and sdz occurs via four main routes hydrolysis photolysis biosorption and biodegradation oberoi et al 2019 xiong et al 2018 baena nogueras et al 2017 due to the hydrophobic characteristics of these two ppcps the hydrolysis of cip and sdz only accounted for 2 38 and 1 34 of removal respectively fig 3 a and c for photolysis due to the higher second order rate constant of hydroxyl radicals oh of sdz its removal percentage was 8 53 higher than for cip boreen et al 2005 flores payán et al 2017 interestingly although only 54 51 of sdz was removed during cultivation the first order loss rates k due to photolysis reached 4 85 10 2 d 1 suggesting that irradiance may not only affect cell growth and carbohydrate accumulation but also preferentially support sdz removal fig 3d and tables s5 and s6 as nitrate consumed photolysis rate of cip and sdz were both slowed indicating that photolysis of nitrate in solution may lead to the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh mack and bolton 1999 zepp et al 1987 after photolysis the residues of both cip and sdz were gently removed through biodegradation the biodegradation of cip accounted for 65 05 of removal which was 48 00 higher than the contribution of sdz biodegradation fig 3a and c also due to the biodegradation of cip the first order loss rates reached 1 93 10 2 d 1 fig 3b obviously cip removal was mainly achieved by biodegradation 65 05 while sdz removal occurred mainly by photolysis 35 60 with this difference in the main elimination route potentially accounting for the disparate removal efficiencies interestingly the maximum biosorption of cip reached 0 55 mg 5 50 which was ten fold higher than sdz the difference of biosorption between cip and sdz indicated that biosorption may play a critical role in the biodegradation process therefore to comprehensively reveal biosorption mechanism we used confocal raman imaging microscopy and nan3 to investigate the association of ppcps with eps and intracellular adsorption 3 2 analysis of biosorption during ppcps removal 3 2 1 different adsorption by visualization proof the adsorption onto cell surfaces is the first step for ppcps biosorption the results provided by microscopic imaging raman spectrometer suggested that more cip was adsorbed on the surface of strain tai 03 as shown in fig 4 a and c two characteristic cip peaks peaks of 1450 and 1650 cm 1 could be observed on spectra of strain tai 03 in the presence of cip conversely due to the limited level of adsorption of sdz there were no sdz peaks detected in the spectra of surface of strain tai 03 fig 4b and d here the visualization proof of the adsorption of cip and sdz by microalgal cells was provided 3 2 2 analysis of electrostatic neutralization the adsorption process can be attributed to electrostatic neutralization and hydrophobicity mechanisms eps adsorption the adsorption of ppcps onto microalgae is mainly governed by electrostatic interactions which is related to their ionization behavior yang et al 2011 due to the acid dissociation constant pka of cip pka1 6 1 pka2 8 2 cip would be stated in zwitterionic form in the modified municipal wastewater ph 6 5 8 0 oberoi et al 2019 ku mmerer 2009 different from cip the pka2 of sdz was 6 35 and sdz would be existed as the anionic species under the similar wastewater condition li and zhang 2010 consistently in this study strain tai 03 has a zeta potential of 21 90 mv and unlike the negative zeta potential of sdz 2 55 mv zeta potential of cip is 10 20 mv therefore electrical neutralization between negatively charged surface of microalgae and positively charged cip is one dominant factor accounting for cell surface adsorption 3 2 3 analysis of hydrophobicity mechanism in addition to establishing the biosorption according to zeta potential eps on surface of strain tai 03 could also provide active binding sites for ppcps adsorption and thus form the stable eps ppcps complexes through hydrophobic interaction xu et al 2013 as shown in fig 4e f and 4g compared with the control group strain tai 03 eps secretion increased by 0 05 g in response to ppcps on 1st day while ros probe indicated that biological activity was not inhibited by ppcps moreover eps concentration with cip addition increased by only 3 89 as compared to sdz addition meanwhile the average pn ps of cip 0 33 was higher than that of sdz 0 22 during the ppcps removal process indicating that microalgae s eps could offer more availability of adsorption sites and binding strength during cip removal mei et al 2009 spath et al 1998 to further investigate the adsorption of ppcps by eps the eps concentrations were determined after extraction by addition of nan3 the results showed that eps content of microalgae was highly associated with ppcps adsorption as shown in fig 4h the low concentration of sdz 0 04 mg l 1 in eps resulted in the reduced importance of biosorption 0 52 and biodegradation 17 05 elimination routes table s6 in contrast the maximum adsorption of cip by eps reached 0 57 mg l 1 on the 2nd day interestingly unlike the entrapped adsorption tendency of eps by activated sludge cip adsorbed by eps was gradually reduced after the 2nd day indicating that fraction of cip in eps had been internalized by microalgal cells based on 3d eem analysis a peak at ex em of 270 290 300 375 nm corresponding to tryptophan was detected in eps samples treated with cip fig s3 chen et al 2003 these results indicate that tryptophan like proteins may play an important role in adsorption of cip by eps moreover ftir results further confirmed changes in chemical groups of proteins as shown in fig 4i the peaks at 1616 cm 1 1637 cm 1 and 3413 cm 1 were attributed to the co stretching vibration n h bending and o h or n h stretching vibrations of amine in proteins respectively jia et al 2017 liu and fang 2003 importantly co bond in proteins carries a negative charge ohko et al 2002 which also preferentially benefits cip adsorption with the intensities of above peaks weakening following exposure suggesting that eps amine groups were involved in cip adsorption it has been well established that n h and co functional groups are mainly derived from proteins in eps with proteins having strong hydrophobicity that may contribute to organic pollutants adsorption mei et al 2009 spath et al 1998 besides the band visible between 3200 and 3500 cm 1 and the peak at 1085 cm 1 indicate that hydroxyl groups of protein and stretching vibration of c o c in polysaccharides also participated in adsorption of ppcps to eps jia et al 2017 undoubtedly different biosorption mechanisms contribute to the distinctive elimination routes observed for cip and sdz resulting in clear differences in biodegradation efficiency due to the stable thickness biofilm blocking the ppcps transport routes massive ppcps was trapped in the eps of activated sludge torresi et al 2017 then the ppcps would consequently release into the surface water without further biodegradation costa et al 2019 fortunately due to the limited eps existed on the surface of microalgae the ppcps would be diffused smoothly into intracellular for complete biodegradation comparing to sludge microalgae would provide a promising potential to remove ppcps with satisfactory biodegradation efficiency 3 3 photolysis and biodegradation of cip and sdz by chlamydomonas sp tai 03 3 3 1 the photolysis and biodegradation pathway of cip as shown in fig 5 and table s7 five intermediates and two pathways were identified for cip photolysis process the result indicated that the direct attacks by hydroxyl radical and hydrated electron to cip were two main photocatalytic degradation pathway firstly hydroxylating the c10 site of cip could form the m z 348 intermediate after that the hydroxylation of c5 site followed by simultaneous defluorination and oxidation at c6 position for m z 348 would arouse to form the product m z 362 then the product m z 348 would endure the decarboxylation followed by hydroxylation at site c9 to form the compound m z 334 moreover cip contains more binding sites which may be more available for attack by hydrated electrons an et al 2010 according to the frontier orbital theory and calculated value of the frontier electron densities fed the first reaction site n12 has the highest value of 2fed2 highest occupied molecular orbital 2fed2 homo ohko et al 2002 zhang et al 2008 allowing electron to be easily extracted additionally sulfate could be reduced to sulfite by atp sulfurylase and adenosine 5 phosphosulfate while photolysis of sulfite in solution may produce the hydrated electrons e to attack cip an et al 2010 li et al 2012 through hydrated electron the piperazinyl ring of cip was partially and completely elimination after the n12 site was attacked generating intermediates m z 306 and 263 respectively in addition six intermediates were determined during cip biodegradation fig 5 due to the similar ms fragmentation patterns fig s4 the photolysis product of m z 306 might be defluorinated by cytochrome p450 and dioxygenase to form the intermediate m z 288 a maia et al 2014 wetzatein et al 1999 following this the product m z 190 might be formed by the direct cleavage of c n bond of the naphthalene group on c1 site of intermediate m z 288 a liao et al 2016 finally the pyridine ring on m z 190 could be broken by the dioxygenase and then formed intermediate m z 104 guengerich 2018 meanwhile after the fluoride group on the benzene ring and the cyclopropane group on the n36 site of m z 288 b were removed m z 243 could be produced by addition of a methyl group as previously reported gao et al 2018 moreover the benzene ring of m z 334 intermediate underwent a meta cleavage to form m z 113 in this study we clearly demonstrated two main biodegradation mechanisms for cip including a detoxification mechanism and enzymatic biodegradation via mono and dioxygenases gao et al 2018 guengerich 2018 wei et al 2019 meanwhile the intermediates e g m z 288 a and m z 243 resulting from loss of fluorine in the benzene ring indicated the toxicity was reduced to microalgal cells liao et al 2016 maia et al 2014 wang et al 2018 additionally it has been reported that phase ii enzymes e g glutathione s transferases can be used as a biocatalyst for conjugating glutathione into electrophilic compounds ding et al 2017 which may result in opening of the epoxide ring due to cleavage of the benzene ring by hydroxyl radical attack mono or dioxygenase was confirmed to be involved in biodegradation of cip e g m z 113 3 3 2 the photolysis and biodegradation pathway of sdz as shown in fig 6 and table s8 only three intermediates m z 281 m z 215 and m z 121 were detected during sdz photolysis degradation process suggesting that the structure of sdz was more stable than that of cip the oxidation of the amine group in the benzene ring of sdz will lead to form intermediate m z 281 then the intermediates at m z 215 and m z 121 were generated from m z 281 by opening the pyridine ring and cleavage of c n bonds respectively fig s5 zou et al 2014 five intermediates were identified during biodegradation fig 6 firstly three intermediates m z 243 m z 229 and m z 257 were produced via the loss of a pyridine ring with addition of a c3h4oo group c3h5o group and c4h10n2 group on the amino group site respectively then intermediate m z 157 was formed by cleavage of c n bond and m z 127 intermediate was formed by hydroxylation of benzene ring of m z 157 molecule by cytochrome p450 guengerich 2018 the higher molecular weight of intermediates generated from sdz as compared to cip may result from the relatively minor contributions of biosorption overall the total organic carbon toc removal percentage of cip and sdz were 60 29 and 27 49 at the 9th days of biodegradation respectively as shown in table s9 these results suggested that the above determined intermediates of cip and sdz would be further oxidized and then mineralized an et al 2010 in this study the cip and sdz degradation intermediates have been comprehensively identified which indicated that both the process of biosorption and characteristics of ppcps would obviously affect the following microalgal biodegradation meanwhile biodegradation and photolysis appear to be the main elimination routes for cip and sdz respectively overall strain tai 03 was found to be capable of efficiently removing cip providing a novel insight into microalgal ppcps treatment 3 4 the effect of cip and sdz on bioethanol production by chlamydomonas sp tai 03 3 4 1 estimation of the properties of cip and sdz degradation intermediates to date although ppcps degradation has attracted much attention environmental assessment of degraded intermediates are generally lacking according to the pbt criteria proposed by the usepa and european commission ec howard and muir 2010 li et al 2018 none of identified cip and sdz intermediates exhibited long range transport potential in water bodies table s10 additionally all intermediates presented a log kow of 5 and a bcf of 5000 l kg 1 indicating that both cip and sdz degradation products exhibited no risk of bioaccumulation meanwhile through preliminary toxicological impacts of these compounds were analyzed using ecosar analysis all intermediates were found to present a limited risk of toxicity to both fresh and saltwater fish li et al 2018 these results suggested that the intermediates of cip and sdz generated by microalgal treatment might effectively meet the practical demand 3 4 2 ethanol conversion from sugar rich chlamydomonas sp tai 03 to enhance the downstream application potential of microalgal ppcps treatment the conversion yield of hydrolyzed microalgal carbohydrates mainly starch to ethanol has previously been investigated the study evaluated the use of ethanol producing strain z mobilis atcc29191 through the shf process to further evaluate the biorefinery value of ppcps treated microalgal cells ho et al 2013 as shown in fig s6 the maximum microalgal ethanol production of 13 01 g l 1 was achieved with nearly 99 80 of theoretical ethanol yield achieved after cip treatment demonstrating that ppcps treated microalgal sugar rich biomass could provide a superior feedstock for bioenergy generation increasing commercial viability of microalgal ppcps removal process 4 conclusions this study comprehensively demonstrates that chlamydomonas sp tai 03 was capable of efficient cip and sdz removal by biodegradation and photolysis respectively notably during the ppcps removal process adsorption may play an essential role according to the zeta potential of the assessed ppcps the adsorption of cip was ten fold higher than sdz in cell secreted eps in addition these are the first results to show that microalgal eps prefers to absorb cip rather than sdz which further provided a novel insight into the transfer of ppcps charges from the negative to positive to improve adsorption by eps meanwhile these findings suggest that cip and sdz were mainly adsorbed on eps through binding to carbonyl and amine groups in tryptophan protein like substances and hydroxyl groups of eps although activated sludge can also absorb considerable amounts of cip and sdz its mass transfer efficiency is much lower than microalgae due to congestion from large amounts of eps more importantly these findings disclosed the cip and sdz photolysis and biodegradation pathways via microalgae which clearly confirm the microalgal ppcps removal mechanism consequently due to the limited toxicity of intermediates generated during the microalgal ppcps removal process these findings demonstrate that microalgae can be developed as a novel integrated biological system for ppcps removal in the municipal wastewater with n p removal efficiency and bioenergy generation therefore this method may achieve the goals of waste recycled bio circular economy design if the challenges of up scaled systems can be overcome

18149,the presence of dissolved organic matter dom can exert a strong influence on the effectiveness of the uv chlorine process this study examined the impact of five dom isolates with different characteristics on the degradation kinetics of model contaminant primidone pm during uv chlorine treatment the formation of disinfection by products dbps from dom after 15 min uv chlorine treatment followed by 24 h chlorination was investigated and compared with chlorination alone the use of chemical probes and radical scavengers revealed that oh and clo were the main radical species responsible for the loss of pm at acidic and alkaline conditions respectively all tested dom isolates significantly inhibited the decay of pm a strong negative correlation 0 93 was observed between the decay rate constants of pm and suva of dom isolates except for efom isolate which induced the strongest inhibitory effect due to its higher abundance in sulfur containing functional groups i e sink of oh cl radicals compared with chlorination the formation of adsorbable organic chlorine aocl and trichloromethane tcm during the uv chlorine process was enhanced and hindered for low suva isolates and high suva dom respectively however dichloroacetonitrile dcan formation was generally lower for all isolates except for ribou reservoir dom at ph 8 4 because of its high reactive nitrogenous dbp precursors at caustic conditions however when normalized to the chlorine consumed the uv chlorine process always led to a lower dbps formation compared with chlorination alone graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv chlorine primidone dissolved organic matter disinfection by products suva 1 introduction recently the combination of uv irradiation and chlorine has gained increasing scientific and technological interests as a promising advanced oxidation process aop for drinking water wastewater and reclaimed water treatment the uv photolysis of chlorine generates hydroxyl radicals oh and chlorine radicals cl as the primary radical species which further react with hocl ocl and chloride ion leading to the formation of clo and cl2 as secondary radical species nowell and hoigné 1992 feng et al 2007 watts and linden 2007 jin et al 2011 fang et al 2014 chuang et al 2017 it is well known that oh non selectively oxidizes a variety of substrates at nearly diffusion controlled rates which however could result in a significant loss of efficiency in complex environmental matrices due to a radical scavenging effect induced by background substances compared with oh reactive chlorine species rcs are relatively less affected by solution chemistry ascribing to their more selective characteristics and preferentially targeting organic compounds containing electron rich moieties such as phenols anilines olefins and amines guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 therefore the diverse radical species simultaneously present in the uv chlorine process provide a higher efficiency toward a broader spectrum of molecular structures and organic contaminants however the radical chemistry of the uv chlorine process is dependent on water matrices the ph affects the generation and transformation rates of radical species by influencing the speciation of hocl and ocl pka 7 5 watts and linden 2007 carbonates are known as important sinks of oh cl and cl2 radicals k 105 108 m 1 s 1 resulting in the formation of a relatively weak oxidizing carbonate radical co3 grebel et al 2010 zhang and parker 2018 dissolved organic matter dom a highly heterogeneous mixture of organic molecules ubiquitously present in aquatic environments is of special concern because it exerts a strong influence on the performance of the uv chlorine process by playing multiple roles the light absorbing chemical structures i e chromophores in dom species can attenuate the intensity of uv irradiation and consequently lead to a loss in photolytic rate of chlorine decomposition meanwhile uv absorbed by dom can generate highly reactive species e g 3dom 1o2 and oh which will contribute to the transformation of contaminants varanasi et al 2018 zhang and parker 2018 contrariwise specific functional groups within dom can induce significant scavenging of radicals and consequently alter and complex the transformation of both contaminants and dom itself the scavenging capacity of dom depends on its molecular composition and the specific reactivity of the existing organic moieties with radical species the apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of generic dom with oh cl and clo are 2 5 104 1 3 104 and 4 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 respectively kong et al 2018 suggesting that dom is more susceptible to clo attack particularly the importance of clo in the uv chlorine process towards some micropollutants has been recently highlighted due to its high concentration i e 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of oh and cl and relatively high reaction rates k 107 109 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2017 nevertheless the molecular diversity of dom can influence the overall radical reaction mechanism by promoting inhibiting preferential radical attack and thus significantly influence the efficiency of the uv chlorine process hence exploring the influence of the origin and nature of aquatic dom on the underlying radical mechanisms controlled by the overall scavenging effect is required to better understand the effectiveness of the uv chlorine process for removing specific contaminants in addition to altering substrate transformation kinetics and interacting with photons dom incorporates major precursors of disinfection by products dbps which are of serious human health and ecological concern during chlorination processes the quantities and speciation of dbps formed are strongly affected by the origin and character of the dom kitis et al 2002 williams et al 2019 previous studies demonstrated that the hydrophobic fraction of dom rich in aromatic moieties e g phenolic structures and conjugated double bonds contributes to a key pool of dbps precursors reckhow et al 1990 onnby et al 2018 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva i e used as a surrogate parameter to assess the aromaticity and reactivity of dom weishaar et al 2003 generally correlates well with the formation of regulated and unknown dbps during chlorination croué et al 2000 hua et al 2015 the differential uv i e change in uv absorbance of dom was also observed as a good surrogate for dbp formation korshin et al 1999 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 however under uv chlorine process conditions dom can be simultaneously attacked by chlorine the formed oh radical and rcs thus inducing the subsequent modification of its reactivity towards chlorine and radical species li et al 2016 varanasi et al 2018 therefore the formation and distribution of dbps in uv chlorine systems may significantly differ from those upon chlorination nevertheless the concern regarding the side effect of dbps formation within the uv chlorine process is still debated as previous studies have recorded contradictive dbps formations i e probably due to significant differences in experimental setups lamsal et al 2011 li et al 2016 wu et al 2016 dong et al 2017 wang et al 2017 however limited information is available regarding the role of dom character and associated correlation to dbps formation in the uv chlorine process the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of dom source and character on contaminant degradation kinetics by the uv chlorine process and to assess the formation of dbps and adsorbable organic chlorine aocl five dom isolates of different origins four surface waters and one treated urban wastewater and varying structural characteristics were examined the changes in the properties of dom during the process were characterized by measuring the variation of the uv absorption coefficient cm 1 additionally the radical chemistry under different conditions for contaminant removal was elucidated primidone pm a typical refractory micropollutant showing resistance to both uv photolysis and chlorination was selected as the model contaminant 2 materials and

that the 2 5 mm phosphate buffer did not interfere with the degradation efficiency data not shown the reaction was initiated by dosing a specific amount of free chlorine stock solution into the reactor while simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation samples were collected at predetermined time intervals and the residual chlorine was immediately quenched with sodium metabisulphite in slight excess before analysis by high performance liquid chromatography hplc within 2 h experiments with uv alone and chlorine alone under a free chlorine dose of 70 μm i e 5 mg l 1 in the dark were also conducted to elucidate the role of uv photolysis and chlorination in contaminant removal for dbps formation tests solutions of dom isolate 5 0 mg c l 1 in 2 5 mm phosphate buffer at ph 6 2 or 8 4 without contaminant addition were dosed with 70 μm free chlorine and were simultaneously subjected to uv irradiation for 15 min uv fluence 340 550 mj cm 2 depending on the dom character subsequently the solutions were immediately transferred into amber bottles sealed and kept without headspace for 24 h in the dark i e chlorination the chlorine residual was then measured and quenched before analyzing trihalomethanes thms haloacetonitriles hans and aocl for pre uv experiments the solutions were subjected to uv irradiation for 15 min followed by the injection of 70 μm free chlorine for 24 h the reaction was stopped with the addition of the reducing agent in slight excess for comparison purposes dbps formation from each dom isolate by chlorination only was examined using a similar approach without uv exposure all experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 2 c in duplicate or triplicate whereby the average values were presented 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of residual pm probes and chlorine the concentrations of pm nitrobenzene nb and benzoic acid ba were quantified using an agilent 1100 hplc system equipped with an agilent xdb c18 reversed phase column 5 μm particle size 250 mm 4 6 mm and a diode array detector while the wavelengths were set at 218 270 and 230 nm for pm nb and ba respectively the mobile phase was made of 50 methanol 50 phosphoric acid 0 1 v v and was eluted at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the concentration of free chlorine was determined using the dpd colorimetric method moore et al 1984 2 3 2 characterization of dom isolates the

adsorption on activated carbon column using a tox sample preparatory unit and then measured by combustion and ion chromatography method using an automatic quick furnace aqf 100 with online ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 kristiana et al 2015 2 3 4 kinetic modeling the uv chlorine process was modeled using kintecus v6 70 simulation software to evaluate the steady state concentrations of different radical species ianni 2018 approximately 110 elementary reactions with rate constants obtained from the literature were incorporated into the model fang et al 2014 guo et al 2018 the details of the principal reactions involved in this study are provided in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of pm degradation preliminary experiments were conducted to investigate the loss of free chlorine i e hocl and ocl under uv photolysis at ph 5 9 and were reported in the si section text s4 and fig s2 initial experiments demonstrated that pm was photo resistant resulting in a negligible removal 4 at the applied incident fluence of 750 mj cm 2 across ph 5 9 fig s3 the degradation of pm under exposure to 70 μm free chlorine was also insignificant 5 due to the recalcitrance of amide groups toward chlorination hureiki et al 1994 in contrast pm was efficiently eliminated 87 in the uv chlorine process because of the simultaneous generation of oh and rcs as shown in fig 1 the degradation of pm by the uv h2o2 process was also investigated for comparison purposes as shown in fig 1 the uv chlorine aop demonstrated a considerably higher efficacy for degrading pm specifically the observed pseudo first order rate constant k obs 2 4 10 4 s 1 was 2 2 fold higher than that obtained from uv h2o2 aop 1 1 10 4 s 1 likely attributed to the reaction of pm with rcs as well as the higher quantum yields and molar absorption coefficients of free chlorine species at 254 nm as compared with those of h2o2 the quantum yields of hocl ocl and h2o2 under uv254 were reported as 0 62 1 5 0 55 1 3 and 0 5 1 1 mol es 1 respectively while their molar absorption coefficients were 59 66 and 19 6 m 1 cm 1 respectively feng et al 2007 watts and linden 2007 jin et al 2011 fang et al 2014 sun et al 2016 chuang et al 2017 the initial dose of chlorine can affect the process efficiency by influencing the speciation of radical species the removal of pm significantly increased from 63 to 96 as chlorine dose increased from 10 to 50 μm as a result the corresponding k obs increased 2 7 fold fig 2 a and b suggesting a promoted radical exposure however further increment in the chlorine dose to 100 μm resulted in minimal enhancement of pm removal the kinetic modeling indicated that under similar conditions the average clo content ranged from 10 10 to 10 9 m specifically 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than oh content fig 2c the modeled concentration of cl was 20 of the oh concentration cl2 was present at a considerably lower level compared with other radicals both oh and cl radicals gradually increased as the chlorine dose increased from 10 to 50 μm then leveled off due to the scavenging effect of excess hocl ocl or cl i e present at equimolar of free chlorine contributed from hypochlorite stock solutions consequently yielding more clo and cl2 radicals eqs 1 5 as a result the enhanced formation of the secondary clo and cl2 radicals was calculated from the model with increasing chlorine concentration however the nonlinear increase in the rate constants of pm degradation suggests that the reactivity of clo with pm was not fast enough to offset the contributions of oh and cl scavenged by excess chlorine 1 hocl o h clo h 2 o k 2 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 2 ocl o h clo oh k 8 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 cl hocl clo h cl k 3 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 4 cl ocl clo cl k 8 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 5 cl cl cl 2 k 8 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 2 contribution of different radical species for differentiating the contribution of reactive radicals to pm decay in the uv chlorine process the oh and cl concentrations were experimentally determined based on the degradation of nb and ba as relevant radical probes fig s4 calculation detailed in si text s5 and s6 besides the second order rate constant of cl reaction with pm k cl pm was determined as 3 19 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 based on a similar approach and competition kinetics of pm and ba degradation in the uv chlorine process under higher ph condition the suspected contribution of clo led to a second order rate constant higher than the diffusion controlled rate constant fig 3 illustrates the overall rate constants of nb ba and pm loss at ph 5 9 and the specific rate constants of pm degradation remarkably the radical chemistry and the degradation of pm were not significantly affected by the presence of probes except for ph 5 i e a condition that favors the production of oh radicals fig s5 the performance of the uv chlorine process was maximized at ph 5 with complete removal of pm at 15 min an increase in solution ph from 5 to 8 4 resulted in a substantial decrease in the degradation rate of both probes and pm while the rate constants were not affected at alkaline conditions primidone i e pka of 12 3 mainly occurred as one species and exhibited a similar photolysis rate under the investigated ph range fig s3 schaffer et al 2012 thus the significant ph dependence of the uv chlorine process efficiency in degrading pm was most likely attributed to the shift in chlorine speciation toward ocl at increasing ph the higher abundance of ocl could enhance the scavenging of oh and cl and simultaneously increase the production of clo radical as shown in fig 3b oh was the main radical species responsible for the loss of pm at acidic ph while the degradation of pm at alkaline conditions was mainly attributed to rcs species at ph 7 both oh and rcs participated in the pm decay under similar ratios 42 and 55 respectively as the solution ph increased from 5 to 9 k oh decreased from 3 5 10 3 to 2 5 10 4 s 1 while the contribution of oh to the overall k obs of pm loss decreased from 88 8 to 14 7 on the contrary the corresponding contribution of rcs increased from 9 4 to 82 5 to further distinguish the specific roles of individual rcs i e cl cl2 and clo on the degradation of pm the impact of other radical promoter or scavenger was investigated the addition of 10 mm tert butyl alcohol tba a strong scavenger of oh and cl decreased the overall k obs of pm degradation by 90 from 4 29 10 3 to 4 3 10 4 s 1 fig s6 tba quenched 99 of oh which contributed to 88 8 of pm decay at ph 5 this finding suggested an insignificant involvement of cl for pm transformation the presence of 10 mm chloride had negligible effect on the degradation rate of pm fig s7 although cl2 content increased by 4 orders of magnitude and the concentration of other radicals remained unchanged table s2 this result supports the hypothesis that the role of cl2 radical was insignificant the presence of 100 mm hco3 at ph 8 4 only resulted in a 1 7 and 7 6 decrease of pm removal and decay rate respectively fig s8 the kinetic modeling showed that 94 of oh and cl were quenched by 100 mm hco3 whereas clo was not affected due to its low reactivity toward hco3 meanwhile the model simulation indicated that a relatively high concentration of co3 5 37 10 10 m was formed in the system nevertheless the contribution of co3 on the degradation of pm was negligible because pm exhibited high resistance to co3 oxidation text s7 and fig s9 the above observations suggest that clo is the predominant reactive radical responsible for the decay of pm at alkaline conditions this result confirmed the importance of clo in degrading some micropollutants as previously reported wu et al 2016 kong et al 2018 tba is a known efficient scavenger of both oh and cl however its reactivity toward clo is still unclear the second order rate constant for the reaction of tba with clo was recently determined as 1 3 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2017 however our results showed that this value might be highly overestimated given the minimal effect of 10 mm tba on the degradation of pm at ph 8 4 fig s8 considering the predominant role of clo in pm transformation at alkaline conditions the second order rate constant of clo with pm was roughly estimated as 1 12 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 4 by taking the specific k rcs as k clo and using its steady state concentration from the model simulation this value was more than an order of magnitude lower than the one recently determined by guo et al 2018 using competition kinetics the reason for this difference is currently unknown 3 3 impact of dom character on the performance of the uv chlorine process in this study the observed rate constants wu et al 2017 guo et al 2018 were used over the fluence based rate constants miklos et al 2019 to express the overall reactivity of the processes because the uv irradiation absorbed by dom also generates highly reactive oxygen species i e photosensitizer property that can contribute to the radical chemistry all 5 dom isolates 5 mg c l 1 considerably inhibited the transformation of pm in the uv chlorine process nevertheless the degree of inhibition varied distinctively depending on the character of the dom isolate and the solution ph as shown in fig 4 and fig s10 the rate constants for uv irradiation and chlorination only were not plotted in the figures due to their negligible contribution to the degradation of pm the overall rate constants k obs specific rate constants k oh and k rcs for pm decay at ph 6 2 decreased by 54 74 58 82 44 69 respectively the addition of dom at ph 8 4 induced a relatively slight decline in the process performance compared with those at ph 6 2 with an 18 37 and 19 42 decrease for k obs and k rcs respectively a strong negative correlation 0 93 was observed between the k obs of pm degradation and suva except for j hpo isolate it is well known that efom is enriched in organic sulfur chos and chnos originated from detergents gonsior et al 2011 niu et al 2018 s containing functional groups e g sulfides are preferentially susceptible to cl attack via single electron transfer donating electrons to c h bonds and resulting in enhanced h abstraction by oh cl varanasi et al 2018 consequently the j hpo isolate i e with a relatively low suva but higher abundance in chos and chnos compounds compared with the four surface water dom isolates exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on the uv chlorine process at ph 6 2 when oh and cl were relatively abundant in the system except for the j hpo isolate the good correlation is consistent with the fact that dom isolates enriched with electron rich moieties e g conjugated double bond olefins and amines are more vulnerable to both oh and rcs attack wang et al 2017 zhang and parker 2018 compared with the control at ph 6 2 the presence of s hpoa dom isolate i e which showed the highest suva 5 11 suppressed 70 of both oh and cl based on the decay of probes therefore resulting in a 70 decrease in k obs of pm decay from 3 53 10 3 to 1 05 10 3 s 1 while the c hpo fraction i e characterized by the lowest suva 1 92 exhibited the lowest inhibitory effect a good correlation could be established for k oh at ph 6 2 and k rcs at ph 8 4 with suva nevertheless k rcs at ph 8 4 showed considerably higher linearity with suva r2 0 98 suggesting that the aromatic components of dom isolate are the predominant sinks of clo in contrast other components i e except for the electron rich groups also contributed to the consumption of oh as elucidated by varanasi et al 2018 oh can induce distinct transformation in the aliphatic component of dom this may explain the significantly stronger inhibitory impact of dom at ph 6 2 than that of ph 8 4 since the uv absorbance of the dom solution generally correlates well with the activated aromatic moiety content changes in uv254 during the uv chlorine process were recorded the differential uv254 15 absorbance δuv254 15 uv254 0 uv254 15 min which refers to the cleavage of unsaturated cc bonds of aromatic rings and olefins was calculated as a surrogate for dom transformation in agreement with previous studies wang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 uv chlorine co exposure induced a more significant decrease in the uv absorbance of the dom solutions while there was a minor decay by chlorine only and no significant decay by uv only the higher the initial suva the larger the δuv254 15 fig s11 strong correlations could be established between δuv254 15 vs k oh and k obs at ph 6 2 or k rcs and k obs at ph 8 4 fig 4 indicating that both oh and clo play an important role in degrading the conjugated structure of the chromophoric groups interestingly the relationship between δuv254 15 and k oh or k rcs established at ph 6 2 and ph 8 4 respectively fitted into the same linear correlation fig 4 this finding may indicate that oh and clo exert similar reactivity toward aromatic moieties 3 4 dbps formation from dom isolates several series of experiments were conducted with five dom fractions at ph 6 2 and ph 8 4 to compare the formation of dbps upon chlorination only uv followed by chlorination and combined uv chlorine process aocl trichloromethane tcm and dichloroacetonitrile dcan were considered in the following discussion i e no noticeable amount of trichloroacetonitrile was detected in the chromatograms 3 4 1 chlorination alone and pre uv chlorination the results obtained from chlorination experiments were in agreement with previous findings hwang et al 2001 hua and reckhow 2008 wang et al 2015a for all fractions the production of aocl and dcan was higher at ph 6 2 compared with that at ph 8 4 contrariwise the formation of tcm was higher at ph 8 4 than at ph 6 2 as previously observed wang et al 2012 pre uv irradiation led to the decrease of tcm i e no decrease with c hpo and dcan production table s3 however no noticeable impact was observed for aocl formation the formation of aocl and tcm increased linearly with the suva of the dom fractions fig s12 for aocl formation a unique correlation for the two ph conditions was obtained with the differential uv254 24 absorbance values δuv254 24 uv254 0 uv254 24h however distinct correlations were observed for tcm fig 5 good exponential relationships were obtained between dcan formation and c n ratio fig s13 the lower the c n ratio the higher the formation r hpo showed the highest production of dcan a dom fraction enriched in carboxyl rich aliphatic molecules cram incorporating nitrogen isolated from the ribou reservoir that is known for being impacted by algal blooms niu et al 2018 3 4 2 combined uv chlorine treatment uv chlorine experiments were conducted using similar chlorination conditions as the one used for chlorination alone 5 mg c l 1 of dom 70 μm free chlorine in the presence of dom 50 90 of the injected chlorine was consumed after 15 min irradiation i e higher chlorine demand at ph 6 2 compared with ph 8 4 while only 15 was degraded in the absence of dom figs s2 and s14 overall the higher the suva the higher the chlorine demand a strong correlation was established between the chlorine demand at 15 min and δuv254 15 fig 6 this correlation excluded j hpo which exerted a higher chlorine demand than expected from this correlation no chlorine residual was recorded after 24 h following 15 min uv chlorine treatment except for c hpo lowest suva dom for which the chlorine residual was 0 17 and 1 7 mg l 1 at ph 6 2 and 8 4 respectively as shown in fig s11 the chlorination reaction following the uv chlorine co exposure did not significantly increase δuv254 15 i e δuv254 24 which increased with suva and was higher at ph 6 2 than ph 8 4 however the difference in δuv254 15 between uv chlorine and chlorine only was also observed with δuv254 24 especially for low and medium suva dom this difference can be ascribed to the significant chlorine consumption degradation occurring during the uv chlorine process leading to the production of radical species i e more abundant at ph 6 2 than at ph 8 4 that are highly reactive with aromatic moieties westerhoff et al 1999 varanasi et al 2018 the production of dbps during chlorination and uv chlorine processes is shown in fig s15 the ratios of the dbps produced with the two processes were plotted as a function of suva for comparing the results fig 7 at ph 6 2 good relationships were obtained when excluding j hpo from the data set specifically the lower the suva the higher the dbp ratios the unique reactivity feature of j hpo at ph 6 2 has been previously discussed its higher sulfur containing character enhanced its reactivity with oh cl by h abstraction which was apparently associated with the degradation of dbp precursors for low suva isolates c hpo 1 92 and b hpo 2 45 the uv chlorine process enhanced aocl and tcm formation but decreased dbp productions for high suva s hpoa 5 11 at ph 6 2 moderate suva r hpo 3 24 showed no aocl and tcm difference between the two processes at acid ph the aop treatment showed lower dcan formation for all isolates at ph 8 4 good relationships were also established when excluding the high thm and dcan ratios obtained for r hpo a fraction of dom enriched in nitrogenous dbp precursors originating from algal blooms i e the base form of amino acids at ph 8 4 is more reactive than the zwitterion form at ph 6 2 except for dcan results i e comparable at both ph conditions the difference between the two sets of data was more significant at acid ph similar findings have been discussed in the literature li et al 2016 and wang et al 2017 obtained a lower tcm formation with high suva dom after uv chlorine exposure compared with chlorine alone wang et al 2015b indicated that the uv chlorine process increased the dbp formation potential fp of low suva treated water the effect was generally more pronounced at ph 6 5 compared with ph 8 5 however contradictory results were also published showing an increase liu et al 2012 sun et al 2019 or no modification zhao et al 2011 of dbpfp after the uv chlorine treatment of high suva dom as previously discussed ph influences the distribution of radical species in solution and in particular controls the abundance of oh radical i e more abundant at acid ph the oh radical may play a major role in the transformation of organic matter during the uv chlorine co exposure which does not exclude the possible role of other radicals the oh radical can activate dbp precursors of low suva dom and degrade dbp precursors of high suva dom in accordance with the current results dotson et al 2010 and metz et al 2011 observed an increase in tox and or tthm formation after the uv h2o2 treatment of low suva treated river waters this observation was attributed to the reaction of oh radical contrarywise for a high suva river water 3 16 lamsal et al 2011 observed a substantial decrease in tthmfp a decrease in thmfp sarathy and mohseni 2010 and dcan formation chu et al 2014 srithep and phattarapattamawong 2017 following uv h2o2 treatment was also observed for moderate 2 5 3 5 and low 1 3 1 9 suva waters if the current results are in good agreement with the literature the experimental conditions might have accentuated the difference between the chlorination and uv chlorine co exposure results unlike the cited publications only c hpo showed residual chlorine at the end of the reaction 24 h results indicated that the difference in dbps formation from the two reaction conditions increased with the amount of residual chlorine present after the 15 min uv chlorine treatment fig s16 suggesting that dbp formation from the uv chlorine process could be underestimated when compared with chlorine only this finding does not compromise our previous comments for low and moderate suva dom isolates c hpo b hpo and r hpo and the effect of ph i e no significant difference in chlorine demand was observed at ph 6 2 and 8 4 for the high suva s hpoa fraction the significant difference recorded between the two processes could be reduced with the use of a higher chlorine dose allowing the presence of residual chlorine after 24 h of reaction because the chlorine dose applied for this study led to a major reduction of the uv absorbing moieties i e dbp precursors during the 15 min uv chlorine treatment the use of a higher chlorine dose should not significantly increase the tcm formation the unique reactivity of j hpo should be further explored in fig 8 dbp formations were normalized to the chlorine consumed to take into account the significant difference in chlorine demand between the two processes as observed by wang et al 2017 and for all dom isolates and ph conditions the normalized norm dbp formation was always lower after uv chlorine co exposure compared to chlorination and pre uv chlorination fig s17 pre uv irradiation only slightly decreased norm aocl more significant reductions were observed for norm tcm and norm dcan the relative abundances of tcm and dcan to aocl were depicted in fig s18 at ph 6 2 and for all dom isolates tcm aocl ratios for the uv chlorine process were comparable or slightly higher in comparison with chlorination while the dcan aocl ratios were significantly lower with the uv chlorine process at ph 8 4 higher tcm aocl ratios were obtained for all dom isolates with uv chlorine co exposure except for s hpoa nevertheless dcan aocl ratios remained lower in the presence than in the absence of uv irradiation except for r hpo which showed the opposite trend however the difference is less pronounced at ph 8 4 these results indicate that radicals have diverse impacts on dbps precursors the strong reactivity of nitrogenous organics with oh radicals chu et al 2014 preferentially degrades dcan precursors oh radicals seem to induce the formation of tcm precursors while clo which is predominant at basic ph may contribute to tcm formation finally we should indicate that our lab scale experimental conditions are truly different from real field applications i e irradiation time on the order of seconds with much more powerful uv irradiance previous results obtained from full scale uv chlorine trials suggested that rcs generated during the aop process do not significantly contribute to the formation of dbps it was proposed that the production of oh radicals during the uv chlorine co exposure especially at lower ph could enhance the reactivity of dom with chlorine due to the formation of stronger dbp precursors susceptible to produce aox and specific dbps i e han at very short contact time i e few seconds wang et al 2015b 2019 4 conclusions in this study the uv chlorine process exhibited a significant synergetic effect in eliminating pm 87 due to the simultaneous generation of oh and rcs in the system while uv alone and chlorine only resulted in negligible pm decay modeling and experimental results indicated that oh is mainly responsible for the loss of pm at acidic ph while the degradation of pm at alkaline conditions was mainly attributed to clo the presence of 5 mg c l 1 dom substantially suppressed the k obs of pm decay in the uv chlorine process by 18 74 depending on the dom character and solution ph except for j hpo isolate a strong negative correlation was observed between the k obs of pm degradation and the suva of dom due to the high reactivity of electron rich moieties towards oh and rcs attack the j hpo isolate an efom fraction with a relatively low suva but higher abundance in organic sulfur exhibited the strongest inhibition effect on the uv chlorine process likely resulting from the enhanced sink of oh and cl radicals by s containing groups compared with chlorination the uv chlorine process under our lab scale experimental conditions i e uv chlorine co exposure during several minutes to reach the desired fluence conditions strictly different from few seconds contact time with much more intense uv light that would be applied with full scale treatment unit promoted aocl and tcm formation of low suva dom but lowered the dbp productions for high suva dom nevertheless the formation of dcan was always lower during uv chlorine co exposure except for r hpo which exhibited higher production of dcan at ph 8 4 due to its reactive form of nitrogenous dpb precursors at alkaline ph although the irradiation conditions applied at lab scale i e longer contact time and much lower uv intensity irradiance are different from real applications the observed impact of dom character suva a parameter commonly used by water treatment plant operators to evaluate the chemical reactivity of dom s and n content on the degradation kinetics of contaminant and formation of dbps from this study suggests that dom is an important parameter of the water matrix to control for optimizing the operation of the uv chlorine process declaration of competing interest

18149,the presence of dissolved organic matter dom can exert a strong influence on the effectiveness of the uv chlorine process this study examined the impact of five dom isolates with different characteristics on the degradation kinetics of model contaminant primidone pm during uv chlorine treatment the formation of disinfection by products dbps from dom after 15 min uv chlorine treatment followed by 24 h chlorination was investigated and compared with chlorination alone the use of chemical probes and radical scavengers revealed that oh and clo were the main radical species responsible for the loss of pm at acidic and alkaline conditions respectively all tested dom isolates significantly inhibited the decay of pm a strong negative correlation 0 93 was observed between the decay rate constants of pm and suva of dom isolates except for efom isolate which induced the strongest inhibitory effect due to its higher abundance in sulfur containing functional groups i e sink of oh cl radicals compared with chlorination the formation of adsorbable organic chlorine aocl and trichloromethane tcm during the uv chlorine process was enhanced and hindered for low suva isolates and high suva dom respectively however dichloroacetonitrile dcan formation was generally lower for all isolates except for ribou reservoir dom at ph 8 4 because of its high reactive nitrogenous dbp precursors at caustic conditions however when normalized to the chlorine consumed the uv chlorine process always led to a lower dbps formation compared with chlorination alone graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv chlorine primidone dissolved organic matter disinfection by products suva 1 introduction recently the combination of uv irradiation and chlorine has gained increasing scientific and technological interests as a promising advanced oxidation process aop for drinking water wastewater and reclaimed water treatment the uv photolysis of chlorine generates hydroxyl radicals oh and chlorine radicals cl as the primary radical species which further react with hocl ocl and chloride ion leading to the formation of clo and cl2 as secondary radical species nowell and hoigné 1992 feng et al 2007 watts and linden 2007 jin et al 2011 fang et al 2014 chuang et al 2017 it is well known that oh non selectively oxidizes a variety of substrates at nearly diffusion controlled rates which however could result in a significant loss of efficiency in complex environmental matrices due to a radical scavenging effect induced by background substances compared with oh reactive chlorine species rcs are relatively less affected by solution chemistry ascribing to their more selective characteristics and preferentially targeting organic compounds containing electron rich moieties such as phenols anilines olefins and amines guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 therefore the diverse radical species simultaneously present in the uv chlorine process provide a higher efficiency toward a broader spectrum of molecular structures and organic contaminants however the radical chemistry of the uv chlorine process is dependent on water matrices the ph affects the generation and transformation rates of radical species by influencing the speciation of hocl and ocl pka 7 5 watts and linden 2007 carbonates are known as important sinks of oh cl and cl2 radicals k 105 108 m 1 s 1 resulting in the formation of a relatively weak oxidizing carbonate radical co3 grebel et al 2010 zhang and parker 2018 dissolved organic matter dom a highly heterogeneous mixture of organic molecules ubiquitously present in aquatic environments is of special concern because it exerts a strong influence on the performance of the uv chlorine process by playing multiple roles the light absorbing chemical structures i e chromophores in dom species can attenuate the intensity of uv irradiation and consequently lead to a loss in photolytic rate of chlorine decomposition meanwhile uv absorbed by dom can generate highly reactive species e g 3dom 1o2 and oh which will contribute to the transformation of contaminants varanasi et al 2018 zhang and parker 2018 contrariwise specific functional groups within dom can induce significant scavenging of radicals and consequently alter and complex the transformation of both contaminants and dom itself the scavenging capacity of dom depends on its molecular composition and the specific reactivity of the existing organic moieties with radical species the apparent second order rate constants for the reaction of generic dom with oh cl and clo are 2 5 104 1 3 104 and 4 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 respectively kong et al 2018 suggesting that dom is more susceptible to clo attack particularly the importance of clo in the uv chlorine process towards some micropollutants has been recently highlighted due to its high concentration i e 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of oh and cl and relatively high reaction rates k 107 109 m 1 s 1 guo et al 2017 nevertheless the molecular diversity of dom can influence the overall radical reaction mechanism by promoting inhibiting preferential radical attack and thus significantly influence the efficiency of the uv chlorine process hence exploring the influence of the origin and nature of aquatic dom on the underlying radical mechanisms controlled by the overall scavenging effect is required to better understand the effectiveness of the uv chlorine process for removing specific contaminants in addition to altering substrate transformation kinetics and interacting with photons dom incorporates major precursors of disinfection by products dbps which are of serious human health and ecological concern during chlorination processes the quantities and speciation of dbps formed are strongly affected by the origin and character of the dom kitis et al 2002 williams et al 2019 previous studies demonstrated that the hydrophobic fraction of dom rich in aromatic moieties e g phenolic structures and conjugated double bonds contributes to a key pool of dbps precursors reckhow et al 1990 onnby et al 2018 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva i e used as a surrogate parameter to assess the aromaticity and reactivity of dom weishaar et al 2003 generally correlates well with the formation of regulated and unknown dbps during chlorination croué et al 2000 hua et al 2015 the differential uv i e change in uv absorbance of dom was also observed as a good surrogate for dbp formation korshin et al 1999 roccaro and vagliasindi 2009 however under uv chlorine process conditions dom can be simultaneously attacked by chlorine the formed oh radical and rcs thus inducing the subsequent modification of its reactivity towards chlorine and radical species li et al 2016 varanasi et al 2018 therefore the formation and distribution of dbps in uv chlorine systems may significantly differ from those upon chlorination nevertheless the concern regarding the side effect of dbps formation within the uv chlorine process is still debated as previous studies have recorded contradictive dbps formations i e probably due to significant differences in experimental setups lamsal et al 2011 li et al 2016 wu et al 2016 dong et al 2017 wang et al 2017 however limited information is available regarding the role of dom character and associated correlation to dbps formation in the uv chlorine process the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of dom source and character on contaminant degradation kinetics by the uv chlorine process and to assess the formation of dbps and adsorbable organic chlorine aocl five dom isolates of different origins four surface waters and one treated urban wastewater and varying structural characteristics were examined the changes in the properties of dom during the process were characterized by measuring the variation of the uv absorption coefficient cm 1 additionally the radical chemistry under different conditions for contaminant removal was elucidated primidone pm a typical refractory micropollutant showing resistance to both uv photolysis and chlorination was selected as the model contaminant 2 materials and

suggested by bolton and linden 2003 reactions were performed using a glass petri dish inner diameter 84 mm volume 200 ml positioned on a mini magnetic stirrer to provide a continuous mixing of the solution during the irradiation period the average uv irradiance across the solution reactor was determined as 0 835 mw cm 2 after calibration and correction by a certified uvc radiometer uv surface sglux germany the detailed information about the setup and the measurement of uv irradiance are provided in text s2 si for kinetic experiments fluences of 50 750 mj cm 2 i e 500 7500 j m 2 were applied to the prepared solutions unless otherwise indicated experiments were conducted in solutions spiked with 5 μm of primidone and 2 5 mm of phosphate buffer ph 5 9 preliminary experiments showed that the 2 5 mm phosphate buffer did not interfere with the degradation efficiency data not shown the reaction was initiated by dosing a specific amount of free chlorine stock solution into the reactor while simultaneously exposed to uv irradiation samples were collected at predetermined time intervals and the residual chlorine was immediately quenched with sodium metabisulphite in slight excess before analysis by high performance liquid chromatography hplc within 2 h experiments with uv alone and chlorine alone under a free chlorine dose of 70 μm i e 5 mg l 1 in the dark were also conducted to elucidate the role of uv photolysis and chlorination in contaminant removal for dbps formation tests solutions of dom isolate 5 0 mg c l 1 in 2 5 mm phosphate buffer at ph 6 2 or 8 4 without contaminant addition were dosed with 70 μm free chlorine and were simultaneously subjected to uv irradiation for 15 min uv fluence 340 550 mj cm 2 depending on the dom character subsequently the solutions were immediately transferred into amber bottles sealed and kept without headspace for 24 h in the dark i e chlorination the chlorine residual was then measured and quenched before analyzing trihalomethanes thms haloacetonitriles hans and aocl for pre uv experiments the solutions were subjected to uv irradiation for 15 min followed by the injection of 70 μm free chlorine for 24 h the reaction was stopped with the addition of the reducing agent in slight excess for comparison purposes dbps formation from each dom isolate by chlorination only was examined using a similar approach without uv exposure all experiments were conducted at room temperature 20 2 c in duplicate or triplicate whereby the average values were presented 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 analysis of residual pm probes and chlorine the concentrations of pm nitrobenzene nb and benzoic acid ba were quantified using an agilent 1100 hplc system equipped with an agilent xdb c18 reversed phase column 5 μm particle size 250 mm 4 6 mm and a diode array detector while the wavelengths were set at 218 270 and 230 nm for pm nb and ba respectively the mobile phase was made of 50 methanol 50 phosphoric acid 0 1 v v and was eluted at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 the concentration of free chlorine was determined using the dpd colorimetric method moore et al 1984 2 3 2 characterization of dom isolates the

adsorption on activated carbon column using a tox sample preparatory unit and then measured by combustion and ion chromatography method using an automatic quick furnace aqf 100 with online ion chromatography dionex ics 3000 kristiana et al 2015 2 3 4 kinetic modeling the uv chlorine process was modeled using kintecus v6 70 simulation software to evaluate the steady state concentrations of different radical species ianni 2018 approximately 110 elementary reactions with rate constants obtained from the literature were incorporated into the model fang et al 2014 guo et al 2018 the details of the principal reactions involved in this study are provided in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 kinetics of pm degradation preliminary experiments were conducted to investigate the loss of free chlorine i e hocl and ocl under uv photolysis at ph 5 9 and were reported in the si section text s4 and fig s2 initial experiments demonstrated that pm was photo resistant resulting in a negligible removal 4 at the applied incident fluence of 750 mj cm 2 across ph 5 9 fig s3 the degradation of pm under exposure to 70 μm free chlorine was also insignificant 5 due to the recalcitrance of amide groups toward chlorination hureiki et al 1994 in contrast pm was efficiently eliminated 87 in the uv chlorine process because of the simultaneous generation of oh and rcs as shown in fig 1 the degradation of pm by the uv h2o2 process was also investigated for comparison purposes as shown in fig 1 the uv chlorine aop demonstrated a considerably higher efficacy for degrading pm specifically the observed pseudo first order rate constant k obs 2 4 10 4 s 1 was 2 2 fold higher than that obtained from uv h2o2 aop 1 1 10 4 s 1 likely attributed to the reaction of pm with rcs as well as the higher quantum yields and molar absorption coefficients of free chlorine species at 254 nm as compared with those of h2o2 the quantum yields of hocl ocl and h2o2 under uv254 were reported as 0 62 1 5 0 55 1 3 and 0 5 1 1 mol es 1 respectively while their molar absorption coefficients were 59 66 and 19 6 m 1 cm 1 respectively feng et al 2007 watts and linden 2007 jin et al 2011 fang et al 2014 sun et al 2016 chuang et al 2017 the initial dose of chlorine can affect the process efficiency by influencing the speciation of radical species the removal of pm significantly increased from 63 to 96 as chlorine dose increased from 10 to 50 μm as a result the corresponding k obs increased 2 7 fold fig 2 a and b suggesting a promoted radical exposure however further increment in the chlorine dose to 100 μm resulted in minimal enhancement of pm removal the kinetic modeling indicated that under similar conditions the average clo content ranged from 10 10 to 10 9 m specifically 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than oh content fig 2c the modeled concentration of cl was 20 of the oh concentration cl2 was present at a considerably lower level compared with other radicals both oh and cl radicals gradually increased as the chlorine dose increased from 10 to 50 μm then leveled off due to the scavenging effect of excess hocl ocl or cl i e present at equimolar of free chlorine contributed from hypochlorite stock solutions consequently yielding more clo and cl2 radicals eqs 1 5 as a result the enhanced formation of the secondary clo and cl2 radicals was calculated from the model with increasing chlorine concentration however the nonlinear increase in the rate constants of pm degradation suggests that the reactivity of clo with pm was not fast enough to offset the contributions of oh and cl scavenged by excess chlorine 1 hocl o h clo h 2 o k 2 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 2 ocl o h clo oh k 8 8 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 cl hocl clo h cl k 3 0 10 9 m 1 s 1 4 cl ocl clo cl k 8 3 10 9 m 1 s 1 5 cl cl cl 2 k 8 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 3 2 contribution of different radical species for differentiating the contribution of reactive radicals to pm decay in the uv chlorine process the oh and cl concentrations were experimentally determined based on the degradation of nb and ba as relevant radical probes fig s4 calculation detailed in si text s5 and s6 besides the second order rate constant of cl reaction with pm k cl pm was determined as 3 19 1010 m 1 s 1 at ph 5 based on a similar approach and competition kinetics of pm and ba degradation in the uv chlorine process under higher ph condition the suspected contribution of clo led to a second order rate constant higher than the diffusion controlled rate constant fig 3 illustrates the overall rate constants of nb ba and pm loss at ph 5 9 and the specific rate constants of pm degradation remarkably the radical chemistry and the degradation of pm were not significantly affected by the presence of probes except for ph 5 i e a condition that favors the production of oh radicals fig s5 the performance of the uv chlorine process was maximized at ph 5 with complete removal of pm at 15 min an increase in solution ph from 5 to 8 4 resulted in a substantial decrease in the degradation rate of both probes and pm while the rate constants were not affected at alkaline conditions primidone i e pka of 12 3 mainly occurred as one species and exhibited a similar photolysis rate under the investigated ph range fig s3 schaffer et al 2012 thus the significant ph dependence of the uv chlorine process efficiency in degrading pm was most likely attributed to the shift in chlorine speciation toward ocl at increasing ph the higher abundance of ocl could enhance the scavenging of oh and cl and simultaneously increase the production of clo radical as shown in fig 3b oh was the main radical species responsible for the loss of pm at acidic ph while the degradation of pm at alkaline conditions was mainly attributed to rcs species at ph 7 both oh and rcs participated in the pm decay under similar ratios 42 and 55 respectively as the solution ph increased from 5 to 9 k oh decreased from 3 5 10 3 to 2 5 10 4 s 1 while the contribution of oh to the overall k obs of pm loss decreased from 88 8 to 14 7 on the contrary the corresponding contribution of rcs increased from 9 4 to 82 5 to further distinguish the specific roles of individual rcs i e cl cl2 and clo on the degradation of pm the impact of other radical promoter or scavenger was investigated the addition of 10 mm tert butyl alcohol tba a strong scavenger of oh and cl decreased the overall k obs of pm degradation by 90 from 4 29 10 3 to 4 3 10 4 s 1 fig s6 tba quenched 99 of oh which contributed to 88 8 of pm decay at ph 5 this finding suggested an insignificant involvement of cl for pm transformation the presence of 10 mm chloride had negligible effect on the degradation rate of pm fig s7 although cl2 content increased by 4 orders of magnitude and the concentration of other radicals remained unchanged table s2 this result supports the hypothesis that the role of cl2 radical was insignificant the presence of 100 mm hco3 at ph 8 4 only resulted in a 1 7 and 7 6 decrease of pm removal and decay rate respectively fig s8 the kinetic modeling showed that 94 of oh and cl were quenched by 100 mm hco3 whereas clo was not affected due to its low reactivity toward hco3 meanwhile the model simulation indicated that a relatively high concentration of co3 5 37 10 10 m was formed in the system nevertheless the contribution of co3 on the degradation of pm was negligible because pm exhibited high resistance to co3 oxidation text s7 and fig s9 the above observations suggest that clo is the predominant reactive radical responsible for the decay of pm at alkaline conditions this result confirmed the importance of clo in degrading some micropollutants as previously reported wu et al 2016 kong et al 2018 tba is a known efficient scavenger of both oh and cl however its reactivity toward clo is still unclear the second order rate constant for the reaction of tba with clo was recently determined as 1 3 0 1 107 m 1 s 1 wu et al 2017 however our results showed that this value might be highly overestimated given the minimal effect of 10 mm tba on the degradation of pm at ph 8 4 fig s8 considering the predominant role of clo in pm transformation at alkaline conditions the second order rate constant of clo with pm was roughly estimated as 1 12 106 m 1 s 1 at ph 8 4 by taking the specific k rcs as k clo and using its steady state concentration from the model simulation this value was more than an order of magnitude lower than the one recently determined by guo et al 2018 using competition kinetics the reason for this difference is currently unknown 3 3 impact of dom character on the performance of the uv chlorine process in this study the observed rate constants wu et al 2017 guo et al 2018 were used over the fluence based rate constants miklos et al 2019 to express the overall reactivity of the processes because the uv irradiation absorbed by dom also generates highly reactive oxygen species i e photosensitizer property that can contribute to the radical chemistry all 5 dom isolates 5 mg c l 1 considerably inhibited the transformation of pm in the uv chlorine process nevertheless the degree of inhibition varied distinctively depending on the character of the dom isolate and the solution ph as shown in fig 4 and fig s10 the rate constants for uv irradiation and chlorination only were not plotted in the figures due to their negligible contribution to the degradation of pm the overall rate constants k obs specific rate constants k oh and k rcs for pm decay at ph 6 2 decreased by 54 74 58 82 44 69 respectively the addition of dom at ph 8 4 induced a relatively slight decline in the process performance compared with those at ph 6 2 with an 18 37 and 19 42 decrease for k obs and k rcs respectively a strong negative correlation 0 93 was observed between the k obs of pm degradation and suva except for j hpo isolate it is well known that efom is enriched in organic sulfur chos and chnos originated from detergents gonsior et al 2011 niu et al 2018 s containing functional groups e g sulfides are preferentially susceptible to cl attack via single electron transfer donating electrons to c h bonds and resulting in enhanced h abstraction by oh cl varanasi et al 2018 consequently the j hpo isolate i e with a relatively low suva but higher abundance in chos and chnos compounds compared with the four surface water dom isolates exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on the uv chlorine process at ph 6 2 when oh and cl were relatively abundant in the system except for the j hpo isolate the good correlation is consistent with the fact that dom isolates enriched with electron rich moieties e g conjugated double bond olefins and amines are more vulnerable to both oh and rcs attack wang et al 2017 zhang and parker 2018 compared with the control at ph 6 2 the presence of s hpoa dom isolate i e which showed the highest suva 5 11 suppressed 70 of both oh and cl based on the decay of probes therefore resulting in a 70 decrease in k obs of pm decay from 3 53 10 3 to 1 05 10 3 s 1 while the c hpo fraction i e characterized by the lowest suva 1 92 exhibited the lowest inhibitory effect a good correlation could be established for k oh at ph 6 2 and k rcs at ph 8 4 with suva nevertheless k rcs at ph 8 4 showed considerably higher linearity with suva r2 0 98 suggesting that the aromatic components of dom isolate are the predominant sinks of clo in contrast other components i e except for the electron rich groups also contributed to the consumption of oh as elucidated by varanasi et al 2018 oh can induce distinct transformation in the aliphatic component of dom this may explain the significantly stronger inhibitory impact of dom at ph 6 2 than that of ph 8 4 since the uv absorbance of the dom solution generally correlates well with the activated aromatic moiety content changes in uv254 during the uv chlorine process were recorded the differential uv254 15 absorbance δuv254 15 uv254 0 uv254 15 min which refers to the cleavage of unsaturated cc bonds of aromatic rings and olefins was calculated as a surrogate for dom transformation in agreement with previous studies wang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 uv chlorine co exposure induced a more significant decrease in the uv absorbance of the dom solutions while there was a minor decay by chlorine only and no significant decay by uv only the higher the initial suva the larger the δuv254 15 fig s11 strong correlations could be established between δuv254 15 vs k oh and k obs at ph 6 2 or k rcs and k obs at ph 8 4 fig 4 indicating that both oh and clo play an important role in degrading the conjugated structure of the chromophoric groups interestingly the relationship between δuv254 15 and k oh or k rcs established at ph 6 2 and ph 8 4 respectively fitted into the same linear correlation fig 4 this finding may indicate that oh and clo exert similar reactivity toward aromatic moieties 3 4 dbps formation from dom isolates several series of experiments were conducted with five dom fractions at ph 6 2 and ph 8 4 to compare the formation of dbps upon chlorination only uv followed by chlorination and combined uv chlorine process aocl trichloromethane tcm and dichloroacetonitrile dcan were considered in the following discussion i e no noticeable amount of trichloroacetonitrile was detected in the chromatograms 3 4 1 chlorination alone and pre uv chlorination the results obtained from chlorination experiments were in agreement with previous findings hwang et al 2001 hua and reckhow 2008 wang et al 2015a for all fractions the production of aocl and dcan was higher at ph 6 2 compared with that at ph 8 4 contrariwise the formation of tcm was higher at ph 8 4 than at ph 6 2 as previously observed wang et al 2012 pre uv irradiation led to the decrease of tcm i e no decrease with c hpo and dcan production table s3 however no noticeable impact was observed for aocl formation the formation of aocl and tcm increased linearly with the suva of the dom fractions fig s12 for aocl formation a unique correlation for the two ph conditions was obtained with the differential uv254 24 absorbance values δuv254 24 uv254 0 uv254 24h however distinct correlations were observed for tcm fig 5 good exponential relationships were obtained between dcan formation and c n ratio fig s13 the lower the c n ratio the higher the formation r hpo showed the highest production of dcan a dom fraction enriched in carboxyl rich aliphatic molecules cram incorporating nitrogen isolated from the ribou reservoir that is known for being impacted by algal blooms niu et al 2018 3 4 2 combined uv chlorine treatment uv chlorine experiments were conducted using similar chlorination conditions as the one used for chlorination alone 5 mg c l 1 of dom 70 μm free chlorine in the presence of dom 50 90 of the injected chlorine was consumed after 15 min irradiation i e higher chlorine demand at ph 6 2 compared with ph 8 4 while only 15 was degraded in the absence of dom figs s2 and s14 overall the higher the suva the higher the chlorine demand a strong correlation was established between the chlorine demand at 15 min and δuv254 15 fig 6 this correlation excluded j hpo which exerted a higher chlorine demand than expected from this correlation no chlorine residual was recorded after 24 h following 15 min uv chlorine treatment except for c hpo lowest suva dom for which the chlorine residual was 0 17 and 1 7 mg l 1 at ph 6 2 and 8 4 respectively as shown in fig s11 the chlorination reaction following the uv chlorine co exposure did not significantly increase δuv254 15 i e δuv254 24 which increased with suva and was higher at ph 6 2 than ph 8 4 however the difference in δuv254 15 between uv chlorine and chlorine only was also observed with δuv254 24 especially for low and medium suva dom this difference can be ascribed to the significant chlorine consumption degradation occurring during the uv chlorine process leading to the production of radical species i e more abundant at ph 6 2 than at ph 8 4 that are highly reactive with aromatic moieties westerhoff et al 1999 varanasi et al 2018 the production of dbps during chlorination and uv chlorine processes is shown in fig s15 the ratios of the dbps produced with the two processes were plotted as a function of suva for comparing the results fig 7 at ph 6 2 good relationships were obtained when excluding j hpo from the data set specifically the lower the suva the higher the dbp ratios the unique reactivity feature of j hpo at ph 6 2 has been previously discussed its higher sulfur containing character enhanced its reactivity with oh cl by h abstraction which was apparently associated with the degradation of dbp precursors for low suva isolates c hpo 1 92 and b hpo 2 45 the uv chlorine process enhanced aocl and tcm formation but decreased dbp productions for high suva s hpoa 5 11 at ph 6 2 moderate suva r hpo 3 24 showed no aocl and tcm difference between the two processes at acid ph the aop treatment showed lower dcan formation for all isolates at ph 8 4 good relationships were also established when excluding the high thm and dcan ratios obtained for r hpo a fraction of dom enriched in nitrogenous dbp precursors originating from algal blooms i e the base form of amino acids at ph 8 4 is more reactive than the zwitterion form at ph 6 2 except for dcan results i e comparable at both ph conditions the difference between the two sets of data was more significant at acid ph similar findings have been discussed in the literature li et al 2016 and wang et al 2017 obtained a lower tcm formation with high suva dom after uv chlorine exposure compared with chlorine alone wang et al 2015b indicated that the uv chlorine process increased the dbp formation potential fp of low suva treated water the effect was generally more pronounced at ph 6 5 compared with ph 8 5 however contradictory results were also published showing an increase liu et al 2012 sun et al 2019 or no modification zhao et al 2011 of dbpfp after the uv chlorine treatment of high suva dom as previously discussed ph influences the distribution of radical species in solution and in particular controls the abundance of oh radical i e more abundant at acid ph the oh radical may play a major role in the transformation of organic matter during the uv chlorine co exposure which does not exclude the possible role of other radicals the oh radical can activate dbp precursors of low suva dom and degrade dbp precursors of high suva dom in accordance with the current results dotson et al 2010 and metz et al 2011 observed an increase in tox and or tthm formation after the uv h2o2 treatment of low suva treated river waters this observation was attributed to the reaction of oh radical contrarywise for a high suva river water 3 16 lamsal et al 2011 observed a substantial decrease in tthmfp a decrease in thmfp sarathy and mohseni 2010 and dcan formation chu et al 2014 srithep and phattarapattamawong 2017 following uv h2o2 treatment was also observed for moderate 2 5 3 5 and low 1 3 1 9 suva waters if the current results are in good agreement with the literature the experimental conditions might have accentuated the difference between the chlorination and uv chlorine co exposure results unlike the cited publications only c hpo showed residual chlorine at the end of the reaction 24 h results indicated that the difference in dbps formation from the two reaction conditions increased with the amount of residual chlorine present after the 15 min uv chlorine treatment fig s16 suggesting that dbp formation from the uv chlorine process could be underestimated when compared with chlorine only this finding does not compromise our previous comments for low and moderate suva dom isolates c hpo b hpo and r hpo and the effect of ph i e no significant difference in chlorine demand was observed at ph 6 2 and 8 4 for the high suva s hpoa fraction the significant difference recorded between the two processes could be reduced with the use of a higher chlorine dose allowing the presence of residual chlorine after 24 h of reaction because the chlorine dose applied for this study led to a major reduction of the uv absorbing moieties i e dbp precursors during the 15 min uv chlorine treatment the use of a higher chlorine dose should not significantly increase the tcm formation the unique reactivity of j hpo should be further explored in fig 8 dbp formations were normalized to the chlorine consumed to take into account the significant difference in chlorine demand between the two processes as observed by wang et al 2017 and for all dom isolates and ph conditions the normalized norm dbp formation was always lower after uv chlorine co exposure compared to chlorination and pre uv chlorination fig s17 pre uv irradiation only slightly decreased norm aocl more significant reductions were observed for norm tcm and norm dcan the relative abundances of tcm and dcan to aocl were depicted in fig s18 at ph 6 2 and for all dom isolates tcm aocl ratios for the uv chlorine process were comparable or slightly higher in comparison with chlorination while the dcan aocl ratios were significantly lower with the uv chlorine process at ph 8 4 higher tcm aocl ratios were obtained for all dom isolates with uv chlorine co exposure except for s hpoa nevertheless dcan aocl ratios remained lower in the presence than in the absence of uv irradiation except for r hpo which showed the opposite trend however the difference is less pronounced at ph 8 4 these results indicate that radicals have diverse impacts on dbps precursors the strong reactivity of nitrogenous organics with oh radicals chu et al 2014 preferentially degrades dcan precursors oh radicals seem to induce the formation of tcm precursors while clo which is predominant at basic ph may contribute to tcm formation finally we should indicate that our lab scale experimental conditions are truly different from real field applications i e irradiation time on the order of seconds with much more powerful uv irradiance previous results obtained from full scale uv chlorine trials suggested that rcs generated during the aop process do not significantly contribute to the formation of dbps it was proposed that the production of oh radicals during the uv chlorine co exposure especially at lower ph could enhance the reactivity of dom with chlorine due to the formation of stronger dbp precursors susceptible to produce aox and specific dbps i e han at very short contact time i e few seconds wang et al 2015b 2019 4 conclusions in this study the uv chlorine process exhibited a significant synergetic effect in eliminating pm 87 due to the simultaneous generation of oh and rcs in the system while uv alone and chlorine only resulted in negligible pm decay modeling and experimental results indicated that oh is mainly responsible for the loss of pm at acidic ph while the degradation of pm at alkaline conditions was mainly attributed to clo the presence of 5 mg c l 1 dom substantially suppressed the k obs of pm decay in the uv chlorine process by 18 74 depending on the dom character and solution ph except for j hpo isolate a strong negative correlation was observed between the k obs of pm degradation and the suva of dom due to the high reactivity of electron rich moieties towards oh and rcs attack the j hpo isolate an efom fraction with a relatively low suva but higher abundance in organic sulfur exhibited the strongest inhibition effect on the uv chlorine process likely resulting from the enhanced sink of oh and cl radicals by s containing groups compared with chlorination the uv chlorine process under our lab scale experimental conditions i e uv chlorine co exposure during several minutes to reach the desired fluence conditions strictly different from few seconds contact time with much more intense uv light that would be applied with full scale treatment unit promoted aocl and tcm formation of low suva dom but lowered the dbp productions for high suva dom nevertheless the formation of dcan was always lower during uv chlorine co exposure except for r hpo which exhibited higher production of dcan at ph 8 4 due to its reactive form of nitrogenous dpb precursors at alkaline ph although the irradiation conditions applied at lab scale i e longer contact time and much lower uv intensity irradiance are different from real applications the observed impact of dom character suva a parameter commonly used by water treatment plant operators to evaluate the chemical reactivity of dom s and n content on the degradation kinetics of contaminant and formation of dbps from this study suggests that dom is an important parameter of the water matrix to control for optimizing the operation of the uv chlorine process declaration of competing interest
