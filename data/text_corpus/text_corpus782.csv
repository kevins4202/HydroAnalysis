3910,recession flow analysis based on the boussinesq equation has been widely used to estimate hydraulic parameters of hillslope aquifers however previous studies mainly focused on homogeneous hillslope aquifers and showed that the recession curves satisfy the power law with two transition points and three power law regimes b 1 b 2 and b 3 since the variation trends of b for homogeneous hillslopes are inconsistent and even opposite it is necessary to investigate the law of recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers in the current study a modified boussinesq equation applicable to double layered hillslope aquifers was proposed after validating against laboratory experiments and numerical simulations this modified boussinesq equation was used to examine the recession characteristics of double layered hillslope aquifers the results show that the recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers also follow three power law regimes however the variations of b values are more complex than those of homogeneous hillslopes specifically while b monotonically changes with slope angle for homogeneous hillslopes the variations of b are non monotonic for double layered hillslopes depending on the soil configuration e g the thickness of subsoil these findings are of great significance for determining the hydraulic parameters of hillslopes keywords recession flow analysis boussinesq equation double layered hillslope aquifers 1 introduction groundwater recession flow which refers to the continuous drainage during a certain period with little or no precipitation is an important component of the hydrological cycle mcmahon et al 2021 to determine the hydraulic parameters of aquifers in catchments recession flow analysis has been widely used brutsaert and nieber 1977 vogel kroll 1992 rupp selker 2006 hogarth et al 2014 recession flow analysis provides guidance for water resource planning water supply design and ecosystem services mcmahon et al 2021 brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed the equation bn method between the discharge q from a horizontal aquifer and its first order time derivative dq dt 1 dq dt a q b where a is a function related to the hydraulic and dimensional properties of the aquifer and b is the exponent roques et al 2017 in the logarithm coordinate system the curve of dq dt and q on a log log scale represents two linear recession plots with different slopes displaying the short term b 1 and long term b 2 recession characters troch et al 2013 the bn method was later on extended to sloping aquifers brutsaert 1994 huyck et al 2005 for horizontal homogeneous aquifers parlange et al 2001 suggested b 1 3 and b 2 1 5 by deriving an analytical solution of the boussinesq equation these two values were confirmed by laboratory experiments mizumura 2002 2005 however different b 2 values of were reported brutsaert 1998 inferred b 2 1 based on the calculation of the recession discharge data collected from the washita river basin van de giesen et al 2005 theoretically demonstrated b 2 1 by using the laplace equation for sloping homogeneous aquifers analytical solutions based on the kinematic wave approximation beven 1982 or linearized boussinesq equation brutsaert 1994 sanford et al 1993 were used to determine the values of b these two methods lead to different predictions of b 2 because both of them are applicable to certain situations only beven et al 1982 suggested that b 1 and b 2 both equaled to 0 with the kinematic wave approximation and the zero value may arise from the predefined condition of no diffusion and initial shape of water table using a similar quasi steady state approach sanford et al 1993 supported b 1 1 5 and b 2 1 with the linearization method while brutsaert 1994 used a linearization in h to infer b 1 3 and b 2 1 although the above studies obtained various values of b they all neglected the effect of unsaturated flow which can greatly affect the groundwater table dynamics and water movement in the saturated zone barry et al 1996 kong et al 2013 2015 considering the effect of unsaturated vertical flow hilberts et al 2007 developed the analytic expression between groundwater level and effective porosity and applied it to the nonlinear hillslope storage boussinesq hsb model kong et al 2016 improved the hsb model by considering unsaturated lateral flow and verified it by numeral simulations and laboratory experiments luo et al 2018 further explored the effects of unsaturated flow on hillslope recession based on kong hsb model and proposed that unsaturated flow exerts a significant influence on recession curve resulting in three power law regimes and two transition points in the regression curve luo et al 2018 further pointed out that there is no specific value of b in horizontal or sloping aquifers because b is affected by many factors related to the configuration and properties of hillslope aquifers such as slope angle and soil type however above studies only focused on the single layered hillslopes and ignored the effects of soil stratigraphy many natural hillslopes are stratified with two soil layers of different hydraulic properties lo et al 2020 for example in china the bank of shangjingjiang has a dual structure with a thick clay layer overlying a thin sand layer zong et al 2013 in canada double layered marine soft soil foundation composed of a crust layer and a soft substratum is quite widely distributed chen et al 2019 some studies have revealed that soil stratification may greatly affect drainage schepper et al 2017 examined seasonal variations of tile drainage discharge in the 6 km2 fensholt catchment denmark which is made up of clay and sand they pointed out that drain flow is mainly controlled by the geological heterogeneity huang et al 2011 developed a system dynamics model to simulate transient infiltration and drainage processes in multilayered soils and found that the presence of a finer sand layer above a coarse sand layer will increase the soil water storage however it still remains unclear as to how soil stratigraphy would affect recession flow characteristics and b values of hillslope aquifers to reveal the influence of layered soil on the water recession during drainage present study is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 derive a type of generalized double layered hillslope boussinesq equation and validate it with numerical solutions and experiment data section 4 conducts a parametric analysis and further discusses the influence of double layered soil on the recession characteristics section 5 draws final conclusions 2 theoretical derivations based on the mass balance principle the governing equation of hsb model is troch et al 2003 2 s t w q x n w where s l2 is the total effective water content per unit distance along the hillslope t t is time the axis x is parallel to the sloping bed w l is the variation of the hillslope width along the slope q l2t 1 is the darcy flux per unit width along the slope n lt 1 is the groundwater recharge rate due to precipitations which is set to zero since this study focuses on the drainage process the total effective water content can be calculated as 3 s 0 d w θ ψ θ r d z where d l is the thickness of the aquifer which is perpendicular to the bottom of the slope θ ψ is the soil water content ψ l is the pressure head positive in the saturated zone while negative in the unsaturated zone and θ r is the residual water content assuming a hydrostatic pressure distribution kong et al 2016 the hydraulic gradient along the slope in saturated area and unsaturated area is equivalent and water flow is parallel to the slope thus the unit discharge along the slope is the sum of the unit flow rate of the saturated and unsaturated zones 4a wq w q q s q us w ϕ x 0 h k s d z h d k ψ d z 4b ϕ x h x cos i sin i 4c ϕ z ψ where h l is the height of water table perpendicular to the slope i is slope angle q s l2t 1 is the flux per unit width along the hillslope in the saturated zone q us l2t 1 is the flux per unit width along the hillslope in the unsaturated zones ϕ l is the piezometric head z l is elevation and k s lt 1 and k ψ lt 1 are the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities respectively unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k ψ and soil water content θ ψ are related to pressure head which can be expressed by van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 however the complexity of traditional vg model hinders the derivation of the new model thus this paper employs the improved vg model in accordance with kong et al 2016 which can be written as 5 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α ψ 1 1 n 1 k ψ k s 1 1 β ψ n 2 1 1 n 2 where θ s is saturated water content α l 1 n 1 β l 1 and n 2 are the fitting parameters related to soil properties readers may refer to luo et al 2019 for details about equation 5 as this paper focuses on two layered hillslope aquifers corresponding to each layer the vg function should be written as 6a θ 1 ψ θ r 1 θ s 1 θ r 1 1 1 α 1 ψ 1 1 n 1 6b θ 2 ψ θ r 2 θ s 2 θ r 2 1 1 α 2 ψ 1 1 n 2 6c k 3 ψ k s 3 1 1 β 3 ψ n 3 1 1 n 3 6d k 4 ψ k s 4 1 1 β 4 ψ n 4 1 1 n 4 where θ 1 and θ 2 are the soil water content of under layer and up layer soil respectively θ r 1 and θ r 2 are residual water content of under layer and up layer soil respectively θ s 1 and θ s 2 are the saturated water content of under layer and up layer soil respectively α 1 l 1 n 1 β 3 l 1 and n 3 are the correction parameter of under layer soil based on kong s method α 2 l 1 n 2 β 4 l 1 and n 4 are the correction parameter of up layer soil based on kong s method k 3 ψ lt 1 and k 4 ψ lt 1 are unsaturated hydraulic conductivities of under layer and up layer soil respectively k s 3 lt 1 and k s 4 lt 1 are saturated hydraulic conductivities of under layer and up layer soil respectively in the early and middle stages of drainage the saturated and unsaturated zones co exist as the water level is over the slope as the double layered structure contributes to different soil characters the circumstance of h 0 should be divided into two diverse situations namely h 1 h d fig 1 a and 0 h h 1 fig 1b where h 1 is the thickness of the under layer soil in the late period of drainage only the unsaturated zone exists as the water level falls down the slope h 0 fig 1c the total effective water content s can be obtained by placing eqs 6a and 6b into eq 3 7a s w 0 d θ ψ θ r d z w θ s 1 θ r 1 h 1 w θ s 2 θ r 2 h h 1 w θ s 2 θ r 2 d h 1 α 2 h d cos i n 2 1 n 2 when h 1 h d 7b s w 0 d θ ψ θ r d

difficult to derive the analytical solutions directly we used the finite difference method to solve eq 11 refer to supporting information for more details to verify the accuracy of the double layered hsb model and make the results more universal this study conducted laboratory experiments and ran numerical simulations using the hydrus model by considering different soil combinations in the experimental verification the fast draining standard sand and glass beads with a particle size of 3 4 mm were selected for the double layered soil in the numerical verification the slow draining sand and clay were adopted 3 1 comparison with experiments a flume with length of 1 8 m width of 0 2 m and height of 0 6 m was used for the experiment the flume is placed on a forklift and its slope angle can be adjusted by the forklift two slope angles were considered 5 and 7 fig 2 a the upper surface boundary of the flume was connected to the atmosphere while the downstream boundary the height of the outlet was constant at 0 01 m the bottom boundary was set to be impermeable the aquifer thickness d and subsoil thickness h 1 were 0 4 m and 0 2 m respectively two soil combinations were used glass beads overlying lab sand case c1 and the reverse case case c2 to avoid air trap the flume was filled with water before adding lab sand and beads to prevent sand and glass beads from leaking out of the outlet geotextile was fixed in the flume the sand and glass beads used in the experiments have a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 4 57 10 3 m s 1 and 2 10 2 m s 1 darcy s test respectively more parameters are summarized in table 1 to observe the change of water level inside the slope six transverse piezometers were placed on the back of the tank the outermost pressure piezometer was 0 15 m away from the outlet and the rest were placed at an interval of 0 3 m a rectangular column was placed below the outlet to collect the discharged water fig 2b the displacement was determined by the change of water level in the rectangular column which was measured by water pressure datalogger solinst levelogger model 3001 f6 m2 1 mm accuracy fig 2b shows the location of the water pressure datalogger fig 3 compares the measured and predicted water table and outflow rates as can be seen with the progress of drainage the arch of the water level line in case c1 gradually moves to the top of the hillslope on the top of the hillslope the unsaturated zone has strong water holding capacity and the low permeability results in the higher water level the water level in case c2 presents different patterns as it has not been adjusted in the early stage of drainage fig 5 affected by the initial state of drainage the water surface is not smooth in the original stage however as the drainage continues the water level gradually becomes flat and the arch of the water level moves to the slope toe gradually resulting from the faster slope top drainage and drop of water level the simulated outflow shows that the exponential attenuation trend is consistent with the measured data figs 4 and 6 in the numerical model the initial water level was taken as the initial condition considering the simulation results the double layered soil hsb model established in this paper appropriately reflects the drainage characteristics of the double layered soil and fits well with the experiment results 3 2 comparison with hydrus variable saturation groundwater flow model hydrus was used to further confirm the rationality of the proposed hsb model for double layered hillslopes following the work of luo et al 2018 the slope length l and the aquifer thickness d are 6 m and 0 5 m respectively the initial water level is 0 3 m and the simulation duration is 10 h to verify the hsb model of double layered soil two kinds of soil layer combinations were adopted 1 upper clay and lower sand 2 upper sand and lower clay for each combination two slope angles 5 and 10 and four subsoil thicknesses 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 2 m and 0 25 m were considered therefore a total of 16 cases were simulated other soil parameters are listed in table 1 the outlet was set as a dirichlet type boundary with h 0 t 0 1 and the upper end of the hillslope was treated as no flow i e h x cos i sin i 0 hydrus was used to simulate the variation process of water level and seepage flow at the toe of slope under different conditions then the simulation results were compared with hsb model of double layered soil the simulation results with subsoil thickness of 0 25 m and the slope angles of 5 and 10 are shown in figs 7 10 other simulation results are shown in the appendix figs s1 s12 it can be seen that the trend of water level and seepage flow at slope toe of the new hsb model is generally consistent with that of hydrus simulation the consistency further verifies the accuracy of the double layered hsb model considering unsaturated flow since unsaturated flow is considered in the double layered hsb model the negative pressure variation in the unsaturated zone can also be predicted when the clay layer is underneath the sand layer the drainage time is longer and the negative pressure appears in the later stage fig 7 however when the underlying layer is sand the top of the slope quickly enters into the negative pressure area with the progress of drainage fig 9 in the later stage of drainage the water level exhibits an obvious s type indicating special vertical distribution of negative pressure 4 results and discussions based on the modified hsb model proposed in this paper the recession flow analysis of double layered hillslope aquifers was conducted in this section we first compare the recession characteristics of two homogeneous hillslope aquifers to see if the variation trends of b are consistent and then study the law of recession of double layered hillslope aquifers composed of sand and clay the aquifer length l aquifer thickness d initial water level and boundary conditions are consistent with the settings in section 3 2 in view of the difference of drainage duration the simulation time of soil combination of lower clay with upper sand is 300 h while that of the reverse order is 60 h the thickness of subsoil is 0 5 m 0 25 m 0 2 m 0 15 m and 0 1 m respectively thus the simulations include 10 different cases table 2 4 1 comparison between clay and sandy homogeneous hillslope fig 11 shows the recession curves of different hillslope aquifers as the slope angle changes the recession curves of homogeneous hillslopes satisfy the power law relation of eq 1 and the regression curve presents two transition points and three power law regimes fig 11 a1 and 11 b1 the red circle represents the transition point of short time and long time b 1 and b 2 while the blue circle is that of long time and longer time b 2 and b 3 the three stage recession curve for the clay hillslope aquifers is not very obvious but apparent for the sandy hillslope aquifers furthermore with the increase of the slope angle the transition time between b 1 and b 2 is advanced and the corresponding transition flow increases to further study the effects of slope angle on recession flow analysis we linearly fitted different sections of the recession curve log log plot of dq dt versus q to obtain the values of b 1 b 2 and b 3 for the hillslope composed of clay fig 12 a1 the slope angle has the greatest influence on b 2 the value of b 2 increases with the rise of slope angle from 4 0 in the case of mild slope i 5 to 5 6 for a steep slope i 15 moreover the value of b 1 also increases as the slope angle increases the increase amplitude of b 1 ranging from 3 3 to 3 8 is smaller than b 2 the value of b 3 is insensitive to slope angle compared with b 1 and b 2 since it only decreases slightly from 3 5 to 3 2 for the hillslope composed of sand fig 12 b1 the slope angle has the greatest influence on b 1 with the increase of slope angle the value of b 1 increases from 4 5 for slope angle of 5 to 6 7 for slope angle of 15 however the law of b 2 for fully sandy hillslope is different from b 1 the value of b 2 decreases with the rise of slope angle from 1 2 to 0 7 furthermore the value of b 3 decreases slightly from 1 5 to 1 4 as the slope angle rises in general the values of b 1 of clay and sandy homogeneous hillslope both increase with the rise of slope angle however the increase amplitude of b 1 for clay hillslope is smaller than that of sandy hillslope it is worth noting that with the increase of slope angle the value of b 2 for clay hillslope increases while b2 for sandy hillslope decreases the values of b 3 for clay hillslope and sandy hillslope both slightly decrease with the increase of slope angle while the value of b 3 for clay hillslope is bigger than that of sandy hillslope above comparison indicates that the variation trends of b for homogeneous hillslopes composed of different soil types are inconsistent and even opposite therefore it is necessary to explore the law of recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers 4 2 comparison between homogeneous hillslopes and the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand fig 11 a2 11 a5 indicate that the recession curves of hillslope aquifers composed of lower clay and upper sand still take the multi section power law form with three regimes furthermore as the thickness of the lower clay layer gradually decreases cases 2 5 it is found that the three stage characteristics of the recession curves become more obvious gradually transforming to the trend of the sandy slope moreover with the increase of slope angle the transition time between b 1 and b 2 is advanced and the corresponding transition flow increases similar to homogeneous hillslopes we fitted linear functions to different sections of the recession curves for double layered hillslopes and discuss the variation trend of b for the slope composed of lower clay and upper sand fig 12a2 12a5 the slope angle has the greatest influence on b 1 the value of b 1 increases with the rise of slope angle from about 5 in the case of mild hillslope i 5 to about 8 for a steep slope i 15 however the trend of b 2 is related to the thickness of the lower clay soil when the thickness of the lower clay is 0 25 m and 0 2 m fig 12a2 12a3 the value of b 2 increases with the increase of the angle while that of b 2 decreases when the thickness of the lower sand is 0 15 m and 0 1 m fig 12a4 12a5 additionally the value of b 3 for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand is also insensitive to slope angle compared with b 1 and b 2 the value of b 3 increases slightly from 1 4 to 1 6 to highlight the influence of heterogeneity on recession flow we compare the variation trends of b for homogeneous hillslope and the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand first the values of b 1 for clay hillslope sandy hillslope and the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand all increase as the slope angle increases nevertheless the increase amplitude of b 1 for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand is bigger than that for clay and sandy hillslopes second with the increase of slope angle the variation trends of b 2 for homogeneous hillslopes are monotonic while that for the hillslope composed of clay and sand is more complex which is related to the thickness of lower soil third the amplitudes of variation of b 3 for these hillslopes are all small and the variation trends of b 3 for homogeneous hillslopes and the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand are different with the increase of slope angle the values of b 3 for clay and sandy hillslopes slightly decrease while that for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand increases 4 3 comparison between homogeneous hillslopes and the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay as shown in fig 11 b2 11 b5 the recession curves of hillslope aquifers composed of lower sand and upper clay still have three power law regimes with two transition points in addition as the thickness of the lower layer of sand gradually decreases cases 7 10 the three stage characteristics of the recession curves become vague and gradually transform to the trend of a fully clay hillslope furthermore with the increase of slope angle the transition time between b1 and b2 moves up and the transition flow is enhanced it can be seen from fig 12 b2 12 b5 that the slope angle has the greatest influence on b 1 for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay the trend of b 1 is sophisticated which is associated with the thickness of the lower sand soil for example when the thickness of the lower sand is 0 25 m and 0 2 m fig 12 b2 12 b3 the value of b 1 decreases with the increase of the angle while that of b1 raises when the thickness of the lower sand is 0 15 m and 0 1 m fig 12 b4 12 b5 moreover the value of b 2 monotonically decreases with the rise of slope angle the value of b 3 increases slightly from 1 5 to 1 7 to further investigate the influence of heterogeneity on recession flow analysis we compare the variation trend of homogeneous hillslopes and the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay first with the increase of slope angle the values of b 1 for homogeneous hillslopes increase monotonously while that for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay is more complex which is related to the thickness of the lower soil second the values of b 2 for sandy hillslope and the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay both decrease with the rise of slope angle while that for clay hillslope increases third with the increase of slope angle the values of b 3 for homogeneous hillslopes both slightly decrease while that for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay increases the values of b 3 for these hillslopes are all insensitive to slope angle compared with b 1 and b 2 these findings further demonstrate that the law of recession characteristics between homogeneous and double layered hillslopes are different 4 4 comparison between two different double layered hillslopes the influence of the thickness of subsoil on the recession curves of the double layered hillslope is further analyzed fig 13 shows the recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers as the thickness of subsoil change for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand fig 13 a1 13 a5 with the increase of the thickness of the lower layer of clay the transition time between b 1 and b 2 is delayed and the transition flow decreases however for the slope composed of lower sand and upper clay figs 13 b1 b5 the transition time between b 1 and b 2 is advanced and the transition flow goes up with the increase of lower sand according to fig 14 it can be seen that the thickness of subsoil can affect the values of b 1 b 2 and b 3 of double layered hillslopes for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand fig 14 a1 14 a5 the thickness of subsoil has the greatest influence on b 1 the value of b 1 increases with the rise of thickness of subsoil which ranges from 4 to12 moreover the value of b 2 also increases as the thickness of subsoil increases while the increase amplitude of value of b 2 is significantly smaller than that of b 1 the value of b 3 increases slightly increases from 1 4 to 1 5 for the slope composed of lower sand and upper clay fig 14 b1 14 b5 the thickness of subsoil has the greatest influence on b 1 the trend of b 1 is complex which is associated with slope angle when the slope angle is small fig 14 b1 14 b4 the value of b 1 tends to increase with the increase of subsoil thickness while that of b 1 decreases with the increase of subsoil thickness when the angle increases to 15 fig 14 b5 the value of b 2 decreases with the increase of the thickness of subsoil while the value of b 3 decreases slightly from 1 7 to 1 5 from the above analysis we can see that the laws of the recession curves between double layered hillslopes are also different first with the increase of the thickness of subsoil the values of b 1 for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand increases monotonously while that for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay is more complex which is related to slope angle second the values of b 2 for hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand increases with the increase of the thickness of subsoil while that of the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay decreases third with the increase of the thickness of subsoil the values of b 3 for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand slightly increase while that for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay decreases the values of b 3 for double layered hillslopes are all insensitive to the thickness of subsoil compared with b 1 and b 2 during the last drainage stage capillary effects dominate and hence leads to an insignificant change of b 3 5 conclusions to more reasonably analyze the recession flow for natural hillslopes this paper proposed a modified boussinesq equation applicable to double layered aquifers the new model considers the unsaturated flow and soil stratification and is verified by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations recession flow analysis of double layered hillslopes is subsequently carried out the main key findings are as follows 1 the recession curves of homogeneous and double layered hillslope aquifers all satisfy the power law and presents two transition points and three different power law regimes b 1 b 2 and b 3 however the variation trend of b for homogeneous hillslopes are inconsistent especially b 2 therefore the law of recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers composed of sand and clay are more complex 2 the variation trends of b 1 between two double layered hillslope aquifers are different the value of b 1 is positively correlated with the slope angle and the thickness of subsoil for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand while that of hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay does not show a significant positive correlation when the thickness of subsoil is thick the value of b 1 for hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay decreases with the increase of the slope angle 3 the variation trends of b 2 between double layered hillslope aquifers are also different for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay the value of b 2 is negatively correlated with the slope angle and the thickness of subsoil for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand the value of b 2 is mainly positively correlated with slope angle and the thickness of subsoil however in some cases when the thickness of subsoil is small the value of b 2 decreases with the increase of the slope angle 4 the value of b 3 is quite insensitive to slope angle and the thickness of the subsoil compared with b 1 and b 2 irrespective of homogeneous hillslopes or double double layered hillslopes the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the recession flow of b 1 and b 2 comes from the saturated and unsaturated zone while the recession flow of b 3 is entirely governed by water drainage from the unsaturated zone during the late drainage stage and the unsaturated zone has strong capillary effect with the progress of drainage capillary effect becomes stronger than the gravity effect leading to the change of b 3 not obvious through the above analysis it can be known that the value of b in double layered hillslopes is more complex than that of homogeneous hillslopes which is affected by slope angle soil type and soil thickness in reality most of the slopes are heterogeneous obvious stratification the heterogeneity of slope will exert great influence on the drainage rates at different stages then the value of b of homogeneous hillslopes cannot be directly used to deduce the local hydraulic parameters although the present study reveals the influences of heterogeneity on hillslope recession flow more research is needed to further advance our understanding of the process in this paper we neglect recharge and evaporation besides this study assumes that the hillslopes are composed of sand and clay whereas most hillslopes can be made up of other soil types further theoretical studies should consider these factors to gain a deeper insight into the hillslope recession characteristics credit authorship contribution statement yunan ding conceptualization formal analysis investigation resources data

3910,recession flow analysis based on the boussinesq equation has been widely used to estimate hydraulic parameters of hillslope aquifers however previous studies mainly focused on homogeneous hillslope aquifers and showed that the recession curves satisfy the power law with two transition points and three power law regimes b 1 b 2 and b 3 since the variation trends of b for homogeneous hillslopes are inconsistent and even opposite it is necessary to investigate the law of recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers in the current study a modified boussinesq equation applicable to double layered hillslope aquifers was proposed after validating against laboratory experiments and numerical simulations this modified boussinesq equation was used to examine the recession characteristics of double layered hillslope aquifers the results show that the recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers also follow three power law regimes however the variations of b values are more complex than those of homogeneous hillslopes specifically while b monotonically changes with slope angle for homogeneous hillslopes the variations of b are non monotonic for double layered hillslopes depending on the soil configuration e g the thickness of subsoil these findings are of great significance for determining the hydraulic parameters of hillslopes keywords recession flow analysis boussinesq equation double layered hillslope aquifers 1 introduction groundwater recession flow which refers to the continuous drainage during a certain period with little or no precipitation is an important component of the hydrological cycle mcmahon et al 2021 to determine the hydraulic parameters of aquifers in catchments recession flow analysis has been widely used brutsaert and nieber 1977 vogel kroll 1992 rupp selker 2006 hogarth et al 2014 recession flow analysis provides guidance for water resource planning water supply design and ecosystem services mcmahon et al 2021 brutsaert and nieber 1977 proposed the equation bn method between the discharge q from a horizontal aquifer and its first order time derivative dq dt 1 dq dt a q b where a is a function related to the hydraulic and dimensional properties of the aquifer and b is the exponent roques et al 2017 in the logarithm coordinate system the curve of dq dt and q on a log log scale represents two linear recession plots with different slopes displaying the short term b 1 and long term b 2 recession characters troch et al 2013 the bn method was later on extended to sloping aquifers brutsaert 1994 huyck et al 2005 for horizontal homogeneous aquifers parlange et al 2001 suggested b 1 3 and b 2 1 5 by deriving an analytical solution of the boussinesq equation these two values were confirmed by laboratory experiments mizumura 2002 2005 however different b 2 values of were reported brutsaert 1998 inferred b 2 1 based on the calculation of the recession discharge data collected from the washita river basin van de giesen et al 2005 theoretically demonstrated b 2 1 by using the laplace equation for sloping homogeneous aquifers analytical solutions based on the kinematic wave approximation beven 1982 or linearized boussinesq equation brutsaert 1994 sanford et al 1993 were used to determine the values of b these two methods lead to different predictions of b 2 because both of them are applicable to certain situations only beven et al 1982 suggested that b 1 and b 2 both equaled to 0 with the kinematic wave approximation and the zero value may arise from the predefined condition of no diffusion and initial shape of water table using a similar quasi steady state approach sanford et al 1993 supported b 1 1 5 and b 2 1 with the linearization method while brutsaert 1994 used a linearization in h to infer b 1 3 and b 2 1 although the above studies obtained various values of b they all neglected the effect of unsaturated flow which can greatly affect the groundwater table dynamics and water movement in the saturated zone barry et al 1996 kong et al 2013 2015 considering the effect of unsaturated vertical flow hilberts et al 2007 developed the analytic expression between groundwater level and effective porosity and applied it to the nonlinear hillslope storage boussinesq hsb model kong et al 2016 improved the hsb model by considering unsaturated lateral flow and verified it by numeral simulations and laboratory experiments luo et al 2018 further explored the effects of unsaturated flow on hillslope recession based on kong hsb model and proposed that unsaturated flow exerts a significant influence on recession curve resulting in three power law regimes and two transition points in the regression curve luo et al 2018 further pointed out that there is no specific value of b in horizontal or sloping aquifers because b is affected by many factors related to the configuration and properties of hillslope aquifers such as slope angle and soil type however above studies only focused on the single layered hillslopes and ignored the effects of soil stratigraphy many natural hillslopes are stratified with two soil layers of different hydraulic properties lo et al 2020 for example in china the bank of shangjingjiang has a dual structure with a thick clay layer overlying a thin sand layer zong et al 2013 in canada double layered marine soft soil foundation composed of a crust layer and a soft substratum is quite widely distributed chen et al 2019 some studies have revealed that soil stratification may greatly affect drainage schepper et al 2017 examined seasonal variations of tile drainage discharge in the 6 km2 fensholt catchment denmark which is made up of clay and sand they pointed out that drain flow is mainly controlled by the geological heterogeneity huang et al 2011 developed a system dynamics model to simulate transient infiltration and drainage processes in multilayered soils and found that the presence of a finer sand layer above a coarse sand layer will increase the soil water storage however it still remains unclear as to how soil stratigraphy would affect recession flow characteristics and b values of hillslope aquifers to reveal the influence of layered soil on the water recession during drainage present study is organized as follows sections 2 and 3 derive a type of generalized double layered hillslope boussinesq equation and validate it with numerical solutions and experiment data section 4 conducts a parametric analysis and further discusses the influence of double layered soil on the recession characteristics section 5 draws final conclusions 2 theoretical derivations based on the mass balance principle the governing equation of hsb model is troch et al 2003 2 s t w q x n w where s l2 is the total effective water content per unit distance along the hillslope t t is time the axis x is parallel to the sloping bed w l is the variation of the hillslope width along the slope q l2t 1 is the darcy flux per unit width along the slope n lt 1 is the groundwater recharge rate due to precipitations which is set to zero since this study focuses on the drainage process the total effective water content can be calculated as 3 s 0 d w θ ψ θ r d z where d l is the thickness of the aquifer which is perpendicular to the bottom of the slope θ ψ is the soil water content ψ l is the pressure head positive in the saturated zone while negative in the unsaturated zone and θ r is the residual water content assuming a hydrostatic pressure distribution kong et al 2016 the hydraulic gradient along the slope in saturated area and unsaturated area is equivalent and water flow is parallel to the slope thus the unit discharge along the slope is the sum of the unit flow rate of the saturated and unsaturated zones 4a wq w q q s q us w ϕ x 0 h k s d z h d k ψ d z 4b ϕ x h x cos i sin i 4c ϕ z ψ where h l is the height of water table perpendicular to the slope i is slope angle q s l2t 1 is the flux per unit width along the hillslope in the saturated zone q us l2t 1 is the flux per unit width along the hillslope in the unsaturated zones ϕ l is the piezometric head z l is elevation and k s lt 1 and k ψ lt 1 are the saturated and unsaturated hydraulic conductivities respectively unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k ψ and soil water content θ ψ are related to pressure head which can be expressed by van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 however the complexity of traditional vg model hinders the derivation of the new model thus this paper employs the improved vg model in accordance with kong et al 2016 which can be written as 5 θ ψ θ r θ s θ r 1 1 α ψ 1 1 n 1 k ψ k s 1 1 β ψ n 2 1 1 n 2 where θ s is saturated water content α l 1 n 1 β l 1 and n 2 are the fitting parameters related to soil properties readers may refer to luo et al 2019 for details about equation 5 as this paper focuses on two layered hillslope aquifers corresponding to each layer the vg function should be written as 6a θ 1 ψ θ r 1 θ s 1 θ r 1 1 1 α 1 ψ 1 1 n 1 6b θ 2 ψ θ r 2 θ s 2 θ r 2 1 1 α 2 ψ 1 1 n 2 6c k 3 ψ k s 3 1 1 β 3 ψ n 3 1 1 n 3 6d k 4 ψ k s 4 1 1 β 4 ψ n 4 1 1 n 4 where θ 1 and θ 2 are the soil water content of under layer and up layer soil respectively θ r 1 and θ r 2 are residual water content of under layer and up layer soil respectively θ s 1 and θ s 2 are the saturated water content of under layer and up layer soil respectively α 1 l 1 n 1 β 3 l 1 and n 3 are the correction parameter of under layer soil based on kong s method α 2 l 1 n 2 β 4 l 1 and n 4 are the correction parameter of up layer soil based on kong s method k 3 ψ lt 1 and k 4 ψ lt 1 are unsaturated hydraulic conductivities of under layer and up layer soil respectively k s 3 lt 1 and k s 4 lt 1 are saturated hydraulic conductivities of under layer and up layer soil respectively in the early and middle stages of drainage the saturated and unsaturated zones co exist as the water level is over the slope as the double layered structure contributes to different soil characters the circumstance of h 0 should be divided into two diverse situations namely h 1 h d fig 1 a and 0 h h 1 fig 1b where h 1 is the thickness of the under layer soil in the late period of drainage only the unsaturated zone exists as the water level falls down the slope h 0 fig 1c the total effective water

difficult to derive the analytical solutions directly we used the finite difference method to solve eq 11 refer to supporting information for more details to verify the accuracy of the double layered hsb model and make the results more universal this study conducted laboratory experiments and ran numerical simulations using the hydrus model by considering different soil combinations in the experimental verification the fast draining standard sand and glass beads with a particle size of 3 4 mm were selected for the double layered soil in the numerical verification the slow draining sand and clay were adopted 3 1 comparison with experiments a flume with length of 1 8 m width of 0 2 m and height of 0 6 m was used for the experiment the flume is placed on a forklift and its slope angle can be adjusted by the forklift two slope angles were considered 5 and 7 fig 2 a the upper surface boundary of the flume was connected to the atmosphere while the downstream boundary the height of the outlet was constant at 0 01 m the bottom boundary was set to be impermeable the aquifer thickness d and subsoil thickness h 1 were 0 4 m and 0 2 m respectively two soil combinations were used glass beads overlying lab sand case c1 and the reverse case case c2 to avoid air trap the flume was filled with water before adding lab sand and beads to prevent sand and glass beads from leaking out of the outlet geotextile was fixed in the flume the sand and glass beads used in the experiments have a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 4 57 10 3 m s 1 and 2 10 2 m s 1 darcy s test respectively more parameters are summarized in table 1 to observe the change of water level inside the slope six transverse piezometers were placed on the back of the tank the outermost pressure piezometer was 0 15 m away from the outlet and the rest were placed at an interval of 0 3 m a rectangular column was placed below the outlet to collect the discharged water fig 2b the displacement was determined by the change of water level in the rectangular column which was measured by water pressure datalogger solinst levelogger model 3001 f6 m2 1 mm accuracy fig 2b shows the location of the water pressure datalogger fig 3 compares the measured and predicted water table and outflow rates as can be seen with the progress of drainage the arch of the water level line in case c1 gradually moves to the top of the hillslope on the top of the hillslope the unsaturated zone has strong water holding capacity and the low permeability results in the higher water level the water level in case c2 presents different patterns as it has not been adjusted in the early stage of drainage fig 5 affected by the initial state of drainage the water surface is not smooth in the original stage however as the drainage continues the water level gradually becomes flat and the arch of the water level moves to the slope toe gradually resulting from the faster slope top drainage and drop of water level the simulated outflow shows that the exponential attenuation trend is consistent with the measured data figs 4 and 6 in the numerical model the initial water level was taken as the initial condition considering the simulation results the double layered soil hsb model established in this paper appropriately reflects the drainage characteristics of the double layered soil and fits well with the experiment results 3 2 comparison with hydrus variable saturation groundwater flow model hydrus was used to further confirm the rationality of the proposed hsb model for double layered hillslopes following the work of luo et al 2018 the slope length l and the aquifer thickness d are 6 m and 0 5 m respectively the initial water level is 0 3 m and the simulation duration is 10 h to verify the hsb model of double layered soil two kinds of soil layer combinations were adopted 1 upper clay and lower sand 2 upper sand and lower clay for each combination two slope angles 5 and 10 and four subsoil thicknesses 0 1 m 0 15 m 0 2 m and 0 25 m were considered therefore a total of 16 cases were simulated other soil parameters are listed in table 1 the outlet was set as a dirichlet type boundary with h 0 t 0 1 and the upper end of the hillslope was treated as no flow i e h x cos i sin i 0 hydrus was used to simulate the variation process of water level and seepage flow at the toe of slope under different conditions then the simulation results were compared with hsb model of double layered soil the simulation results with subsoil thickness of 0 25 m and the slope angles of 5 and 10 are shown in figs 7 10 other simulation results are shown in the appendix figs s1 s12 it can be seen that the trend of water level and seepage flow at slope toe of the new hsb model is generally consistent with that of hydrus simulation the consistency further verifies the accuracy of the double layered hsb model considering unsaturated flow since unsaturated flow is considered in the double layered hsb model the negative pressure variation in the unsaturated zone can also be predicted when the clay layer is underneath the sand layer the drainage time is longer and the negative pressure appears in the later stage fig 7 however when the underlying layer is sand the top of the slope quickly enters into the negative pressure area with the progress of drainage fig 9 in the later stage of drainage the water level exhibits an obvious s type indicating special vertical distribution of negative pressure 4 results and discussions based on the modified hsb model proposed in this paper the recession flow analysis of double layered hillslope aquifers was conducted in this section we first compare the recession characteristics of two homogeneous hillslope aquifers to see if the variation trends of b are consistent and then study the law of recession of double layered hillslope aquifers composed of sand and clay the aquifer length l aquifer thickness d initial water level and boundary conditions are consistent with the settings in section 3 2 in view of the difference of drainage duration the simulation time of soil combination of lower clay with upper sand is 300 h while that of the reverse order is 60 h the thickness of subsoil is 0 5 m 0 25 m 0 2 m 0 15 m and 0 1 m respectively thus the simulations include 10 different cases table 2 4 1 comparison between clay and sandy homogeneous hillslope fig 11 shows the recession curves of different hillslope aquifers as the slope angle changes the recession curves of homogeneous hillslopes satisfy the power law relation of eq 1 and the regression curve presents two transition points and three power law regimes fig 11 a1 and 11 b1 the red circle represents the transition point of short time and long time b 1 and b 2 while the blue circle is that of long time and longer time b 2 and b 3 the three stage recession curve for the clay hillslope aquifers is not very obvious but apparent for the sandy hillslope aquifers furthermore with the increase of the slope angle the transition time between b 1 and b 2 is advanced and the corresponding transition flow increases to further study the effects of slope angle on recession flow analysis we linearly fitted different sections of the recession curve log log plot of dq dt versus q to obtain the values of b 1 b 2 and b 3 for the hillslope composed of clay fig 12 a1 the slope angle has the greatest influence on b 2 the value of b 2 increases with the rise of slope angle from 4 0 in the case of mild slope i 5 to 5 6 for a steep slope i 15 moreover the value of b 1 also increases as the slope angle increases the increase amplitude of b 1 ranging from 3 3 to 3 8 is smaller than b 2 the value of b 3 is insensitive to slope angle compared with b 1 and b 2 since it only decreases slightly from 3 5 to 3 2 for the hillslope composed of sand fig 12 b1 the slope angle has the greatest influence on b 1 with the increase of slope angle the value of b 1 increases from 4 5 for slope angle of 5 to 6 7 for slope angle of 15 however the law of b 2 for fully sandy hillslope is different from b 1 the value of b 2 decreases with the rise of slope angle from 1 2 to 0 7 furthermore the value of b 3 decreases slightly from 1 5 to 1 4 as the slope angle rises in general the values of b 1 of clay and sandy homogeneous hillslope both increase with the rise of slope angle however the increase amplitude of b 1 for clay hillslope is smaller than that of sandy hillslope it is worth noting that with the increase of slope angle the value of b 2 for clay hillslope increases while b2 for sandy hillslope decreases the values of b 3 for clay hillslope and sandy hillslope both slightly decrease with the increase of slope angle while the value of b 3 for clay hillslope is bigger than that of sandy hillslope above comparison indicates that the variation trends of b for homogeneous hillslopes composed of different soil types are inconsistent and even opposite therefore it is necessary to explore the law of recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers 4 2 comparison between homogeneous hillslopes and the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand fig 11 a2 11 a5 indicate that the recession curves of hillslope aquifers composed of lower clay and upper sand still take the multi section power law form with three regimes furthermore as the thickness of the lower clay layer gradually decreases cases 2 5 it is found that the three stage characteristics of the recession curves become more obvious gradually transforming to the trend of the sandy slope moreover with the increase of slope angle the transition time between b 1 and b 2 is advanced and the corresponding transition flow increases similar to homogeneous hillslopes we fitted linear functions to different sections of the recession curves for double layered hillslopes and discuss the variation trend of b for the slope composed of lower clay and upper sand fig 12a2 12a5 the slope angle has the greatest influence on b 1 the value of b 1 increases with the rise of slope angle from about 5 in the case of mild hillslope i 5 to about 8 for a steep slope i 15 however the trend of b 2 is related to the thickness of the lower clay soil when the thickness of the lower clay is 0 25 m and 0 2 m fig 12a2 12a3 the value of b 2 increases with the increase of the angle while that of b 2 decreases when the thickness of the lower sand is 0 15 m and 0 1 m fig 12a4 12a5 additionally the value of b 3 for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand is also insensitive to slope angle compared with b 1 and b 2 the value of b 3 increases slightly from 1 4 to 1 6 to highlight the influence of heterogeneity on recession flow we compare the variation trends of b for homogeneous hillslope and the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand first the values of b 1 for clay hillslope sandy hillslope and the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand all increase as the slope angle increases nevertheless the increase amplitude of b 1 for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand is bigger than that for clay and sandy hillslopes second with the increase of slope angle the variation trends of b 2 for homogeneous hillslopes are monotonic while that for the hillslope composed of clay and sand is more complex which is related to the thickness of lower soil third the amplitudes of variation of b 3 for these hillslopes are all small and the variation trends of b 3 for homogeneous hillslopes and the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand are different with the increase of slope angle the values of b 3 for clay and sandy hillslopes slightly decrease while that for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand increases 4 3 comparison between homogeneous hillslopes and the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay as shown in fig 11 b2 11 b5 the recession curves of hillslope aquifers composed of lower sand and upper clay still have three power law regimes with two transition points in addition as the thickness of the lower layer of sand gradually decreases cases 7 10 the three stage characteristics of the recession curves become vague and gradually transform to the trend of a fully clay hillslope furthermore with the increase of slope angle the transition time between b1 and b2 moves up and the transition flow is enhanced it can be seen from fig 12 b2 12 b5 that the slope angle has the greatest influence on b 1 for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay the trend of b 1 is sophisticated which is associated with the thickness of the lower sand soil for example when the thickness of the lower sand is 0 25 m and 0 2 m fig 12 b2 12 b3 the value of b 1 decreases with the increase of the angle while that of b1 raises when the thickness of the lower sand is 0 15 m and 0 1 m fig 12 b4 12 b5 moreover the value of b 2 monotonically decreases with the rise of slope angle the value of b 3 increases slightly from 1 5 to 1 7 to further investigate the influence of heterogeneity on recession flow analysis we compare the variation trend of homogeneous hillslopes and the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay first with the increase of slope angle the values of b 1 for homogeneous hillslopes increase monotonously while that for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay is more complex which is related to the thickness of the lower soil second the values of b 2 for sandy hillslope and the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay both decrease with the rise of slope angle while that for clay hillslope increases third with the increase of slope angle the values of b 3 for homogeneous hillslopes both slightly decrease while that for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay increases the values of b 3 for these hillslopes are all insensitive to slope angle compared with b 1 and b 2 these findings further demonstrate that the law of recession characteristics between homogeneous and double layered hillslopes are different 4 4 comparison between two different double layered hillslopes the influence of the thickness of subsoil on the recession curves of the double layered hillslope is further analyzed fig 13 shows the recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers as the thickness of subsoil change for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand fig 13 a1 13 a5 with the increase of the thickness of the lower layer of clay the transition time between b 1 and b 2 is delayed and the transition flow decreases however for the slope composed of lower sand and upper clay figs 13 b1 b5 the transition time between b 1 and b 2 is advanced and the transition flow goes up with the increase of lower sand according to fig 14 it can be seen that the thickness of subsoil can affect the values of b 1 b 2 and b 3 of double layered hillslopes for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand fig 14 a1 14 a5 the thickness of subsoil has the greatest influence on b 1 the value of b 1 increases with the rise of thickness of subsoil which ranges from 4 to12 moreover the value of b 2 also increases as the thickness of subsoil increases while the increase amplitude of value of b 2 is significantly smaller than that of b 1 the value of b 3 increases slightly increases from 1 4 to 1 5 for the slope composed of lower sand and upper clay fig 14 b1 14 b5 the thickness of subsoil has the greatest influence on b 1 the trend of b 1 is complex which is associated with slope angle when the slope angle is small fig 14 b1 14 b4 the value of b 1 tends to increase with the increase of subsoil thickness while that of b 1 decreases with the increase of subsoil thickness when the angle increases to 15 fig 14 b5 the value of b 2 decreases with the increase of the thickness of subsoil while the value of b 3 decreases slightly from 1 7 to 1 5 from the above analysis we can see that the laws of the recession curves between double layered hillslopes are also different first with the increase of the thickness of subsoil the values of b 1 for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand increases monotonously while that for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay is more complex which is related to slope angle second the values of b 2 for hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand increases with the increase of the thickness of subsoil while that of the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay decreases third with the increase of the thickness of subsoil the values of b 3 for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand slightly increase while that for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay decreases the values of b 3 for double layered hillslopes are all insensitive to the thickness of subsoil compared with b 1 and b 2 during the last drainage stage capillary effects dominate and hence leads to an insignificant change of b 3 5 conclusions to more reasonably analyze the recession flow for natural hillslopes this paper proposed a modified boussinesq equation applicable to double layered aquifers the new model considers the unsaturated flow and soil stratification and is verified by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations recession flow analysis of double layered hillslopes is subsequently carried out the main key findings are as follows 1 the recession curves of homogeneous and double layered hillslope aquifers all satisfy the power law and presents two transition points and three different power law regimes b 1 b 2 and b 3 however the variation trend of b for homogeneous hillslopes are inconsistent especially b 2 therefore the law of recession curves of double layered hillslope aquifers composed of sand and clay are more complex 2 the variation trends of b 1 between two double layered hillslope aquifers are different the value of b 1 is positively correlated with the slope angle and the thickness of subsoil for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand while that of hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay does not show a significant positive correlation when the thickness of subsoil is thick the value of b 1 for hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay decreases with the increase of the slope angle 3 the variation trends of b 2 between double layered hillslope aquifers are also different for the hillslope composed of lower sand and upper clay the value of b 2 is negatively correlated with the slope angle and the thickness of subsoil for the hillslope composed of lower clay and upper sand the value of b 2 is mainly positively correlated with slope angle and the thickness of subsoil however in some cases when the thickness of subsoil is small the value of b 2 decreases with the increase of the slope angle 4 the value of b 3 is quite insensitive to slope angle and the thickness of the subsoil compared with b 1 and b 2 irrespective of homogeneous hillslopes or double double layered hillslopes the possible reason for this phenomenon is that the recession flow of b 1 and b 2 comes from the saturated and unsaturated zone while the recession flow of b 3 is entirely governed by water drainage from the unsaturated zone during the late drainage stage and the unsaturated zone has strong capillary effect with the progress of drainage capillary effect becomes stronger than the gravity effect leading to the change of b 3 not obvious through the above analysis it can be known that the value of b in double layered hillslopes is more complex than that of homogeneous hillslopes which is affected by slope angle soil type and soil thickness in reality most of the slopes are heterogeneous obvious stratification the heterogeneity of slope will exert great influence on the drainage rates at different stages then the value of b of homogeneous hillslopes cannot be directly used to deduce the local hydraulic parameters although the present study reveals the influences of heterogeneity on hillslope recession flow more research is needed to further advance our understanding of the process in this paper we neglect recharge and evaporation besides this study assumes that the hillslopes are composed of sand and clay whereas most hillslopes can be made up of other soil types further theoretical studies should consider these factors to gain a deeper insight into the hillslope recession characteristics credit authorship contribution statement yunan ding conceptualization formal analysis investigation resources data

3911,understanding flood event related risk in an interconnected river lake system irls is a prerequisite for developing water resource management strategies and enhancing disaster resilience previous flood event related risk assessments either hardly consider the context in which water diversion encounters flood events or hardly consider the physical process stochastic analysis and multivariate interactions of flood event characteristics simultaneously thereby resulting in a less reliable assessment of flood event related risk to resolve this limitation a copula coupled hydrodynamic risk assessment model chram is proposed to characterize the physical multivariate and stochastic nature of risk improving the accuracy of risk assessment in this study chram is capable of accurately quantifying flood event related risks i e flood risk and ecological risk of the nansi lake basin in the flood season under the operation of the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project in china our findings revealed that the total flood volume rsum and duration td of flood events were significantly sensitive characteristic indexes for flood risk and ecological risk in addition the security domains of flood risk rsum 35 mm and td 23 d and ecological risk rsum 50 mm and td 27 d were determined based on the analysis of the relationship between sensitive characteristic indexes and risk indicators the results also showed that the impact of td on flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk was 3 14 times greater than the impact of rsum the occurrence probability of flood ecological combined risk was smaller than that of flood risk but greater than that of ecological risk with the corresponding maximum risk probabilities of 11 2 36 5 and 4 7 respectively this study extends the current knowledge about risk assessment in irls and is beneficial to instruct the management of projects for similar systems keywords risk assessment water diversion interconnected river lake system copula hydrodynamics 1 introduction freshwater is a fundamental part of ecosystems and human society with the significance of providing food energy and services for human beings as well as maintaining the health conditions of ecosystems li et al 2017 rosegrant et al 2009 wang et al 2018a water scarcity exists in many regions of the world due to the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and the rapid development of the population and economy zhang et al 2020 gleick 1993 to alleviate water shortages water diversion projects have been widely applied in such water deficient areas zhang et al 2015 however with the transfer of large amounts of water the hydrological cycle and hydrodynamic process in source and recipient basins have inevitably changed dai et al 2020 xia et al 2018 mauser and bach 2009 which also creates some negative impacts zhuang 2016 zhang et al 2015 for example flood risk wang et al 2019 ecological degradation risk yang et al 2018 and environmental risk zhu et al 2008 are caused by the operation of water diversion project in an interconnected river lake system irls therefore a reliable assessment of risks associated with water diversion projects is crucial for the efficient and safe management of water diversion projects and for enhancing resilience to water transfer induced risks recently studies of flood event related risk have mainly focused on urban flooding coastal flooding and river flooding under the condition of climate change and extreme events karim and mimura 2008 hallegatte et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 while little attention has been given to risks in the context of water diversion encountering flood events this might be because water transfer is commonly carried out in the nonflood season huang et al 2019 however with the worldwide increase in droughts associated with global warming dai 2013 an increasing number of water diversion projects are faced with the dilemma of having insufficient water to divert in the nonflood season castle et al 2014 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 thus water transfer in the flood season has been regarded as a strategy to alleviate tension and improve the sustainability of water diversion projects huang et al 2019 previous studies on the hydrological response to water diversion projects have shown an increase in water levels in lakes of conveyance channels and water receiving basins when the diversion projects are operating wang et al 2018b wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 notably some of the lakes are located in basins with a history of frequent flooding thus water diversion undoubtedly affects flood processes in these basins along with a significant impediment to flood control and a shifted habitat of submerged macrophytes leading to a rise in flood risk and ecological risk yang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 therefore it is desirable to gain insight into the nature of flood event related risks within such a context risk associated with flood events typically results from the superposition of various physical processes zhang et al 2021 therefore the physical multivariate and stochastic nature of risk needs to be considered for precise risk assessment in general there are two ways to analyze flood event related risks mosavi et al 2018 one is to use a physically based model which is scenario based exploration of uncertainty using hydrodynamic modeling for example karim and mimura 2008 used a hydrodynamic model to evaluate the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on cyclonic storm surge flood risks in bangladesh based on eight flooding scenarios of plausible future conditions a 2d hydrodynamic inundation model was proposed to reveal the evolution of future urban inundation under different scenarios wu et al 2017 however this method cannot accurately reflect the risk s stochastic and multivariate characteristics because of the limited number of man made scenarios and the neglect of flood events randomness tang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 another way is to use a data driven model based on statistical method such as fuzzy mathematical method jiang et al 2009 machine learning algorithm park and lee 2020 cloud model combining analytic hierarchy process entropy weight method and x conditional cloud huang et al 2019 and copula function liu et al 2020 when analyzing the risk data driven model mainly depends on long term data in the past without considering the physical process it is especially unable to take future anthropogenic intervention such as altered operations of water diversion projects into consideration additionally some of the risk assessments based on the security domain tend to overestimate or underestimate the risk zhou et al 2019 therefore how to reveal its occurrence mechanism incorporating the physical multivariate and stochastic nature of risk is also a scientific problem worth exploring the objective of this study is to develop an accuracy improved risk assessment model on the basis of coupling a hydrodynamic model and copula functions this method is successfully used in the upper nansi lake basin that locates in the water receiving area of the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project hereinafter er snwdp in china particularly the study entails 1 construction of the copula coupled hydrodynamic risk assessment model chram determining the sensitive characteristic indexes of flood events to flood risk and ecological risk as well as the joint probability distributions of the sensitive characteristic indexes and risk indicators 2 analysis of the relationship between the sensitive characteristic indexes of flood events and risk indicators identifying the flood events that cannot lead to flood risk and ecological risk as risk security domains and 3 analysis of probability variation trends of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk outside the security domain this methodology improves the accuracy of risk estimation by incorporating the physical mechanisms and stochastic characteristics of risk occurrence under future conditions in addition the case study in the nansi lake basin provides a scientific basis not only for evaluating er snwdp s operation plan in the future but also for better instructing the management of projects in the nansi lake basin 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data sources nansi lake is located in the yi shu si river basin of the huai river basin with an area of 1266 km2 it is a typical large shallow lake with an average depth of 2 m zhao et al 2020 the lake is divided into an upper lake and a lower lake by the erji dam to control flood discharge zhang et al 2003 fig 1 c the area of the upper lake accounts for 47 5 of the total lake area and receives inflow water from 88 of the nansi lake basin which indicates that flood control in the upper lake is very important a total of 30 rivers flow into the upper lake including 8 main rivers namely the guangfu river si river baima river beisha river liangji canal zhuzhaoxin river wanfu river and dongyu river fig 1c their contribution to the lake inflow is 24 2 for liangji river 22 8 for zhuzhaoxin river 18 1 for dongyu river 14 3 for si river and around 20 for the rest four rivers in the flood season compared with the rivers in the western region of nansi lake that are in the flood plain of the yellow river most rivers in the eastern region of nansi lake are in mountainous areas with characteristics of short river sources and quick flow indicating that they have a more serious impact on flood risk in the short term thus the eastern rivers of the upper nansi lake are the focus of this study the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china is the largest water diversion project in the world with a current delivery of 25 billion m3 of fresh water per year liu and zheng 2002 zhang 2009 the er snwdp links five lakes and transfers water from downstream of the yangtze river to beijing fig 1a b chen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 as one of the storage lakes of the er snwdp nansi lake is mainly used to store and regulate water resources the water is transferred into the upper lake from the erji dam and out of it through the liangji canal according to the plan of er snwdp the operation period in the first planning phase covers only the nonflood season october to may to ensure water quality and flood control safety wang et al 2019 however as the water shortages in the huang huai hai plain become increasingly intense the operation period of the er snwdp will increase by at least one month in the flood season based on the second planning phase of the er snwdp the hydrological data originate from the hydrological yearbooks of the huai river basin which are mainly flood discharge processes of 12 year 2007 2018 typical floods in the upper boundaries of 8 rivers apart from those drought years 2014 and 2015 a total of 13 floods are selected for input to the hydrodynamic model to carry out the simulation studies in addition the daily water level records of xindian station nanyang station and boluoshu station in both 2007 high flow year and 2010 normal flow year are used for the calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model 2 2 copula coupled hydrodynamic risk assessment model chram is proposed to accurately quantify flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk in a specific basin under irls by coupling the hydrodynamic model and copula functions chram is capable of characterizing the physical process stochastic process and multivariate interaction of risk better reflecting its nature of localization multivariate and uncertainty the research framework of chram is shown in fig s1 specifically the first step of chram is to determine what kinds of flood events can lead to flood risk and ecological risk based on the nature flow paradigm hydrodynamic model and correlation analysis we choose to use the nature flow paradigm to characterize basin specific flood events poff et al 1997 eight flood related indexes from the paradigm are used to characterize the entire range of each flood event pi and distinguish their differences table 1 zhang et al 2020 then each flood event is used as an input to the basin specific hydrodynamic model to obtain the simulated water level results in the lake that can be further used as flood risk and ecological risk indicators ij eq 1 2 with all the characteristic indexes of flood events and their corresponding risk indicators correlation analysis between each flood event characteristic index and risk indicator is conducted to determine the significantly sensitive flood event characteristic indexes associated with flood risk and ecological risk 1 i 1 t end t warning 2 i 2 wl t end wl t begin where i1 represents the number of days when the water level in the lake is beyond the warning water level tover35 the warning water level of the upper nansi lake is 35 m according to the information publicized by the hydrological bureau of shandong province i2 represents the amplitude of water level variation during a flood event amplitude tend and twarning are the times when the flood ends and the water level reaches the warning water level separately and wltend and wltbegin are the corresponding water levels when the flood begins and ends the second step is to estimate the occurrence probability of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk based on copula function and set theory we choose to use copula function to build the joint probability distributions of the sensitive flood events characteristic indexes and risk indicators according to sklar s theorem an n copula c can be used to build an n dimensional joint distribution function h for pi and ij with margins f1 f2 fn 3 h p 1 p 2 p i i 1 i 2 i j c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f i p i f i 1 i 1 f i 2 i 2 f i j i j where i j n 0 i 8 0 j 2 when j 0 the joint distribution is just about pi once the joint distribution of the sensitive flood events characteristic indexes is obtained set theory can be used to analyze the occurrence probability under different scenarios risk scenario s can be defined as each of the sensitive characteristic indexes remaining in a specific interval between pi and pi salvadori et al 2016 and its occurrence probability using the copula based joint probability distribution will be made clear below in this way the risk probability is represented by the occurrence frequency of risk causing flood events outside risk security domain notably the risk security domain here is defined by pi 4 p x s c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f i p i c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f i p i in addition an improved way in this study to indicate the occurrence of risk is to set the risk indicators beyond their thresholds directly while setting the sensitive flood event characteristic indexes within certain values in the joint probability distributions the occurrence probability can be calculated as eqs 5 and 6 which represent the single risk and dual risk respectively as different numbers of risk indicators are involved in a three or four dimensional joint distribution 5 p p 1 p 1 p 2 p 2 i j i j c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f 3 i j 6 p p 1 p 1 p 2 p 2 i 1 i 1 i 2 i 2 c f 1 p 1 f 2

index analysis we clustered 4 main rivers in eastern upper nansi lake into an eastern virtual river according to topologic relationships and runoff correlations shown in figs s2 and s3 then the characteristic indexes of 13 flood events in the eastern virtual river were obtained based on the calculation formula in table 1 in addition the risk indicators tover35 and amplitude for different flood events during operation of the er snwdp were obtained based on the 1d 2d coupled hydrodynamic model of the upper nansi lake building details and output were shown in supplementary material s 5 and s 6 all the characteristic indexes and risk indicators of the 13 flood events are shown in table 2 then correlation analysis among each flood event characteristic index and risk indicator were conducted by evaluating the kendall rank correlation coefficient as the correlation matrix in fig 2 shows td and rsum are the two indexes with the highest and second highest correlations to tover35 and amplitude thus these two indexes were defined as the sensitive indexes then five commonly used parametric copula functions i e gaussian student s t clayton frank and gumbel copula functions were applied to establish the joint probability distributions of td rsum tover35 and amplitude when using copula functions the first step was to define marginal distributions for rsum td tover35 and amplitude through the conventional univariate approach zhou et al 2019 in this study 10 widely used distributions were fitted and compared including normal exponential logistic gamma weibull cauchy gumbel log normal log logistic and pearson type iii distributions tosunoglu and singh 2018 the akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse were used to select the most suitable univariate distribution tosunoglu and singh 2018 zhou et al 2019 as a result the marginal distributions of rsum td tover35 and amplitude were found to follow cauchy weibull normal and gamma distributions well respectively with the smallest aic and bic values table s1 subsequently the maximum likelihood method was used to fit copula functions while aic and bic were used to further compare the five copula functions the results showed that the gaussian copula gave the smallest aic and bic values which therefore confirmed that the gaussian copula was the most appropriate copula for use in constructing the bivariate probability distribution of rsum and td table s2 we also used the same method to construct two three dimensional and one four dimensional joint probability distributions as a result the student s t copula performed the best for one three dimensional joint probability distribution involving rsum td and tover35 the gaussian copula performed the best for another three dimensional joint probability distribution involving rsum td and amplitude as well as the four dimensional joint probability distribution involving rsum td tover35 and amplitude the details are shown in table s2 2 4 model calibration and validation chram mainly consists of the hydrodynamic module and the copula function module model calibration and validation were conducted in stages from which the hydrodynamic module was first calibrated and validated to ensure reasonable simulation of the daily water level that was directly related to the risk indicators furthermore this process also ensured that the data used in the copula function were accurate in addition calibration and validation of the copula function module were conducted to ensure that the correlation structures between each sensitive characteristic index and risk indicator were described accurately so that the occurrence probabilities of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk were reliable besides sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the chram was also conducted the details are shown in supplementary material s 7 for the hydrodynamic module in chram two typical flood events that occurred separately in 2007 and 2010 in the upper nansi lake basin were used to calibrate and validate the hydrodynamic model as a result the simulated water level process shows an acceptable agreement with the measured process at three hydrologic stations xindian station nanyang station and boluoshu station fig s4 additionally the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to examine the performance of the coupling model table s3 the results show that in both the calibration and validation stages the values of mae and rmse for the water level in the upper nansi lake are 0 13 m while those in rivers are 0 29 m moreover the values of nse are all greater than 0 6 thus all the above prove the model is reliable for the copula function module the kolmogorov smirnov k s test conducted at the 5 significance level was used to assess the appropriateness of marginal theoretical distributions the results show that the p values all exceed 0 05 which means that the theoretical distributions are considered to be reasonable models for all four variables table s4 in addition a parametric bootstrap based pb goodness of fit test kojadinovic and yan 2010 was used to examine the goodness of fit of five copula based joint probability distributions the p values of pb goodness of fit for four chosen copula functions i e gaussian student s t gaussian and gaussian copulas are all over 0 05 indicating that their goodness of fit is fairly good table s2 2 5 flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk scenarios after determining the sensitive indexes to risks i e rsum and td we needed to decide what kinds of flood events with certain characteristic indexes of rsum and td could lead to flood risk or ecological risk separately the first step was to create a threshold for each of the risk indicators i e tover35 and amplitude which could be used to judge whether the flood risk or ecological risk occurred in detail as the value of the flood risk indicator tover35 exceeding zero represents that the water level is beyond warning water level we defined zero as the tover35 threshold at which flood risk might occur in addition potamogeton crispus is considered to be the dominant specie of the upper nansi lake in july with a light compensation point of 3 m yuan et al 2013 as macrophyte growth will be inhibited when water depth is beyond its light compensation point a water depth of 3 m can be treated as the threshold of ecological risk indicator thus the amplitude threshold was obtained as 1 05 m based on the bottom elevation and initial water level in the upper nansi lake then three dimensional scatter diagrams were used to analyze the relationship among rsum td and tover35 as well as rsum td and amplitude determining the area without flood risk and ecological risk respectively as the risk security domains thus the corresponding thresholds of r sum and t d were also determined to further analyze the probability variation trends of flood risk and ecological risk we set a series of different inputs as risk scenarios to two three dimensional joint probability distributions that were separately related to flood risk and ecological risk first we made the inputs of risk indicators beyond their thresholds tover35 0 or amplitude 1 05 to indicate the occurrence of flood risk or ecological risk and then we made the values of sensitive indexes rsum and td in a range from the thresholds of the security domain to the maximum of their samples thus the variation in the risk probability under different scenarios outside the security domain could be obtained specifically the flood risk scenarios were set through 1 keeping the value of rsum unchanged while grouping rsum with td in sequence as the value of td changed from 23 d to 31 d at the interval of one day and 2 keeping the value of td unchanged while grouping td with rsum in sequence as the value of rsum changed from 35 mm to 40 mm and then to 110 mm at intervals of 10 mm similarly the ecological risk scenarios were set with the value of td changing from 20 d to 31 d and the value of rsum changing from 50 mm to 110 mm additionally we set the flood ecological combined risk scenarios to compare the differences in risk probability variation trends between each single risk and dual risk the flood ecological combined risk scenarios were set in the same way as flood risk scenarios except that the scenarios were used as inputs for the four dimensional joint probability distribution with two risk indicators by setting both of the risk indicators beyond their thresholds the condition that flood risk and ecological risk occur at the same time were considered the combinations of rsum and td were the same as the flood risk scenarios 3 results 3 1 security domain in flood risk and ecological risk with the thresholds of flood risk tover35 0 and ecological risk amplitude 1 05 risk security domains are separately obtained by analyzing the relationship between flood events sensitive characteristic indexes and risk indicators the relationships of rsum td and tover35 as well as rsum td and amplitude are plotted in fig 3 where flood events with tover35 0 are categorized as events without flood risk fig 3a and flood events with amplitude 1 05 are categorized as events without ecological risk fig 3b thus the security domains of flood risk and ecological risk are determined with certain thresholds of rsum and td more precisely when rsum is more than 35 mm or td is more than 23 d these kinds of flood events can be determined as flood risk causing events for ecological risk flood events with the characteristic index of rsum over 50 mm are determined as ecological risk causing events 3 2 probability variation trends of flood risk and ecological risk outside the security domain probability variation trends of flood risk and ecological risk are obtained based on eqs 5 and the risk scenarios set before in general the occurrence probability of flood risk rises as rsum or td rises and the maximum risk probability is 36 5 when rsum is 110 mm and td is 31 fig 4 a when analyzing the impact of td on flood risk probability it shows that the risk probability rises from 15 5 to 29 9 by 14 4 when td rises from 23 d to 31 d and rsum remains 35 mm and rises from 17 3 to 36 5 by 19 2 when td rises from 23 d to 31 d and rsum remains 110 mm in addition regarding the impact of rsum on flood risk probability we find that the risk probability rises from 15 5 to 17 3 by 1 8 when rsum rises from 35 mm to 110 mm and td remains 23 d and rises from 29 9 to 36 5 by 6 6 when rsum rises from 35 mm to 110 mm and td remains 31 d thus it is clear that td has a greater impact on the occurrence probability of flood risk in addition as the variation trend of each profile curve shows the risk probability rises relatively rapidly at first and then tends to be flat with the turning point of rsum at 60 mm therefore attention should be given to the situation when rsum reaches 60 mm according to the change of intervals between different profile curves it can be seen that the increase amplitude of risk probability shows a decreasing trend as td rises for the ecological risk the maximum risk probability is 4 7 when rsum is 110 mm and td is 31 d fig 4c indicating that the risk of low light stress on submersed macrophytes under the operation of the er snwdp during the flood season is very low moreover the value of risk probability does not become positive until td reaches 27 d which means that ecological risk may only occur if the flood event lasts longer than 27 days therefore td 27 d is also added as a constraint to the security domain of ecological risk when analyzing the impact of td on ecological risk probability it shows that the risk probability rises from 0 4 to 3 6 by 3 2 when td rises from 20 d to 31 d and rsum remains 50 mm and rises from 1 3 to 4 7 by 3 4 when td rises from 20 d to 31 d and rsum remains 110 mm in addition as for the impact of rsum on ecological risk probability we find that the risk probability rises from 0 4 to 1 3 by 0 9 when rsum rises from 50 mm to 110 mm and td remains 27 d and rises from 3 6 to 4 7 by 1 1 when rsum rises from 50 mm to 110 mm and td remains 31 d therefore it is obvious that the risk probability changes little as rsum and td change in general but the impact of td on the ecological risk probability is still greater than that of rsum in addition there is a linear relationship between the risk probability and td according to the nearly equal interval of profile curves 3 3 comparison between single risk and dual risk overall the occurrence probability of flood ecological combined risk is smaller than that of flood risk but greater than that of ecological risk with corresponding maximum risk probabilities of 11 2 36 5 and 4 7 respectively figs 4a c and 5 the impact results of td and rsum on each risk probability show that td has a greater effect on all three types of risks than rsum moreover td has the greatest influence on flood risk probability with an average increase of 16 8 while its influence on ecological risk probability and flood ecological combined risk probability is basically the same i e approximately one fifth of its influence on flood risk probability compared with the average increase caused by td the average increase in flood risk probability caused by rsum is approximately 4 notably the occurrence probability of flood ecological combined risk is basically unchanged when rsum increases fig 5 meaning that rsum has almost no effect on flood ecological combined risk probability when td is over 23 d in addition probability variation trends of flood risk and ecological risk calculated by the occurrence frequency of risk causing flood events outside risk security domains are also obtained based on eqs 4 and risk security domains fig 4b d these figures show the same trends as the results calculated by the joint distributions involving risk indicators fig 4a c however the values of risk occurrence probability are different on the whole the flood risk probability calculated based on the occurrence frequency of risk causing flood events is smaller than that calculated based on the joint distribution involving risk indicator and the ecological risk probability is the opposite this finding indicates that the security domains are either too large or too small to reflect the exact risk probability 4 discussion 4 1 significant role of flood duration in irls under water diversion based on the results of the probability variation trends of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk the rationality of td playing a leading role in the impact on each risk as well as the difference between dual risk and single risk are analyzed normally when rsum remains the same the flood risk probability and ecological risk probability will decline as td increases liu et al 2020 however the occurrence probabilities of all kinds of risks show a rising trend as td increases in this study because of the operation of the er snwdp specifically the water transferred into the upper lake from the erji dam is 125 m3 s and out of it through the liangji canal is 100 m3 s wang et al 2019 this operation means that even if there is no precipitation in the basin the water level in the upper nansi lake will continue to rise followed by the rising risk probability wang et al 2019 therefore td plays a leading role in the impact on each risk in this irls additionally when analyzing the reason why the combined risk probability is relatively much less than that of flood risk and slightly more than that of ecological risk the different risk indicators provide clues based on the thresholds of flood risk indicator and ecological risk indicator mentioned before we know that the highest water level that may not cause flood risk is 35 m while that for ecological risk is 35 3 m indicating that there is still a cushion between flood risk and ecological risk therefore when considering the simultaneous occurrence probability of the two risks the probability value is much closer to the smaller probability value of ecological risk 4 2 improved accuracy of risk assessment after considering risk indicator in the joint probability distribution when using copulas to analyze multivariate risk the common way is to transfer the occurrence frequency of risk causing events into risk based on the joint probability distribution of the risk causing event s sensitive indexes i e contributing variables zhou et al 2019 fan et al 2018 additionally the risk indicator based on the joint return period in the and case fan et al 2016 or the impact function of contributing variables bevacqua et al 2017 are defined to explicitly quantify the risk which indicates that the relationship between risk contributing variables and the impact of the risk needs to be considered thus we proposed a more direct way to consider the correlation between risk contributing variables and risk impact by building the joint probability distribution of risk contributing variables and risk indicators together in addition we also compare the evaluation of risk in both ways to prove the improved accuracy in detail when using the previous method zhou et al 2019 the maximum occurrence probability of risk causing flood events outside the risk security domain is 31 4 fig 4b however the maximum flood risk probability is 36 5 by using the joint probability distribution involving the risk indicator tover35 fig 4a this means that there is still a 5 1 probability of flood risk within the security domain additionally we find that the ecological risk may only occur when td is more than 27 d by joint probability distribution based analysis which cannot be recognized by the previous security domain based method therefore the chram is a more accurate model to evaluate risk probability since it takes risk source and risk receptor into consideration simultaneously better reflecting the risk s synthesized attribute of dangerousness and fragility huang 2015 4 3 risk resistance ability of the existing engineering the greatest challenge of transferring water during the flood season is to ensure water quality and flood control safety at the same time because polluted water cannot be stored in the rivers when floods need to be discharged into the lake cao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 notably the first flood event in the flood season is particularly crucial because all the accumulated pollutants in the rivers are pooled through the flood to flow into the lake resulting in the highest concentration of pollutants to solve this problem we need to evaluate whether the existing engineering has the capability to deal with the polluted water that would flow into the lake for example is there enough storage capacity to store the water or enough wetland to purify the polluted water after the evaluation new engineering or new operation schedules of engineering on each river can be proposed to instruct the management of projects taking the flood event at the flood risk critical point into consideration as the flood risk security domain shows the td threshold is 23 d and the rsum threshold is 35 mm which means that there will be a 5 046 000 m3 flood volume in the eastern rivers flowing into the lake each day based on the related equation in table 1 however the daily sewage treatment capacity of 21 wetland projects in the eastern region of the upper nansi lake is 727 500 m3 in addition the total storage capacity of sewage interception and diversion projects is 15 531 000 m3 except for the use of wetland projects 4 318 500 m3 per day of polluted water still needs to be addressed if we divert them all into sewage interception and diversion projects the projects will be full in just 3 6 days which is far less than the duration of the flood event thus we conclude that water quality assurance is still a serious problem even though there is no flood risk more wetland or more storage projects need to be constructed 5 conclusion in this study we proposed a new methodology chram for flood event related risk assessment considering water diversion in the flood season the advantage of chram is that it can fully reflect the physical multivariate and stochastic nature of risk therefore this method can improve the accuracy of risk assessment and fill the gap of limitation while using physically based models and data driven models this methodology was used in the nansi lake basin with analyses of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk the advantage of chram in improving the accuracy of risk assessment was proven in addition the occurrence probability of flood ecological combined risk is smaller than that of flood risk but greater than that of ecological risk additionally td has a greater effect on all three types of risks than rsum with the limitation of data resources only rsum and td passed the correlation hypothesis test and showed good correlation to risk indicators however there may be more than two representative characteristic indexes to distinguish different flood processes more accurately with the support of long term data in addition further research can be extended to the uncertainty analysis of parameter estimation and the nonstationarity analyses of flood event characteristic indexes when using the copula function in chram credit

3911,understanding flood event related risk in an interconnected river lake system irls is a prerequisite for developing water resource management strategies and enhancing disaster resilience previous flood event related risk assessments either hardly consider the context in which water diversion encounters flood events or hardly consider the physical process stochastic analysis and multivariate interactions of flood event characteristics simultaneously thereby resulting in a less reliable assessment of flood event related risk to resolve this limitation a copula coupled hydrodynamic risk assessment model chram is proposed to characterize the physical multivariate and stochastic nature of risk improving the accuracy of risk assessment in this study chram is capable of accurately quantifying flood event related risks i e flood risk and ecological risk of the nansi lake basin in the flood season under the operation of the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project in china our findings revealed that the total flood volume rsum and duration td of flood events were significantly sensitive characteristic indexes for flood risk and ecological risk in addition the security domains of flood risk rsum 35 mm and td 23 d and ecological risk rsum 50 mm and td 27 d were determined based on the analysis of the relationship between sensitive characteristic indexes and risk indicators the results also showed that the impact of td on flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk was 3 14 times greater than the impact of rsum the occurrence probability of flood ecological combined risk was smaller than that of flood risk but greater than that of ecological risk with the corresponding maximum risk probabilities of 11 2 36 5 and 4 7 respectively this study extends the current knowledge about risk assessment in irls and is beneficial to instruct the management of projects for similar systems keywords risk assessment water diversion interconnected river lake system copula hydrodynamics 1 introduction freshwater is a fundamental part of ecosystems and human society with the significance of providing food energy and services for human beings as well as maintaining the health conditions of ecosystems li et al 2017 rosegrant et al 2009 wang et al 2018a water scarcity exists in many regions of the world due to the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources and the rapid development of the population and economy zhang et al 2020 gleick 1993 to alleviate water shortages water diversion projects have been widely applied in such water deficient areas zhang et al 2015 however with the transfer of large amounts of water the hydrological cycle and hydrodynamic process in source and recipient basins have inevitably changed dai et al 2020 xia et al 2018 mauser and bach 2009 which also creates some negative impacts zhuang 2016 zhang et al 2015 for example flood risk wang et al 2019 ecological degradation risk yang et al 2018 and environmental risk zhu et al 2008 are caused by the operation of water diversion project in an interconnected river lake system irls therefore a reliable assessment of risks associated with water diversion projects is crucial for the efficient and safe management of water diversion projects and for enhancing resilience to water transfer induced risks recently studies of flood event related risk have mainly focused on urban flooding coastal flooding and river flooding under the condition of climate change and extreme events karim and mimura 2008 hallegatte et al 2013 kundzewicz et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 while little attention has been given to risks in the context of water diversion encountering flood events this might be because water transfer is commonly carried out in the nonflood season huang et al 2019 however with the worldwide increase in droughts associated with global warming dai 2013 an increasing number of water diversion projects are faced with the dilemma of having insufficient water to divert in the nonflood season castle et al 2014 yang et al 2015 liu et al 2015 thus water transfer in the flood season has been regarded as a strategy to alleviate tension and improve the sustainability of water diversion projects huang et al 2019 previous studies on the hydrological response to water diversion projects have shown an increase in water levels in lakes of conveyance channels and water receiving basins when the diversion projects are operating wang et al 2018b wang et al 2019 wu et al 2020 notably some of the lakes are located in basins with a history of frequent flooding thus water diversion undoubtedly affects flood processes in these basins along with a significant impediment to flood control and a shifted habitat of submerged macrophytes leading to a rise in flood risk and ecological risk yang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 therefore it is desirable to gain insight into the nature of flood event related risks within such a context risk associated with flood events typically results from the superposition of various physical processes zhang et al 2021 therefore the physical multivariate and stochastic nature of risk needs to be considered for precise risk assessment in general there are two ways to analyze flood event related risks mosavi et al 2018 one is to use a physically based model which is scenario based exploration of uncertainty using hydrodynamic modeling for example karim and mimura 2008 used a hydrodynamic model to evaluate the impacts of climate change and sea level rise on cyclonic storm surge flood risks in bangladesh based on eight flooding scenarios of plausible future conditions a 2d hydrodynamic inundation model was proposed to reveal the evolution of future urban inundation under different scenarios wu et al 2017 however this method cannot accurately reflect the risk s stochastic and multivariate characteristics because of the limited number of man made scenarios and the neglect of flood events randomness tang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 another way is to use a data driven model based on statistical method such as fuzzy mathematical method jiang et al 2009 machine learning algorithm park and lee 2020 cloud model combining analytic hierarchy process entropy weight method and x conditional cloud huang et al 2019 and copula function liu et al 2020 when analyzing the risk data driven model mainly depends on long term data in the past without considering the physical process it is especially unable to take future anthropogenic intervention such as altered operations of water diversion projects into consideration additionally some of the risk assessments based on the security domain tend to overestimate or underestimate the risk zhou et al 2019 therefore how to reveal its occurrence mechanism incorporating the physical multivariate and stochastic nature of risk is also a scientific problem worth exploring the objective of this study is to develop an accuracy improved risk assessment model on the basis of coupling a hydrodynamic model and copula functions this method is successfully used in the upper nansi lake basin that locates in the water receiving area of the eastern route of the south to north water diversion project hereinafter er snwdp in china particularly the study entails 1 construction of the copula coupled hydrodynamic risk assessment model chram determining the sensitive characteristic indexes of flood events to flood risk and ecological risk as well as the joint probability distributions of the sensitive characteristic indexes and risk indicators 2 analysis of the relationship between the sensitive characteristic indexes of flood events and risk indicators identifying the flood events that cannot lead to flood risk and ecological risk as risk security domains and 3 analysis of probability variation trends of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk outside the security domain this methodology improves the accuracy of risk estimation by incorporating the physical mechanisms and stochastic characteristics of risk occurrence under future conditions in addition the case study in the nansi lake basin provides a scientific basis not only for evaluating er snwdp s operation plan in the future but also for better instructing the management of projects in the nansi lake basin 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data sources nansi lake is located in the yi shu si river basin of the huai river basin with an area of 1266 km2 it is a typical large shallow lake with an average depth of 2 m zhao et al 2020 the lake is divided into an upper lake and a lower lake by the erji dam to control flood discharge zhang et al 2003 fig 1 c the area of the upper lake accounts for 47 5 of the total lake area and receives inflow water from 88 of the nansi lake basin which indicates that flood control in the upper lake is very important a total of 30 rivers flow into the upper lake including 8 main rivers namely the guangfu river si river baima river beisha river liangji canal zhuzhaoxin river wanfu river and dongyu river fig 1c their contribution to the lake inflow is 24 2 for liangji river 22 8 for zhuzhaoxin river 18 1 for dongyu river 14 3 for si river and around 20 for the rest four rivers in the flood season compared with the rivers in the western region of nansi lake that are in the flood plain of the yellow river most rivers in the eastern region of nansi lake are in mountainous areas with characteristics of short river sources and quick flow indicating that they have a more serious impact on flood risk in the short term thus the eastern rivers of the upper nansi lake are the focus of this study the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china is the largest water diversion project in the world with a current delivery of 25 billion m3 of fresh water per year liu and zheng 2002 zhang 2009 the er snwdp links five lakes and transfers water from downstream of the yangtze river to beijing fig 1a b chen et al 2013 wang et al 2019 as one of the storage lakes of the er snwdp nansi lake is mainly used to store and regulate water resources the water is transferred into the upper lake from the erji dam and out of it through the liangji canal according to the plan of er snwdp the operation period in the first planning phase covers only the nonflood season october to may to ensure water quality and flood control safety wang et al 2019 however as the water shortages in the huang huai hai plain become increasingly intense the operation period of the er snwdp will increase by at least one month in the flood season based on the second planning phase of the er snwdp the hydrological data originate from the hydrological yearbooks of the huai river basin which are mainly flood discharge processes of 12 year 2007 2018 typical floods in the upper boundaries of 8 rivers apart from those drought years 2014 and 2015 a total of 13 floods are selected for input to the hydrodynamic model to carry out the simulation studies in addition the daily water level records of xindian station nanyang station and boluoshu station in both 2007 high flow year and 2010 normal flow year are used for the calibration and validation of the hydrodynamic model 2 2 copula coupled hydrodynamic risk assessment model chram is proposed to accurately quantify flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk in a specific basin under irls by coupling the hydrodynamic model and copula functions chram is capable of characterizing the physical process stochastic process and multivariate interaction of risk better reflecting its nature of localization multivariate and uncertainty the research framework of chram is shown in fig s1 specifically the first step of chram is to determine what kinds of flood events can lead to flood risk and ecological risk based on the nature flow paradigm hydrodynamic model and correlation analysis we choose to use the nature flow paradigm to characterize basin specific flood events poff et al 1997 eight flood related indexes from the paradigm are used to characterize the entire range of each flood event pi and distinguish their differences table 1 zhang et al 2020 then each flood event is used as an input to the basin specific hydrodynamic model to obtain the simulated water level results in the lake that can be further used as flood risk and ecological risk indicators ij eq 1 2 with all the characteristic indexes of flood events and their corresponding risk indicators correlation analysis between each flood event characteristic index and risk indicator is conducted to determine the significantly sensitive flood event characteristic indexes associated with flood risk and ecological risk 1 i 1 t end t warning 2 i 2 wl t end wl t begin where i1 represents the number of days when the water level in the lake is beyond the warning water level tover35 the warning water level of the upper nansi lake is 35 m according to the information publicized by the hydrological bureau of shandong province i2 represents the amplitude of water level variation during a flood event amplitude tend and twarning are the times when the flood ends and the water level reaches the warning water level separately and wltend and wltbegin are the corresponding water levels when the flood begins and ends the second step is to estimate the occurrence probability of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk based on copula function and set theory we choose to use copula function to build the joint probability distributions of the sensitive flood events characteristic indexes and risk indicators according to sklar s theorem an n copula c can be used to build an n dimensional joint distribution function h for pi and ij with margins f1 f2 fn 3 h p 1 p 2 p i i 1 i 2 i j c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f i p i f i 1 i 1 f i 2 i 2 f i j i j where i j n 0 i 8 0 j 2 when j 0 the joint distribution is just about pi once the joint distribution of the sensitive flood events characteristic indexes is obtained set theory can be used to analyze the occurrence probability under different scenarios risk scenario s can be defined as each of the sensitive characteristic indexes remaining in a specific interval between pi and pi salvadori et al 2016 and its occurrence probability using the copula based joint probability distribution will be made clear below in this way the risk probability is represented by the occurrence frequency of risk causing flood events outside risk security domain notably the risk security domain here is defined by pi 4 p x s c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f i p i c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f i p i in addition an improved way in this study to indicate the occurrence of risk is to set the risk indicators beyond their thresholds directly while setting the sensitive flood event characteristic indexes within certain values in the joint probability distributions the occurrence probability can be calculated as eqs 5 and 6 which represent the single risk and dual risk respectively as different numbers of risk indicators are involved in a three or four dimensional joint distribution 5 p p 1 p 1 p 2 p 2 i j i j c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 c f 1 p 1 f 2 p 2 f 3 i j 6 p p 1 p 1 p 2 p 2 i 1 i 1 i 2 i 2 c f 1 p 1 f 2

index analysis we clustered 4 main rivers in eastern upper nansi lake into an eastern virtual river according to topologic relationships and runoff correlations shown in figs s2 and s3 then the characteristic indexes of 13 flood events in the eastern virtual river were obtained based on the calculation formula in table 1 in addition the risk indicators tover35 and amplitude for different flood events during operation of the er snwdp were obtained based on the 1d 2d coupled hydrodynamic model of the upper nansi lake building details and output were shown in supplementary material s 5 and s 6 all the characteristic indexes and risk indicators of the 13 flood events are shown in table 2 then correlation analysis among each flood event characteristic index and risk indicator were conducted by evaluating the kendall rank correlation coefficient as the correlation matrix in fig 2 shows td and rsum are the two indexes with the highest and second highest correlations to tover35 and amplitude thus these two indexes were defined as the sensitive indexes then five commonly used parametric copula functions i e gaussian student s t clayton frank and gumbel copula functions were applied to establish the joint probability distributions of td rsum tover35 and amplitude when using copula functions the first step was to define marginal distributions for rsum td tover35 and amplitude through the conventional univariate approach zhou et al 2019 in this study 10 widely used distributions were fitted and compared including normal exponential logistic gamma weibull cauchy gumbel log normal log logistic and pearson type iii distributions tosunoglu and singh 2018 the akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and root mean square error rmse were used to select the most suitable univariate distribution tosunoglu and singh 2018 zhou et al 2019 as a result the marginal distributions of rsum td tover35 and amplitude were found to follow cauchy weibull normal and gamma distributions well respectively with the smallest aic and bic values table s1 subsequently the maximum likelihood method was used to fit copula functions while aic and bic were used to further compare the five copula functions the results showed that the gaussian copula gave the smallest aic and bic values which therefore confirmed that the gaussian copula was the most appropriate copula for use in constructing the bivariate probability distribution of rsum and td table s2 we also used the same method to construct two three dimensional and one four dimensional joint probability distributions as a result the student s t copula performed the best for one three dimensional joint probability distribution involving rsum td and tover35 the gaussian copula performed the best for another three dimensional joint probability distribution involving rsum td and amplitude as well as the four dimensional joint probability distribution involving rsum td tover35 and amplitude the details are shown in table s2 2 4 model calibration and validation chram mainly consists of the hydrodynamic module and the copula function module model calibration and validation were conducted in stages from which the hydrodynamic module was first calibrated and validated to ensure reasonable simulation of the daily water level that was directly related to the risk indicators furthermore this process also ensured that the data used in the copula function were accurate in addition calibration and validation of the copula function module were conducted to ensure that the correlation structures between each sensitive characteristic index and risk indicator were described accurately so that the occurrence probabilities of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk were reliable besides sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the chram was also conducted the details are shown in supplementary material s 7 for the hydrodynamic module in chram two typical flood events that occurred separately in 2007 and 2010 in the upper nansi lake basin were used to calibrate and validate the hydrodynamic model as a result the simulated water level process shows an acceptable agreement with the measured process at three hydrologic stations xindian station nanyang station and boluoshu station fig s4 additionally the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse were used to examine the performance of the coupling model table s3 the results show that in both the calibration and validation stages the values of mae and rmse for the water level in the upper nansi lake are 0 13 m while those in rivers are 0 29 m moreover the values of nse are all greater than 0 6 thus all the above prove the model is reliable for the copula function module the kolmogorov smirnov k s test conducted at the 5 significance level was used to assess the appropriateness of marginal theoretical distributions the results show that the p values all exceed 0 05 which means that the theoretical distributions are considered to be reasonable models for all four variables table s4 in addition a parametric bootstrap based pb goodness of fit test kojadinovic and yan 2010 was used to examine the goodness of fit of five copula based joint probability distributions the p values of pb goodness of fit for four chosen copula functions i e gaussian student s t gaussian and gaussian copulas are all over 0 05 indicating that their goodness of fit is fairly good table s2 2 5 flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk scenarios after determining the sensitive indexes to risks i e rsum and td we needed to decide what kinds of flood events with certain characteristic indexes of rsum and td could lead to flood risk or ecological risk separately the first step was to create a threshold for each of the risk indicators i e tover35 and amplitude which could be used to judge whether the flood risk or ecological risk occurred in detail as the value of the flood risk indicator tover35 exceeding zero represents that the water level is beyond warning water level we defined zero as the tover35 threshold at which flood risk might occur in addition potamogeton crispus is considered to be the dominant specie of the upper nansi lake in july with a light compensation point of 3 m yuan et al 2013 as macrophyte growth will be inhibited when water depth is beyond its light compensation point a water depth of 3 m can be treated as the threshold of ecological risk indicator thus the amplitude threshold was obtained as 1 05 m based on the bottom elevation and initial water level in the upper nansi lake then three dimensional scatter diagrams were used to analyze the relationship among rsum td and tover35 as well as rsum td and amplitude determining the area without flood risk and ecological risk respectively as the risk security domains thus the corresponding thresholds of r sum and t d were also determined to further analyze the probability variation trends of flood risk and ecological risk we set a series of different inputs as risk scenarios to two three dimensional joint probability distributions that were separately related to flood risk and ecological risk first we made the inputs of risk indicators beyond their thresholds tover35 0 or amplitude 1 05 to indicate the occurrence of flood risk or ecological risk and then we made the values of sensitive indexes rsum and td in a range from the thresholds of the security domain to the maximum of their samples thus the variation in the risk probability under different scenarios outside the security domain could be obtained specifically the flood risk scenarios were set through 1 keeping the value of rsum unchanged while grouping rsum with td in sequence as the value of td changed from 23 d to 31 d at the interval of one day and 2 keeping the value of td unchanged while grouping td with rsum in sequence as the value of rsum changed from 35 mm to 40 mm and then to 110 mm at intervals of 10 mm similarly the ecological risk scenarios were set with the value of td changing from 20 d to 31 d and the value of rsum changing from 50 mm to 110 mm additionally we set the flood ecological combined risk scenarios to compare the differences in risk probability variation trends between each single risk and dual risk the flood ecological combined risk scenarios were set in the same way as flood risk scenarios except that the scenarios were used as inputs for the four dimensional joint probability distribution with two risk indicators by setting both of the risk indicators beyond their thresholds the condition that flood risk and ecological risk occur at the same time were considered the combinations of rsum and td were the same as the flood risk scenarios 3 results 3 1 security domain in flood risk and ecological risk with the thresholds of flood risk tover35 0 and ecological risk amplitude 1 05 risk security domains are separately obtained by analyzing the relationship between flood events sensitive characteristic indexes and risk indicators the relationships of rsum td and tover35 as well as rsum td and amplitude are plotted in fig 3 where flood events with tover35 0 are categorized as events without flood risk fig 3a and flood events with amplitude 1 05 are categorized as events without ecological risk fig 3b thus the security domains of flood risk and ecological risk are determined with certain thresholds of rsum and td more precisely when rsum is more than 35 mm or td is more than 23 d these kinds of flood events can be determined as flood risk causing events for ecological risk flood events with the characteristic index of rsum over 50 mm are determined as ecological risk causing events 3 2 probability variation trends of flood risk and ecological risk outside the security domain probability variation trends of flood risk and ecological risk are obtained based on eqs 5 and the risk scenarios set before in general the occurrence probability of flood risk rises as rsum or td rises and the maximum risk probability is 36 5 when rsum is 110 mm and td is 31 fig 4 a when analyzing the impact of td on flood risk probability it shows that the risk probability rises from 15 5 to 29 9 by 14 4 when td rises from 23 d to 31 d and rsum remains 35 mm and rises from 17 3 to 36 5 by 19 2 when td rises from 23 d to 31 d and rsum remains 110 mm in addition regarding the impact of rsum on flood risk probability we find that the risk probability rises from 15 5 to 17 3 by 1 8 when rsum rises from 35 mm to 110 mm and td remains 23 d and rises from 29 9 to 36 5 by 6 6 when rsum rises from 35 mm to 110 mm and td remains 31 d thus it is clear that td has a greater impact on the occurrence probability of flood risk in addition as the variation trend of each profile curve shows the risk probability rises relatively rapidly at first and then tends to be flat with the turning point of rsum at 60 mm therefore attention should be given to the situation when rsum reaches 60 mm according to the change of intervals between different profile curves it can be seen that the increase amplitude of risk probability shows a decreasing trend as td rises for the ecological risk the maximum risk probability is 4 7 when rsum is 110 mm and td is 31 d fig 4c indicating that the risk of low light stress on submersed macrophytes under the operation of the er snwdp during the flood season is very low moreover the value of risk probability does not become positive until td reaches 27 d which means that ecological risk may only occur if the flood event lasts longer than 27 days therefore td 27 d is also added as a constraint to the security domain of ecological risk when analyzing the impact of td on ecological risk probability it shows that the risk probability rises from 0 4 to 3 6 by 3 2 when td rises from 20 d to 31 d and rsum remains 50 mm and rises from 1 3 to 4 7 by 3 4 when td rises from 20 d to 31 d and rsum remains 110 mm in addition as for the impact of rsum on ecological risk probability we find that the risk probability rises from 0 4 to 1 3 by 0 9 when rsum rises from 50 mm to 110 mm and td remains 27 d and rises from 3 6 to 4 7 by 1 1 when rsum rises from 50 mm to 110 mm and td remains 31 d therefore it is obvious that the risk probability changes little as rsum and td change in general but the impact of td on the ecological risk probability is still greater than that of rsum in addition there is a linear relationship between the risk probability and td according to the nearly equal interval of profile curves 3 3 comparison between single risk and dual risk overall the occurrence probability of flood ecological combined risk is smaller than that of flood risk but greater than that of ecological risk with corresponding maximum risk probabilities of 11 2 36 5 and 4 7 respectively figs 4a c and 5 the impact results of td and rsum on each risk probability show that td has a greater effect on all three types of risks than rsum moreover td has the greatest influence on flood risk probability with an average increase of 16 8 while its influence on ecological risk probability and flood ecological combined risk probability is basically the same i e approximately one fifth of its influence on flood risk probability compared with the average increase caused by td the average increase in flood risk probability caused by rsum is approximately 4 notably the occurrence probability of flood ecological combined risk is basically unchanged when rsum increases fig 5 meaning that rsum has almost no effect on flood ecological combined risk probability when td is over 23 d in addition probability variation trends of flood risk and ecological risk calculated by the occurrence frequency of risk causing flood events outside risk security domains are also obtained based on eqs 4 and risk security domains fig 4b d these figures show the same trends as the results calculated by the joint distributions involving risk indicators fig 4a c however the values of risk occurrence probability are different on the whole the flood risk probability calculated based on the occurrence frequency of risk causing flood events is smaller than that calculated based on the joint distribution involving risk indicator and the ecological risk probability is the opposite this finding indicates that the security domains are either too large or too small to reflect the exact risk probability 4 discussion 4 1 significant role of flood duration in irls under water diversion based on the results of the probability variation trends of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk the rationality of td playing a leading role in the impact on each risk as well as the difference between dual risk and single risk are analyzed normally when rsum remains the same the flood risk probability and ecological risk probability will decline as td increases liu et al 2020 however the occurrence probabilities of all kinds of risks show a rising trend as td increases in this study because of the operation of the er snwdp specifically the water transferred into the upper lake from the erji dam is 125 m3 s and out of it through the liangji canal is 100 m3 s wang et al 2019 this operation means that even if there is no precipitation in the basin the water level in the upper nansi lake will continue to rise followed by the rising risk probability wang et al 2019 therefore td plays a leading role in the impact on each risk in this irls additionally when analyzing the reason why the combined risk probability is relatively much less than that of flood risk and slightly more than that of ecological risk the different risk indicators provide clues based on the thresholds of flood risk indicator and ecological risk indicator mentioned before we know that the highest water level that may not cause flood risk is 35 m while that for ecological risk is 35 3 m indicating that there is still a cushion between flood risk and ecological risk therefore when considering the simultaneous occurrence probability of the two risks the probability value is much closer to the smaller probability value of ecological risk 4 2 improved accuracy of risk assessment after considering risk indicator in the joint probability distribution when using copulas to analyze multivariate risk the common way is to transfer the occurrence frequency of risk causing events into risk based on the joint probability distribution of the risk causing event s sensitive indexes i e contributing variables zhou et al 2019 fan et al 2018 additionally the risk indicator based on the joint return period in the and case fan et al 2016 or the impact function of contributing variables bevacqua et al 2017 are defined to explicitly quantify the risk which indicates that the relationship between risk contributing variables and the impact of the risk needs to be considered thus we proposed a more direct way to consider the correlation between risk contributing variables and risk impact by building the joint probability distribution of risk contributing variables and risk indicators together in addition we also compare the evaluation of risk in both ways to prove the improved accuracy in detail when using the previous method zhou et al 2019 the maximum occurrence probability of risk causing flood events outside the risk security domain is 31 4 fig 4b however the maximum flood risk probability is 36 5 by using the joint probability distribution involving the risk indicator tover35 fig 4a this means that there is still a 5 1 probability of flood risk within the security domain additionally we find that the ecological risk may only occur when td is more than 27 d by joint probability distribution based analysis which cannot be recognized by the previous security domain based method therefore the chram is a more accurate model to evaluate risk probability since it takes risk source and risk receptor into consideration simultaneously better reflecting the risk s synthesized attribute of dangerousness and fragility huang 2015 4 3 risk resistance ability of the existing engineering the greatest challenge of transferring water during the flood season is to ensure water quality and flood control safety at the same time because polluted water cannot be stored in the rivers when floods need to be discharged into the lake cao et al 2017 liu et al 2018 notably the first flood event in the flood season is particularly crucial because all the accumulated pollutants in the rivers are pooled through the flood to flow into the lake resulting in the highest concentration of pollutants to solve this problem we need to evaluate whether the existing engineering has the capability to deal with the polluted water that would flow into the lake for example is there enough storage capacity to store the water or enough wetland to purify the polluted water after the evaluation new engineering or new operation schedules of engineering on each river can be proposed to instruct the management of projects taking the flood event at the flood risk critical point into consideration as the flood risk security domain shows the td threshold is 23 d and the rsum threshold is 35 mm which means that there will be a 5 046 000 m3 flood volume in the eastern rivers flowing into the lake each day based on the related equation in table 1 however the daily sewage treatment capacity of 21 wetland projects in the eastern region of the upper nansi lake is 727 500 m3 in addition the total storage capacity of sewage interception and diversion projects is 15 531 000 m3 except for the use of wetland projects 4 318 500 m3 per day of polluted water still needs to be addressed if we divert them all into sewage interception and diversion projects the projects will be full in just 3 6 days which is far less than the duration of the flood event thus we conclude that water quality assurance is still a serious problem even though there is no flood risk more wetland or more storage projects need to be constructed 5 conclusion in this study we proposed a new methodology chram for flood event related risk assessment considering water diversion in the flood season the advantage of chram is that it can fully reflect the physical multivariate and stochastic nature of risk therefore this method can improve the accuracy of risk assessment and fill the gap of limitation while using physically based models and data driven models this methodology was used in the nansi lake basin with analyses of flood risk ecological risk and flood ecological combined risk the advantage of chram in improving the accuracy of risk assessment was proven in addition the occurrence probability of flood ecological combined risk is smaller than that of flood risk but greater than that of ecological risk additionally td has a greater effect on all three types of risks than rsum with the limitation of data resources only rsum and td passed the correlation hypothesis test and showed good correlation to risk indicators however there may be more than two representative characteristic indexes to distinguish different flood processes more accurately with the support of long term data in addition further research can be extended to the uncertainty analysis of parameter estimation and the nonstationarity analyses of flood event characteristic indexes when using the copula function in chram credit

thompson editor in chief with the assistance of jesús mateo lázaro associate editor graphical abstract the impact of geomorphological structures on rainwater infiltration and groundwater recharge in the mountainous terrain of a semi arid region was studied in the southern part of the judean western mountain aquifer wma in israel and the palestinian authority the study was conducted in two main typical geomorphological landscape units which include exposed rock outcrops on the hillslope and human made agricultural soil terraces in a first order stream channel we measured rainwater infiltration through the unsaturated zone in the two geomorphological setups using vadose zone monitoring systems vms that enabled continuous tracking of rainwater percolation and tracer transport through the unsaturated zone with respect to the rain patterns the results from three years of continuous monitoring of water percolation through the unsaturated zone indicated a quick and intense percolation pattern in the rocky terrain compared to that measured in the deep soil of the terrace the precipitation patterns as reflected from the rain distribution and intensities appeared to have a significant impact on deep water percolation and ultimately on groundwater recharge in the rocky terrain rain events of high intensity even during drought years of low cumulative precipitation resulted in deep water infiltration which ultimately turned into groundwater recharge on the other hand infiltration through deep soils as prevailed in terraces valleys and high plains was found to be very limited subjected to intense evaporation and ultimately result by reduced groundwater recharge it appears that the value of annual cumulative precipitation is of a lower importance to groundwater recharge while high rain intensity is the most dominant factor responsible for deep water infiltration tracer migration patterns in the unsaturated zone revealed that precipitation on the rock outcrops promotes the generation of local runoff that rapidly drains into the subsurface through infiltration hot spots it has been observed that these hot spots are often marked by prickly burnet shrubs sarcopoterium spinosum which thrive year round on the water abundancy in the soil pockets beneath the impervious rock on land surface an important outcome of this study is the suggested strong coupling between geomorphological features and groundwater recharge application of variable infiltration functions to the different geomorphological characteristics of each terrain may improve groundwater recharge models climate changes in recent years expected to lead to decreased annual precipitations and increased evaporation in parallel with an increase in rainfall intensities in the semi arid mountainous areas of the eastern mediterranean yet according to our results the expected increase in rain intensity may actually result in an increase in groundwater recharge keywords infiltration groundwater recharge unsaturated zone geomorphology semi arid zone hydrology terraces migration 1 introduction rocky mountains which cover 25 of the earth s surface are the most important groundwater recharge zones since the landscape in these terrains is still mostly primeval with very few anthropogenic footprints such as agricultural and urban development sohrt et al 2014 somaratne 2014 viviroli et al 2007 mountain aquifers are known for their highly complex inherent structures this complexity is attributed to the geological processes that impact the 3d structure of the rock formations as well as the hydrological properties of the subsurface caine and tomusiak 2003 le coz et al 2017 mudry et al 2014 in addition to the subsurface s hydrological complexity variations in the surface terrain and landscape units characteristics such as slope angles and lengths rock outcrop exposures soil properties fracture characteristics and vegetation type dramatically impact the local micro scale infiltration pattern which ultimately dictates the potential groundwater recharge hillel 1988 magruder woessner and running 2009 detty and mcguire 2010 estimations of groundwater recharge become even more complex in arid mountainous lands where climatic conditions are often characterized by short rainy seasons with erratic and variable rain patterns a variety of methods for estimating groundwater recharge are commonly used yet it appears that different investigation methods may result in significantly different recharge estimations scanlon et al 2002 the judean western mountain aquifer wma in israel and the palestinian authority fig 1 a is an example of a complex aquifer that has been investigated intensively for many years using different methods which obviously have produced different results it is a regional aquifer that combines a variety of lithological formations and land surface structures with a steep climatic gradient ranging from a mediterranean climate to hyper and semi arid conditions it is one of the most important natural water sources for the region providing 25 of the natural freshwater consumed by inhabitants of both israel and the palestinian authority studies that were conducted during the 1950s estimated the aquifer recharge on the basis of mass balance calculations using the relationship between natural spring discharge and the region s rain pattern goldschmidt and jacobs 1958 their calculation estimated that the total annual recharge is 314 million cubic meters mcm per year which is approximately 30 of the weighted average annual precipitation in the area later from the 1970s to the 1990s the natural spring discharge of the aquifer dramatically declined due to excessive development of abstraction wells in the aquifer as such the aquifer recharge rate was estimated using a set of linear equations that linked the annual rain with the total abstraction baida and burstein 1970 goldshtoff 1972 goldshtoff and ben zvi 1972 baida and zukerman 1992 however their calculation considered the entire aquifer as a single unit guttman and zuckerman 1995 applied the recharge coefficients to a set of interconnected cells that represented the different zones covering the entire aquifer the recharge model was solved numerically on the basis of groundwater level fluctuations on a regional scale unlike previous studies that neglected groundwater recharge in the arid parts of the aquifer guttman et al 2000 suggested that groundwater recharge also occurs in the semi arid regions where the annual precipitation is 300 mm under these conditions recharge occurred during intense rain events and via infiltration through stream beds during flood events their predictions for groundwater recharge indicated that 35 50 of the annual rainfall contributes to the aquifer weiss and gvirtzman 2007 simulated groundwater recharge in a small catchment 5 km2 on the wma using the ratio between rainfall and spring discharge to calibrate a flow model their study included a transient dual porosity model to justify the abrupt water level fluctuations which are attributed to preferential flow in the fractured karstic environment they found that the recharge in this study site varies substantially from 10 of the annual rainfall in dry years to up to 80 in wet years a different approach was taken by sheffer et al 2010 who applied variable infiltration functions to typical lithological cross sections that represent the aquifer s recharge zones and were calibrated to the measured drip amounts in cave ceilings and groundwater table fluctuations groundwater recharge was estimated as 30 50 of the annual rainfall with no contribution from arid areas with below 300 mm precipitation per year dvory et al 2016 estimated the aquifer recharge using a dual permeability flow model in the unsaturated zone that coupled the kinematics wave for the fractures and the richards equation for the porous matrix with a known boundary condition of rainfall and groundwater level data ries et al 2015 used an infiltration model hydrus 1 d in which the simulations were calibrated against moisture measurements in the shallow soil deposits of three sites their recharge estimation ignored the infiltration components that are associated with fractured outcrops which form an important geomorphological feature in the area the traditional large scale models that are based on groundwater data reported an annual recharge rate that varies from 20 to 35 of the rainfall on the other hand studies that were based on information from the unsaturated zone obtained remarkable variability ranging from 0 to 66 of the annual rainfall such high variations in the recharge estimation impose a critical obstacle for long term aquifer management clearly different methodologies reflect different spatial and temporal scales thus impacting the final groundwater recharge assessment yet the final recharge is attributed to small scale processes that are dictated by the geomorphological characteristics thus making it subject to local scale variability the final groundwater recharge is determined by the dynamics of water infiltration in the upper parts of the unsaturated zone near the land surface below the depth that is affected by evapotranspiration dahan et al 2009 fernández de vera et al 2017 rimon et al 2011a observations of the water storage and the chemical and isotopic composition of the sediments from the unsaturated zone provide insights into the hydrological processes that account for water infiltration evaporation and ultimately to groundwater recharge li et al 2017 manna et al 2017 nevertheless methods that rely on these observations are somewhat limited since they often reflect a steady state chemical and isotopic equilibrium which does not reflect the short term dynamics of water infiltration during the erratic infiltration events that are typical of arid and semi arid conditions dahan et al 2009 1999 nativ 1995 rimon et al 2011a insight into the dynamics of water infiltration and solute transport in the unsaturated zone was recently achieved through the application of an advanced vadose zone monitoring system vms the vms enables direct measurements of water percolation and solute transport across deep sections of the unsaturated zone dahan et al 2009 it has been successfully implemented in a variety of hydro geological setups including measurement of rainwater infiltration in sand dunes rimon et al 2011b 2007 turkeltaub et al 2015 flood infiltration dahan et al 2008 2007 water infiltration through clay sediment baram et al 2012 and flow and transport through rock formation druhan et al 2017 fernández de vera et al 2017 geomorphological characteristics of the land surface control water infiltration and runoff generation wilcox et al 2007 yair and kossovsky 2002 these features include mainly the structure of the upper geological unit the soil cover vegetation characteristics land use and anthropogenic activity urbanization agriculture and afforestation as well as variability of the natural geomorphological conditions such as topography slopes and surface texture nie et al 2011 park et al 2005 serval studies compared the effects of geomorphological characteristics on runoff generation and water infiltration at the semi arid hillslope scale ackermann et al 2013 calvo cases et al 2003 danino et al 2021 li et al 2011 these studies suggested a significant increase in infiltration among vegetative plots and fractured rock outcrops as well as an increase in the runoff generation among bare soil and rock outcrops without cracks here we present a study on the dynamics of rainwater infiltration and groundwater recharge under the typical geomorphological features of a carbonate mountain terrain in a semi arid area two typical geomorphological setups were selected rocky terrain which is characterized by exposed hard rock on land surface and deep soil deposits in terraces located along a stream bed fig 2 accordingly the objective of this study was to evaluate the recharge potential of these two typical geomorphological units through direct measurements of the link between the rain pattern and water percolation in the unsaturated zone the study was conducted using a vms that enabled high resolution measurements of variations in the rock sediment water content and track tracer migration across the unsaturated zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located at the southern replenishment area of the wma in the hebron region 31 23 19 5 n lat 35 06 28 9 e long fig 1a and b the upper rock formation is composed of a carbonate limestone rock layer of the judean group bina formation arkin and braun 1965 and the groundwater table at a depth of 250 480 m below land surface semi arid mediterranean climatic conditions prevail in the region with short rainy winters november to april and long hot dry summers may to october the average annual precipitation is 260 mm year 133 425 mm yr 1993 2013 israeli meteorological service the rainstorms develop mainly from cyprus lows cl that contribute 90 of the annual rainfall and the red sea trough rst that generates rainstorms mainly during the fall and spring saaroni et al 2010 the average temperature ranges from 10 6 to 24 8 c in winter and summer respectively the calculated potential evaporation according to the penman monteith method fao ranges from 0 5 to 1 mm day in the wintertime and up to 9 mm day on the hottest days of summer the main groundwater recharge is related to percolation of seasonal rainwater events two sites that represent two typical geomorphological units were chosen for the study rocky terrain that include exposed rock outcrops on the hillslope and human made agricultural soil terrace fig 2 2 2 geomorphological and lithological characteristics characterization of the two typical geomorphological setups was performed through a survey that was conducted in nearby quarry excavations road cuttings and boreholes drilling at the study sites the surface area in the rocky terrain is mainly composed of hard limestone surfaces and calcareous crust with sparse shallow soil patches in small rock depressions fig 1b sparse shrub perennial vegetation mainly the sarcopoterium spinosum known as thorny burnet or prickly burnet is found in the shallow soil depressions between the impervious hard rock surfaces fig 3 annual plants mainly seasonal grasses thrive only during the short rainy season this green cover does not last long and dries immediately after the rain stops however perennial plants such as the prickly burnet shrubs that grow mostly rocky hill slopes survive during an extended dry period quarry excavation and rock cutting in the area reveal that beneath the hard rock surfaces soil pockets and weathered rock layers have developed these pockets of weathered material are attractive growth sites for the prickly burnet shrubs the drilling points for vms installation in the rocky terrain site initiated in a shallow soil depression and extended diagonally down through the weathered rock to the deeper layers of the hard rock surface fig 2 the profile shows that the upper 0 5 m of the cross section is mainly composed of soil with varying amounts of weathered limestone further down the cross section to a depth of 1 5 m weathered limestone rocks were found and the rest of the profile to a depth of 8 0 m is mostly composed of limestone dolomite with traces of marls marked as hard rock in fig 3 lowering a well camera into the two boreholes revealed that the rock layer at a depth of 4 to 8 m is densely fractured the soil terrace site is located in the adjacent stream channel fig 2b the terrace width and length are 25 and 40 m respectively and the land surface slope of the terrace is 0 02 m m the lithological profile is composed of 3 m of rendzina soil clay 40 silt 40 and sand 20 overlying limestone dolomite rock layers to a depth of 8 m the soil parent material consists of residual mineral clay from local weathered rock and aeolian dust yaalon 1997 at the interface between the soil profile and the rock layer a gradual change in lithology between the soil and the rock appears as weathered material 2 3 monitoring setup the study site was instrumented with a meteorological station installed during summer 2016 that records rainfall intensities air temperature radiation wind speed and direction every 10 min the rain is measured by an onsite rain gauge the recorded rain events from the study site were compared statistically to long term rainfall data 20 years from a nearby meteorological station shani weather station 31 21 28 1 n lat 35 04 10 6 e long which is located 5 km from the study site at a similar altitude log normal and log pearson type 3 distributions were used to model rainfall amounts two vms stations were established to investigate rainwater percolation in the two typical geomorphological setups rocky terrain on the hill slopes and soil terraces along an adjacent stream channel fig 2 the system enables direct measurement of variation in the sediment water content and allows frequent sampling of the sediment pore water from multiple points across the upper 8 m of the unsaturated zone dahan et al 2009 2007 rimon et al 2011a turkeltaub et al 2016 to avoid overloading of the manuscript with technical information only concise relevant information on the vms is provided here additional information on the vms structure may be found in the supporting information the vms includes two monitoring sleeves for each geomorphological setting one sleeve is dedicated to measuring variations in sediment water content using eight flexible time domain transmissometer ftdt probes which are based on the acclima tdt circuit connected to flexible wave guides aharoni et al 2017 dahan et al 2003 the other sleeve includes eight vadose zone sampling ports vsp for frequent water sampling from the unsaturated zone dahan et al 2009 rimon et al 2011a fig 2 the flexible sleeves were installed in uncased slanted boreholes to ensure that each monitoring unit faces an undisturbed rock sediment column extending from the unit s location on the sleeve to the land surface fig 2 accordingly the time series data on the variation in water content and tracer concentrations as measured in the water samples obtained from the unsaturated zone are presented as breakthrough curves at different depths and not as a single vertical profile in addition the vms installed in this research site was modified to include a fracture sampler fs which is designed to capture the free gravitational drainage of water from fractures crossing the vms s path along the unsaturated zone as such both the free drainage of water flowing in fractures and the rock sediment pore water under unsaturated conditions can be sampled 2 4 tracers experiment fluorescent dye tracers uranine fluorescein c i name acid yellow 73 c i number 45350 hydroxy 6 oxo 9 2 carboxyphenyl xanthene and naphthionate 4 amino 1 naphthalenesulfonic acid sodium salt were used in this study to track water percolation in the unsaturated zone uranine and naphthionate were chosen for this experiment due to their advantageous chemical properties they are highly soluble unaffected by the natural ph of the subsurface environment negatively charged with low sorption and non toxic thus they are suitable for tracing water percolation in the subsurface flury and wai 2003 weidner et al 2011 the tracers were applied using a drip irrigation system to avoid runoff formation detailed description of the tracers application can be found in the supporting information the tracers were analyzed using a fluorescence spectrometer tecan infanite m200 at specific excitation and emission wavelengths the tracers were applied on the land surface of the sites in winter 2017 2018 upon sampling from the unsaturated zone by the vms all water samples were collected and kept at 4 c under dark conditions until chemical analysis 3 results 3 1 rain pattern the annual rain pattern as measured throughout the monitored period three years ranged from 204 to 278 mm year while the mean annual rainfall in the region is 260 mm ims fig 4 the return periods for the measured annual rain are 1 3 y which is considered unexceptional nevertheless the rainstorms pattern as may be reflected through the rain intensity duration and distribution for each year was significantly different the first 2016 2017 and second 2017 2018 rainy seasons were characterized by two main rain events that constituted 48 and 36 of the annual rainfall amounts respectively while the other rain events were characterized by low intensities of 10 mm day the third rainy season 2018 2019 was characterized by many rainy days 76 days of rain with small cumulative daily rainfall amounts 2 mm day with no events exceeding 21 mm per storm table 1 and the major rain events contributing only 15 to the annual cumulative rainfall as will be discussed further down the rain pattern had a major impact on water percolation and groundwater recharge 3 2 water infiltration through the unsaturated zone the dynamics of rainwater infiltration was characterized by the link between the rain pattern and the variations in the sediment water content as well as the transport of chemical tracers across the unsaturated zone fig 2 temporal variations in water content across the unsaturated zone reflect water percolation processes fig 5 fig 6 and table 2s connecting the wetting and drainage sequence of the sediment profile to the rain events enables direct estimations of the percolation process through the wetting front propagation velocity dahan et al 2008 fernández de vera et al 2017 rimon et al 2007 turkeltaub et al 2015 3 2 1 infiltration through the rocky terrain temporal variations in the sediment profile s water content in the rocky terrain site during the first monitored rainy season winter 2016 2017 which was characterized as a drought year with low annual precipitation of only 204 mm exhibited high connectivity and rapid water migration across the top 8 m of the unsaturated zone fig 5 at the shallowest depth 40 cm located in a shallow soil depression in between the rock outcrop exposures the soil remained wet θ 40 throughout the entire winter period with quick increasing and decreasing fluctuations of moisture following each rain event the shallow soil s high water potential is attributed to local runoff that diverts rainwater from the hard rock surfaces even in very small rain events of 10 mm day it appears that almost every rain event resulted in a quick increase and decrease in the soil water content at this depth obviously the instant decrease inwater content during the winter time reflected rapid water drainage to deeper parts of the unsaturated profile into the soil pockets and weathered rock fig 2 and fig 3 since the evapotranspiration potential in this zone is minimal during this time fig 14s deeper in the profile at 1 3 and 2 7 m the water content sensors are located in a zone that is typically composed of soil pockets and weathered rock just beneath the impervious rock layers on the surface fig 3 at this depth the wetting pattern showed a gradual and mild increase in water content 3 throughout the winter period fig 5 the increase in the rock moisture progressed throughout the summer long after precipitation ceased the timing and range of the change in water content in this part of the unsaturated zone reflected the gradual drainage from the weathered rock and the soil pockets above it below at depths of 4 0 and 5 3 m which is characterized by hard rock a continuous slow increase in the rock matrix s water content was observed yet no direct link to a specific rain event was determined as the flow process through the matrix attenuated the percolation pattern however in the deepest part of the monitored cross section 6 7 and 8 m the moisture probes exhibited an abrupt increase in moisture immediately after the first rain events and a quick reduction upon termination of the rainy season these abrupt wetting and draining patterns are attributed to rapid water infiltration through the fracture system down to the unsaturated zone note that inspection of the borehole prior to the vms installation showed that this zone is highly fractured this is a direct observation of the link between the rain pattern and the deep infiltration that ultimately recharges the groundwater yet the fact that it is characterized by a single increase in water content at the beginning of the season followed by a single decrease approximately one month after the end of the rainy season shows that this zone also transmits water that is drained from larger water storage zones such as the soil pockets and the weathered layers above it the accumulated rain during the second rainy season winter 2017 2018 was also characterized as an average year with rainfall amount of 268 mm year yet it included an exceptionally high intensity rain event of 67 mm table 1 during the first two intense rainstorms 67 and 31 mm abrupt increases and decreases in water content were recorded in the entire cross section these abrupt changes reflect very high connectivity that is attributed to the activation of preferential flow paths and fracture networks dahan et al 1999 moreover this winter s rainfall amount even though only 268 mm which is moderate contributed to deeper wetting of the profile throughout the entire monitored period into the following hot dry summer season the last monitored rainy season 2018 2019 provided important insight into the impact of the rain intensity on the infiltration process and groundwater recharge this year was characterized by higher cumulative annual precipitation reaching 278 mm nevertheless the wetting process of the unsaturated zone was much weaker compared to the previous winters the sensors located in the shallow soil depression 0 4 m indicate immediate increase in water content with the initiation of the rainy season fig 5 yet the moisture values during the third season as measured over 60 winter days of january to february are lower 33 than those measured in the first two winters 42 moreover the deeper probes from 1 3 to 6 7 m showed very weak or no increase in water content throughout the third season unfortunately the probe at 8 m stopped measuring due to a technical failure although the third year had a higher cumulative precipitation than the previous two years the percolation pattern as may be reflected from the variations in water content is significantly weaker accordingly it is obvious that the differences in the percolation patterns is related to the differences in rain intensity rather than the annual cumulative precipitation 3 2 2 infiltration through the soil terrace the soil terrace site is located only 50 m away from the rocky site in the adjacent stream channel in this site the lithological profile includes 3 m of relatively homogeneous rendzina soil layer on top of limestone and dolomite rock formations fig 2 the variations in water content fig 6 emphasize the difference between water movement in the soil profile 3 m and in the deeper rocky part 3 m the transition zone between the soil and the rock 3 5 m depth is composed of weathered material that seems to have a significant impact on the percolation pattern beneath this site during the first rainy season 2016 2017 the wetting pattern in the soil profile was characterized by a gradual increase in water content in the shallow part of the soil profile 0 4 and 0 7 m with a long lag time several days between the rain event and the increase in water content fig 6 the associated wetting front propagation velocity in this event ranges from 2 3 to 5 7 cm h no change in water content was observed at 1 6 m depth indicating limited infiltration across the soil layers the long lag time is obviously attributed to the attenuation of the wetting front propagation in the terrace s dry soil note that during this season no runoff was observed in the stream channel or in between the terraces in the transition zone between the soil and the weathered rock 2 9 and 5 6 m depths a moderate increase in water content was observed late in the winter season which continued through the dry summer then from the end of the dry summer to the beginning of the next winter a gradual decrease in water content reflecting deep drainage was observed however since no deep water infiltration was observed through the above soil layer it is hypothesized that the water that drained from the rock surfaces at the terrace margins infiltrated down and moved laterally along the soil rock interface reaching the sections located under the terrace deeper in the cross section at 7 and 8 3 m depths located in hard limestone rock only a moderate increase in water content was recorded fig 6 suggesting slow drainage of water from the weathered rock above it nevertheless the water s arrival at these depths is also assumed to be related to lateral flow from the rocky margins and not to direct vertical percolation from the soil in the terrace this hypothesis will be further discussed through the results of the tracers experiments that were conducted in the following rainy season during the second rainy season winter 2017 2018 which included two major intense rainstorms runoff was generated in the watershed and locally on the rock outcrops table 1 as a result short term flooding of the terrace was created by water draining from the hillslopes this event created substantial wetting of the entire unsaturated zone profile in this event the percolation pattern was rather complex in the soil layer a gradual wetting that is attributed to direct water infiltration from the land surface was indicated by the sequential wetting of the sensors at 0 4 0 7 and 1 6 m with wetting front propagation velocities ranging 1 1 to 7 9 cm h deeper in the rock profile under the soil layer a quick wetting was observed at depth of 5 6 m immediately after the initiation of the intense rain events this event occurred prior to the full wetting of the soil profile above it suggest a direct connection to the water infiltrating down from the rocky terrain s foothills on the terrace margins and not from the soil above it fig 2b the calculated velocities exhibited relatively high values of 20 2 and 20 5 cm h at depths of 5 6 and 8 3 respectively obviously the actual flow velocities were much higher as the water needed to traverse the cross section from the terrace margins while these velocities were calculated as vertical propagation once again this may suggest subsurface lateral water flow along the soil rock interface rather than direct infiltration through the soil layer the third rainy season winter 2018 2019 was characterized by the highest cumulative rainfall amount reaching 278 mm fig 4 however the rain intensities in this year were quite low compared to the previous two winters reaching a maximum of 20 mm day table 1 the shallowest probe which is located at a depth of 0 4 m at the top of the soil profile showed relatively low water content values of 30 compared to previous seasons in which the water content exceeded 40 moreover the sensors located deeper in the soil profile at 0 7 and 1 6 m depths did not show any increase in water content indicating no deep infiltration that could potentially reach the rock below and contribute water to groundwater recharge on the other hand the sensors located under the soil layer at the soil rock interface exhibited a significant increase in water content this strengthens our hypothesis that the increase in water content that was measured deep under the terrace originated from water that infiltrated at the terrace margins and not from direct infiltration through the thick soil layer an important overall conclusion that emerged from this observation is that despite the fact that this year had the highest cumulative rainfall it had the lowest level of water infiltration due to the low intensity of the rainstorm events 3 3 tracers transport following the observations of rainwater infiltration in the first rainy season a tracer test was conducted during the second rainy season winter 2017 2018 in order to track the water percolation pattern from the land surface through the unsaturated zone the tracers uranine and naphthionate were applied to the land surface in specific morphological features that were suspected to be potential hot spots for deep percolation fig 7 the observations suggested that the shrubs which are annual green plants growing in between the exposed rock surfaces indicating a hot spots for deep infiltration they have deep roots that penetrate the soil pocket and weathered rock beneath the solid rock surfaces fig 3 in the rocky terrain the tracers were applied directly to a few prickly burnet shrubs that are located above the vsp sleeve uranine was applied on prickly burnet shrubs that are located above the deeper section of the vms while the naphthionate was applied to a group of plants that are located above the shallow sections of the vms fig 7a in the terrace site the tracers were applied at the foothills of the rocky outcrops along the contact line between the exposed rock and the soil on the terrace here the tracers were implemented along a line where prickly burnet shrubs grow on the terrace perimeter fig 7b note that no prickly burnet shrubs grow on the soil in the terrace uranine was used on the eastern boundary while the naphthionate was used on the western boundary the rationale behind the tracer implementation on the terrace margins was to test the hypothesis that the observed wetting in the deep rock layers under the soil terrace is attributed to lateral subsurface water flow along the soil rock interface rather than to vertical infiltration through the soil layers accordingly the tracers breakthrough curves at various depths in both sites rocky terrain and deep soil in terraces were analyzed with respect to the rain pattern geomorphological setup and lithological characteristics for the sake of convenience the breakthrough curves are presented as relative concentration normalized to the maximum concentration at each depth fig 8 fig 9 the maximum concentration values for each depth are presented next to each breakthrough curve upon analysis of the breakthrough curves one should note that by coincidence the tracer experiment was conducted during the strongest rainstorm that was monitored for three years this rainstorm generated very intensive percolation events as measured by the moisture sensors in the unsaturated zone as well as runoff on the surface obviously such an intensive event has a distinctive impact on tracer transport on the land surface and in the subsurface 3 3 1 tracer transport in the rocky terrain in the rocky terrain the tracers breakthrough curves present a complex percolation pattern that reflects both vertical and lateral flow trajectories uranine which was applied only on the area that is above the deepest units of the vms fig 7a appeared in all depths fig 8 yet the highest absolute concentration appeared in the deepest sections 4 m with a maximum concentration at 6 7 m at these depths the uranine breakthrough curves exhibited quick increases and decreases in concentration suggesting very high connectivity between the tracers application zone at the prickly burnet shrubs to the deep sections of the unsaturated zone the rapidly rising and falling limbs of the breakthrough curve at the deep sections suggest very small storage where the tracer is quickly washed away from the fracture void the appearance of uranine at a depth of 0 4 m which is located in a shallow soil depression away from its application zone indicates that local runoff washed uranine downhill to the areas that are located above the upper sampling point fig 8 at depths of 1 3 and 2 7 m which are located in weathered rock or soil pockets below the hard rock the absolute uranine concentrations were much smaller 0 2 and 0 16 mg l respectively moreover the breakthrough shows a late appearance 3 4 d after the storm initiation with a very long falling limb 7 d which indicates a larger storage volume of the soil pockets or weathered rock layer compared to the fracture domain naphthionate was also applied to a group of prickly burnet shrubs fig 7a however these were located closer to the vms head above the shallower monitoring units the naphthionate also appeared at all depths with the maximum absolute concentration at a depth of 6 7 m yet its breakthrough curves exhibited a quite different percolation mechanism at most depths the breakthrough curve of naphthionate exhibited a long and slowly falling limb which indicated a larger storage capacity such as soil pockets or weathered rock layer fig 3 the simultaneous breakthrough of the naphthionate and uranine at the shallow depths 2 7 m indicates that uranine was transported on the land surface by local runoff to the area that was traced by naphthionate these two tracers were then transported down by the percolating water into the soil pockets and weathered rock however the quick arrival and washing down of the naphthionate into the deep sections 6 7 m also indicate connectivity through active fractures which are associated with the prickly burnet shrub on land surface tracer arrival velocities were calculated by their arrival time to the different depths with respect to the first major rainstorm rainy season 2017 2018 note that the velocity is underestimated since it is limited by the sampling resolution the tracers velocities in the upper soil layer and deeper in the weathered rock or soil pockets from 0 4 to 2 7 m reveal minimal velocities of 0 5 3 4 cm h this range of values represents water flow in a porous domain however the calculated velocity of the deepest probes at the depths of 4 0 5 3 6 7 and 8 0 m indicate much faster velocities of 38 1 to 76 2 cm h to uranine and 15 4 63 8 cm h for the naphthionate these extremely high velocities are the result of the intense rainstorm and the highly developed fracture system that rapidly transmits rainwater down to deep sections of the unsaturated zone 3 3 2 tracer transport in the soil terrace in the soil terrace site the tracers breakthrough curves were quite different the high intensity of the rain in this event created local runoff and short term flooding of the terrace by water from the traced zones on the margins of the area that is above the monitored zone fig 7b it offered a different perspective on the flow and transport processes both in the soil and in the underlying rock following the first rain event which was the most intensive event of the entire monitored period 67 mm table 1 breakthroughs of both naphthionate and uranine were observed at the shallow depths of the soil profile at 0 4 and 0 7 m since the tracers were implemented away from the monitored zone on the terrace margins it is obvious that the tracers were transported over the land surface by runoff visible evidence for uranine migration on the terrace surface during the rainstorm was also observed in this stage no signs of the tracers were observed in the deep sections of the soil or rock profiles two weeks after the first storm a second large storm with 31 mm of rain occurred table 1 following this storm traced water was detected in both the deeper section of the soil and the rock profiles it appears that both tracers emerged at the soil rock interface 2 9 m as well as in the deeper sections of the rock layers 4 0 and 5 2 m prior to their appearance at 1 6 m in the soil fig 9 at the shallow depths 0 4 and 0 7 m maximal concentrations were found two days after the storm ended and therefore the tracers migration velocities may be calculated as 0 5 and 0 9 cm h respectively the arrival time to a depth of 1 6 m with respect the second major storm resulted in a velocity of 0 8 cm h the slow infiltration rate and gradual water movement indicated typical uniform vertical infiltration in the soil in contrast in the deep part of the rock formation under the terrace much higher tracer velocities were found values of 3 5 4 8 6 2 and 1 9 cm h were calculated for depths of 2 9 4 0 5 2 m and 6 3 m respectively yet as abovementioned these calculated velocities are an underestimation due to the relatively low sampling intervals also the actual path of the tracers from the terrace margins to the sampling points under the terrace is much longer than the vertical distance from the surface 4 discussion direct measurements of water percolation in the deep unsaturated zone showed that rainwater infiltration in rocky terrains where the land surface morphology is mainly composed of hard impervious rock surfaces is much faster and more intense compared to water infiltration through areas where the land surface is covered with deep soils it has been shown that rainwater infiltration in rocky terrains is controlled by quick drainage of the rock surfaces directly into the developed fracture system thus enhancing the deep drainage of the rainwater into the unsaturated zone and ultimately to the groundwater on the other hand in areas where the morphology is mainly composed of deep soils such as those prevailing in terraces along the stream channels high plains and valleys of mountainous regions a large amount of rainwater is required to initiate deep percolation accordingly the penetration depth of small rain events which form the majority of the total precipitation in semi arid conditions is limited exposed to intense evapotranspiration and ultimately reduces the groundwater recharge potential however in rocky terrain almost every rain event results in local runoff from the rock surfaces that drains into the subsurface through the fracture network ultimately contributing to groundwater recharge this finding is somewhat in contrast to previous studies on groundwater recharge in arid and semi arid regions that suggested a higher importance of the stream channels to the overall groundwater recharge dahan et al 2007 2008 gutman 1997 lange 2005 however it is in line with others that showed enhanced infiltration from geomorphological features containing fractured rocky surfaces li et al 2011 yair and raz yassif 2004 dahan et al 1999 native et al 1995 it has been found that the rain pattern has a significant impact on the infiltration rate and ultimately on groundwater recharge groundwater recharge from mountainous rocky outcrops in semi arid conditions is primarily controlled by rain intensity rather than the total annual cumulative precipitation high rain intensities that occur even during drought years may contribute to groundwater recharge more than year of high cumulative precipitation that are characterized by low rain intensities prickly burnet plants were found to constitute an important geomorphological feature related to the rainwater infiltration and groundwater recharge these plants thrive on the hillslopes of rocky terrain and grow especially well in between the impervious rock surfaces sending their roots into the soil pockets which are funneled into the deep fractures systems fig 3 as such these plants mark the locations of the hydrological passages through which rainwater efficiently drains from rocky surfaces into the soil pockets and from there to the deep sections of the unsaturated zone these plants use the natural surfaces drainage system for their growth but are also efficient natural indicators for infiltration hot spots stream channels in the mountain terrains of semi arid regions are often covered by deep soil in human made terraces that were constructed to prevent soil erosion and create zones of deep agricultural soil as such from a regional groundwater recharge perspective the rocky terrain covering 64 of the study areas is significantly important for groundwater recharge compared to the deep soils in the stream channels covering 25 of the area s morphology fig 1b therefore groundwater recharge models must include descriptions of the geomorphological features rather than establishing a uniform infiltration function for the entire region as commonly done moreover our findings emphasizes that the groundwater recharge assessments in semi arid and arid climates must refer the landscape units and surface properties rather than the lithological description from surface to the groundwater level alone 5 conclusions a study on rainwater percolation in a mountainous terrain of a semi arid region was conducted through continuous monitoring of water flow pattern and tracers transport through the unsaturated zone the study compared the percolation pattern in two typical geomorphological settings 1 rocky terrain hillslopes which are characterized by high percentage of exposed rock formation and sparce shallow soil depressions and 2 deep soils formation as may be found in terraces valleys and high plains of mountainous terrains three years of continuous data collection on the temporal variation in water content along with tracer breakthrough curves at multiple depths across the unsaturated zone were analyzed with respect to the rain pattern and geomorphological conditions the results indicated that rainwater percolation from rocky hillslopes is much more significant and intense compared to infiltration through deep soil formation this implies that the rocky surfaces on the hillslopes are of a greater importance to groundwater recharge compared to the deep soil that often covers the stream channels and valleys apparently prickly burnet shrub growing on the rocky hillslopes marks hot spots for water drainage into the deep unsaturated zone it has been found that quick and deep rainwater percolation which ultimately contribute to groundwater recharge is primarily associated with intense rain events accordingly it is the rain pattern that dictates the total annual groundwater recharge more than cumulative annual precipitation thus drought years of low annual precipitation and high rain intensities may result in higher groundwater recharge compared to years of higher cumulative precipitation of lower intensities recent studies have shown decrease in the average annual rainfall and increase in rainstorms intensities during the last decades in the eastern mediterranean sea chenoweth et al 2011 lelieveld et al 2012 volosciuk et al 2016 these changes accompanied by higher temperature and potential evaporation may further reduce the water budget in both wet and semi arid regions however according to this study increase in rain intensities in mountainous areas may result in enhanced water infiltration and ultimately increase groundwater recharge even under decreased annual cumulative precipitation the results suggest that groundwater recharge models for mountainous terrain in semi arid regions could be improved upon referring adoptive infiltration function to the different geomorphological features while linking the rain intensity as an input function to the percolation credit authorship contribution statement or letz conceptualization

thompson editor in chief with the assistance of jesús mateo lázaro associate editor graphical abstract the impact of geomorphological structures on rainwater infiltration and groundwater recharge in the mountainous terrain of a semi arid region was studied in the southern part of the judean western mountain aquifer wma in israel and the palestinian authority the study was conducted in two main typical geomorphological landscape units which include exposed rock outcrops on the hillslope and human made agricultural soil terraces in a first order stream channel we measured rainwater infiltration through the unsaturated zone in the two geomorphological setups using vadose zone monitoring systems vms that enabled continuous tracking of rainwater percolation and tracer transport through the unsaturated zone with respect to the rain patterns the results from three years of continuous monitoring of water percolation through the unsaturated zone indicated a quick and intense percolation pattern in the rocky terrain compared to that measured in the deep soil of the terrace the precipitation patterns as reflected from the rain distribution and intensities appeared to have a significant impact on deep water percolation and ultimately on groundwater recharge in the rocky terrain rain events of high intensity even during drought years of low cumulative precipitation resulted in deep water infiltration which ultimately turned into groundwater recharge on the other hand infiltration through deep soils as prevailed in terraces valleys and high plains was found to be very limited subjected to intense evaporation and ultimately result by reduced groundwater recharge it appears that the value of annual cumulative precipitation is of a lower importance to groundwater recharge while high rain intensity is the most dominant factor responsible for deep water infiltration tracer migration patterns in the unsaturated zone revealed that precipitation on the rock outcrops promotes the generation of local runoff that rapidly drains into the subsurface through infiltration hot spots it has been observed that these hot spots are often marked by prickly burnet shrubs sarcopoterium spinosum which thrive year round on the water abundancy in the soil pockets beneath the impervious rock on land surface an important outcome of this study is the suggested strong coupling between geomorphological features and groundwater recharge application of variable infiltration functions to the different geomorphological characteristics of each terrain may improve groundwater recharge models climate changes in recent years expected to lead to decreased annual precipitations and increased evaporation in parallel with an increase in rainfall intensities in the semi arid mountainous areas of the eastern mediterranean yet according to our results the expected increase in rain intensity may actually result in an increase in groundwater recharge keywords infiltration groundwater recharge unsaturated zone geomorphology semi arid zone hydrology terraces migration 1 introduction rocky mountains which cover 25 of the earth s surface are the most important groundwater recharge zones since the landscape in these terrains is still mostly primeval with very few anthropogenic footprints such as agricultural and urban development sohrt et al 2014 somaratne 2014 viviroli et al 2007 mountain aquifers are known for their highly complex inherent structures this complexity is attributed to the geological processes that impact the 3d structure of the rock formations as well as the hydrological properties of the subsurface caine and tomusiak 2003 le coz et al 2017 mudry et al 2014 in addition to the subsurface s hydrological complexity variations in the surface terrain and landscape units characteristics such as slope angles and lengths rock outcrop exposures soil properties fracture characteristics and vegetation type dramatically impact the local micro scale infiltration pattern which ultimately dictates the potential groundwater recharge hillel 1988 magruder woessner and running 2009 detty and mcguire 2010 estimations of groundwater recharge become even more complex in arid mountainous lands where climatic conditions are often characterized by short rainy seasons with erratic and variable rain patterns a variety of methods for estimating groundwater recharge are commonly used yet it appears that different investigation methods may result in significantly different recharge estimations scanlon et al 2002 the judean western mountain aquifer wma in israel and the palestinian authority fig 1 a is an example of a complex aquifer that has been investigated intensively for many years using different methods which obviously have produced different results it is a regional aquifer that combines a variety of lithological formations and land surface structures with a steep climatic gradient ranging from a mediterranean climate to hyper and semi arid conditions it is one of the most important natural water sources for the region providing 25 of the natural freshwater consumed by inhabitants of both israel and the palestinian authority studies that were conducted during the 1950s estimated the aquifer recharge on the basis of mass balance calculations using the relationship between natural spring discharge and the region s rain pattern goldschmidt and jacobs 1958 their calculation estimated that the total annual recharge is 314 million cubic meters mcm per year which is approximately 30 of the weighted average annual precipitation in the area later from the 1970s to the 1990s the natural spring discharge of the aquifer dramatically declined due to excessive development of abstraction wells in the aquifer as such the aquifer recharge rate was estimated using a set of linear equations that linked the annual rain with the total abstraction baida and burstein 1970 goldshtoff 1972 goldshtoff and ben zvi 1972 baida and zukerman 1992 however their calculation considered the entire aquifer as a single unit guttman and zuckerman 1995 applied the recharge coefficients to a set of interconnected cells that represented the different zones covering the entire aquifer the recharge model was solved numerically on the basis of groundwater level fluctuations on a regional scale unlike previous studies that neglected groundwater recharge in the arid parts of the aquifer guttman et al 2000 suggested that groundwater recharge also occurs in the semi arid regions where the annual precipitation is 300 mm under these conditions recharge occurred during intense rain events and via infiltration through stream beds during flood events their predictions for groundwater recharge indicated that 35 50 of the annual rainfall contributes to the aquifer weiss and gvirtzman 2007 simulated groundwater recharge in a small catchment 5 km2 on the wma using the ratio between rainfall and spring discharge to calibrate a flow model their study included a transient dual porosity model to justify the abrupt water level fluctuations which are attributed to preferential flow in the fractured karstic environment they found that the recharge in this study site varies substantially from 10 of the annual rainfall in dry years to up to 80 in wet years a different approach was taken by sheffer et al 2010 who applied variable infiltration functions to typical lithological cross sections that represent the aquifer s recharge zones and were calibrated to the measured drip amounts in cave ceilings and groundwater table fluctuations groundwater recharge was estimated as 30 50 of the annual rainfall with no contribution from arid areas with below 300 mm precipitation per year dvory et al 2016 estimated the aquifer recharge using a dual permeability flow model in the unsaturated zone that coupled the kinematics wave for the fractures and the richards equation for the porous matrix with a known boundary condition of rainfall and groundwater level data ries et al 2015 used an infiltration model hydrus 1 d in which the simulations were calibrated against moisture measurements in the shallow soil deposits of three sites their recharge estimation ignored the infiltration components that are associated with fractured outcrops which form an important geomorphological feature in the area the traditional large scale models that are based on groundwater data reported an annual recharge rate that varies from 20 to 35 of the rainfall on the other hand studies that were based on information from the unsaturated zone obtained remarkable variability ranging from 0 to 66 of the annual rainfall such high variations in the recharge estimation impose a critical obstacle for long term aquifer management clearly different methodologies reflect different spatial and temporal scales thus impacting the final groundwater recharge assessment yet the final recharge is attributed to small scale processes that are dictated by the geomorphological characteristics thus making it subject to local scale variability the final groundwater recharge is determined by the dynamics of water infiltration in the upper parts of the unsaturated zone near the land surface below the depth that is affected by evapotranspiration dahan et al 2009 fernández de vera et al 2017 rimon et al 2011a observations of the water storage and the chemical and isotopic composition of the sediments from the unsaturated zone provide insights into the hydrological processes that account for water infiltration evaporation and ultimately to groundwater recharge li et al 2017 manna et al 2017 nevertheless methods that rely on these observations are somewhat limited since they often reflect a steady state chemical and isotopic equilibrium which does not reflect the short term dynamics of water infiltration during the erratic infiltration events that are typical of arid and semi arid conditions dahan et al 2009 1999 nativ 1995 rimon et al 2011a insight into the dynamics of water infiltration and solute transport in the unsaturated zone was recently achieved through the application of an advanced vadose zone monitoring system vms the vms enables direct measurements of water percolation and solute transport across deep sections of the unsaturated zone dahan et al 2009 it has been successfully implemented in a variety of hydro geological setups including measurement of rainwater infiltration in sand dunes rimon et al 2011b 2007 turkeltaub et al 2015 flood infiltration dahan et al 2008 2007 water infiltration through clay sediment baram et al 2012 and flow and transport through rock formation druhan et al 2017 fernández de vera et al 2017 geomorphological characteristics of the land surface control water infiltration and runoff generation wilcox et al 2007 yair and kossovsky 2002 these features include mainly the structure of the upper geological unit the soil cover vegetation characteristics land use and anthropogenic activity urbanization agriculture and afforestation as well as variability of the natural geomorphological conditions such as topography slopes and surface texture nie et al 2011 park et al 2005 serval studies compared the effects of geomorphological characteristics on runoff generation and water infiltration at the semi arid hillslope scale ackermann et al 2013 calvo cases et al 2003 danino et al 2021 li et al 2011 these studies suggested a significant increase in infiltration among vegetative plots and fractured rock outcrops as well as an increase in the runoff generation among bare soil and rock outcrops without cracks here we present a study on the dynamics of rainwater infiltration and groundwater recharge under the typical geomorphological features of a carbonate mountain terrain in a semi arid area two typical geomorphological setups were selected rocky terrain which is characterized by exposed hard rock on land surface and deep soil deposits in terraces located along a stream bed fig 2 accordingly the objective of this study was to evaluate the recharge potential of these two typical geomorphological units through direct measurements of the link between the rain pattern and water percolation in the unsaturated zone the study was conducted using a vms that enabled high resolution measurements of variations in the rock sediment water content and track tracer migration across the unsaturated zone 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site is located at the southern replenishment area of the wma in the hebron region 31 23 19 5 n lat 35 06 28 9 e long fig 1a and b the upper rock formation is composed of a carbonate limestone rock layer of the judean group bina formation arkin and braun 1965 and the groundwater table at a depth of 250 480 m below land surface semi arid mediterranean climatic conditions prevail in the region with short rainy winters november to april and long hot dry summers may to october the average annual precipitation is 260 mm year 133 425 mm yr 1993 2013 israeli meteorological service the rainstorms develop mainly from cyprus lows cl that contribute 90 of the annual rainfall and the red sea trough rst that generates rainstorms mainly during the fall and spring saaroni et al 2010 the average temperature ranges from 10 6 to 24 8 c in winter and summer respectively the calculated potential evaporation according to the penman monteith method fao ranges from 0 5 to 1 mm day in the wintertime and up to 9 mm day on the hottest days of summer the main groundwater recharge is related to percolation of seasonal rainwater events two sites that represent two typical geomorphological units were chosen for the study rocky terrain that include exposed rock outcrops on the hillslope and human made agricultural soil terrace fig 2 2 2 geomorphological and lithological characteristics characterization of the two typical geomorphological setups was performed through a survey that was conducted in nearby quarry excavations road cuttings and boreholes drilling at the study sites the surface area in the rocky terrain is mainly composed of hard limestone surfaces and calcareous crust with sparse shallow soil patches in small rock depressions fig 1b sparse shrub perennial vegetation mainly the sarcopoterium spinosum known as thorny burnet or prickly burnet is found in the shallow soil depressions between the impervious hard rock surfaces fig 3 annual plants mainly seasonal grasses thrive only during the short rainy season this green cover does not last long and dries immediately after the rain stops however perennial plants such as the prickly burnet shrubs that grow mostly rocky hill slopes survive during an extended dry period quarry excavation and rock cutting in the area reveal that beneath the hard rock surfaces soil pockets and weathered rock layers have developed these pockets of weathered material are attractive growth sites for the prickly burnet shrubs the drilling points for vms installation in the rocky terrain site initiated in a shallow soil depression and extended diagonally down through the weathered rock to the deeper layers of the hard rock surface fig 2 the profile shows that the upper 0 5 m of the cross section is mainly composed of soil with varying amounts of weathered limestone further down the cross section to a depth of 1 5 m weathered limestone rocks were found and the rest of the profile to a depth of 8 0 m is mostly composed of limestone dolomite with traces of marls marked as hard rock in fig 3 lowering a well camera into the two boreholes revealed that the rock layer at a depth of 4 to 8 m is densely fractured the soil terrace site is located in the adjacent stream channel fig 2b the terrace width and length are 25 and 40 m respectively and the land surface slope of the terrace is 0 02 m m the lithological profile is composed of 3 m of rendzina soil clay 40 silt 40 and sand 20 overlying limestone dolomite rock layers to a depth of 8 m the soil parent material consists of residual mineral clay from local weathered rock and aeolian dust yaalon 1997 at the interface between the soil profile and the rock layer a gradual change in lithology between the soil and the rock appears as weathered material 2 3 monitoring setup the study site was instrumented with a meteorological station installed during summer 2016 that records rainfall intensities air temperature radiation wind speed and direction every 10 min the rain is measured by an onsite rain gauge the recorded rain events from the study site were compared statistically to long term rainfall data 20 years from a nearby meteorological station shani weather station 31 21 28 1 n lat 35 04 10 6 e long which is located 5 km from the study site at a similar altitude log normal and log pearson type 3 distributions were used to model rainfall amounts two vms stations were established to investigate rainwater percolation in the two typical geomorphological setups rocky terrain on the hill slopes and soil terraces along an adjacent stream channel fig 2 the system enables direct measurement of variation in the sediment water content and allows frequent sampling of the sediment pore water from multiple points across the upper 8 m of the unsaturated zone dahan et al 2009 2007 rimon et al 2011a turkeltaub et al 2016 to avoid overloading of the manuscript with technical information only concise relevant information on the vms is provided here additional information on the vms structure may be found in the supporting information the vms includes two monitoring sleeves for each geomorphological setting one sleeve is dedicated to measuring variations in sediment water content using eight flexible time domain transmissometer ftdt probes which are based on the acclima tdt circuit connected to flexible wave guides aharoni et al 2017 dahan et al 2003 the other sleeve includes eight vadose zone sampling ports vsp for frequent water sampling from the unsaturated zone dahan et al 2009 rimon et al 2011a fig 2 the flexible sleeves were installed in uncased slanted boreholes to ensure that each monitoring unit faces an undisturbed rock sediment column extending from the unit s location on the sleeve to the land surface fig 2 accordingly the time series data on the variation in water content and tracer concentrations as measured in the water samples obtained from the unsaturated zone are presented as breakthrough curves at different depths and not as a single vertical profile in addition the vms installed in this research site was modified to include a fracture sampler fs which is designed to capture the free gravitational drainage of water from fractures crossing the vms s path along the unsaturated zone as such both the free drainage of water flowing in fractures and the rock sediment pore water under unsaturated conditions can be sampled 2 4 tracers experiment fluorescent dye tracers uranine fluorescein c i name acid yellow 73 c i number 45350 hydroxy 6 oxo 9 2 carboxyphenyl xanthene and naphthionate 4 amino 1 naphthalenesulfonic acid sodium salt were used in this study to track water percolation in the unsaturated zone uranine and naphthionate were chosen for this experiment due to their advantageous chemical properties they are highly soluble unaffected by the natural ph of the subsurface environment negatively charged with low sorption and non toxic thus they are suitable for tracing water percolation in the subsurface flury and wai 2003 weidner et al 2011 the tracers were applied using a drip irrigation system to avoid runoff formation detailed description of the tracers application can be found in the supporting information the tracers were analyzed using a fluorescence spectrometer tecan infanite m200 at specific excitation and emission wavelengths the tracers were applied on the land surface of the sites in winter 2017 2018 upon sampling from the unsaturated zone by the vms all water samples were collected and kept at 4 c under dark conditions until chemical analysis 3 results 3 1 rain pattern the annual rain pattern as measured throughout the monitored period three years ranged from 204 to 278 mm year while the mean annual rainfall in the region is 260 mm ims fig 4 the return periods for the measured annual rain are 1 3 y which is considered unexceptional nevertheless the rainstorms pattern as may be reflected through the rain intensity duration and distribution for each year was significantly different the first 2016 2017 and second 2017 2018 rainy seasons were characterized by two main rain events that constituted 48 and 36 of the annual rainfall amounts respectively while the other rain events were characterized by low intensities of 10 mm day the third rainy season 2018 2019 was characterized by many rainy days 76 days of rain with small cumulative daily rainfall amounts 2 mm day with no events exceeding 21 mm per storm table 1 and the major rain events contributing only 15 to the annual cumulative rainfall as will be discussed further down the rain pattern had a major impact on water percolation and groundwater recharge 3 2 water infiltration through the unsaturated zone the dynamics of rainwater infiltration was characterized by the link between the rain pattern and the variations in the sediment water content as well as the transport of chemical tracers across the unsaturated zone fig 2 temporal variations in water content across the unsaturated zone reflect water percolation processes fig 5 fig 6 and table 2s connecting the wetting and drainage sequence of the sediment profile to the rain events enables direct estimations of the percolation process through the wetting front propagation velocity dahan et al 2008 fernández de vera et al 2017 rimon et al 2007 turkeltaub et al 2015 3 2 1 infiltration through the rocky terrain temporal variations in the sediment profile s water content in the rocky terrain site during the first monitored rainy season winter 2016 2017 which was characterized as a drought year with low annual precipitation of only 204 mm exhibited high connectivity and rapid water migration across the top 8 m of the unsaturated zone fig 5 at the shallowest depth 40 cm located in a shallow soil depression in between the rock outcrop exposures the soil remained wet θ 40 throughout the entire winter period with quick increasing and decreasing fluctuations of moisture following each rain event the shallow soil s high water potential is attributed to local runoff that diverts rainwater from the hard rock surfaces even in very small rain events of 10 mm day it appears that almost every rain event resulted in a quick increase and decrease in the soil water content at this depth obviously the instant decrease inwater content during the winter time reflected rapid water drainage to deeper parts of the unsaturated profile into the soil pockets and weathered rock fig 2 and fig 3 since the evapotranspiration potential in this zone is minimal during this time fig 14s deeper in the profile at 1 3 and 2 7 m the water content sensors are located in a zone that is typically composed of soil pockets and weathered rock just beneath the impervious rock layers on the surface fig 3 at this depth the wetting pattern showed a gradual and mild increase in water content 3 throughout the winter period fig 5 the increase in the rock moisture progressed throughout the summer long after precipitation ceased the timing and range of the change in water content in this part of the unsaturated zone reflected the gradual drainage from the weathered rock and the soil pockets above it below at depths of 4 0 and 5 3 m which is characterized by hard rock a continuous slow increase in the rock matrix s water content was observed yet no direct link to a specific rain event was determined as the flow process through the matrix attenuated the percolation pattern however in the deepest part of the monitored cross section 6 7 and 8 m the moisture probes exhibited an abrupt increase in moisture immediately after the first rain events and a quick reduction upon termination of the rainy season these abrupt wetting and draining patterns are attributed to rapid water infiltration through the fracture system down to the unsaturated zone note that inspection of the borehole prior to the vms installation showed that this zone is highly fractured this is a direct observation of the link between the rain pattern and the deep infiltration that ultimately recharges the groundwater yet the fact that it is characterized by a single increase in water content at the beginning of the season followed by a single decrease approximately one month after the end of the rainy season shows that this zone also transmits water that is drained from larger water storage zones such as the soil pockets and the weathered layers above it the accumulated rain during the second rainy season winter 2017 2018 was also characterized as an average year with rainfall amount of 268 mm year yet it included an exceptionally high intensity rain event of 67 mm table 1 during the first two intense rainstorms 67 and 31 mm abrupt increases and decreases in water content were recorded in the entire cross section these abrupt changes reflect very high connectivity that is attributed to the activation of preferential flow paths and fracture networks dahan et al 1999 moreover this winter s rainfall amount even though only 268 mm which is moderate contributed to deeper wetting of the profile throughout the entire monitored period into the following hot dry summer season the last monitored rainy season 2018 2019 provided important insight into the impact of the rain intensity on the infiltration process and groundwater recharge this year was characterized by higher cumulative annual precipitation reaching 278 mm nevertheless the wetting process of the unsaturated zone was much weaker compared to the previous winters the sensors located in the shallow soil depression 0 4 m indicate immediate increase in water content with the initiation of the rainy season fig 5 yet the moisture values during the third season as measured over 60 winter days of january to february are lower 33 than those measured in the first two winters 42 moreover the deeper probes from 1 3 to 6 7 m showed very weak or no increase in water content throughout the third season unfortunately the probe at 8 m stopped measuring due to a technical failure although the third year had a higher cumulative precipitation than the previous two years the percolation pattern as may be reflected from the variations in water content is significantly weaker accordingly it is obvious that the differences in the percolation patterns is related to the differences in rain intensity rather than the annual cumulative precipitation 3 2 2 infiltration through the soil terrace the soil terrace site is located only 50 m away from the rocky site in the adjacent stream channel in this site the lithological profile includes 3 m of relatively homogeneous rendzina soil layer on top of limestone and dolomite rock formations fig 2 the variations in water content fig 6 emphasize the difference between water movement in the soil profile 3 m and in the deeper rocky part 3 m the transition zone between the soil and the rock 3 5 m depth is composed of weathered material that seems to have a significant impact on the percolation pattern beneath this site during the first rainy season 2016 2017 the wetting pattern in the soil profile was characterized by a gradual increase in water content in the shallow part of the soil profile 0 4 and 0 7 m with a long lag time several days between the rain event and the increase in water content fig 6 the associated wetting front propagation velocity in this event ranges from 2 3 to 5 7 cm h no change in water content was observed at 1 6 m depth indicating limited infiltration across the soil layers the long lag time is obviously attributed to the attenuation of the wetting front propagation in the terrace s dry soil note that during this season no runoff was observed in the stream channel or in between the terraces in the transition zone between the soil and the weathered rock 2 9 and 5 6 m depths a moderate increase in water content was observed late in the winter season which continued through the dry summer then from the end of the dry summer to the beginning of the next winter a gradual decrease in water content reflecting deep drainage was observed however since no deep water infiltration was observed through the above soil layer it is hypothesized that the water that drained from the rock surfaces at the terrace margins infiltrated down and moved laterally along the soil rock interface reaching the sections located under the terrace deeper in the cross section at 7 and 8 3 m depths located in hard limestone rock only a moderate increase in water content was recorded fig 6 suggesting slow drainage of water from the weathered rock above it nevertheless the water s arrival at these depths is also assumed to be related to lateral flow from the rocky margins and not to direct vertical percolation from the soil in the terrace this hypothesis will be further discussed through the results of the tracers experiments that were conducted in the following rainy season during the second rainy season winter 2017 2018 which included two major intense rainstorms runoff was generated in the watershed and locally on the rock outcrops table 1 as a result short term flooding of the terrace was created by water draining from the hillslopes this event created substantial wetting of the entire unsaturated zone profile in this event the percolation pattern was rather complex in the soil layer a gradual wetting that is attributed to direct water infiltration from the land surface was indicated by the sequential wetting of the sensors at 0 4 0 7 and 1 6 m with wetting front propagation velocities ranging 1 1 to 7 9 cm h deeper in the rock profile under the soil layer a quick wetting was observed at depth of 5 6 m immediately after the initiation of the intense rain events this event occurred prior to the full wetting of the soil profile above it suggest a direct connection to the water infiltrating down from the rocky terrain s foothills on the terrace margins and not from the soil above it fig 2b the calculated velocities exhibited relatively high values of 20 2 and 20 5 cm h at depths of 5 6 and 8 3 respectively obviously the actual flow velocities were much higher as the water needed to traverse the cross section from the terrace margins while these velocities were calculated as vertical propagation once again this may suggest subsurface lateral water flow along the soil rock interface rather than direct infiltration through the soil layer the third rainy season winter 2018 2019 was characterized by the highest cumulative rainfall amount reaching 278 mm fig 4 however the rain intensities in this year were quite low compared to the previous two winters reaching a maximum of 20 mm day table 1 the shallowest probe which is located at a depth of 0 4 m at the top of the soil profile showed relatively low water content values of 30 compared to previous seasons in which the water content exceeded 40 moreover the sensors located deeper in the soil profile at 0 7 and 1 6 m depths did not show any increase in water content indicating no deep infiltration that could potentially reach the rock below and contribute water to groundwater recharge on the other hand the sensors located under the soil layer at the soil rock interface exhibited a significant increase in water content this strengthens our hypothesis that the increase in water content that was measured deep under the terrace originated from water that infiltrated at the terrace margins and not from direct infiltration through the thick soil layer an important overall conclusion that emerged from this observation is that despite the fact that this year had the highest cumulative rainfall it had the lowest level of water infiltration due to the low intensity of the rainstorm events 3 3 tracers transport following the observations of rainwater infiltration in the first rainy season a tracer test was conducted during the second rainy season winter 2017 2018 in order to track the water percolation pattern from the land surface through the unsaturated zone the tracers uranine and naphthionate were applied to the land surface in specific morphological features that were suspected to be potential hot spots for deep percolation fig 7 the observations suggested that the shrubs which are annual green plants growing in between the exposed rock surfaces indicating a hot spots for deep infiltration they have deep roots that penetrate the soil pocket and weathered rock beneath the solid rock surfaces fig 3 in the rocky terrain the tracers were applied directly to a few prickly burnet shrubs that are located above the vsp sleeve uranine was applied on prickly burnet shrubs that are located above the deeper section of the vms while the naphthionate was applied to a group of plants that are located above the shallow sections of the vms fig 7a in the terrace site the tracers were applied at the foothills of the rocky outcrops along the contact line between the exposed rock and the soil on the terrace here the tracers were implemented along a line where prickly burnet shrubs grow on the terrace perimeter fig 7b note that no prickly burnet shrubs grow on the soil in the terrace uranine was used on the eastern boundary while the naphthionate was used on the western boundary the rationale behind the tracer implementation on the terrace margins was to test the hypothesis that the observed wetting in the deep rock layers under the soil terrace is attributed to lateral subsurface water flow along the soil rock interface rather than to vertical infiltration through the soil layers accordingly the tracers breakthrough curves at various depths in both sites rocky terrain and deep soil in terraces were analyzed with respect to the rain pattern geomorphological setup and lithological characteristics for the sake of convenience the breakthrough curves are presented as relative concentration normalized to the maximum concentration at each depth fig 8 fig 9 the maximum concentration values for each depth are presented next to each breakthrough curve upon analysis of the breakthrough curves one should note that by coincidence the tracer experiment was conducted during the strongest rainstorm that was monitored for three years this rainstorm generated very intensive percolation events as measured by the moisture sensors in the unsaturated zone as well as runoff on the surface obviously such an intensive event has a distinctive impact on tracer transport on the land surface and in the subsurface 3 3 1 tracer transport in the rocky terrain in the rocky terrain the tracers breakthrough curves present a complex percolation pattern that reflects both vertical and lateral flow trajectories uranine which was applied only on the area that is above the deepest units of the vms fig 7a appeared in all depths fig 8 yet the highest absolute concentration appeared in the deepest sections 4 m with a maximum concentration at 6 7 m at these depths the uranine breakthrough curves exhibited quick increases and decreases in concentration suggesting very high connectivity between the tracers application zone at the prickly burnet shrubs to the deep sections of the unsaturated zone the rapidly rising and falling limbs of the breakthrough curve at the deep sections suggest very small storage where the tracer is quickly washed away from the fracture void the appearance of uranine at a depth of 0 4 m which is located in a shallow soil depression away from its application zone indicates that local runoff washed uranine downhill to the areas that are located above the upper sampling point fig 8 at depths of 1 3 and 2 7 m which are located in weathered rock or soil pockets below the hard rock the absolute uranine concentrations were much smaller 0 2 and 0 16 mg l respectively moreover the breakthrough shows a late appearance 3 4 d after the storm initiation with a very long falling limb 7 d which indicates a larger storage volume of the soil pockets or weathered rock layer compared to the fracture domain naphthionate was also applied to a group of prickly burnet shrubs fig 7a however these were located closer to the vms head above the shallower monitoring units the naphthionate also appeared at all depths with the maximum absolute concentration at a depth of 6 7 m yet its breakthrough curves exhibited a quite different percolation mechanism at most depths the breakthrough curve of naphthionate exhibited a long and slowly falling limb which indicated a larger storage capacity such as soil pockets or weathered rock layer fig 3 the simultaneous breakthrough of the naphthionate and uranine at the shallow depths 2 7 m indicates that uranine was transported on the land surface by local runoff to the area that was traced by naphthionate these two tracers were then transported down by the percolating water into the soil pockets and weathered rock however the quick arrival and washing down of the naphthionate into the deep sections 6 7 m also indicate connectivity through active fractures which are associated with the prickly burnet shrub on land surface tracer arrival velocities were calculated by their arrival time to the different depths with respect to the first major rainstorm rainy season 2017 2018 note that the velocity is underestimated since it is limited by the sampling resolution the tracers velocities in the upper soil layer and deeper in the weathered rock or soil pockets from 0 4 to 2 7 m reveal minimal velocities of 0 5 3 4 cm h this range of values represents water flow in a porous domain however the calculated velocity of the deepest probes at the depths of 4 0 5 3 6 7 and 8 0 m indicate much faster velocities of 38 1 to 76 2 cm h to uranine and 15 4 63 8 cm h for the naphthionate these extremely high velocities are the result of the intense rainstorm and the highly developed fracture system that rapidly transmits rainwater down to deep sections of the unsaturated zone 3 3 2 tracer transport in the soil terrace in the soil terrace site the tracers breakthrough curves were quite different the high intensity of the rain in this event created local runoff and short term flooding of the terrace by water from the traced zones on the margins of the area that is above the monitored zone fig 7b it offered a different perspective on the flow and transport processes both in the soil and in the underlying rock following the first rain event which was the most intensive event of the entire monitored period 67 mm table 1 breakthroughs of both naphthionate and uranine were observed at the shallow depths of the soil profile at 0 4 and 0 7 m since the tracers were implemented away from the monitored zone on the terrace margins it is obvious that the tracers were transported over the land surface by runoff visible evidence for uranine migration on the terrace surface during the rainstorm was also observed in this stage no signs of the tracers were observed in the deep sections of the soil or rock profiles two weeks after the first storm a second large storm with 31 mm of rain occurred table 1 following this storm traced water was detected in both the deeper section of the soil and the rock profiles it appears that both tracers emerged at the soil rock interface 2 9 m as well as in the deeper sections of the rock layers 4 0 and 5 2 m prior to their appearance at 1 6 m in the soil fig 9 at the shallow depths 0 4 and 0 7 m maximal concentrations were found two days after the storm ended and therefore the tracers migration velocities may be calculated as 0 5 and 0 9 cm h respectively the arrival time to a depth of 1 6 m with respect the second major storm resulted in a velocity of 0 8 cm h the slow infiltration rate and gradual water movement indicated typical uniform vertical infiltration in the soil in contrast in the deep part of the rock formation under the terrace much higher tracer velocities were found values of 3 5 4 8 6 2 and 1 9 cm h were calculated for depths of 2 9 4 0 5 2 m and 6 3 m respectively yet as abovementioned these calculated velocities are an underestimation due to the relatively low sampling intervals also the actual path of the tracers from the terrace margins to the sampling points under the terrace is much longer than the vertical distance from the surface 4 discussion direct measurements of water percolation in the deep unsaturated zone showed that rainwater infiltration in rocky terrains where the land surface morphology is mainly composed of hard impervious rock surfaces is much faster and more intense compared to water infiltration through areas where the land surface is covered with deep soils it has been shown that rainwater infiltration in rocky terrains is controlled by quick drainage of the rock surfaces directly into the developed fracture system thus enhancing the deep drainage of the rainwater into the unsaturated zone and ultimately to the groundwater on the other hand in areas where the morphology is mainly composed of deep soils such as those prevailing in terraces along the stream channels high plains and valleys of mountainous regions a large amount of rainwater is required to initiate deep percolation accordingly the penetration depth of small rain events which form the majority of the total precipitation in semi arid conditions is limited exposed to intense evapotranspiration and ultimately reduces the groundwater recharge potential however in rocky terrain almost every rain event results in local runoff from the rock surfaces that drains into the subsurface through the fracture network ultimately contributing to groundwater recharge this finding is somewhat in contrast to previous studies on groundwater recharge in arid and semi arid regions that suggested a higher importance of the stream channels to the overall groundwater recharge dahan et al 2007 2008 gutman 1997 lange 2005 however it is in line with others that showed enhanced infiltration from geomorphological features containing fractured rocky surfaces li et al 2011 yair and raz yassif 2004 dahan et al 1999 native et al 1995 it has been found that the rain pattern has a significant impact on the infiltration rate and ultimately on groundwater recharge groundwater recharge from mountainous rocky outcrops in semi arid conditions is primarily controlled by rain intensity rather than the total annual cumulative precipitation high rain intensities that occur even during drought years may contribute to groundwater recharge more than year of high cumulative precipitation that are characterized by low rain intensities prickly burnet plants were found to constitute an important geomorphological feature related to the rainwater infiltration and groundwater recharge these plants thrive on the hillslopes of rocky terrain and grow especially well in between the impervious rock surfaces sending their roots into the soil pockets which are funneled into the deep fractures systems fig 3 as such these plants mark the locations of the hydrological passages through which rainwater efficiently drains from rocky surfaces into the soil pockets and from there to the deep sections of the unsaturated zone these plants use the natural surfaces drainage system for their growth but are also efficient natural indicators for infiltration hot spots stream channels in the mountain terrains of semi arid regions are often covered by deep soil in human made terraces that were constructed to prevent soil erosion and create zones of deep agricultural soil as such from a regional groundwater recharge perspective the rocky terrain covering 64 of the study areas is significantly important for groundwater recharge compared to the deep soils in the stream channels covering 25 of the area s morphology fig 1b therefore groundwater recharge models must include descriptions of the geomorphological features rather than establishing a uniform infiltration function for the entire region as commonly done moreover our findings emphasizes that the groundwater recharge assessments in semi arid and arid climates must refer the landscape units and surface properties rather than the lithological description from surface to the groundwater level alone 5 conclusions a study on rainwater percolation in a mountainous terrain of a semi arid region was conducted through continuous monitoring of water flow pattern and tracers transport through the unsaturated zone the study compared the percolation pattern in two typical geomorphological settings 1 rocky terrain hillslopes which are characterized by high percentage of exposed rock formation and sparce shallow soil depressions and 2 deep soils formation as may be found in terraces valleys and high plains of mountainous terrains three years of continuous data collection on the temporal variation in water content along with tracer breakthrough curves at multiple depths across the unsaturated zone were analyzed with respect to the rain pattern and geomorphological conditions the results indicated that rainwater percolation from rocky hillslopes is much more significant and intense compared to infiltration through deep soil formation this implies that the rocky surfaces on the hillslopes are of a greater importance to groundwater recharge compared to the deep soil that often covers the stream channels and valleys apparently prickly burnet shrub growing on the rocky hillslopes marks hot spots for water drainage into the deep unsaturated zone it has been found that quick and deep rainwater percolation which ultimately contribute to groundwater recharge is primarily associated with intense rain events accordingly it is the rain pattern that dictates the total annual groundwater recharge more than cumulative annual precipitation thus drought years of low annual precipitation and high rain intensities may result in higher groundwater recharge compared to years of higher cumulative precipitation of lower intensities recent studies have shown decrease in the average annual rainfall and increase in rainstorms intensities during the last decades in the eastern mediterranean sea chenoweth et al 2011 lelieveld et al 2012 volosciuk et al 2016 these changes accompanied by higher temperature and potential evaporation may further reduce the water budget in both wet and semi arid regions however according to this study increase in rain intensities in mountainous areas may result in enhanced water infiltration and ultimately increase groundwater recharge even under decreased annual cumulative precipitation the results suggest that groundwater recharge models for mountainous terrain in semi arid regions could be improved upon referring adoptive infiltration function to the different geomorphological features while linking the rain intensity as an input function to the percolation credit authorship contribution statement or letz conceptualization

with the assistance of xiaohui lei associate editor model predictive control mpc is an effective real time control method in dealing with water level deviations in canal pools however the control interval must be relatively small if some canal pools have short time delay characteristics resulting in frequent gate control and limited use in practical engineering in this paper control interval constraint and water level soft constraint methods were proposed to handle frequent gate control problems in mpc the mpc method with these constraint methods was tested on a simulation model of the beijing shijiazhuang part of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project mrp with two kinds of disturbances common to this project the results indicate that the control interval constraint can increase the gate control interval and avoid back and forth gate opening adjustments without affecting the water level regulation the water level constraint helps avoid unnecessary control to minor water level deviations with both constraints used together the control times can be reduced by 60 and 37 respectively in the two test disturbances this control method meets the demand of large control intervals in multi cascade pools keywords model predictive control multi cascade canal pools control interval constraint water level constraint the mrp 1 introduction water diversion projects can restructure river connectivity via manufactured canals which has become an increasingly popular solution to unequal spatial and temporal distribution of water resources several large scale water diversion projects have been constructed with notable examples such as the california state water project chung and helweg 1985 and the central arizona project mariño and loaiciga 1985 in the united states as well as the great lakes basin water diversion becker and easter 1995 in canada the snowy mountains hydro electric scheme young et al 2010 in australia and the south to north water diversion project in china most of these large scale water diversion projects span multiple basins and need to be divided into cascaded canals by check gates and pump stations to divert water each canal pool can be seen as a small reservoir whose water storage is reflected by the water level behind the upstream check gate and in front of the downstream check gate the water level is an essential factor during water diversion changes in water level will affect the flow to users and serious damages will occur if the water level is beyond the threshold it is thus essential to control the water level of the canals since the water flow in open canals are mostly subcritical flow the water depth at the downstream end of the canal pool is the largest with minimum safety height of the side slope so it is mainly to control the water level at the downstream end of a pool several techniques have been developed to deal with the gate control problems of water delivery canals mainly for irrigation canals rogers and goussard 1998 zafra cabeza et al 2011 current canal control methods can be broadly divided into the feedback method feliu batlle et al 2009 litrico et al 2007 the feedforward method and the model predictive control mpc method the basic idea of the feedback control method is to get the regulation rules or logic for control structures cheng and chau 2004 romdhane et al 2008 the most representative of which is the proportional integral pi control burt et al 1998 feliu batlle et al 2009 pi control is the most widely used control method in practice as the regulation rules or logic are easy to be calculated but it is often used only to guide a limited number of gates in canal pools feliu batlle et al 2009 litrico et al 2007 when many gates in multi cascade canal pools are controlled the control logic is difficult to formulate also the feedback control is inapplicable for adopting the foreseen information directly to get the control strategy clemmens and strand 2010 clemmens and bautista 2005 proposed a well known feedforward method the volume compensation method according to the volume regulation experience of the irrigation canal operators while they also admit that influenced by the uncertainty of canal parameters volume compensation needs to be applied judiciously and preferably implemented in conjunction with a feedback control strategy soler et al 2013 and kong et al 2019 used the sequential quadratic problem sqp method and exhaustive method respectively to schedule gate opening with a prediction component based on the complete form of saint venant sv equations this kind of optimization strategy based on a simulation model is prevalent in cascade large scale reservoir optimization scheduling bai et al 2015 liu et al 2017 or the large scale water allocations jamshid mousavi et al 2017 sadegh et al 2010 however the water level change caused by the uncertainty of canal parameters and offtake changes in the cascaded canals is tremendous due to their small water storage capacity it is necessary to adjust the control plan based on the feedback water level information on time in canal pools mpc is a kind of regulation theory that uses an internal model of the studied regulation system to predict the future value of the process output according to the current control input of the system and the historical information of the process a predictive model describing the system s dynamic behavior is needed as the internal model different from the water balance equation that describes the relationship between water level and flow in the reservoir the saint venant equations describing the hydrodynamic characteristics of a canal do not explicitly express the relationship between the water level and the flow therefore the latter method can not directly use the measured water level to update the equations data assimilation and neural networks are widely used to predict water levels or flow in canals or rivers romanowicz et al 2006 described data assimilation da and adaptive forecasting techniques for flood forecasting and their application to forecasting water levels at various river locations to meet the needs of short term water level prediction and early decision making shang et al 2019 used the neural network to predict the water level downstream of a power station ren et al 2020 adopted neural networks to predict water levels in cascaded channels for water level control needs tan et al 2018 used an adaptive artificial neural network to forecast the monthly runoff in the yangtze river basin but the neural networks and data assimilation model based on full saint venant sv equations would be much computationally expensive as an internal model for the mpc xu et al 2011 as far as multiple cascaded canal pools are concerned the internal model of mpc to describe a canal pool is usually a linear model such as the muskingum model cunge 1969 integrator delay id model schuurmans et al 1995 and reduced sv model xu et al 2011 wahlin 2004 first studied the effectiveness of mpc on canal control by using the id model to get the state space equations of the controlled canal system overloop et al 2008 developed a multiple model predictive control to deal with uncertainties in model predictions most studies tested mpc on simulation models because the ideal modern automated water canal simply did not exist van overloop et al 2010 then tested the mpc method to a practical engineering canal for the first time the results showed that under the control of mpc relatively stable water delivery flow and small water level deviation can be maintained xu et al 2013 used a reduced saint venant rsv model using proper orthogonal decomposition pod on the sv equations to get the state space equations of the controlled canal system and applied it with mpc control hashemy et al 2013 studied the mpc based on the id model to optimally control water levels under water shortage using the in line storage it is noticeable to find that the mpc method is applicable in real time control of water levels in canal pools in view of the fact that a small control interval is needed to maintain the prediction accuracy in the internal model the mpc would result in a frequent gate control in some large scale water diversion canals large control devices may be damaged if gate control is carried out too frequently moreover in some large scale water diversion projects with pumps as the primary control devices the regulation should not be too frequent due to the small adjustability of the pumping station therefore it is essential to develop a real time control method that meets the water level stability requirements and the gate control frequency limits in this paper control interval constraint and water level constraint methods are adopted in mpc to increase the gate control interval and reduce the gate control times the method is then tested on a simulation model of the beijing shijiazhuang part of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project mrp consisting of 13 cascaded canal pools the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the background of mpc and details regarding the control methods to reduce the gate control times are provided section 3 presents a simulated case study using the proposed mpc method and conclusions are given in section 4 2 material and methods in this section the mpc control theory is illustrated first then the id model for mpc in canal control is described subsequently the constraint methods used in this paper are proposed finally the comparison methods are explained 2 1 model predictive control theory mpc uses an internal model of the studied system to predict future output processes the system s input includes the current state disturbances in the current and forecast period and control actions in the current and forecast period the system output is the future state mpc obtains a sequence of control variables by solving the objective function but only the control variable at the next control step in the sequence is executed before reaching the next moment the actual measured information of the system is used to update the state variables and the disturbance in the internal model and the updated model is used to calculate the optimal control variable at the next moment in this way the controller can handle the difference between the simplified internal and the real system this process is called rolling optimization the flow chart of a control system using mpc is shown in fig 1 the state space representation of the internal model can be used for calculation in mpc this representation based on states inputs and outputs is much easier to work with because it allows direct matrix manipulations a linear time invariant state space model of the system is given as x k 1 ax k bu k dd k 1 y k cx k where a represents the system matrix b is the input to state matrix d is the disturbance to state matrix x is the state vector u is the input vector d is the disturbance vector and c is the output matrix used to transfer the state vector x to the output vector y then an output prediction is carried out with the state space model in the prediction process the predicted output of the system y k i k is determined by the current state vector x k and the future control actions u k i k the counter i denotes the number of time steps into the future in y k i k the counter i ranges from 1 to p which is the prediction horizon in u k i k the counter i ranges from 1 to m which is the control horizon and should be less than or equal to p it is assumed that there are control actions from the current time step k to future time step k m and no control actions from time step k m 1 to the future time step k p the objective function is expressed as a quadratic cost function of the future setpoint tracking errors plus the input increments term weighting is added the objective function can be described as 2 min u k j j 1 p q j y k j k y r k j k 2 j 1 m r j u k j 1 k 2 where y r is the reference trajectory q j is the weighting matrix of the difference between the output and reference trajectory a positive definite matrix r j is the weighting matrix of the input a positive definite matrix the constraints of the control variables in mpc should be in the form of 3 u lb k j 1 k u k j 1 k u ub k j 1 k where u ub k j 1 k represents the upper limit of u k j 1 k the elements of which should all be non negative u lb k j 1 k represents the lower limit of u k j 1 k the elements of which should all be non positive the optimization problem is a convex programming problem with the objective function in eq 2 and constraints in eq 3 the gradient descent algorithm can be used to find the global optimal solution according to the optimization criteria the rolling optimization problem of mpc is actually to obtain the optimal control input u k j 1 k j 1 2 3 m while only the u k is implemented after the implementation of optimal control action u k the state of the system will change at this time the state space model can be updated with feedback information and then a new round of prediction and optimal control action calculation is carried out 2 2 the integrator delay model for mpc in canal water level control it s the id model most used as an internal model for the mpc in canal water level control the id model assumes that the water level deviation of a canal pool is a linear function of the flow rate change and the upstream flow change has a delay effect on the water level at the downstream end of the canal pool therefore the id model calculation can be expressed as schuurmans et al 1995 4 d e d t 1 a s q in t t d q out t q offtake t where e is the water level deviation at the downstream end of the pool qin t td is the inflow deviation to the backwater section with delay time td qout t is the downstream outflow deviation qofftake t is the offtake flow deviation and as is the average storage area the characteristics td and as can be calculated by applying the system identification technique litrico and fromion 2004 weyer 2001 under different flow conditions the values of td and as may vary slightly as the water surface profile changes with the flow rate previous studies have demonstrated that by reducing the sensitivity of the control algorithm to the water level deviation as much as possible or choosing a smaller as and a larger td the risk of failure of the control method can be reduced at the cost of lowering the optimal control effect meanwhile wahlin 2004 the water level and water level change rate in the id model can be updated according to the real time water level monitoring information then the id model can be written in the state space representation when the id model is written in the state space expression the delay time is converted into a delay step with the following equation 5 t k t d t s where the delay step tk is an integer t s is the control interval in the control system if td is smaller than ts the tk should be set to 1 rather than 0 as tk equals 0 means that the studied system has no time delay which will result in lousy control result if the time delay step of a canal pool is 2 the discrete form of the state space model of the canal pool can be expressed as e k 1 δ e k 1 δ q in k δ q in k 1 δ q in k 2 1 1 0 0 t s a s 0 1 0 0 t s a s 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 e k δ e k δ q in k 1 δ q in k 2 δ q in k 3 0 0 1 0 0 δ q in k t s a s t s a s 0 0 0 δ q out k 6 e k δ e k 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 e k δ e k δ q in k 1 δ q in k 2 δ q in k 3 where δ q in k is the element in the input vector u meaning the increment of the inflow with δ q in k q in k 1 q in k δ q out k shows the increment of the outflow then a water level deviation prediction is carried out with the state space model of the id model the objective function of mpc in water level control s expressed as 7 min u k j i 1 n j 1 p q i j e i k j k e i r k j k 2 j 1 m r i j δ q i k j 1 k 2 where e i is the water level deviation at the downstream point of pool i e i r is the reference trajectory of e i which can be set to zero to keep the water level stable δ q i is the inflow increment of pool i the elements in q and r provide a trade off between minimizing the water level deviations and minimizing flow changes the larger the value of the elements in q is the more aggressive the flow control the optimization problem of eq 7 is a typical quadratic programming problem which is solved by the standard matlab function quadprog in this paper s case the control variable in the state space model is the inflow increment the flow adjustment command is then converted into the gate opening adjustment command with the gate flow equation swamee 1992 2 3 constraint methods to reduce the gate control times 2 3 1 control interval constraint method if there is a considerable control interval need one straightforward way is to set the control interval to the desired control interval in this condition to use the discrete state space equations with the mpc the delay step of pools with short time delay should be set to be 1 leading to a decrease in prediction accuracy and control effect in this paper a small control interval is still used to keep the prediction precision for the internal model and a control interval constraint method can be used to increase the control interval if the desired control interval is l times the used control interval of the internal model the flow control actions δ q k in control variables u k can be strictly limited to be 0 if the control step is not a multiple of l so this flow change constraint can be added to constraint eq 3 with 8 0 δ q k j 1 k 0 if k j 1 l 0 thus the constraints of the control variables are still in the form of eq 3 the flow control interval can be increased to the desired interval it should be noted that a small flow control action cannot be executed due to the existence of the dead band of check gates in this way the control interval may be larger than the desired control interval when the generated flow control action is small in this study the accumulator method proposed by zheng et al 2019 was adopted to handle the dead band constraints thus when the value of the flow adjustment command is not enough to drive the gate movement this flow adjustment command is accumulated to the next moment when the gate opening change corresponding to this accumulated flow adjustment command can be executed the gate action is executed and the accumulated flow control command reset to zero this check gate dead band will reduce the effect of predictive control such as making the water level unable to stabilize at the target water level but it also avoids gate actions at every calculation step 2 3 2 water level soft constraint method water level soft constraint is usually used to limit the controlled the level to the allowable range hashemy et al 2013 used the this soft constraint to limit the water level during significant water flow change by introducing a virtual input signal u in the input vector u and a virtual state e in the state vector x 9 u k e k e min e k e max e max e k e max e min e k e min where e max and emin are upper and lower values of the water level deviation constraints respectively the virtual state can be expressed with e k e k u k thus the u k is limited within the constraint in the form of eq 9 then e k can be considered in the objective function in eq 7 with this soft constraint used the deviation part beyond the water level deviation constraint is set with an extra weight of the state e k thus the weight of the part beyond the allowable range is the sum of weight of e k and weight of e k by setting e k a significant weight the water level shall not exceed range as much as possible in this paper the water level soft constraint method is used to deduce the weight of minor water deviations the weight of water level deviation is added to the e k rather than e k so minor water level deviations are not controlled or controlled slightly and to set tremendous weight for water level deviation beyond the allowable range more virtual deviation states e k and corresponding u k can be introduced in the state space model 2 4 comparison methods an mpc control method using a small control interval with no constraint method can be used for comparison referred to as method 1 an mpc method with control interval constraint is used for comparison referred to as method 2 an mpc control method with water level soft constraint is used for comparison referred to as method 3 the method in this paper with both constraint methods is referred to as method 4 these methods are used to compare and analyze the impact of the two constraint methods on the mpc model 3 case study 3 1 study scenario a simulation model of the beijing shijiazhuang section of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project mrp was selected to test the effectiveness of the control method in this paper the starting point of this canal system is near shijiazhuang city the endpoint is near beijing city shown in fig 2 this canal system is regarded as an independent canal system and the effects from the upstream part of the mrp are ignored the length of canal pools in the study area ranges from 10 km to 27 km covering the length range of all canal pools in the mrp there is a target water level upstream of every check gate in the regulation of the project it is generally required that the regulation interval of each check gate should be greater than 2 h as far as possible during normal regulation the water level deviations should be maintained smaller than 0 15 m in pools 1 12 and smaller than 0 1 m in pool 13 simulation models of each pool were established separately to tune the hydraulic parameters therefore the measured value of the water level downstream of the check gate served as model boundaries the parameters were tuned to ensure that the water level upstream of the check gate is close to the measured water level the simulation models for each pool were also used to get the id model of canal pools the initial flow condition and the id model parameters of each pool are shown in table 1 the pools are initially steady and water levels at the control points are all at target water levels then control methods are implemented on this simulation model the control methods only obtain real time information of water levels and gate openings in the simulation model which can be monitored in the real world two kinds of disturbances are used to test the control methods the first one is the unknown slight delivery disturbance the second disturbance is the scheduled offtake flow change for unknown disturbances the flow change information is not contained in the id model while for scheduled disturbance the flow change information is predictable in the id model the disturbances are shown in fig 3 3 2 control method settings the delay time of id models ranges from 19 min to 76 min so the control interval is set to 0 5 h considering the precision of the internal model and the calculation workload of the control method as the control interval is set to be 0 5 h the desired interval is 2 h so the value of l is 4 in the control interval constraint in method 1 the flow change weight is set to 1 in r j the water level deviation weight is set to 13 for method 2 with control interval constraint as the control interval constraint limits the flexibility of flow adjustment the water level control effect will be relatively reduced hence the weight of the deviation needs to be increased appropriately and is set to 18 in method 3 with water level soft constraint method three virtual input signals and corresponding virtual deviation states e 1 e 2 e 3 are used when the absolute value of water level deviation is larger than 0 08 m in pools 1 12 or 0 05 m in pool 13 there is a virtual deviation state e 1 in each pool when the absolute value is larger than 0 15 m in pools 1 12 or 0 1 m in pool 13 there is a virtual deviation state e 2 in each pool when the absolute value is larger than 0 35 m in pools 1 12 or 0 15 m in pool 13 which is considered as an emergency condition there is a virtual deviation state e 3 in each pool the weight for water deviation e is set to be 0 while the weight for e 1 e 2 and e 3 are set to be 25 25 and 25 respectively thus the minor water level deviations are not controlled similarly in method 4 using both constraint methods the weights for e 1 e 2 and e 3 needs to be increased appropriately are all set to 30 the details of the parameter values are shown in table 2 3 3 results method 1 4 are first used in disturbance i in the first place with a 2 7 ghz computer processor the calculation time at each control step in method 1 4 is 4 s 4 s 8 s and 8 s respectively the water level constraint method will increase the optimization variables so the calculation time is longer in method 3 and method 4 the results of these methods in disturbance i are shown in figs 4 7 in figs 4 7 the deviations are controlled to the range of 0 15 m to 0 15 m proving the effectiveness of these control methods due to the different processes of the gate opening change the trends of the water level deviations under the control of these methods are also slightly different the gate control times with these methods in disturbance i are shown in table 3 in figs 4 and 5 the maximum and minimum water level deviations in all pools are almost the same and the change trends of the gate openings are also relatively close the main difference is that the control interval of each gate in fig 5 is larger than that in fig 4 and the control times of each gate are relatively less than those in fig 4 most remarkably the number of gate controls in pool 5 and pool 7 have been reduced from 17 in method 1 to 11 in method 2 in method 1 although the control interval is larger than 2 h with the dead band of check gate in pool 5 the use of gate control interval constraint in method 2 can increase the control interval further in pool 11 due to the large water level deviations in pools 10 12 there are many back and forth opening adjustments at small intervals in fig 4 the use of the control interval constraint method in fig 5 can decrease these back and forth opening adjustments when there is a small control interval with large deviations of several surrounding pools the gate control strategy may be implemented at each control step causing the water level to fluctuate significantly these fluctuations will interfere with the forecast of the changing trend of the water level which will lead to unreasonable back and forth gate opening adjustments while with the control interval constraint method used the perceived water level change trend is relatively stable as fluctuations have decreased a lot when the flow regulation step is reached thus the water level prediction is more accurate and the generated gate control strategy is more reasonable the water level deviation changing trends are different in figs 4 and 6 as the deviations are with different weights in method 1 and method 3 in fig 6 the total number of control times is 115 less than 139 in fig 4 it can be seen from table 4 that not all check gates in method 3 are less controlled than those in method 1 in pools 1 4 where there are minor deviations in fig 4 and significant deviations in fig 6 the number of gate control times in fig 6 is less while in pools 5 7 where there are all significant deviations in figs 4 and 6 the number of gate control times in fig 6 is even more the weight of significant deviation needs to be set to a larger value with the water level constraint method which causes the gate control times to increase with significant deviations in fig 6 the back and forth gate opening adjustments at small intervals in pool 5 pool 6 pool 9 and pool 10 are apparent in fig 7 the number of gate control times is the least as both constraint methods are used compared with the result in fig 6 these back and forth gate opening adjustments in pools 7 10 are reduced as the control interval increases the most significant change in fig 7 is that after 48 h there is almost no gate opening adjustment in pools 1 5 in figs 4 and 5 the water level deviation will be continuously controlled with minor deviations it can be expected that the gate controls in pools 1 5 are frequent in fig 0 6 the water level deviations in pools 1 5 after 48 h are within the safe range before the gate action gate action in these pools is likely to respond to the control action of gates in downstream pools 5 8 in fig 7 due to the addition of the control interval method these back and forth gate opening adjustments in pools 5 8 are eliminated so there is no corresponding gate control in pools 1 4 the add of the control interval constraint method greatly helps method 4 to reduce gate control times the total gate control times are 139 times and the total gate control times in methods 3 5 are 103 115 and 69 respectively a reduction of 25 23 and 60 a reasonable control method should have a predictive function and effectively deal with predictable disturbances then these methods are all used in disturbance ii the calculation time is the same in disturbance i with the methods the control results are shown in figs 8 11 in figs 8 11 the deviations are in or slightly beyond the range of 0 15 m to 0 15 m proving the effectiveness of these control methods similarly different gate opening adjustment processes lead to different deviation change trends the gate control times with these methods in disturbance ii are shown in table 4 in figs 8 and 9 the change trends of the gate openings are also relatively close and the control interval constraint method in fig 9 is able to reduce the gate control times most check gate control times are relatively minor in fig 0 9 except for the gate in pool 13 the reason is that the control interval of the gate in pool 13 is much longer than 2 h so the use of the control interval constraint method in method 2 cannot reduce the gate control times on the contrary the larger deviation weight in method 2 will increase the gate control times compared with the result in fig 8 using the water level constraint method in fig 0 10 does not effectively reduce the gate control times as the flow change disturbance is relatively tremendous in disturbance ii there are significant deviations in pools 5 13 the use of the water level constraint cannot exert its effect in reducing the demand for flow adjustment but a larger weight for deviation increases the back and forth gate opening adjustments in pools 11 and 12 in fig 10 apparent back and forth gate opening adjustments are apparent at small intervals the results of method 4 under two constraints are shown in fig 11 and it is indicated that the use of control interval constraints can decrease these back and forth adjustments thus the gate control times in pools 5 13 decrease compared with the result in fig 10 similarly in pools 1 4 where there are minor deviations the use of water level constraint helps to reduce the gate control times significantly after 48 h in fig 11 therefore the number of gate control in method 4 is 70 about 37 less than 112 in method 1 with no constraint method 4 discussion in mpc the control interval constraint method helps to increase the control interval thus those frequent small gate actions can be changed into significant actions with large control intervals moreover the use of the control interval constraint method helps to decrease the back and forth gate opening adjustments therefore the control interval constraint can increase the control interval and reduce the gate control times whether with large water level deviation or minor deviation the water level constraint method helps deduce the mpc method s sensitivity to minor water level deviations so that small flow control is generated in the case of a minor deviation due to the gate dead band these small flow changes need to be accumulated more times before they can be executed thus increasing the control interval however to maintain the control effect of mpc on significant disturbances a more considerable weight value needs to be assigned to the large water level deviation in the case of significant disturbances or large water level deviations the control of the mpc may be aggressive increasing the number of opening adjustments especially repeated back and forth adjustments thus the water level deviation constraint may only be practical under slight disturbances and minor water level deviations in the case of large disturbances the control effect of reducing the gate will decrease when the water level constraint and the control interval constraint methods are used the gate control times can be significantly reduced and the effect is better than using the water level constraint method or the control interval constraint method alone the control interval constraint can significantly reduce the possibility of back and forth gate opening adjustments caused by the water level constraint method the use of both constraints can eliminate the problem of excessive back and forth adjustments in the case of large water level deviations while also retain less sensitivity to minor water level deviations therefore the mpc with these two constraint methods can effectively increase the control interval and reduce the gate control times under large and small disturbances moreover the addition of these two constraint methods in mpc does not change the standard form of mpc so quadratic programming can still be used to solve optimization problems quickly using these constraint methods does not significantly increase computing time the calculation time at each control step is less than 10 s in method 1 4 therefore the method in this paper can be used for the real time predictive control of large scale cascaded canal pools 5 conclusions this study aimed to provide a predictive control method for multi cascade canal pools with large control interval demand a mpc method using control interval constraint and water level constraint method is proposed the main findings of the study are as follows 1 the use of constraint methods in this paper can reduce the gate control times by 60 and 37 respectively in the studied cases under mpc these constraint methods can sufficiently reduce the gate control times in both slight unknown disturbance and significant foreseen disturbance 2 the water level constraint method helps avoid unnecessary control of minor water level deviations but may lead to multiple back and forth adjustments to large deviations while the control interval constraint method can decrease these adjustments combining the two methods can increase the control interval and reduce gate control times 3 the addition of the two constraints does not change the standard form of mpc so the optimal problem can still be solved quickly through quadratic programming the method proposed in this paper has reasonable practicability in multi cascade canal pools credit authorship contribution statement lingzhong kong conceptualization formal

with the assistance of xiaohui lei associate editor model predictive control mpc is an effective real time control method in dealing with water level deviations in canal pools however the control interval must be relatively small if some canal pools have short time delay characteristics resulting in frequent gate control and limited use in practical engineering in this paper control interval constraint and water level soft constraint methods were proposed to handle frequent gate control problems in mpc the mpc method with these constraint methods was tested on a simulation model of the beijing shijiazhuang part of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project mrp with two kinds of disturbances common to this project the results indicate that the control interval constraint can increase the gate control interval and avoid back and forth gate opening adjustments without affecting the water level regulation the water level constraint helps avoid unnecessary control to minor water level deviations with both constraints used together the control times can be reduced by 60 and 37 respectively in the two test disturbances this control method meets the demand of large control intervals in multi cascade pools keywords model predictive control multi cascade canal pools control interval constraint water level constraint the mrp 1 introduction water diversion projects can restructure river connectivity via manufactured canals which has become an increasingly popular solution to unequal spatial and temporal distribution of water resources several large scale water diversion projects have been constructed with notable examples such as the california state water project chung and helweg 1985 and the central arizona project mariño and loaiciga 1985 in the united states as well as the great lakes basin water diversion becker and easter 1995 in canada the snowy mountains hydro electric scheme young et al 2010 in australia and the south to north water diversion project in china most of these large scale water diversion projects span multiple basins and need to be divided into cascaded canals by check gates and pump stations to divert water each canal pool can be seen as a small reservoir whose water storage is reflected by the water level behind the upstream check gate and in front of the downstream check gate the water level is an essential factor during water diversion changes in water level will affect the flow to users and serious damages will occur if the water level is beyond the threshold it is thus essential to control the water level of the canals since the water flow in open canals are mostly subcritical flow the water depth at the downstream end of the canal pool is the largest with minimum safety height of the side slope so it is mainly to control the water level at the downstream end of a pool several techniques have been developed to deal with the gate control problems of water delivery canals mainly for irrigation canals rogers and goussard 1998 zafra cabeza et al 2011 current canal control methods can be broadly divided into the feedback method feliu batlle et al 2009 litrico et al 2007 the feedforward method and the model predictive control mpc method the basic idea of the feedback control method is to get the regulation rules or logic for control structures cheng and chau 2004 romdhane et al 2008 the most representative of which is the proportional integral pi control burt et al 1998 feliu batlle et al 2009 pi control is the most widely used control method in practice as the regulation rules or logic are easy to be calculated but it is often used only to guide a limited number of gates in canal pools feliu batlle et al 2009 litrico et al 2007 when many gates in multi cascade canal pools are controlled the control logic is difficult to formulate also the feedback control is inapplicable for adopting the foreseen information directly to get the control strategy clemmens and strand 2010 clemmens and bautista 2005 proposed a well known feedforward method the volume compensation method according to the volume regulation experience of the irrigation canal operators while they also admit that influenced by the uncertainty of canal parameters volume compensation needs to be applied judiciously and preferably implemented in conjunction with a feedback control strategy soler et al 2013 and kong et al 2019 used the sequential quadratic problem sqp method and exhaustive method respectively to schedule gate opening with a prediction component based on the complete form of saint venant sv equations this kind of optimization strategy based on a simulation model is prevalent in cascade large scale reservoir optimization scheduling bai et al 2015 liu et al 2017 or the large scale water allocations jamshid mousavi et al 2017 sadegh et al 2010 however the water level change caused by the uncertainty of canal parameters and offtake changes in the cascaded canals is tremendous due to their small water storage capacity it is necessary to adjust the control plan based on the feedback water level information on time in canal pools mpc is a kind of regulation theory that uses an internal model of the studied regulation system to predict the future value of the process output according to the current control input of the system and the historical information of the process a predictive model describing the system s dynamic behavior is needed as the internal model different from the water balance equation that describes the relationship between water level and flow in the reservoir the saint venant equations describing the hydrodynamic characteristics of a canal do not explicitly express the relationship between the water level and the flow therefore the latter method can not directly use the measured water level to update the equations data assimilation and neural networks are widely used to predict water levels or flow in canals or rivers romanowicz et al 2006 described data assimilation da and adaptive forecasting techniques for flood forecasting and their application to forecasting water levels at various river locations to meet the needs of short term water level prediction and early decision making shang et al 2019 used the neural network to predict the water level downstream of a power station ren et al 2020 adopted neural networks to predict water levels in cascaded channels for water level control needs tan et al 2018 used an adaptive artificial neural network to forecast the monthly runoff in the yangtze river basin but the neural networks and data assimilation model based on full saint venant sv equations would be much computationally expensive as an internal model for the mpc xu et al 2011 as far as multiple cascaded canal pools are concerned the internal model of mpc to describe a canal pool is usually a linear model such as the muskingum model cunge 1969 integrator delay id model schuurmans et al 1995 and reduced sv model xu et al 2011 wahlin 2004 first studied the effectiveness of mpc on canal control by using the id model to get the state space equations of the controlled canal system overloop et al 2008 developed a multiple model predictive control to deal with uncertainties in model predictions most studies tested mpc on simulation models because the ideal modern automated water canal simply did not exist van overloop et al 2010 then tested the mpc method to a practical engineering canal for the first time the results showed that under the control of mpc relatively stable water delivery flow and small water level deviation can be maintained xu et al 2013 used a reduced saint venant rsv model using proper orthogonal decomposition pod on the sv equations to get the state space equations of the controlled canal system and applied it with mpc control hashemy et al 2013 studied the mpc based on the id model to optimally control water levels under water shortage using the in line storage it is noticeable to find that the mpc method is applicable in real time control of water levels in canal pools in view of the fact that a small control interval is needed to maintain the prediction accuracy in the internal model the mpc would result in a frequent gate control in some large scale water diversion canals large control devices may be damaged if gate control is carried out too frequently moreover in some large scale water diversion projects with pumps as the primary control devices the regulation should not be too frequent due to the small adjustability of the pumping station therefore it is essential to develop a real time control method that meets the water level stability requirements and the gate control frequency limits in this paper control interval constraint and water level constraint methods are adopted in mpc to increase the gate control interval and reduce the gate control times the method is then tested on a simulation model of the beijing shijiazhuang part of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project mrp consisting of 13 cascaded canal pools the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the background of mpc and details regarding the control methods to reduce the gate control times are provided section 3 presents a simulated case study using the proposed mpc method and conclusions are given in section 4 2 material and methods in this section the mpc control theory is illustrated first then the id model for mpc in canal control is described subsequently the constraint methods used in this paper are proposed finally the comparison methods are explained 2 1 model predictive control theory mpc uses an internal model of the studied system to predict future output processes the system s input includes the current state disturbances in the current and forecast period and control actions in the current and forecast period the system output is the future state mpc obtains a sequence of control variables by solving the objective function but only the control variable at the next control step in the sequence is executed before reaching the next moment the actual measured information of the system is used to update the state variables and the disturbance in the internal model and the updated model is used to calculate the optimal control variable at the next moment in this way the controller can handle the difference between the simplified internal and the real system this process is called rolling optimization the flow chart of a control system using mpc is shown in fig 1 the state space representation of the internal model can be used for calculation in mpc this representation based on states inputs and outputs is much easier to work with because it allows direct matrix manipulations a linear time invariant state space model of the system is given as x k 1 ax k bu k dd k 1 y k cx k where a represents the system matrix b is the input to state matrix d is the disturbance to state matrix x is the state vector u is the input vector d is the disturbance vector and c is the output matrix used to transfer the state vector x to the output vector y then an output prediction is carried out with the state space model in the prediction process the predicted output of the system y k i k is determined by the current state vector x k and the future control actions u k i k the counter i denotes the number of time steps into the future in y k i k the counter i ranges from 1 to p which is the prediction horizon in u k i k the counter i ranges from 1 to m which is the control horizon and should be less than or equal to p it is assumed that there are control actions from the current time step k to future time step k m and no control actions from time step k m 1 to the future time step k p the objective function is expressed as a quadratic cost function of the future setpoint tracking errors plus the input increments term weighting is added the objective function can be described as 2 min u k j j 1 p q j y k j k y r k j k 2 j 1 m r j u k j 1 k 2 where y r is the reference trajectory q j is the weighting matrix of the difference between the output and reference trajectory a positive definite matrix r j is the weighting matrix of the input a positive definite matrix the constraints of the control variables in mpc should be in the form of 3 u lb k j 1 k u k j 1 k u ub k j 1 k where u ub k j 1 k represents the upper limit of u k j 1 k the elements of which should all be non negative u lb k j 1 k represents the lower limit of u k j 1 k the elements of which should all be non positive the optimization problem is a convex programming problem with the objective function in eq 2 and constraints in eq 3 the gradient descent algorithm can be used to find the global optimal solution according to the optimization criteria the rolling optimization problem of mpc is actually to obtain the optimal control input u k j 1 k j 1 2 3 m while only the u k is implemented after the implementation of optimal control action u k the state of the system will change at this time the state space model can be updated with feedback information and then a new round of prediction and optimal control action calculation is carried out 2 2 the integrator delay model for mpc in canal water level control it s the id model most used as an internal model for the mpc in canal water level control the id model assumes that the water level deviation of a canal pool is a linear function of the flow rate change and the upstream flow change has a delay effect on the water level at the downstream end of the canal pool therefore the id model calculation can be expressed as schuurmans et al 1995 4 d e d t 1 a s q in t t d q out t q offtake t where e is the water level deviation at the downstream end of the pool qin t td is the inflow deviation to the backwater section with delay time td qout t is the downstream outflow deviation qofftake t is the offtake flow deviation and as is the average storage area the characteristics td and as can be calculated by applying the system identification technique litrico and fromion 2004 weyer 2001 under different flow conditions the values of td and as may vary slightly as the water surface profile changes with the flow rate previous studies have demonstrated that by reducing the sensitivity of the control algorithm to the water level deviation as much as possible or choosing a smaller as and a larger td the risk of failure of the control method can be reduced at the cost of lowering the optimal control effect meanwhile wahlin 2004 the water level and water level change rate in the id model can be updated according to the real time water level monitoring information then the id model can be written in the state space representation when the id model is written in the state space expression the delay time is converted into a delay step with the following equation 5 t k t d t s where the delay step tk is an integer t s is the control interval in the control system if td is smaller than ts the tk should be set to 1 rather than 0 as tk equals 0 means that the studied system has no time delay which will result in lousy control result if the time delay step of a canal pool is 2 the discrete form of the state space model of the canal pool can be expressed as e k 1 δ e k 1 δ q in k δ q in k 1 δ q in k 2 1 1 0 0 t s a s 0 1 0 0 t s a s 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 e k δ e k δ q in k 1 δ q in k 2 δ q in k 3 0 0 1 0 0 δ q in k t s a s t s a s 0 0 0 δ q out k 6 e k δ e k 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 e k δ e k δ q in k 1 δ q in k 2 δ q in k 3 where δ q in k is the element in the input vector u meaning the increment of the inflow with δ q in k q in k 1 q in k δ q out k shows the increment of the outflow then a water level deviation prediction is carried out with the state space model of the id model the objective function of mpc in water level control s expressed as 7 min u k j i 1 n j 1 p q i j e i k j k e i r k j k 2 j 1 m r i j δ q i k j 1 k 2 where e i is the water level deviation at the downstream point of pool i e i r is the reference trajectory of e i which can be set to zero to keep the water level stable δ q i is the inflow increment of pool i the elements in q and r provide a trade off between minimizing the water level deviations and minimizing flow changes the larger the value of the elements in q is the more aggressive the flow control the optimization problem of eq 7 is a typical quadratic programming problem which is solved by the standard matlab function quadprog in this paper s case the control variable in the state space model is the inflow increment the flow adjustment command is then converted into the gate opening adjustment command with the gate flow equation swamee 1992 2 3 constraint methods to reduce the gate control times 2 3 1 control interval constraint method if there is a considerable control interval need one straightforward way is to set the control interval to the desired control interval in this condition to use the discrete state space equations with the mpc the delay step of pools with short time delay should be set to be 1 leading to a decrease in prediction accuracy and control effect in this paper a small control interval is still used to keep the prediction precision for the internal model and a control interval constraint method can be used to increase the control interval if the desired control interval is l times the used control interval of the internal model the flow control actions δ q k in control variables u k can be strictly limited to be 0 if the control step is not a multiple of l so this flow change constraint can be added to constraint eq 3 with 8 0 δ q k j 1 k 0 if k j 1 l 0 thus the constraints of the control variables are still in the form of eq 3 the flow control interval can be increased to the desired interval it should be noted that a small flow control action cannot be executed due to the existence of the dead band of check gates in this way the control interval may be larger than the desired control interval when the generated flow control action is small in this study the accumulator method proposed by zheng et al 2019 was adopted to handle the dead band constraints thus when the value of the flow adjustment command is not enough to drive the gate movement this flow adjustment command is accumulated to the next moment when the gate opening change corresponding to this accumulated flow adjustment command can be executed the gate action is executed and the accumulated flow control command reset to zero this check gate dead band will reduce the effect of predictive control such as making the water level unable to stabilize at the target water level but it also avoids gate actions at every calculation step 2 3 2 water level soft constraint method water level soft constraint is usually used to limit the controlled the level to the allowable range hashemy et al 2013 used the this soft constraint to limit the water level during significant water flow change by introducing a virtual input signal u in the input vector u and a virtual state e in the state vector x 9 u k e k e min e k e max e max e k e max e min e k e min where e max and emin are upper and lower values of the water level deviation constraints respectively the virtual state can be expressed with e k e k u k thus the u k is limited within the constraint in the form of eq 9 then e k can be considered in the objective function in eq 7 with this soft constraint used the deviation part beyond the water level deviation constraint is set with an extra weight of the state e k thus the weight of the part beyond the allowable range is the sum of weight of e k and weight of e k by setting e k a significant weight the water level shall not exceed range as much as possible in this paper the water level soft constraint method is used to deduce the weight of minor water deviations the weight of water level deviation is added to the e k rather than e k so minor water level deviations are not controlled or controlled slightly and to set tremendous weight for water level deviation beyond the allowable range more virtual deviation states e k and corresponding u k can be introduced in the state space model 2 4 comparison methods an mpc control method using a small control interval with no constraint method can be used for comparison referred to as method 1 an mpc method with control interval constraint is used for comparison referred to as method 2 an mpc control method with water level soft constraint is used for comparison referred to as method 3 the method in this paper with both constraint methods is referred to as method 4 these methods are used to compare and analyze the impact of the two constraint methods on the mpc model 3 case study 3 1 study scenario a simulation model of the beijing shijiazhuang section of the middle route of the south to north water diversion project mrp was selected to test the effectiveness of the control method in this paper the starting point of this canal system is near shijiazhuang city the endpoint is near beijing city shown in fig 2 this canal system is regarded as an independent canal system and the effects from the upstream part of the mrp are ignored the length of canal pools in the study area ranges from 10 km to 27 km covering the length range of all canal pools in the mrp there is a target water level upstream of every check gate in the regulation of the project it is generally required that the regulation interval of each check gate should be greater than 2 h as far as possible during normal regulation the water level deviations should be maintained smaller than 0 15 m in pools 1 12 and smaller than 0 1 m in pool 13 simulation models of each pool were established separately to tune the hydraulic parameters therefore the measured value of the water level downstream of the check gate served as model boundaries the parameters were tuned to ensure that the water level upstream of the check gate is close to the measured water level the simulation models for each pool were also used to get the id model of canal pools the initial flow condition and the id model parameters of each pool are shown in table 1 the pools are initially steady and water levels at the control points are all at target water levels then control methods are implemented on this simulation model the control methods only obtain real time information of water levels and gate openings in the simulation model which can be monitored in the real world two kinds of disturbances are used to test the control methods the first one is the unknown slight delivery disturbance the second disturbance is the scheduled offtake flow change for unknown disturbances the flow change information is not contained in the id model while for scheduled disturbance the flow change information is predictable in the id model the disturbances are shown in fig 3 3 2 control method settings the delay time of id models ranges from 19 min to 76 min so the control interval is set to 0 5 h considering the precision of the internal model and the calculation workload of the control method as the control interval is set to be 0 5 h the desired interval is 2 h so the value of l is 4 in the control interval constraint in method 1 the flow change weight is set to 1 in r j the water level deviation weight is set to 13 for method 2 with control interval constraint as the control interval constraint limits the flexibility of flow adjustment the water level control effect will be relatively reduced hence the weight of the deviation needs to be increased appropriately and is set to 18 in method 3 with water level soft constraint method three virtual input signals and corresponding virtual deviation states e 1 e 2 e 3 are used when the absolute value of water level deviation is larger than 0 08 m in pools 1 12 or 0 05 m in pool 13 there is a virtual deviation state e 1 in each pool when the absolute value is larger than 0 15 m in pools 1 12 or 0 1 m in pool 13 there is a virtual deviation state e 2 in each pool when the absolute value is larger than 0 35 m in pools 1 12 or 0 15 m in pool 13 which is considered as an emergency condition there is a virtual deviation state e 3 in each pool the weight for water deviation e is set to be 0 while the weight for e 1 e 2 and e 3 are set to be 25 25 and 25 respectively thus the minor water level deviations are not controlled similarly in method 4 using both constraint methods the weights for e 1 e 2 and e 3 needs to be increased appropriately are all set to 30 the details of the parameter values are shown in table 2 3 3 results method 1 4 are first used in disturbance i in the first place with a 2 7 ghz computer processor the calculation time at each control step in method 1 4 is 4 s 4 s 8 s and 8 s respectively the water level constraint method will increase the optimization variables so the calculation time is longer in method 3 and method 4 the results of these methods in disturbance i are shown in figs 4 7 in figs 4 7 the deviations are controlled to the range of 0 15 m to 0 15 m proving the effectiveness of these control methods due to the different processes of the gate opening change the trends of the water level deviations under the control of these methods are also slightly different the gate control times with these methods in disturbance i are shown in table 3 in figs 4 and 5 the maximum and minimum water level deviations in all pools are almost the same and the change trends of the gate openings are also relatively close the main difference is that the control interval of each gate in fig 5 is larger than that in fig 4 and the control times of each gate are relatively less than those in fig 4 most remarkably the number of gate controls in pool 5 and pool 7 have been reduced from 17 in method 1 to 11 in method 2 in method 1 although the control interval is larger than 2 h with the dead band of check gate in pool 5 the use of gate control interval constraint in method 2 can increase the control interval further in pool 11 due to the large water level deviations in pools 10 12 there are many back and forth opening adjustments at small intervals in fig 4 the use of the control interval constraint method in fig 5 can decrease these back and forth opening adjustments when there is a small control interval with large deviations of several surrounding pools the gate control strategy may be implemented at each control step causing the water level to fluctuate significantly these fluctuations will interfere with the forecast of the changing trend of the water level which will lead to unreasonable back and forth gate opening adjustments while with the control interval constraint method used the perceived water level change trend is relatively stable as fluctuations have decreased a lot when the flow regulation step is reached thus the water level prediction is more accurate and the generated gate control strategy is more reasonable the water level deviation changing trends are different in figs 4 and 6 as the deviations are with different weights in method 1 and method 3 in fig 6 the total number of control times is 115 less than 139 in fig 4 it can be seen from table 4 that not all check gates in method 3 are less controlled than those in method 1 in pools 1 4 where there are minor deviations in fig 4 and significant deviations in fig 6 the number of gate control times in fig 6 is less while in pools 5 7 where there are all significant deviations in figs 4 and 6 the number of gate control times in fig 6 is even more the weight of significant deviation needs to be set to a larger value with the water level constraint method which causes the gate control times to increase with significant deviations in fig 6 the back and forth gate opening adjustments at small intervals in pool 5 pool 6 pool 9 and pool 10 are apparent in fig 7 the number of gate control times is the least as both constraint methods are used compared with the result in fig 6 these back and forth gate opening adjustments in pools 7 10 are reduced as the control interval increases the most significant change in fig 7 is that after 48 h there is almost no gate opening adjustment in pools 1 5 in figs 4 and 5 the water level deviation will be continuously controlled with minor deviations it can be expected that the gate controls in pools 1 5 are frequent in fig 0 6 the water level deviations in pools 1 5 after 48 h are within the safe range before the gate action gate action in these pools is likely to respond to the control action of gates in downstream pools 5 8 in fig 7 due to the addition of the control interval method these back and forth gate opening adjustments in pools 5 8 are eliminated so there is no corresponding gate control in pools 1 4 the add of the control interval constraint method greatly helps method 4 to reduce gate control times the total gate control times are 139 times and the total gate control times in methods 3 5 are 103 115 and 69 respectively a reduction of 25 23 and 60 a reasonable control method should have a predictive function and effectively deal with predictable disturbances then these methods are all used in disturbance ii the calculation time is the same in disturbance i with the methods the control results are shown in figs 8 11 in figs 8 11 the deviations are in or slightly beyond the range of 0 15 m to 0 15 m proving the effectiveness of these control methods similarly different gate opening adjustment processes lead to different deviation change trends the gate control times with these methods in disturbance ii are shown in table 4 in figs 8 and 9 the change trends of the gate openings are also relatively close and the control interval constraint method in fig 9 is able to reduce the gate control times most check gate control times are relatively minor in fig 0 9 except for the gate in pool 13 the reason is that the control interval of the gate in pool 13 is much longer than 2 h so the use of the control interval constraint method in method 2 cannot reduce the gate control times on the contrary the larger deviation weight in method 2 will increase the gate control times compared with the result in fig 8 using the water level constraint method in fig 0 10 does not effectively reduce the gate control times as the flow change disturbance is relatively tremendous in disturbance ii there are significant deviations in pools 5 13 the use of the water level constraint cannot exert its effect in reducing the demand for flow adjustment but a larger weight for deviation increases the back and forth gate opening adjustments in pools 11 and 12 in fig 10 apparent back and forth gate opening adjustments are apparent at small intervals the results of method 4 under two constraints are shown in fig 11 and it is indicated that the use of control interval constraints can decrease these back and forth adjustments thus the gate control times in pools 5 13 decrease compared with the result in fig 10 similarly in pools 1 4 where there are minor deviations the use of water level constraint helps to reduce the gate control times significantly after 48 h in fig 11 therefore the number of gate control in method 4 is 70 about 37 less than 112 in method 1 with no constraint method 4 discussion in mpc the control interval constraint method helps to increase the control interval thus those frequent small gate actions can be changed into significant actions with large control intervals moreover the use of the control interval constraint method helps to decrease the back and forth gate opening adjustments therefore the control interval constraint can increase the control interval and reduce the gate control times whether with large water level deviation or minor deviation the water level constraint method helps deduce the mpc method s sensitivity to minor water level deviations so that small flow control is generated in the case of a minor deviation due to the gate dead band these small flow changes need to be accumulated more times before they can be executed thus increasing the control interval however to maintain the control effect of mpc on significant disturbances a more considerable weight value needs to be assigned to the large water level deviation in the case of significant disturbances or large water level deviations the control of the mpc may be aggressive increasing the number of opening adjustments especially repeated back and forth adjustments thus the water level deviation constraint may only be practical under slight disturbances and minor water level deviations in the case of large disturbances the control effect of reducing the gate will decrease when the water level constraint and the control interval constraint methods are used the gate control times can be significantly reduced and the effect is better than using the water level constraint method or the control interval constraint method alone the control interval constraint can significantly reduce the possibility of back and forth gate opening adjustments caused by the water level constraint method the use of both constraints can eliminate the problem of excessive back and forth adjustments in the case of large water level deviations while also retain less sensitivity to minor water level deviations therefore the mpc with these two constraint methods can effectively increase the control interval and reduce the gate control times under large and small disturbances moreover the addition of these two constraint methods in mpc does not change the standard form of mpc so quadratic programming can still be used to solve optimization problems quickly using these constraint methods does not significantly increase computing time the calculation time at each control step is less than 10 s in method 1 4 therefore the method in this paper can be used for the real time predictive control of large scale cascaded canal pools 5 conclusions this study aimed to provide a predictive control method for multi cascade canal pools with large control interval demand a mpc method using control interval constraint and water level constraint method is proposed the main findings of the study are as follows 1 the use of constraint methods in this paper can reduce the gate control times by 60 and 37 respectively in the studied cases under mpc these constraint methods can sufficiently reduce the gate control times in both slight unknown disturbance and significant foreseen disturbance 2 the water level constraint method helps avoid unnecessary control of minor water level deviations but may lead to multiple back and forth adjustments to large deviations while the control interval constraint method can decrease these adjustments combining the two methods can increase the control interval and reduce gate control times 3 the addition of the two constraints does not change the standard form of mpc so the optimal problem can still be solved quickly through quadratic programming the method proposed in this paper has reasonable practicability in multi cascade canal pools credit authorship contribution statement lingzhong kong conceptualization formal

3914,quantification of affecting factors on river regime changes can be greatly helpful for water resources planning and management in the basin both anthropogenic changes and climate variability have affected rivers regime and led to considerable social and economic impacts observations in most parts of the world indicate that the hydrological cycle has been influenced by human activity besides of climate variability in this study 9 different methods which are divided into three general categories have been used to determine the impact of anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff changes in two watersheds in the central plateau of iran including ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds the results indicate that climate variability plays a dominant role in runoff decline in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed accounting for 60 2 of the total decrease while human activities accounted for 39 8 in the javanmardi watershed anthropogenic changes played a dominant role in runoff decline accounting for 77 1 on average in comparison 22 9 on average of the decrease was attributable to climate variability sensitivity analysis of the annual mean runoff shows that precipitation plays a key role in runoff changes in both study areas after precipitation changes in potential evapotranspiration and temperature have the greatest impact on the annual mean runoff in the studied watersheds respectively comparison of the different applied methods indicate that elasticity based methods are the fastest and intuitive methods to investigate the impacts of anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff changes despite this using different methods should be taken into account keywords climate variability anthropogenic changes elasticity based methods sensitivity analysis runoff regime changes 1 introduction both climate variability and anthropogenic changes have affected hydrological cycle according to the observational evidence from a number of basins in four corners of the world huntington 2006 climate variability has affected the variability of meteorological factors especially precipitation and temperature eslamian 2014 nazari tahroudi et al 2019 and has increased the frequency of extreme value events rani and sreekesh 2018 variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system internal variability or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external factors external variability the difference between climate variability and climate change goes back to a period of time so that climate variability considers changes thatoccur within smaller timeframes the global mean surface temperature increased by 0 87 c from 2006 to 2015 in comparison with the historical average over the period 1850 1900 and it is projected to increase 1 5 c between 2030 and 2052 if temperature continues to rise at the current rate ipcc 2018 runoff in the basin is influenced directly and indirectly by changes in meteorological factors dam 2003 tabatabaei et al 2020 on the other hand the effect of anthropogenic changes such as urbanization deforestation desertification dam construction and reservoir operation on different elements of hydrological regime and water resources is taken for granted haghighi et al 2014 milly et al 2005 rahnama and mirabbasi 2010 sharifi et al 2021 around the globe especially in arid and semi arid regions declining runoff can lead to critical social and ecological issues fazel et al 2017 haghighi and kløve 2017 water resources in these regions are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change than other regions torabi haghighi et al 2020b zamani et al 2017 furthermore per capita water availability is declining in these areas due to population growth and water dependent economic development as the manifestations of anthropogenic changes un water 2008 in this regard determining the contribution of each of the factors of climate variability and human activities can provide useful information for managers and planners to design appropriate strategies to adapt to the runoff regime changes and reduce its adverse effects runoff plays a crucial role in meeting environmental and human demands especially in hot seasons investigation of runoff changes in a basin not only reflects the characteristics of the river system but also indicates the structural and environmental changes in the basin sharifi et al 2017 yao et al 2015 human activities affect runoff directly e g land use change and indirectly e g increased greenhouse gas emissions assessment and quantification of anthropogenic changes and climate variability effects on runoff are crucial for water resources management in a basin addressing the impact of anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff changes separately can be contributed to the improvement development and modification of measures planned for adaptation to climate change torabi haghighi et al 2020a wang 2014 in recent years numerous studies have been done to investigate the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability impacts on long term average change in runoff bao et al 2019 zeng et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 the methods for separating anthropogenic change and climate variability impact on runoff can be divided into three groups including empirical methods gao et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 elasticity based methods gao et al 2016 wu et al 2017 ye et al 2013 and hydrological modeling renner et al 2012 tomer and schilling 2009 zeng et al 2015 zuo et al 2014 simple linear regression and double mass curve methods are the most common empirical methods gao et al 2011 applied the double mass curve method to investigate streamflow changes in the middle reach in yellow river during 1985 2008 they reported that human activities played a major role in streamflow reduction by 72 which was much stronger than the precipitation contribution rate by 28 zhao et al 2015 using simple linear regression attributed that 72 of runoff decrease in the yangtze river between 1953 and 2010 was due to climate change nonparametric methods and analytical methods based on the budyko hypothesis are the most common elasticity based methods that are broadly utilized to determine the relative contribution of human activities and climate change on runoff changes mwangi et al 2016 used budyko hypotheses to separate the respective contribution of drivers to change in runoff in the upper catchment of mara river basin in kenya they found that land use change as the manifestation of human activities in the catchment was the main driver of change in runoff accounting for 97 5 of the change wu et al 2017 used elasticity based methods and budyko hypothesis to investigate the hydrological response to climate change and human activities in the yanhe river basin as one of the yellow river s sub basins china from 1972 to 2011 they reported that climate change played a key role in decreasing runoff in the basin with a rate of 54 1 of the total decrease in runoff they also attributed 45 9 of the reduction of runoff to the effects of human activities various hydrological models have been developed during the last decades to simulate runoff and hydrological cycle in a basin ren et al 2020 sharifi et al 2017 the impacts of climate variability on runoff changes can be evaluated by comparing simulations driven by different climate variables in different periods wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 zuo et al 2014 kakaei lafdani et al 2020 applied hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model to quantify different types of natural and human droughts in the kiakola and eskandari catchments in iran they reported that although both catchments have different climate conditions human activities had a negative impact on the hydrological system and played a major role in longer and more severe drought investigating most studies on the impact of human activities and climate variability on runoff change shows that most of them use a single method or appliy different methods in the same catchment generally using different methods in the same study area often has a significant degree of uncertainty to increase confidence multiple methods have been applied to assess the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on runoff changes liang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 there is an inconsistency in the obtained results using multiple methods because of variable complex effects of human activity and climate variability on runoff changes and geographical condition therefore it is essential to have an in depth and meticulous understanding and insight into the study area to determine the effects of human activity and climate variability on runoff changes runoff sensitivity to climate variables can be evaluated by two main approaches including hydrological models that apply different climate scenarios and elasticity based models that use long term observed data bao et al 2019 the hydrological models approach has been applied broadly worldwide arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 lopez et al 2012 montanari et al 2013 renner et al 2012 siam and eltahir 2017 geshnigani et al 2021 recently some researchers applied elasticity based models and budyko hypotheses budyko 1974 to investigate the runoff sensitivity to climate variables hasan et al 2018 used the budyko framework in the nile river basin they reported that a 10 decrease in precipitation results in a decrease in runoff from 19 to 30 in tropical and arid zones respectively in comparison a 10 increase in precipitation leads to an increase in the runoff between 14 and 22 in tropical and arid zones respectively the impacts of the potential evapotranspiration formula are greater for wet regions than for dry regions kingston et al 2009 sheffield et al 2012 sperna weiland et al 2012 therefore its impacts should be taken into account dakhlaoui et al 2020 reported that runoff in semi arid areas like northern tunisia is not sensitive to potential evapotranspiration estimates but precipitation is the most sensitive climate variable in the study area in this study we used nine methods that have been classified into three groups and applied them in two watersheds in the central plateau of iran including ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds this approach enables us to discuss the advantages disadvantages and characteristics of all the methods therefore the novel aspects of this study are as follows 1 to review the nine different methods in all its aspect and explain the respective merits demerits and limitations 2 to apply and compare the performance of the different methods in the selected watersheds and determine the relative contribution of anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff changes and 3 to characterize the sensitivity of runoff to different climatic variables including temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration 2 materials and methods 2 1 baseline period the first step to ascertain the impacts of human activities and climate variability on runoff changes is determining the baseline period there are two approaches for determining the baseline period i the human designated miao et al 2011 xu et al 2006 and ii the abrupt change detecting liang et al 2015 in the human designated an available period with the lowest human interference will be considered a baseline period and the post baseline period is selected based on observations and experience in this approach the baseline period is selected subjectively and due to the lack of a standard to determine the change point it may lead to different results in the second approach the period before an abrupt change point in meteorological and hydrological time series will be considered as the baseline period in this approach a point is selected in the time series as the beginning of human activity in a mathematical way this method is more scientific than the human designated method because it uses statistical criteria to determine the change point the mann kendal kendall 1975 and pettitt pettitt 1979 tests are the most common methods to detect the abrupt change point which applied in different studies hekmatzadeh et al 2020 kakaei lafdani et al 2020 liang et al 2015 sattari et al 2020 wu et al 2017 in this study we used pettitt test pettitt 1979 to determine the significant abrupt change point in the flow time series a period before and after the change point is considered baseline and variation periods respectively in addition we applied a modified mann kendall test mmk hamed and rao 1998 which remove all significant autocorrelations in the time series data to analyze the trend of the time series including runoff precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration during the time span 2 2 conceptual framework for determining the impacts of anthropogenic changes and climate variability to assess the contribution of anthropogenic changes and climate variability in runoff changes the change in annual mean runoff amr in the variation and baseline periods was compared accordingly the change in annual flow between two periods variation and baseline consists two parts regarding to anthropogenic changes and climate variability 1 δ q δ q var δ q bl δ q ant δ q clm where δ q is the change in the amr δ q var and δ q bl are the change in the amr during the variation and baseline periods respectively further δ q ant and δ q clm are the change in the amr due to the impacts of anthropogenic changes and climate variability respectively to assess the contribution of anthropogenic changes δ q ant and climate variability δ q clm on runoff changes we applied three approaches fig 2 including empirical methods elasticity based methods and hydrological modeling 2 3 empirical methods simple linear regression and double mass curve methods are the most common empirical methods to determine the impacts of human activities and climate variability on runoff wu et al 2017 it includes three steps i calculate a linear regression between the amr and the precipitation in the baseline period 2 q bl a bl p bl b bl where a bl and b bl are the slope and the intercept of the linear regression ii the amr in the variation period q rec is reconstructed by applying the precipitation in the variation period p var in linear regression 3 q rec a bl p var b bl and iii the contribution of human activities on changes in runoff can be calculated as follow 4 δ q ant q rec q var finally δ q clm can be calculated using eq 1 in the double mass curve method the cumulative runoff and precipitation in the baseline and variation periods are used to create regression equations after the calculation of cumulative runoff the amr in the variation period can be projected finally the impacts of human activities and climate variability on the runoff changes is calculated by using eqs 1 and 4 2 4 hydrological modeling in recent years hydrological models have been widely used to investigate runoff changes in basins worldwide wu et al 2017 in order to determine the contribution of human activities and climate variability on runoff alteration the applied model in this study swat model is calibrated for the baseline period then the contribution of climate variability is calculated as wu et al 2017 5 δ q climate q variation model q baseline model where q variation model and q baseline model are the simulated amr during the baseline and the variation periods respectively after that δ q human can be determined by using eq 1 in this study the swat model as a semi distributed hydrological model arnold 1994 is used to simulate runoff in the ghaleh shahrokh between 1987 and 2016 and the javanmardi watersheds from 1995 to 2016 this model was developed to investigate the impact of land use changes as the manifestation of human activities on runoff in the basin abbaspour et al 2009 this model includes the procedures to describe how climate variables including temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration affect runoff generation therefore is also used to investigate climate change impacts on runoff we used arc swat 2012 where the arcgis 10 2 environment is used for modelling development after the modelling the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 software is applied for parameter optimization after the calibration the obtained results are compared by using the performance criteria including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr moriasi et al 2007 recommend that three quantitative statistics facilitate model evaluation in terms of the accuracy of simulated data in comparison with measured flow and constituent values including nse pbias and rsr they stated that model simulation could be judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 pbias 25 and rsr 0 70 2 5 elasticity based methods runoff q in the watershed can be expressed as a function of precipitation p potential evapotranspiration etp and characteristics of the watershed v as follows 6 q f p et p v any change in these variables can be affected runoff thus changes in runoff δ q can be expressed as follows 7 δ q q p δ p q et p δ et p q v δ v where δ p δ et p and δ v are the change in annual mean precipitation potential evapotranspiration and characteristics of the watershed respectively any change in the watershed characteristics like land use is an anthropogenic change contribution while the change in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can be assumed as climate variability impact thus the contribution of climate variability can be obtained as follows 8 δ q climate q p δ p q et p δ et p schaake 1990 proposed the climate elasticity of runoff ε as follows 9 ε q q x x where x is climate variable e g precipitation or evapotranspiration by using the term of climate elasticity eq 7 can be rewritten as follows 10 δ q climate ε p δ p p ε et p δ et p et p q where ε p and ε et p are the elasticities of runoff to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively 2 5 1 nonparametric methods the climate elasticity can be estimated using the median statistic sankarasubramanian et al 2001 developed a nonparametric method to estimate climate elasticity directly from the data as follows 11 ε m e d i a n q i q q x i x x where q and x are the long term runoff and climate variable means respectively ε is the nonparametric estimate of ε for runoff zheng et al 2009 proposed another nonparametric method by rearranging eq 9 and estimated the elasticity of runoff using the least square estimator as follows 12 ε x x q x i x q i q x i x 2 ρ x q c q c x where c q and c x are the variation coefficients of q and x respectively and ρ x q is the coefficient of correlation between x and q 2 5 2 budyko hypotheses the climate elasticity of runoff can be estimated using the long term water balance as below 13 p et a q δ s where et a is the actual evapotranspiration q is runoff and δ s is the change in water storage which can be assumed to be zero on a multi year scale budyko 1974 defined aridity index φ as the ratio of the potential evapotranspiration to the precipitation as follows 14 φ et p p he also assumed that the actual evapotranspiration et a is a function of the aridity index as follows 15 et a p f φ budyko 1974 also defined f φ as the evaporative index which is the ratio of the actual evapotranspiration to the precipitation f φ et a p the relationship between aridity and evaporative indexes as known as budyko curve fig s1 in sm two spaces have been introduced in the curve including energy limited and water limited spaces in the energy limited space φ 1 all incident precipitation does not evaporate due to limitation of available energy therefore the basin produces runoff in contrast in the water limited space φ 1 all precipitation evaporates and water plays a limiting factor for more information about the budyko curve and its details please refer to dey and mishra 2017 by combination climate elasticity for p ε p q q p p and et p ε et p q q et p et p with eq 13 we can derive the precipitation elasticity of runoff as 16 ε p 1 φ f φ 1 f φ ε p ε et p 1 where f φ represents the derived function of f φ the details derivation of ε p is presented in the supplementary materials sm accordingly four different forms of f φ has been recommended table 1 2 6 sensitivity analysis from eq 15 the change in actual evapotranspiration can be calculated as 17 δ et a f φ δ p δ φ f φ p where δ φ is the change in the aridity index which can be calculated as 18 δ φ δ et p p φ p δ p the change in runoff δ q from eq 13 is as follows 19 δ q δ et a δ p by combination of eq 19 eq 17 and eq 18 change in runoff can be rewritten as 20 δ q δ p 1 f φ φ f φ f φ δ et p by substituting eq 15 in eq 13 q can be rewritten as 21 q p 1 f φ by dividing eq 20 to eq 21 and rearranging the obtained equation the change in runoff can be expressed as arora 2002 22 δ q q δ p 1 f φ φ f φ f φ δ et p p 1 f φ δ p p 1 β δ et p et p β where β is the sensitivity index which can be computed as 23 β φ f φ 1 f φ if β 1 the runoff sensitivity is classified as high conversely when β 1 the runoff sensitivity is classified low hasan et al 2018 furthermore runoff coefficient rc can be written as a function of evaporative index as follows 24 rc q p p et a p 1 et a p 1 e i 1 f φ according to the table 1 there are several methods to calculate f φ grijsen et al 2013 applied pike equation and calculated β as a function of rc as follows 25 β 2 3 r c r c 2 according to the sensitivity index β definition in eq 23 the precipitation elasticity of runoff eq 16 can be rewritten as 26 ε p 1 φ f φ 1 f φ 1 β ε p ε et p 1 in addition the potential evapotranspiration elasticity of runoff can be calculated as 27 ε et p β additionally the temperature t elasticity of runoff can be expressed as grijsen et al 2013 28 ε t δ q q δ t t ε et p t t 17 8 β t t 17 8 if the mean temperature i e t 9 6 of the watershed is replaced in eq 27 ε t can be written as 29 ε t 0 35 β finally total elasticity can be expressed as 30 ε total 1 β 0 35 β 1 0 65 β 2 7 case studies 2 7 1 ghaleh shahrokh watershed the ghaleh shahrokh watershed with an area of 1397 1 km2 and elevation between 2066 m and 3901 m above mean sea level is located upstream of the zayandeh rud dam this watershed is one of the two main tributaries of the zayandeh rud river which provides about 90 of the surface water in the zayandeh rud river fig 1 since the 1950s three water transfer projects have been completed to increase the water supply for various purposes in the zayandeh rud river basin out of these two of operating water transfer projects i e kuhrang tunnel no 1 and 2 are located in ghaleh shahrokh watershed which transfer 543 mcm to zayandeh rud river basin annually the annual mean precipitation in this watershed varies from about 1400 mm in the mountains to 400 mm in the flow measurement station as such the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and temperature are 1580 mm and 9 5 c respectively farsi and mahjouri 2019 in this study we used monthly flow data 1986 to 2016 from the ghaleh shahrokh gauge 50 27 n and 32 39 e which were obtained from the esfahan regional water company esrw to investigate the impacts of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes in the watershed further precipitation data from 5 stations i e farsan ben heydari chelgerd and ghaleh shahrokh and monthly meteorological data recorded at the chelgerd synoptic station including maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and number of sunshine hours were collected from the islamic republic of iran meteorological organization irimo 2 7 2 javanmardi watershed the javanmardi watershed is one the sub basin of the khan mirza river basin and covers an area of about 380 6 km2 the watershed elevation ranges from 1747 m to 2992 m above mean sea level fig 1 the annual mean precipitation varies in the watershed about from 400 mm to 750 mm about 540 mm per year the annual average potential evapotranspiration and temperature are 1346 mm and 15 7 c respectively the monthly flow data 1995 2016 from the zarrin derakht hydrometric station at the outlet of the watershed which was obtained from chaharmahal and bakhtiari regional water company chbrw was used to assess runoff changes in the watershed a such precipitation data from 6 stations i e dorahan aloni sardasht dahanoo bard and lordegan and monthly meteorological data were recorded at the lordegan synoptic station including maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and the number of sunshine hours were collected from the irimo in this study the essential maps for the swat model consisted of the digital elevation model dem land use information and soil type are obtained from the esrw and chbrw additionally the fao pm 56 allen et al 1998 was used to estimate potential evapotranspiration in the ghaleh sharokh and javanmardi watersheds this method is the most appropriate method to estimate etp over various climates has widely used in recent decades in different parts of the world itenfisu et al 2003 sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 3 results 3 1 baseline period determination table 2 provides the trend of temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff from mmk in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds the results in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed indicate that there is no significant trend in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration however the temperature has increased substantially at 1 significance level additionally runoff in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed has decreased at 1 confidence level in the javanmardi watershed temperature and potential evapotranspiration have increased substantially at 1 and 5 respectively as such there is no significant trend in precipitation nevertheless runoff has declined substantially at 1 significance level the results of the pettitt test 1987 2016 in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed reveal that an abrupt change was occurred in the temperature and runoff time series in 1996 while no abrupt change was detected for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration fig 3 therefore two time periods were determined including the baseline period 1987 1996 and variation period 1997 2016 in the javanmardi watershed the results of the pettit test show that an abrupt change occurred in the potential evapotranspiration and runoff time series in 2003 and an abrupt change in temperature in 2001 however no abrupt change was detected in precipitation fig 4 therefore 2003 was selected as abrupt change and the period 1995 2003 and 2004 2016 were determined as the baseline and variation periods respectively comprising two time periods in the study areas indicates that temperature has increased about 0 84 c about 9 3 and 0 46 c about 3 during the variation period in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds respectively precipitation and amr in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed have declined by 14 5 185 mm and 30 3 15 39 m3s 1 respectively as such in the javanmardi watershed precipitation and amr have decreased by 2 3 14 6 mm and 53 3 78 m3s 1 respectively 3 2 impacts anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff the results of two empirical methods including simple linear regression and double mass curve in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed show that the average reconstructed runoff for the two mentioned methods will be 43 4 and 41 9 m3s 1 respectively by considering the observed flow 37 1 m3s 1 in this period the relative contribution of climate variability was obtained 59 3 and 69 3 respectively therefore climate variability played a dominant role in the runoff decline in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed based on these methods further in the javanmardi watershed the average reconstructed runoff using the simple linear regression and double mass curve methods was obtained 6 4 and 9 1 m3s 1 respectively the relative contribution of climate variability in the watershed was calculated at 12 6 and 8 5 respectively in addition the relative contribution of human activities in decline in the runoff was estimated at 87 4 and 91 5 as a result human activities played a significant role in the runoff decrease in the javanmardi watershed the results of budyko hypotheses based methods also show that the role of climate variability in decreasing the runoff is more than anthropogenic changes in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed the relative contribution of human activities in decline in the runoff range from 21 8 ol dekop to 32 3 schreiber average 27 6 which decreased amr by about 4 2 m3 s on average during the variation period by contrast the average relative contribution of climate variability was about 72 4 range between 67 7 schreiber and 78 2 ol dekop the results of sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and zheng et al 2009 methods indicate that human activities had a dominant role in the decline of runoff accounting for 69 and 82 of the total decrease respectively table 3 appling budyko hypothesis based methods had different results in the javanmardi watershed compared with the ghaleh shahrokh watershed and indicate that human activities played a crucial role in the runoff decline the relative contribution of human activities in runoff decline range from 73 1 schreiber to 79 9 pike average 76 8 which decreased amr about 2 7 m3 s on average in the variation period by contrast the average relative contribution of climate variability was about 23 2 range between 20 1 pike and 26 9 schreiber the results of non parametric methods in the javanmardi watershed indicate that human activities had a dominant role in the decline of runoff accounting for 61 1 and 70 8 of the total decrease respectively table 4 which was akin to the result of applying non parametric methods in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed the results of the swat model for the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds after calibration are shown in fig s2 and fig s3 respectively the performance evaluation of the model improved remarkably after calibration according to the performance criteria described by moriasi et al 2007 with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 62 percent bias pbias 5 86 and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr 0 16 in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed table s1 and nse 0 65 pbias 11 54 and rsr 0 34 in the javanmardi watershed table s2 based on the result of swat climate variability with 74 8 and human activities with 76 played a key role in the decline of runoff in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds respectively table 5 as seen out of nine applied methods in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed seven methods suggest that the climate variability played a significant role in the runoff reduction by about 70 4 on average in contrast two methods including sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and zheng et al 2009 show that 75 on average of the total streamflow decrease in the watershed was due to human activities fig 5 a in the javanmardi watershed all applied methods show that human activities played a dominant role in the runoff reduction by about 77 1 on average fig 5b 3 3 sensitivity analysis the relationship between the aridity and evaporative indexes budyko curve fig 6 a in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed illustrates most of the points are in the water limited space low precipitation in other words it reveals that drought has occurred in the watershed in most years during the study period hasan et al 2018 given that there is not any trend in etp table 2 the amounts of runoff in the watershed are highly dependent on changes in precipitation in contrast several points fall into the energy limited space i e in these years the amount of precipitation has been more than normal years and is exceeded than evapotranspiration the watershed is characterized by high sensitivity β 1 accounting for 1 2 in the variation period β has increased about 0 06 compared with the baseline period reaching about 1 22 additionally rc has declined by 9 in the variation period and has fallen from 0 32 to 0 29 therefore the potential of the watershed to generate runoff has decreased in the variation period in compared to baseline period in the javanmardi watershed all of the points are located in the water limited space low precipitation budyko curve fig 6b it reveals that precipitation is significantly lower than the amount of potential evapotranspiration given that there is a significant trend in etp table 2 the amounts of runoff in the watershed are dependent on changes in precipitation and influential variables on potential evapotranspiration the javanmardi watershed is characterized by high sensitivity β 1 accounting for 1 76 in the variation period β has increased about 0 03 compared with the baseline period reaching about 1 79 additionally rc has declined by 10 in the variation period as a result the potential of the watershed to generate runoff has decreased in the variation period in compared to baseline period similar to the ghaleh shahrokh watershed hasan et al 2018 reported that the arid and semi arid areas in the nile river basin are water limited area with high sensitivity the five year moving average of β changes periodically in response to wet and dry periods especially in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed fig 7 the higher value of β is belonged to dry periods and vice versa hasan et al 2018 the blue and red bands in the figure illustrate the historical wet and dry periods in the watersheds respectively consistent with high and low values of β the sensitivity analysis results of the runoff obtained using the amount of elasticities indicate that precipitation and temperature are the most and least sensitive variables in two study areas respectively fig 8 a 20 change in precipitation in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed eventuates in a change in runoff of 41 while temperature change by 20 leads to runoff change by 7 4 likewise a 20 change in precipitation in the javanamrdi watershed eventuates in a change in runoff by 55 while temperature change by 16 leads to runoff change by 7 4 hasan et al 2018 reported that a 10 decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in runoff of between 19 in the tropical zone and 30 in the arid zones in the nile river basin dakhlaoui et al 2020 found that the hydrological response of northern tunisian catchments which have semi arid to humid mediterranean climate has presented a high sensitivity to any change in precipitation they reported that the assessment of the elasticity of discharge to precipitation results in a hydrological multiplication factor of around two which means that any future change rate of precipitation would cause a change of twice this rate in discharge the results of this study are similar to our finding in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds 4 discussion the summary of the obtained results from 9 different methods in two study areas is illustrated in fig 5 there are stark differences between the principles and structure of these methods generally calculating the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability to runoff changes using empirical methods is easy however these methods do not consider the physical mechanisms of runoff generation these methods need long term hydrological and precipitation data to create regression equations accurately therefore most of the observed variation in runoff cannot be explained using the created regression in the baseline period in addition empirical methods just used precipitation to estimate runoff and the impact of other variables on runoff such as potential evapotranspiration is not investigated thus the results obtained by using empirical methods may have a significant degree of uncertainty however so many studies applied empirical methods to determine the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability to runoff changes kong et al 2016 miao et al 2011 these studies proposed that the empirical methods are more suitable in the large study area however in the current study the results of the empirical methods in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds as small regions were suitable and akin to the results of the other methods the results of elasticity based methods are similar to the results of swat models in two selected watersheds however in ghaleh shahrokh watershed non parametric methods are contrary to the results obtained using the other methods according to the obtained results climate variability with 59 1 on average and human activities with 73 6 on average played a dominant role in runoff decline in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds respectively the elasticity based methods and swat model results are similar using an integrated framework that includes a variety of methodologies should be more convincing than using just one or two methods elasticity based methods use precipitation and potential evapotranspiration unlike empirical methods and are the fastest methods to investigate the impacts of human activities and climate variability on runoff changes in addition these methods have a more physically realistic basis and are easy to calculate however estimating potential evapotranspiration which is difficult to monitor may increase the degree of uncertainty in these methods furthermore these methods do not take the impact of the inter related relationship between human activities and climate variability into account as such they do not consider inter annual and intra annual effects of climate change and climate variability gao et al 2016 physical based hydrological modelling requires a great deal of data which some of them may be difficult to obtain in addition it is a time consuming costly and complex approach compared with the previous methods nevertheless hydrological modeling techniques have been widely used in four corners of the world because they cover physical processes comprehensively further they can present information at different temporal and spatial scales using too much data may affect the quantitative results calculated via hydrological modeling and may increase uncertainty in addition there is uncertainty in model calibration and it is essential to reoptimize the model parameters again under new conditions new study area or different time period in this study the trend of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration was investigated in two study areas the results indicate that temperature in the ghaleh shahrkh watershed and temperature and potential evapotranspiration in the javanmardi watershed have increased significantly table 2 further an abrupt change was detected in the mentioned variables time series fig 3 and fig 4 the transferability ofhydrological model parameters between baseline and variation periods due to climate variability or climate change can be an important source of uncertainty coron et al 2014 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 5 conclusions determination of possible runoff changes in response to climate variability and anthropogenic changes is very substantial for water resources management especially in arid and semi arid regions this study used three main categories including empirical methods elasticity based methods and hydrological modeling to determine the relative contribution of anthropogenic changes and climate variability effects on runoff changes in two watersheds in the central plateau of iran including ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds we reviewed nine different methods and summarized their advantages disadvantages and characteristics the main results of the current study are as follow 1 climate variability played a key role in runoff decline in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed from 1987 to 2016 by 60 2 on average in addition 39 8 on average of the total runoff decrease was due to anthropogenic changes in contrast in the javanmardi watershed human activities played a dominant role in runoff decline accounting for 77 1 on average in comparison 22 9 on average of the decrease was attributable to climate variability runoff decline in the study areas stem from different agents therefore in each watershed different measures need to be taken into account to obviate runoff decline 2 the empirical methods in the two study areas were essentially consistent across the budyko hypotheses based methods and swat model it showed that they could apply in a small regional scale to determine the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability to runoff changes although they just use a small amount of data and precipitation to estimate runoff however the results of non parametric methods in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed were contrary to other methods results therefore non parametric methods were not suitable for specifying the impacts of climate variability and human activities on runoff in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed this conclusion is tenable for catchments similar to the ghaleh shahrokh watershed and we will focus on this in our future work 3 each method has its principles structure and characteristics therefore the results obtained by different methods should be compared and the most suitable method be selected according to the condition of the study area empirical methods need long term data and the results of these methods can be reliable if a suitable regression equation is detected for the baseline period elasticity based methods follow a fast inexpensive and straightforward approach to investigate runoff changes cause in a study area hydrological modeling covers physical processes but is problematic compared with the previous methods furthermore it can provide useful information across different temporal and spatial scales 4 precipitation and temperature are the most and least sensitive variables respectively in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds because no significant trend was observed in the precipitation timeseries in two study areas therefore any change in precipitation including change in precipitation type can affect runoff significantly especially in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed further the effects of change in temperature and potential evapotranspiration on runoff are not negligible as a result we will focus on potential parameter transferability

3914,quantification of affecting factors on river regime changes can be greatly helpful for water resources planning and management in the basin both anthropogenic changes and climate variability have affected rivers regime and led to considerable social and economic impacts observations in most parts of the world indicate that the hydrological cycle has been influenced by human activity besides of climate variability in this study 9 different methods which are divided into three general categories have been used to determine the impact of anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff changes in two watersheds in the central plateau of iran including ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds the results indicate that climate variability plays a dominant role in runoff decline in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed accounting for 60 2 of the total decrease while human activities accounted for 39 8 in the javanmardi watershed anthropogenic changes played a dominant role in runoff decline accounting for 77 1 on average in comparison 22 9 on average of the decrease was attributable to climate variability sensitivity analysis of the annual mean runoff shows that precipitation plays a key role in runoff changes in both study areas after precipitation changes in potential evapotranspiration and temperature have the greatest impact on the annual mean runoff in the studied watersheds respectively comparison of the different applied methods indicate that elasticity based methods are the fastest and intuitive methods to investigate the impacts of anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff changes despite this using different methods should be taken into account keywords climate variability anthropogenic changes elasticity based methods sensitivity analysis runoff regime changes 1 introduction both climate variability and anthropogenic changes have affected hydrological cycle according to the observational evidence from a number of basins in four corners of the world huntington 2006 climate variability has affected the variability of meteorological factors especially precipitation and temperature eslamian 2014 nazari tahroudi et al 2019 and has increased the frequency of extreme value events rani and sreekesh 2018 variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system internal variability or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external factors external variability the difference between climate variability and climate change goes back to a period of time so that climate variability considers changes thatoccur within smaller timeframes the global mean surface temperature increased by 0 87 c from 2006 to 2015 in comparison with the historical average over the period 1850 1900 and it is projected to increase 1 5 c between 2030 and 2052 if temperature continues to rise at the current rate ipcc 2018 runoff in the basin is influenced directly and indirectly by changes in meteorological factors dam 2003 tabatabaei et al 2020 on the other hand the effect of anthropogenic changes such as urbanization deforestation desertification dam construction and reservoir operation on different elements of hydrological regime and water resources is taken for granted haghighi et al 2014 milly et al 2005 rahnama and mirabbasi 2010 sharifi et al 2021 around the globe especially in arid and semi arid regions declining runoff can lead to critical social and ecological issues fazel et al 2017 haghighi and kløve 2017 water resources in these regions are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change than other regions torabi haghighi et al 2020b zamani et al 2017 furthermore per capita water availability is declining in these areas due to population growth and water dependent economic development as the manifestations of anthropogenic changes un water 2008 in this regard determining the contribution of each of the factors of climate variability and human activities can provide useful information for managers and planners to design appropriate strategies to adapt to the runoff regime changes and reduce its adverse effects runoff plays a crucial role in meeting environmental and human demands especially in hot seasons investigation of runoff changes in a basin not only reflects the characteristics of the river system but also indicates the structural and environmental changes in the basin sharifi et al 2017 yao et al 2015 human activities affect runoff directly e g land use change and indirectly e g increased greenhouse gas emissions assessment and quantification of anthropogenic changes and climate variability effects on runoff are crucial for water resources management in a basin addressing the impact of anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff changes separately can be contributed to the improvement development and modification of measures planned for adaptation to climate change torabi haghighi et al 2020a wang 2014 in recent years numerous studies have been done to investigate the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability impacts on long term average change in runoff bao et al 2019 zeng et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 the methods for separating anthropogenic change and climate variability impact on runoff can be divided into three groups including empirical methods gao et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 zhao et al 2014 elasticity based methods gao et al 2016 wu et al 2017 ye et al 2013 and hydrological modeling renner et al 2012 tomer and schilling 2009 zeng et al 2015 zuo et al 2014 simple linear regression and double mass curve methods are the most common empirical methods gao et al 2011 applied the double mass curve method to investigate streamflow changes in the middle reach in yellow river during 1985 2008 they reported that human activities played a major role in streamflow reduction by 72 which was much stronger than the precipitation contribution rate by 28 zhao et al 2015 using simple linear regression attributed that 72 of runoff decrease in the yangtze river between 1953 and 2010 was due to climate change nonparametric methods and analytical methods based on the budyko hypothesis are the most common elasticity based methods that are broadly utilized to determine the relative contribution of human activities and climate change on runoff changes mwangi et al 2016 used budyko hypotheses to separate the respective contribution of drivers to change in runoff in the upper catchment of mara river basin in kenya they found that land use change as the manifestation of human activities in the catchment was the main driver of change in runoff accounting for 97 5 of the change wu et al 2017 used elasticity based methods and budyko hypothesis to investigate the hydrological response to climate change and human activities in the yanhe river basin as one of the yellow river s sub basins china from 1972 to 2011 they reported that climate change played a key role in decreasing runoff in the basin with a rate of 54 1 of the total decrease in runoff they also attributed 45 9 of the reduction of runoff to the effects of human activities various hydrological models have been developed during the last decades to simulate runoff and hydrological cycle in a basin ren et al 2020 sharifi et al 2017 the impacts of climate variability on runoff changes can be evaluated by comparing simulations driven by different climate variables in different periods wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2015 zuo et al 2014 kakaei lafdani et al 2020 applied hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv model to quantify different types of natural and human droughts in the kiakola and eskandari catchments in iran they reported that although both catchments have different climate conditions human activities had a negative impact on the hydrological system and played a major role in longer and more severe drought investigating most studies on the impact of human activities and climate variability on runoff change shows that most of them use a single method or appliy different methods in the same catchment generally using different methods in the same study area often has a significant degree of uncertainty to increase confidence multiple methods have been applied to assess the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability on runoff changes liang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 zhao et al 2015 there is an inconsistency in the obtained results using multiple methods because of variable complex effects of human activity and climate variability on runoff changes and geographical condition therefore it is essential to have an in depth and meticulous understanding and insight into the study area to determine the effects of human activity and climate variability on runoff changes runoff sensitivity to climate variables can be evaluated by two main approaches including hydrological models that apply different climate scenarios and elasticity based models that use long term observed data bao et al 2019 the hydrological models approach has been applied broadly worldwide arnell and lloyd hughes 2014 lopez et al 2012 montanari et al 2013 renner et al 2012 siam and eltahir 2017 geshnigani et al 2021 recently some researchers applied elasticity based models and budyko hypotheses budyko 1974 to investigate the runoff sensitivity to climate variables hasan et al 2018 used the budyko framework in the nile river basin they reported that a 10 decrease in precipitation results in a decrease in runoff from 19 to 30 in tropical and arid zones respectively in comparison a 10 increase in precipitation leads to an increase in the runoff between 14 and 22 in tropical and arid zones respectively the impacts of the potential evapotranspiration formula are greater for wet regions than for dry regions kingston et al 2009 sheffield et al 2012 sperna weiland et al 2012 therefore its impacts should be taken into account dakhlaoui et al 2020 reported that runoff in semi arid areas like northern tunisia is not sensitive to potential evapotranspiration estimates but precipitation is the most sensitive climate variable in the study area in this study we used nine methods that have been classified into three groups and applied them in two watersheds in the central plateau of iran including ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds this approach enables us to discuss the advantages disadvantages and characteristics of all the methods therefore the novel aspects of this study are as follows 1 to review the nine different methods in all its aspect and explain the respective merits demerits and limitations 2 to apply and compare the performance of the different methods in the selected watersheds and determine the relative contribution of anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff changes and 3 to characterize the sensitivity of runoff to different climatic variables including temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration 2 materials and methods 2 1 baseline period the first step to ascertain the impacts of human activities and climate variability on runoff changes is determining the baseline period there are two approaches for determining the baseline period i the human designated miao et al 2011 xu et al 2006 and ii the abrupt change detecting liang et al 2015 in the human designated an available period with the lowest human interference will be considered a baseline period and the post baseline period is selected based on observations and experience in this approach the baseline period is selected subjectively and due to the lack of a standard to determine the change point it may lead to different results in the second approach the period before an abrupt change point in meteorological and hydrological time series will be considered as the baseline period in this approach a point is selected in the time series as the beginning of human activity in a mathematical way this method is more scientific than the human designated method because it uses statistical criteria to determine the change point the mann kendal kendall 1975 and pettitt pettitt 1979 tests are the most common methods to detect the abrupt change point which applied in different studies hekmatzadeh et al 2020 kakaei lafdani et al 2020 liang et al 2015 sattari et al 2020 wu et al 2017 in this study we used pettitt test pettitt 1979 to determine the significant abrupt change point in the flow time series a period before and after the change point is considered baseline and variation periods respectively in addition we applied a modified mann kendall test mmk hamed and rao 1998 which remove all significant autocorrelations in the time series data to analyze the trend of the time series including runoff precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration during the time span 2 2 conceptual framework for determining the impacts of anthropogenic changes and climate variability to assess the contribution of anthropogenic changes and climate variability in runoff changes the change in annual mean runoff amr in the variation and baseline periods was compared accordingly the change in annual flow between two periods variation and baseline consists two parts regarding to anthropogenic changes and climate variability 1 δ q δ q var δ q bl δ q ant δ q clm where δ q is the change in the amr δ q var and δ q bl are the change in the amr during the variation and baseline periods respectively further δ q ant and δ q clm are the change in the amr due to the impacts of anthropogenic changes and climate variability respectively to assess the contribution of anthropogenic changes δ q ant and climate variability δ q clm on runoff changes we applied three approaches fig 2 including empirical methods elasticity based methods and hydrological modeling 2 3 empirical methods simple linear regression and double mass curve methods are the most common empirical methods to determine the impacts of human activities and climate variability on runoff wu et al 2017 it includes three steps i calculate a linear regression between the amr and the precipitation in the baseline period 2 q bl a bl p bl b bl where a bl and b bl are the slope and the intercept of the linear regression ii the amr in the variation period q rec is reconstructed by applying the precipitation in the variation period p var in linear regression 3 q rec a bl p var b bl and iii the contribution of human activities on changes in runoff can be calculated as follow 4 δ q ant q rec q var finally δ q clm can be calculated using eq 1 in the double mass curve method the cumulative runoff and precipitation in the baseline and variation periods are used to create regression equations after the calculation of cumulative runoff the amr in the variation period can be projected finally the impacts of human activities and climate variability on the runoff changes is calculated by using eqs 1 and 4 2 4 hydrological modeling in recent years hydrological models have been widely used to investigate runoff changes in basins worldwide wu et al 2017 in order to determine the contribution of human activities and climate variability on runoff alteration the applied model in this study swat model is calibrated for the baseline period then the contribution of climate variability is calculated as wu et al 2017 5 δ q climate q variation model q baseline model where q variation model and q baseline model are the simulated amr during the baseline and the variation periods respectively after that δ q human can be determined by using eq 1 in this study the swat model as a semi distributed hydrological model arnold 1994 is used to simulate runoff in the ghaleh shahrokh between 1987 and 2016 and the javanmardi watersheds from 1995 to 2016 this model was developed to investigate the impact of land use changes as the manifestation of human activities on runoff in the basin abbaspour et al 2009 this model includes the procedures to describe how climate variables including temperature precipitation and evapotranspiration affect runoff generation therefore is also used to investigate climate change impacts on runoff we used arc swat 2012 where the arcgis 10 2 environment is used for modelling development after the modelling the sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup abbaspour et al 2007 software is applied for parameter optimization after the calibration the obtained results are compared by using the performance criteria including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr moriasi et al 2007 recommend that three quantitative statistics facilitate model evaluation in terms of the accuracy of simulated data in comparison with measured flow and constituent values including nse pbias and rsr they stated that model simulation could be judged as satisfactory if nse 0 50 pbias 25 and rsr 0 70 2 5 elasticity based methods runoff q in the watershed can be expressed as a function of precipitation p potential evapotranspiration

et p q v δ v where δ p δ et p and δ v are the change in annual mean precipitation potential evapotranspiration and characteristics of the watershed respectively any change in the watershed characteristics like land use is an anthropogenic change contribution while the change in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration can be assumed as climate variability impact thus the contribution of climate variability can be obtained as follows 8 δ q climate q p δ p q et p δ et p schaake 1990 proposed the climate elasticity of runoff ε as follows 9 ε q q x x where x is climate

elasticities of runoff to precipitation and potential evapotranspiration respectively 2 5 1 nonparametric methods the climate elasticity can be estimated using the median statistic sankarasubramanian

variable means respectively ε is the nonparametric estimate of ε for runoff zheng et al 2009 proposed another nonparametric method by rearranging eq 9 and estimated the elasticity of runoff using the least square estimator as follows 12 ε x x q x i x q i q x i x 2 ρ x q c q c x where c q and c x are the variation coefficients of q and x respectively and ρ x q is the coefficient of correlation between x and q 2 5 2 budyko hypotheses the climate elasticity of runoff can be estimated using the long term water balance as below 13 p et a q δ s where et a is the actual evapotranspiration q is runoff and δ s is the change in water storage which can be assumed to be zero on a multi year scale budyko 1974 defined aridity index φ as the ratio of the potential evapotranspiration to the precipitation as follows 14 φ et p p he also assumed that the actual evapotranspiration et a is a function of the aridity index as follows 15 et a p f φ budyko 1974 also defined f φ as the evaporative

been introduced in the curve including energy limited and water limited spaces in the energy limited space φ 1 all incident precipitation does not evaporate due to limitation of available energy

details please refer to dey and mishra 2017 by combination climate elasticity for p ε p q q p p and et p ε et p q q et p et p with eq 13 we can derive the precipitation elasticity of runoff as 16 ε p

been recommended table 1 2 6 sensitivity analysis from eq 15 the change in actual evapotranspiration can be calculated as 17 δ et a f φ δ p δ φ f φ p where δ φ is the change in the aridity index which

ghaleh shahrokh watershed the ghaleh shahrokh watershed with an area of 1397 1 km2 and elevation between 2066 m and 3901 m above mean sea level is located upstream of the zayandeh rud dam this watershed is one of the two main tributaries of the zayandeh rud river which provides about 90 of the surface water in the zayandeh rud river fig 1 since the 1950s three water transfer projects have been completed to increase the water supply for various purposes in the zayandeh rud river basin out of these two of operating water transfer projects i e kuhrang tunnel no 1 and 2 are located in ghaleh shahrokh watershed which transfer 543 mcm to zayandeh rud river basin annually the annual mean precipitation in this watershed varies from about 1400 mm in the mountains to 400 mm in the flow measurement station as such the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and temperature are 1580 mm and 9 5 c respectively farsi and mahjouri 2019 in this study we used monthly flow data 1986 to 2016 from the ghaleh shahrokh gauge 50 27 n and 32 39 e which were obtained from the esfahan regional water company esrw to investigate the impacts of climate variability and human activities on runoff changes in the watershed further precipitation data from 5 stations i e farsan ben heydari chelgerd and ghaleh shahrokh and monthly meteorological data recorded at the chelgerd synoptic station including maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and number of sunshine hours were collected from the islamic republic of iran meteorological organization irimo 2 7 2 javanmardi watershed the javanmardi watershed is one the sub basin of the khan mirza river basin and covers an area of about 380 6 km2 the watershed elevation ranges from 1747 m to 2992 m above mean sea level fig 1 the annual mean precipitation varies in the watershed about from 400 mm to 750 mm about 540 mm per year the annual average potential evapotranspiration and temperature are 1346 mm and 15 7 c respectively the monthly flow data 1995 2016 from the zarrin derakht hydrometric station at the outlet of the watershed which was obtained from chaharmahal and bakhtiari regional water company chbrw was used to assess runoff changes in the watershed a such precipitation data from 6 stations i e dorahan aloni sardasht dahanoo bard and lordegan and monthly meteorological data were recorded at the lordegan synoptic station including maximum and minimum air temperature relative humidity wind speed and the number of sunshine hours were collected from the irimo in this study the essential maps for the swat model consisted of the digital elevation model dem land use information and soil type are obtained from the esrw and chbrw additionally the fao pm 56 allen et al 1998 was used to estimate potential evapotranspiration in the ghaleh sharokh and javanmardi watersheds this method is the most appropriate method to estimate etp over various climates has widely used in recent decades in different parts of the world itenfisu et al 2003 sharifi and dinpashoh 2014 3 results 3 1 baseline period determination table 2 provides the trend of temperature precipitation potential evapotranspiration and runoff from mmk in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds the results in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed indicate that there is no significant trend in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration however the temperature has increased substantially at 1 significance level additionally runoff in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed has decreased at 1 confidence level in the javanmardi watershed temperature and potential evapotranspiration have increased substantially at 1 and 5 respectively as such there is no significant trend in precipitation nevertheless runoff has declined substantially at 1 significance level the results of the pettitt test 1987 2016 in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed reveal that an abrupt change was occurred in the temperature and runoff time series in 1996 while no abrupt change was detected for precipitation and potential evapotranspiration fig 3 therefore two time periods were determined including the baseline period 1987 1996 and variation period 1997 2016 in the javanmardi watershed the results of the pettit test show that an abrupt change occurred in the potential evapotranspiration and runoff time series in 2003 and an abrupt change in temperature in 2001 however no abrupt change was detected in precipitation fig 4 therefore 2003 was selected as abrupt change and the period 1995 2003 and 2004 2016 were determined as the baseline and variation periods respectively comprising two time periods in the study areas indicates that temperature has increased about 0 84 c about 9 3 and 0 46 c about 3 during the variation period in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds respectively precipitation and amr in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed have declined by 14 5 185 mm and 30 3 15 39 m3s 1 respectively as such in the javanmardi watershed precipitation and amr have decreased by 2 3 14 6 mm and 53 3 78 m3s 1 respectively 3 2 impacts anthropogenic changes and climate variability on runoff the results of two empirical methods including simple linear regression and double mass curve in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed show that the average reconstructed runoff for the two mentioned methods will be 43 4 and 41 9 m3s 1 respectively by considering the observed flow 37 1 m3s 1 in this period the relative contribution of climate variability was obtained 59 3 and 69 3 respectively therefore climate variability played a dominant role in the runoff decline in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed based on these methods further in the javanmardi watershed the average reconstructed runoff using the simple linear regression and double mass curve methods was obtained 6 4 and 9 1 m3s 1 respectively the relative contribution of climate variability in the watershed was calculated at 12 6 and 8 5 respectively in addition the relative contribution of human activities in decline in the runoff was estimated at 87 4 and 91 5 as a result human activities played a significant role in the runoff decrease in the javanmardi watershed the results of budyko hypotheses based methods also show that the role of climate variability in decreasing the runoff is more than anthropogenic changes in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed the relative contribution of human activities in decline in the runoff range from 21 8 ol dekop to 32 3 schreiber average 27 6 which decreased amr by about 4 2 m3 s on average during the variation period by contrast the average relative contribution of climate variability was about 72 4 range between 67 7 schreiber and 78 2 ol dekop the results of sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and zheng et al 2009 methods indicate that human activities had a dominant role in the decline of runoff accounting for 69 and 82 of the total decrease respectively table 3 appling budyko hypothesis based methods had different results in the javanmardi watershed compared with the ghaleh shahrokh watershed and indicate that human activities played a crucial role in the runoff decline the relative contribution of human activities in runoff decline range from 73 1 schreiber to 79 9 pike average 76 8 which decreased amr about 2 7 m3 s on average in the variation period by contrast the average relative contribution of climate variability was about 23 2 range between 20 1 pike and 26 9 schreiber the results of non parametric methods in the javanmardi watershed indicate that human activities had a dominant role in the decline of runoff accounting for 61 1 and 70 8 of the total decrease respectively table 4 which was akin to the result of applying non parametric methods in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed the results of the swat model for the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds after calibration are shown in fig s2 and fig s3 respectively the performance evaluation of the model improved remarkably after calibration according to the performance criteria described by moriasi et al 2007 with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 62 percent bias pbias 5 86 and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr 0 16 in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed table s1 and nse 0 65 pbias 11 54 and rsr 0 34 in the javanmardi watershed table s2 based on the result of swat climate variability with 74 8 and human activities with 76 played a key role in the decline of runoff in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds respectively table 5 as seen out of nine applied methods in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed seven methods suggest that the climate variability played a significant role in the runoff reduction by about 70 4 on average in contrast two methods including sankarasubramanian et al 2001 and zheng et al 2009 show that 75 on average of the total streamflow decrease in the watershed was due to human activities fig 5 a in the javanmardi watershed all applied methods show that human activities played a dominant role in the runoff reduction by about 77 1 on average fig 5b 3 3 sensitivity analysis the relationship between the aridity and evaporative indexes budyko curve fig 6 a in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed illustrates most of the points are in the water limited space low precipitation in other words it reveals that drought has occurred in the watershed in most years during the study period hasan et al 2018 given that there is not any trend in etp table 2 the amounts of runoff in the watershed are highly dependent on changes in precipitation in contrast several points fall into the energy limited space i e in these years the amount of precipitation has been more than normal years and is exceeded than evapotranspiration the watershed is characterized by high sensitivity β 1 accounting for 1 2 in the variation period β has increased about 0 06 compared with the baseline period reaching about 1 22 additionally rc has declined by 9 in the variation period and has fallen from 0 32 to 0 29 therefore the potential of the watershed to generate runoff has decreased in the variation period in compared to baseline period in the javanmardi watershed all of the points are located in the water limited space low precipitation budyko curve fig 6b it reveals that precipitation is significantly lower than the amount of potential evapotranspiration given that there is a significant trend in etp table 2 the amounts of runoff in the watershed are dependent on changes in precipitation and influential variables on potential evapotranspiration the javanmardi watershed is characterized by high sensitivity β 1 accounting for 1 76 in the variation period β has increased about 0 03 compared with the baseline period reaching about 1 79 additionally rc has declined by 10 in the variation period as a result the potential of the watershed to generate runoff has decreased in the variation period in compared to baseline period similar to the ghaleh shahrokh watershed hasan et al 2018 reported that the arid and semi arid areas in the nile river basin are water limited area with high sensitivity the five year moving average of β changes periodically in response to wet and dry periods especially in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed fig 7 the higher value of β is belonged to dry periods and vice versa hasan et al 2018 the blue and red bands in the figure illustrate the historical wet and dry periods in the watersheds respectively consistent with high and low values of β the sensitivity analysis results of the runoff obtained using the amount of elasticities indicate that precipitation and temperature are the most and least sensitive variables in two study areas respectively fig 8 a 20 change in precipitation in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed eventuates in a change in runoff of 41 while temperature change by 20 leads to runoff change by 7 4 likewise a 20 change in precipitation in the javanamrdi watershed eventuates in a change in runoff by 55 while temperature change by 16 leads to runoff change by 7 4 hasan et al 2018 reported that a 10 decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in runoff of between 19 in the tropical zone and 30 in the arid zones in the nile river basin dakhlaoui et al 2020 found that the hydrological response of northern tunisian catchments which have semi arid to humid mediterranean climate has presented a high sensitivity to any change in precipitation they reported that the assessment of the elasticity of discharge to precipitation results in a hydrological multiplication factor of around two which means that any future change rate of precipitation would cause a change of twice this rate in discharge the results of this study are similar to our finding in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds 4 discussion the summary of the obtained results from 9 different methods in two study areas is illustrated in fig 5 there are stark differences between the principles and structure of these methods generally calculating the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability to runoff changes using empirical methods is easy however these methods do not consider the physical mechanisms of runoff generation these methods need long term hydrological and precipitation data to create regression equations accurately therefore most of the observed variation in runoff cannot be explained using the created regression in the baseline period in addition empirical methods just used precipitation to estimate runoff and the impact of other variables on runoff such as potential evapotranspiration is not investigated thus the results obtained by using empirical methods may have a significant degree of uncertainty however so many studies applied empirical methods to determine the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability to runoff changes kong et al 2016 miao et al 2011 these studies proposed that the empirical methods are more suitable in the large study area however in the current study the results of the empirical methods in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds as small regions were suitable and akin to the results of the other methods the results of elasticity based methods are similar to the results of swat models in two selected watersheds however in ghaleh shahrokh watershed non parametric methods are contrary to the results obtained using the other methods according to the obtained results climate variability with 59 1 on average and human activities with 73 6 on average played a dominant role in runoff decline in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds respectively the elasticity based methods and swat model results are similar using an integrated framework that includes a variety of methodologies should be more convincing than using just one or two methods elasticity based methods use precipitation and potential evapotranspiration unlike empirical methods and are the fastest methods to investigate the impacts of human activities and climate variability on runoff changes in addition these methods have a more physically realistic basis and are easy to calculate however estimating potential evapotranspiration which is difficult to monitor may increase the degree of uncertainty in these methods furthermore these methods do not take the impact of the inter related relationship between human activities and climate variability into account as such they do not consider inter annual and intra annual effects of climate change and climate variability gao et al 2016 physical based hydrological modelling requires a great deal of data which some of them may be difficult to obtain in addition it is a time consuming costly and complex approach compared with the previous methods nevertheless hydrological modeling techniques have been widely used in four corners of the world because they cover physical processes comprehensively further they can present information at different temporal and spatial scales using too much data may affect the quantitative results calculated via hydrological modeling and may increase uncertainty in addition there is uncertainty in model calibration and it is essential to reoptimize the model parameters again under new conditions new study area or different time period in this study the trend of precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration was investigated in two study areas the results indicate that temperature in the ghaleh shahrkh watershed and temperature and potential evapotranspiration in the javanmardi watershed have increased significantly table 2 further an abrupt change was detected in the mentioned variables time series fig 3 and fig 4 the transferability ofhydrological model parameters between baseline and variation periods due to climate variability or climate change can be an important source of uncertainty coron et al 2014 2012 dakhlaoui et al 2019 5 conclusions determination of possible runoff changes in response to climate variability and anthropogenic changes is very substantial for water resources management especially in arid and semi arid regions this study used three main categories including empirical methods elasticity based methods and hydrological modeling to determine the relative contribution of anthropogenic changes and climate variability effects on runoff changes in two watersheds in the central plateau of iran including ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds we reviewed nine different methods and summarized their advantages disadvantages and characteristics the main results of the current study are as follow 1 climate variability played a key role in runoff decline in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed from 1987 to 2016 by 60 2 on average in addition 39 8 on average of the total runoff decrease was due to anthropogenic changes in contrast in the javanmardi watershed human activities played a dominant role in runoff decline accounting for 77 1 on average in comparison 22 9 on average of the decrease was attributable to climate variability runoff decline in the study areas stem from different agents therefore in each watershed different measures need to be taken into account to obviate runoff decline 2 the empirical methods in the two study areas were essentially consistent across the budyko hypotheses based methods and swat model it showed that they could apply in a small regional scale to determine the relative contribution of human activities and climate variability to runoff changes although they just use a small amount of data and precipitation to estimate runoff however the results of non parametric methods in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed were contrary to other methods results therefore non parametric methods were not suitable for specifying the impacts of climate variability and human activities on runoff in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed this conclusion is tenable for catchments similar to the ghaleh shahrokh watershed and we will focus on this in our future work 3 each method has its principles structure and characteristics therefore the results obtained by different methods should be compared and the most suitable method be selected according to the condition of the study area empirical methods need long term data and the results of these methods can be reliable if a suitable regression equation is detected for the baseline period elasticity based methods follow a fast inexpensive and straightforward approach to investigate runoff changes cause in a study area hydrological modeling covers physical processes but is problematic compared with the previous methods furthermore it can provide useful information across different temporal and spatial scales 4 precipitation and temperature are the most and least sensitive variables respectively in the ghaleh shahrokh and javanmardi watersheds because no significant trend was observed in the precipitation timeseries in two study areas therefore any change in precipitation including change in precipitation type can affect runoff significantly especially in the ghaleh shahrokh watershed further the effects of change in temperature and potential evapotranspiration on runoff are not negligible as a result we will focus on potential parameter transferability
