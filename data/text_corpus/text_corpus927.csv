4635,water infrastructure design and flood mitigation projects are currently based on a so called stationary assumption however this assumption has been challenged in recent years due to increased extreme weather potentially leading to the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of structural failures in the present study peak flow series from 158 gauging stations in the uk are analysed using both stationary and non stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location scale and shape gamlss framework nine candidate covariates are used for non stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non stationarity in each flood series very few stations are thus found to show temporal trends which suggests that time varying non stationary flood models may not always be suitable and the use of physically based covariates can provide better fitting models in particular the non stationary models using rainfall related covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding moreover two atmospheric circulation patterns namely the north atlantic oscillation nao and the east atlantic pattern were found to be closely related to the non stationarity of flooding at a number of stations unlike rainfall however the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant hence they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple covariate non stationary model besides a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally for the majority of stations 70 the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non stationary model than the use of a single covariate keywords non stationarity flood frequency analysis covariate uk gamlss 1 introduction floods are the most common and destructive natural disasters leading to numerous fatalities every year all over the world aside from direct mortality floods have indirect impacts such as widespread damage to crops property and infrastructure in this respect flood frequency analysis is a cornerstone of flood risk control hydraulic structure design and water resource management conventional flood frequency analysis is based on the assumption that flood time series are both stationary and independent the stationary assumption means that hydrological variables fluctuate randomly within an unchanging range of variability these variables in annual scale have time invariant probability density functions whose properties can be estimated from observed data records however in the real world climate change human interventions and land use changes are influencing the characteristics of these hydrological data such that their fluctuations may extend beyond the supposedly unchanging range of variability consequently the stationary assumption may be no longer valid milly et al 2008 2015 thus while water related planning has always been dependent and always should depend on the analysis of past data to inform projections of future conditions the present non stationary conditions mean that the past observed data may no longer provide all the necessary information concerning the future statistical behaviour of extreme precipitation and floods for example an increasing trend in the mean of a flow series could result in the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of failure of hydraulic structures and flood prevention measures conversely a decreasing trend could result in the overestimation of design quantiles and increased costs relating to the overdesign of infrastructures therefore the incorporation of non stationarity into hydrological frequency analysis has become an active area of research and is considered crucial for human adaptation to the uncertain and changing environment e g bayazit 2015 debele et al 2017a gilroy and mccuen 2012 hall et al 2014 kang et al 2019 khaliq et al 2006 koutsoyiannis 2006 leclerc and ouarda 2007 liu et al 2019 luke et al 2017 milly et al 2015 2008 villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 a variety of new concepts and techniques for non stationary hydrological frequency analysis have emerged in recent years most of those have been described in a review by salas et al 2018 focusing on hydrological design for protection against extreme events such as floods and low flows under non stationary conditions some government agencies are also in the process of updating their flood design guidelines to account for non stationarity e g hfawg 2017 madsen et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2014 however despite the increasing attention given to this subject there remains no generally agreed upon set of methods for performing flood frequency analysis under non stationary conditions nevertheless one approach is to attempt to remove the trend from the data before the analysis this is more suitable for contexts where the increase in the rate and size of extreme events can be explained by a trend in the mean e g in sea level analysis a more convenient and widely used approach is the use of a time varying model which assumes that the parameters of the distributions for frequency analysis vary as a function of time and provides a useful tool for reconstructing the non stationary behaviour of flood series however the explanatory variables from an only time dependent model may not always be suitable as trends can also be influenced by factors such as climate variability or anthropogenic activities for this reason several studies have explored the feasibility of incorporating external physically based covariates into models for non stationary flood frequency analysis faulkner et al 2020 lópez and francés 2013 machado et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 šraj et al 2016 yan et al 2017 villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 this approach has been shown not only to produce a better fitting model but also to help provide a better explanation for variations in flood regimes flood frequency analysis in the uk has generally followed the statistical procedures described in the flood estimation handbook feh institute of hydrology 1999 and subsequent updates kjeldsen et al 2005 2008 although these methods are based on the traditional assumptions of stationarity and flow time series independence some non stationary concepts and techniques have also been implemented in the uk for example harrigan et al 2018 used daily flow data from stations in the uk benchmark network ukbn to analyse high flow and low flow trends using the mann kendall mk test and pettitt test the study concluded that the near natural ukbn catchments allow for the detection of trends that are less affected by human disturbances to river flow regimes prosdocimi et al 2014 applied a linear regression model and a 2 parameter log normal distribution to explore trends in uk peak river flow using time and 99th percentile of daily rainfall values during a year or season to account for the potential non linearity of chronological trends that may be relevant to changes in precipitation subsequently prosdocimi et al 2015 used an index of urban extent as a covariate to investigate the impact of urbanisation upon flood extremes based on non stationary flood frequency models for two catchments in northern england the results indicated that the increasing urbanisation levels in these catchments had a significant effect upon flood extremes during the study period of 1970 2010 to describe the change in flood frequency in the uk griffin et al 2019 implemented a moving window approach to estimate how parameters of the generalised logistic distribution vary as a linear function of time most of the existing non stationary models including those used in the studies mentioned above comprise parameters that are linear functions of the covariate of interest although the assumption of linearity facilitates result interpretation and model fitting the above discussion has emphasised that it may not always be suitable moreover it is easier to detect an apparent trend than to investigate its potential drivers hence many previous studies were limited to the detection and diagnosis of apparent trends without identifying the underlying causal factors nevertheless a consideration of the potential reasons for the hypothesised trends could prove essential in helping to assess whether and how the trends might continue and hence how to take them into account for practical applications the aim of the present study is to investigate the main drivers of non stationarity in flood frequency and assess their comparative suitability in the study area it focuses on determining the strongest influences of different hydrologic and climatic variables as well as their possible combinatorial effects on flooding in the uk and identifying possible spatial patterns flood frequency analysis of 141 catchments over the uk is conducted in both stationary and non stationary contexts based on the generalised additive models for location scale and shape gamlss framework nine explanatory variables have been used for non stationary modelling to explore the potential causes for the non stationarity two hypotheses regarding the underlying drivers of the non stationarity in flood frequency are put forward and tested namely 1 that a single variable such as climate change or change in the rainfall regime is the cause and 2 that some combination of factors e g amplification of the north atlantic oscillation nao by a warming climate is related 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources peak flow data from 158 gauging stations across the uk including scotland england northern ireland and wales were used in the present study the uk lies in the higher mid latitudes between 49 and 61 n and is well known for its unsettled weather due to its constant proximity to the path of the polar front jet stream the uk climate is defined as temperate maritime with mild wet winters and warm wet summers climate conditions vary in different regions of the uk providing an important motivation for investigating the spatial variability of flooding across the uk data sets were obtained from the following sources the uk national river flow archive nrfa 2019 provided the annual maximum peak flows and the gridded catchment daily rainfall from 158 gauging stations the uk met office hadley center 2020 and the university of east anglia climatic research unit hadcrut4 provided the uk regional land surface air temperature and the observed global average surface air temperature anomaly series the following climate indices were also used the north atlantic oscillation the arctic oscillation the east atlantic pattern and the scandinavia pattern in the remainder of this study all references to annual correspond to water years rather than calendar years i e from 1st october to 30th september of the following year as the length of the data record is crucial for accurately determining the extreme value distributions of the parameters the annual maximum instantaneous peak flow data from stations with at least 40 years of records were obtained from the nrfa the mean and median data lengths were 54 and 55 years respectively the catchment locations and available record lengths are indicated in fig 1 the apparent diversity of the selected catchments in terms of size and location allows for good spatial coverage of the uk although the coverage of northern ireland and the north of scotland is relatively low due to a lack of long records according to the nrfa 2019 these catchments are suitable for use in the qmed flood index and pooling in the nrfa peak flow dataset version 8 this should ensure that only flood data of good quality are used in the present study nevertheless further quality control was performed by manually inspecting the records for missing data and discarding any water years in which less than 90 of the peak flow data were recorded this would ensure that no potentially large flood would be missing from the analysed data sets 2 2 candidate explanatory covariates in addition to the conventional time varying non stationary models the following eight physically based covariates were considered in this study i annual rainfall amount ii annual maximum daily rainfall iii global average temperature iv regional temperature v the north atlantic oscillation nao vi the arctic oscillation ao vii the east atlantic pattern ea and viii the scandinavia pattern sca since the majority of the selected catchments are predominantly rural the urbanisation effect was not considered the annual rainfall amount and annual maximum daily rainfall for each catchment were calculated by using the catchment s daily rainfall cdr time series this was derived from the uk center for ecology and hydrology s gridded estimates of areal rainfall ceh gear data a gridded dataset at 1 km resolution covering the entire uk tanguy et al 2016 for the water years available from 1961 or from the start of the flow record if earlier the rainfall grids were produced using the natural neighbour interpolation method including a normalisation step based on average annual rainfall 1961 1990 as detailed in keller et al 2015 the global average temperature is the most robust indicator of human induced climate change with the strongest attribution of causes therefore the monthly observed hadcrut4 http www metoffice gov uk hadobs hadcrut4 land surface air global average temperature anomalies relative to a 1961 1990 reference period were used as an indicator of global warming besides the monthly uk regional temperature data was retrieved from the 1 km haduk grid dataset https www metoffice gov uk research climate maps and data data haduk grid and used as an indicator of local climate change uk met office 2020 the final input data for the present analysis consisted of the global and regional annual mean temperature for each water year converted from the monthly temperature series in recent years the teleconnection between the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and the local river flow and rainfall regime have become very active areas of research in particular numerous studies have revealed the influence of circulation patterns on the flood regime at the local or regional scale nalley et al 2019 nobre et al 2017 kalimeris et al 2017 steirou et al 2017 mallakpour and villarini 2016 lima et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 burt and howden 2013 lópez and francés 2013 niedzielski 2011 wrzesiński and paluszkiewicz 2011 in the present work four circulation indices with proven influence on the uk river flows were selected as candidate explanatory variables for the non stationary flooding brady et al 2019 steirou et al 2019 hannaford 2015 namely i the north atlantic oscillation nao ii the arctic oscillation ao iii the east atlantic pattern ea and iv the scandinavia pattern sca the corresponding time series were obtained from the climate prediction

shape gamlss approach under a non stationary assumption flood data were modelled by incorporating explanatory covariates to describe the temporal changes in the statistical parameters for the selected frequency distribution the model employed the modern distribution based gamlss approach that was developed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 as a common coherent framework for parametric and nonparametric regression models thereby uniting models that are often regarded as distinct in the statistical literature although the gamlss framework is of general statistical use rather than being dedicated to hydrological problems it has been successfully used in the non stationary frequency analysis of hydrologic series in recent years debele et al 2017b machado et al 2015 lópez and francés 2013 villarini et al 2012 the gamlss approach allows modelling of all the distribution parameters as linear parametric functions or non linear nonparametric smoothing functions of the explanatory variables known as covariates or predictive factors in hydrologic problems a gamlss model assumes that y i independent observations of a random variable y where i 1 2 3 n have the probability distribution function f y y i θ i of p parameters where θ i θ 1 i θ p i accounting for the location scale and shape of the random variable distribution the number of parameters p is limited to four and guarantees sufficient flexibility of distributions in most applications in gamlss explanatory variables are introduced into the model through the predictors η k related to parameters by monotonic link functions g k including identity log inverse function and others the gamlss framework involves several important sub models relating the distribution parameters to explanatory variables via an additive model or semi parametric additive model in linear and non linear form eq 1 provides the semi parametric additive model formulation 1 g k θ k x k β k j 1 m h jk x jk where θ k are vectors of length n x k is a known design matrix of order n m i e a matrix of explanatory variables β k is a parameter vector of length m and h jk is an unknown function of explanatory variables representing the functional dependence of the distribution parameters on the explanatory variables x jk the dependence can be linear parametric or non linear nonparametric via smoothing terms since smoothing techniques offer greater flexibility than linear models cubic spline functions were used to fit the non stationary models the gamlss package in the r software provides a wide variety of probability distributions whose parameters can be expressed as functions of explanatory variables in which the coefficients are estimated using a penalised maximum likelihood method based on the characteristics of the data series used in this study the following five two parameter μ and σ distributions were used in modelling the peak flow data i log normal logno ii gamma ga iii inverse gaussian ig iv reverse gumbel rg and v weibull wei the corresponding formulae are given in table 1 2 3 2 model selection and evaluation the model selection was based on the generalised akaike information criterion gaic akaike 1983 this is obtained by adding to the fitted global deviance gdev a penalty k for each effective degree of freedom used in the model i e g a i c k g d e v k d f where df represents the total effective degrees of freedom the two commonly used model selection criteria namely the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic also known as the schwarz bayesian criterion sbc are special cases of gaic corresponding to k 2 and k i n n respectively in practice it is usually found that the aic leads to over fitting while the bic sbc leads to under fitting stasinopoulos et al 2017 after testing the sensitivity and robustness of the model selection to various values of k a penalty of k 3 was applied to the flood datasets in the following analysis the model with the lowest gaic value k 3 indicates the best model performance in this study all references to gaic should be interpreted as the gaic values when k 3 the filliben correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the selected models where a larger value indicates better performance additionally the goodness of fit of the selected models was examined by visual inspection of diagnostic plots of the residuals vs response or worm plots these are de trended forms of the two quantile qq scatter plots and highlight the departure from normality van buuren and fredriks 2001 in detail the difference between the empirical and theoretical quantiles is plotted on the vertical axis and the theoretical quantiles are plotted on the horizontal axis the points appear as a worm shape such that the extreme points are more variable than those in the centre 2 3 3 hypothesised drivers for non stationarity the following two hypotheses assumptions were made and tested in order to explore the dominant drivers for the non stationarity of flood series in individual catchments assumption 1 the non stationarity in flood series is mainly caused by a single variable such as global warming regional climate change change in rainfall regime or variability in atmospheric circulation patterns assumption 2 the non stationarity is caused by some combination of factors e g an amplification of the north atlantic oscillation due to a warming climate for testing this hypothesis a step wise procedure was used to select the optimal combination such that only the significant explanatory variables were included in the model since many of the catchments chosen in the present study are predominantly rural the effects of land use change or urbanisation were not included in the above mentioned assumptions 3 results and discussion 3 1 non stationary models using individual covariates the flood series from each station were analysed using both stationary and non stationary models with nine candidate covariates as listed in table 2 in the non stationary models the covariates were considered separately to obtain information on the most significant driver for each flood series in addition the five distributions listed in table 1 were applied to all the stations and a best fit distribution with the lowest gaic value was selected for each station when no covariates were involved thus the rg and ga distributions offer the best results for 31 and 27 of the 158 stations whereas the logno ig and wei distributions were selected for 15 14 and 13 of stations respectively in other words the rg and ga distributions are more suitable for modelling the flood frequency in uk rivers in this section all parameters of the selected distribution μ and σ were modelled as a function of covariates at the same time this contrasts with some previous studies e g sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 lópez and francés 2013 in which each individual parameter was first modelled separately while keeping the other one constant before finally modelling both together the final step would then be to compare the aic values of the various models in order to select the best one i e the model with the lowest aic in the present study this procedure was initially implemented and it is found that although the second parameter σ is less sensitive than μ modelling both two parameters at once provides superior performance for the majority 90 of stations therefore to compare various covariates and identify the major drivers both parameters are modelled simultaneously for each station for example fig 2 shows the fitted values of the two distribution parameters for the time varying model model 1 and the stationary model model 0 at station 75017 to demonstrate our analysis the selected distributions for three stations in england 22 001 68 001 and 75 001 and one each in scotland wales and northern ireland 9002 55 029 and 20 508 respectively are presented along with the corresponding gaic values for each model table 3 the aforementioned six stations are primarily used for the demonstration of our analytical procedure and do not possess specific hydrological characteristics due to the national scale of this study stations from each different country of the uk were selected the non stationary flood frequency analysis for the rest 152 stations was carried out using the same procedure here it can be seen that model 5 a non stationary model in which the distribution parameters vary as a function of the maximum daily rainfall maxr provided the best performance for stations 9002 22 001 and 205 008 as the functional dependence between the distribution parameters and each covariate is obtained via the cubic splines the number of effective degrees of freedom for these was optimised according to the gaic value in order to avoid model over fitting and balance the complexity and accuracy and are all between 1 and 3 when the number of degrees of freedom is equal to zero the fit is linear the results in table 3 also indicate that using the ea index as the covariate model 8 provides the best non stationary model for station 55 029 this suggests that the variability in atmospheric circulation may have an impact upon flooding in this catchment additionally the peak flood series from station 68 001 shows a strong correlation with the annual rainfall amount as indicated by the lowest gaic value for model 4 meanwhile the time varying non stationary model shows the best performance for station 75 017 the estimated quantiles for the above six best fitted non stationary models are plotted against the selected covariates in fig 3 in addition the fitting quality of the six best models is evaluated via the worm plots in fig 4 here the standard residuals of all the models are seen to be within the 95 confidence interval indicating good statistical performance in this procedure the stationary model model 0 for each station is considered as the criterion for choosing covariates if a non stationary model is superior to the stationary model at a given station the flood series at this station can be regarded as vulnerable to non stationarity although the non stationary model with the lowest gaic value is the best model for such a station any other non stationary models that exhibit better performance than the stationary model are also considered to be reasonable choices for instance although model 5 provides the best performance for station 9002 models 1 2 4 and 8 are also preferable to the stationary model table 3 thus indicating that the time global temperature change annual rainfall and ea index can also be selected as predictors for this station among the 158 stations 154 are found to be vulnerable to non stationarity due to one or more of the covariates while only 4 stations completely lack non stationarity the non stationary analysis for all 158 stations used in this study is summarised in table 4 where the annual rainfall and annual maximum daily rainfall are found to be the best covariates for the majority of the stations at the same time the global mean temperature and the local temperature never provide the best performance this may suggest that global warming and local temperature changes do not have a direct correlation with the observed changes in flood series aside from the annual rainfall amount and maximum daily rainfall the variability of climate indices particularly the nao and ea patterns are also relevant to the non stationarity in flood series at a number of catchments based on the non stationary models which are preferred to the stationary model for each station it is observed that only 12 of the stations display temporal trends in flood series the results confirm that the use of physically based covariates instead of time can produce a better fitting model for non stationary flood analysis the spatial distribution of the best models for each station is discussed in section 3 3 3 2 non stationary models using multiple covariates in the previous section the candidate covariates were considered separately and independently based on the assumption that non stationarity in flood series is primarily caused by a single variable assumption 1 in the present section the assumption that the non stationarity is caused by some combination of variables assumption 2 is tested the distribution parameters μ and σ for each station were first subjected to a step wise gaic based selection procedure in which one candidate covariate could be eliminated or added at each step to ensure that all covariates included in the final model are significant two distinct strategies strategy a b available in gamlss were applied to each station for the step wise gaic based selection strategy a considers each parameter separately whereas strategy b forces both distribution parameters to vary with the same covariates the final models obtained are presented in table 5 along with the best performing single covariate models that were previously identified for the same six stations it can be seen that the step wise selected models for some stations e g 22 001 55 029 68 001 75 017 have the same combinations for both parameters while those for other stations e g 9002 205008 contain different subsets of covariates for each parameter due to the use of the two above mentioned strategies the fitting quality for each of the selected models was evaluated using the probability plot correlation coefficient test that was introduced by filliben coefficients with values greater than 0 98 indicating a high goodness of fit for all the models in table 5 furthermore the worm plots for the residuals of the selected multiple covariate non stationary models for the six stations are presented in fig 5 the standardised residuals of the six models are found to be within the 95 confidence boundary limit thus indicating no discrepancy in the model fitting the results demonstrate that the use of multiple covariates can provide better non stationary models than the use of single covariates for the six selected stations it is worth emphasising that the result of the step wise selection could be either some combinations of covariates or one single covariate this indicates that the use of multiple covariates does not necessarily provide better models than the use of only a single covariate at each station a statistical analysis based on the results of strategy b indicates that of the 158 stations 113 stations 70 have an optimal non stationary model in which the distribution parameters vary with multiple covariates 44 stations 28 have an optimal non stationary model in which the parameters vary with a single covariate and 4 stations 3 do not show any non stationarity the results may suggest that the non stationarity is more likely to be induced by a combination of variables rather than a single variable additional information on the various combinations selected for each station is provided in table s 1 of the supplementary material 3 3 spatial patterns the spatial distribution of the best covariate for each station when considering only the best model for each flood series is presented in fig 6 the most significant covariates are found to be rainfall related variables such as the annual rainfall amount and maximum daily rainfall the best model for the majority of stations in the south of england especially the midlands east anglia and the southeast of england is that with the annual rainfall amount as the covariate the majority of stations for which the best performing model is that with the maximum daily rainfall as covariate are located in scotland northern ireland wales and the southwest of england as floods are produced by rainfall excess with a hydrological response this difference could be associated with the distinct catchment geological characteristics of these regions based on the individual catchment geological information provided by the nrfa the regions that are better modelled with the annual rainfall amount as the covariate mainly present a high percentage of a combination of high and moderate permeability bedrock this would allow for greater infiltration and deep percolation processes to take place where base flow contributions could highly govern flood flows through the slowly accumulated rainwater in the aquifers in contrast the regions that are better modelled with the maximum daily rainfall as the covariate are primarily dominated by low permeability bedrock something that makes the hydrologic response of the catchment highly susceptible to rainfall events of higher intensity in this case catchment runoff could be the flood flow controlling factor which is heavily linked to the maximum daily precipitation it has to be noted that the majority of the regions that belong to this group are primarily mountainous although that is not absolute hence rainfall intensity in these regions could be further amplified by orographic contributions apart from rainfall related covariates the results in table 4 indicate that two atmospheric circulation patterns namely the nao and ea are also relevant to the non stationarity of flooding at a number of catchments two maps indicating whether the flood series from each station exhibits non stationarity due to the nao or ea are presented in fig 7 a large spatial variability is evident across the uk but clear patterns are difficult to discern thus unlike the rainfall related covariates the nao and ea cannot be the most dominant drivers even though several stations exhibit correlations with these climate indices these indices are therefore more suitable as part of a combination in multiple covariate non stationary flood modelling 4 conclusions and future investigations in the present study peak flow series from 158 gauging stations throughout the uk were analysed using both stationary and non stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location scale and shape gamlss framework nine candidate covariates were used for non stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non stationarity in each flood series leading to the following conclusions 1 only 12 of the stations exhibited temporal trends hence time is not considered as the optimum covariate for non stationary flood analysis this indicates that time varying non stationary flood frequency models may not always be suitable and that better fitting models can be constructed on physically based covariates 2 although climate change has been previously identified as the primary source of non stationarity in flood series the present findings demonstrate that neither local temperature changes nor global warming have any direct correlation with the variability of flooding at most of the studied catchments 3 for the majority of the stations the best performing models were found to be the non stationary models with annual rainfall or maximum daily rainfall as the covariates as floods are induced by rainfall excess with a hydrological response rainfall related variables were found to be the most significant predictors of non stationary flood modelling the individual catchment geological characteristics could also be a significant factor the spatial distribution of soils with low and high moderate permeability was found to match to a great extent the flood correlations with maximum daily and annual rainfalls respectively the influence of rainfall related covariates with various time periods as well as the catchments geological features could be the focus for future detailed investigations 4 the non stationary models using multiple covariates were found to be superior to those using single covariates in the majority of stations this implies that non stationarity in flood series is more likely to be caused by a combination of factors rather than a single element however the optimal combination selected via a step wise procedure was found to differ from one station to another possibly due to their different catchment characteristics hence future investigations should consider the influence of catchment characteristics upon the flood generation mechanism and examine their potential relevance to the flood non stationarity 5 for several stations in the uk the variability of two atmospheric circulation patterns nao and ea was also found to be relevant to the changes in flood series however unlike rainfall related covariates these climate indices are not the main predictors for modelling floods and are more suitable as part of a combination for multiple covariate non stationary modelling the findings of this study contribute to the understanding of non stationary flood behaviour and provide new insights into the flood generating mechanisms which are important for flood risk and water resources management to further increase understanding future investigations could be focused on non stationary flood frequency analysis in the uk using three parameter distributions particularly the widely used generalised logistic distribution as recommended by the flood estimation handbook feh robson and reed 1999 can be further explored furthermore smoothing non parametric models can offer greater flexibility but reduce the extrapolation capability it is worth assessing whether the smoothing techniques are necessary for non stationary flood analysis and whether the linear models are adequate in capturing the relationship between the parameters and predictors finally since the flood generating mechanisms are particularly complex for a more complete model specification explanatory variables related to soil texture and moisture deficit evapotranspiration and urbanization

covariates display the best performance for the vast majority of stations thus suggesting that the variability of the rainfall regime remains the dominant driver for changes in flooding moreover two atmospheric circulation patterns namely the north atlantic oscillation nao and the east atlantic pattern were found to be closely related to the non stationarity of flooding at a number of stations unlike rainfall however the influence of these climate indices is not particularly dominant hence they are more suitably employed as components of a multiple covariate non stationary model besides a direct linkage between the variability of flooding and climate changes has not been identified either regionally or globally for the majority of stations 70 the use of multiple covariates can provide a better non stationary model than the use of a single covariate keywords non stationarity flood frequency analysis covariate uk gamlss 1 introduction floods are the most common and destructive natural disasters leading to numerous fatalities every year all over the world aside from direct mortality floods have indirect impacts such as widespread damage to crops property and infrastructure in this respect flood frequency analysis is a cornerstone of flood risk control hydraulic structure design and water resource management conventional flood frequency analysis is based on the assumption that flood time series are both stationary and independent the stationary assumption means that hydrological variables fluctuate randomly within an unchanging range of variability these variables in annual scale have time invariant probability density functions whose properties can be estimated from observed data records however in the real world climate change human interventions and land use changes are influencing the characteristics of these hydrological data such that their fluctuations may extend beyond the supposedly unchanging range of variability consequently the stationary assumption may be no longer valid milly et al 2008 2015 thus while water related planning has always been dependent and always should depend on the analysis of past data to inform projections of future conditions the present non stationary conditions mean that the past observed data may no longer provide all the necessary information concerning the future statistical behaviour of extreme precipitation and floods for example an increasing trend in the mean of a flow series could result in the underestimation of flood quantiles and an increased risk of failure of hydraulic structures and flood prevention measures conversely a decreasing trend could result in the overestimation of design quantiles and increased costs relating to the overdesign of infrastructures therefore the incorporation of non stationarity into hydrological frequency analysis has become an active area of research and is considered crucial for human adaptation to the uncertain and changing

et al 2015 2008 villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 a variety of new concepts and techniques for non stationary hydrological frequency analysis have emerged in recent years most of those have been described in a review by salas et al 2018 focusing on hydrological design for protection against extreme events such as floods and low flows under non stationary conditions some government agencies are also in the process of updating their flood design guidelines to account for non stationarity e g hfawg 2017 madsen et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2014 however despite the increasing attention given to this subject there remains no generally agreed upon set of methods for performing flood frequency analysis under non stationary conditions nevertheless one approach is to attempt to remove the trend from the data before the analysis this is more suitable for contexts where the increase in the rate and size of extreme events can be explained by a trend in the mean e g in sea level analysis a more convenient and widely used approach is the use of a time varying model which assumes that the parameters of the distributions for frequency analysis vary as a function of time and provides a useful tool for reconstructing the non stationary behaviour of flood series however the explanatory variables from an only time dependent model may not always be suitable as trends can also be influenced by factors such as climate variability or anthropogenic activities for this reason several studies have explored the feasibility of incorporating external physically based covariates into models for non stationary flood frequency analysis faulkner et al 2020 lópez and francés 2013 machado et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 šraj et al 2016 yan et al 2017 villarini et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 this approach has been shown not only to produce a better fitting model but also to help provide a better explanation for variations in flood regimes flood frequency analysis in the uk has generally followed the statistical procedures described in the flood estimation handbook feh institute of hydrology 1999 and subsequent updates kjeldsen et al 2005 2008 although these methods are based on the traditional assumptions of stationarity and flow time series independence some non stationary concepts and techniques have also been implemented in the uk for example harrigan et al 2018 used daily flow data from stations in the uk benchmark network ukbn to analyse high flow and low flow trends using the mann kendall mk test and pettitt test the study concluded that the near natural ukbn catchments allow for the detection of trends that are less affected by human disturbances to river flow regimes prosdocimi et al 2014 applied a linear regression model and a 2 parameter log normal distribution to explore trends in uk peak river flow using time and 99th percentile of daily rainfall values during a year or season to account for the potential non linearity of chronological trends that may be relevant to changes in precipitation subsequently prosdocimi et al 2015 used an index of urban extent as a covariate to investigate the impact of urbanisation upon flood extremes based on non stationary flood frequency models for two catchments in northern england the results indicated that the increasing urbanisation levels in these catchments had a significant effect upon flood extremes during the study period of 1970 2010 to describe the change in flood frequency in the uk griffin et al 2019 implemented a moving window approach to estimate how parameters of the generalised logistic distribution vary as a linear function of time most of the existing non stationary models including those used in the studies mentioned above comprise parameters that are linear functions of the covariate of interest although the assumption of linearity facilitates result interpretation and model fitting the above discussion has emphasised that it may not always be suitable moreover it is easier to detect an apparent trend than to investigate its potential drivers hence many previous studies were limited to the detection and diagnosis of apparent trends without identifying the underlying causal factors nevertheless a consideration of the potential reasons for the hypothesised trends could prove essential in helping to assess whether and how the trends might continue and hence how to take them into account for practical applications the aim of the present study is to investigate the main drivers of non stationarity in flood frequency and assess their comparative suitability in the study area it focuses on determining the strongest influences of different hydrologic and climatic variables as well as their possible combinatorial effects on flooding in the uk and identifying possible spatial patterns flood frequency analysis of 141 catchments over the uk is conducted in both stationary and non stationary contexts based on the generalised additive models for location scale and shape gamlss framework nine explanatory variables have been used for non stationary modelling to explore the potential causes for the non stationarity two hypotheses regarding the underlying drivers of the non stationarity in flood frequency are put forward and tested namely 1 that a single variable such as climate change or change in the rainfall regime is the cause and 2 that some combination of factors e g amplification of the north atlantic oscillation nao by a warming climate is related 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources peak flow data from 158 gauging stations across the uk including scotland england northern ireland and wales were used in the present study the uk lies in the higher mid latitudes between 49 and 61 n and is well known for its unsettled weather due to its constant proximity to the path of the polar front jet stream the uk climate is defined as temperate maritime with mild wet winters and warm wet summers climate conditions vary in different regions of the uk providing an important motivation for investigating the spatial variability of flooding across the uk data sets were obtained from the following sources the uk national river flow archive nrfa 2019 provided the annual maximum peak flows and the gridded catchment daily rainfall from 158 gauging stations the uk met office hadley center 2020 and the university of east anglia climatic research unit hadcrut4 provided the uk regional land surface air temperature and the observed global average surface air temperature anomaly series the following climate indices were also used the north atlantic oscillation the arctic oscillation the east atlantic pattern and the scandinavia pattern in the remainder of this study all references to annual correspond to water years rather than calendar years i e from 1st october to 30th september of the following year as the length of the data record is crucial for accurately determining the extreme value distributions of the parameters the annual maximum instantaneous peak flow data from stations with at least 40 years of records were obtained from the nrfa the mean and median data lengths were 54 and 55 years respectively the catchment locations and available record lengths are indicated in fig 1 the apparent diversity of the selected catchments in terms of size and location allows for good spatial coverage of the uk although the coverage of northern ireland and the north of scotland is relatively low due to a lack of long records according to the nrfa 2019 these catchments are suitable for use in the qmed flood index and pooling in the nrfa peak flow dataset version 8 this should ensure that only flood data of good quality are used in the present study nevertheless further quality control was performed by manually inspecting the records for missing data and discarding any water years in which less than 90 of the peak flow data were recorded this would ensure that no potentially large flood would be missing from the analysed data sets 2 2 candidate explanatory covariates in addition to the conventional time varying non stationary models the following eight physically based covariates were considered in this study i annual rainfall amount ii annual maximum daily rainfall iii global average temperature iv regional temperature v the north atlantic oscillation nao vi the arctic oscillation ao vii the east atlantic pattern ea and viii the scandinavia pattern sca since the majority of the selected catchments are predominantly rural the urbanisation effect was not considered the annual rainfall amount and annual maximum daily rainfall for each catchment were calculated by using the catchment s daily rainfall cdr time series this was derived from the uk center for ecology and hydrology s gridded estimates of areal rainfall ceh gear data a gridded dataset at 1 km resolution covering the entire uk tanguy et al 2016 for the water years available from 1961 or from the start of the flow record if earlier the rainfall grids were produced using the natural neighbour interpolation method including a normalisation step based on average annual rainfall 1961 1990 as detailed in keller et al 2015 the global average temperature is the most robust indicator of human induced climate change with the strongest attribution of causes therefore the monthly observed hadcrut4 http www metoffice gov uk hadobs hadcrut4 land surface air global average temperature anomalies relative to a 1961 1990 reference period were used as an indicator of global warming besides the monthly uk regional temperature data was retrieved from the 1 km haduk grid dataset https www metoffice gov uk research climate maps and data data haduk grid and used as an indicator of local climate change uk met office 2020 the final input data for the present analysis consisted of the global and regional annual mean temperature for each water year converted from the monthly temperature series in recent years the teleconnection between the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns and the local river flow and rainfall regime have become very active areas of research in particular numerous studies have revealed the influence of circulation patterns on the flood regime at the local or regional scale nalley et al 2019 nobre et al 2017 kalimeris et al 2017 steirou et al 2017 mallakpour and villarini 2016 lima et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 burt and howden 2013 lópez and francés 2013 niedzielski 2011 wrzesiński and paluszkiewicz 2011 in the present work four circulation indices with proven influence on the uk river flows were selected as candidate explanatory variables for the non stationary flooding brady et al 2019 steirou et al 2019 hannaford 2015 namely i the north atlantic oscillation nao ii the arctic oscillation ao iii the east atlantic pattern ea and iv the scandinavia pattern sca the corresponding time series were obtained from the climate prediction

shape gamlss approach under a non stationary assumption flood data were modelled by incorporating explanatory covariates to describe the temporal changes in the statistical parameters for the selected frequency distribution the model employed the modern distribution based gamlss approach that was developed by rigby and stasinopoulos 2005 as a common coherent framework for parametric and nonparametric regression models thereby uniting models that are often regarded as distinct in the statistical literature although the gamlss framework is of general statistical use rather than being dedicated to hydrological problems it has been successfully used in the non stationary frequency analysis of hydrologic series in recent years debele et al 2017b machado et al 2015 lópez and francés 2013 villarini et al 2012 the gamlss approach allows modelling of all the distribution parameters as linear parametric functions or non linear nonparametric smoothing functions of the explanatory variables known as covariates or predictive factors in hydrologic problems a gamlss model assumes that y i independent observations of a random variable y where i 1 2 3 n have the probability distribution function f y y i θ i of p parameters where θ i θ 1 i θ p i accounting for the location scale and shape of the random variable distribution the number of parameters p is limited to four and guarantees sufficient flexibility of distributions in most applications in gamlss explanatory variables are introduced into the model through the predictors η k related to parameters by monotonic link functions g k including identity log inverse function and others the gamlss framework involves several important sub models relating the distribution parameters to explanatory variables via an additive model or semi parametric additive model in linear and non linear form eq 1 provides the semi parametric additive model formulation 1 g k θ k x k β k j 1 m h jk x jk where θ k are vectors of length n x k is a known design matrix of order n m i e a matrix of explanatory variables β k is a parameter vector of length m and h jk is an unknown function of explanatory variables representing the functional dependence of the distribution parameters on the explanatory variables x jk the dependence can be linear parametric or non linear nonparametric via smoothing terms since smoothing techniques offer greater flexibility than linear models cubic spline functions were used to fit the non stationary models the gamlss package in the r software provides a wide variety of probability distributions whose parameters can be expressed as functions of explanatory variables in which the coefficients are estimated using a penalised maximum likelihood method based on the characteristics of the data series used in this study the following five two parameter μ and σ distributions were used in modelling the peak flow data i log normal logno ii gamma ga iii inverse gaussian ig iv reverse gumbel rg and v weibull wei the corresponding formulae are given in table 1 2 3 2 model selection and evaluation the model selection was based on the generalised akaike information criterion gaic akaike 1983 this is obtained by adding to the fitted global deviance gdev a penalty k for each effective degree of freedom used in the model i e g a i c k g d e v k d f where df represents the total effective degrees of freedom the two commonly used model selection criteria namely the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic also known as the schwarz bayesian criterion sbc are special cases of gaic corresponding to k 2 and k i n n respectively in practice it is usually found that the aic leads to over fitting while the bic sbc leads to under fitting stasinopoulos et al 2017 after testing the sensitivity and robustness of the model selection to various values of k a penalty of k 3 was applied to the flood datasets in the following analysis the model with the lowest gaic value k 3 indicates the best model performance in this study all references to gaic should be interpreted as the gaic values when k 3 the filliben correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the selected models where a larger value indicates better performance additionally the goodness of fit of the selected models was examined by visual inspection of diagnostic plots of the residuals vs response or worm plots these are de trended forms of the two quantile qq scatter plots and highlight the departure from normality van buuren and fredriks 2001 in detail the difference between the empirical and theoretical quantiles is plotted on the vertical axis and the theoretical quantiles are plotted on the horizontal axis the points appear as a worm shape such that the extreme points are more variable than those in the centre 2 3 3 hypothesised drivers for non stationarity the following two hypotheses assumptions were made and tested in order to explore the dominant drivers for the non stationarity of flood series in individual catchments assumption 1 the non stationarity in flood series is mainly caused by a single variable such as global warming regional climate change change in rainfall regime or variability in atmospheric circulation patterns assumption 2 the non stationarity is caused by some combination of factors e g an amplification of the north atlantic oscillation due to a warming climate for testing this hypothesis a step wise procedure was used to select the optimal combination such that only the significant explanatory variables were included in the model since many of the catchments chosen in the present study are predominantly rural the effects of land use change or urbanisation were not included in the above mentioned assumptions 3 results and discussion 3 1 non stationary models using individual covariates the flood series from each station were analysed using both stationary and non stationary models with nine candidate covariates as listed in table 2 in the non stationary models the covariates were considered separately to obtain information on the most significant driver for each flood series in addition the five distributions listed in table 1 were applied to all the stations and a best fit distribution with the lowest gaic value was selected for each station when no covariates were involved thus the rg and ga distributions offer the best results for 31 and 27 of the 158 stations whereas the logno ig and wei distributions were selected for 15 14 and 13 of stations respectively in other words the rg and ga distributions are more suitable for modelling the flood frequency in uk rivers in this section all parameters of the selected distribution μ and σ were modelled as a function of covariates at the same time this contrasts with some previous studies e g sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 lópez and francés 2013 in which each individual parameter was first modelled separately while keeping the other one constant before finally modelling both together the final step would then be to compare the aic values of the various models in order to select the best one i e the model with the lowest aic in the present study this procedure was initially implemented and it is found that although the second parameter σ is less sensitive than μ modelling both two parameters at once provides superior performance for the majority 90 of stations therefore to compare various covariates and identify the major drivers both parameters are modelled simultaneously for each station for example fig 2 shows the fitted values of the two distribution parameters for the time varying model model 1 and the stationary model model 0 at station 75017 to demonstrate our analysis the selected distributions for three stations in england 22 001 68 001 and 75 001 and one each in scotland wales and northern ireland 9002 55 029 and 20 508 respectively are presented along with the corresponding gaic values for each model table 3 the aforementioned six stations are primarily used for the demonstration of our analytical procedure and do not possess specific hydrological characteristics due to the national scale of this study stations from each different country of the uk were selected the non stationary flood frequency analysis for the rest 152 stations was carried out using the same procedure here it can be seen that model 5 a non stationary model in which the distribution parameters vary as a function of the maximum daily rainfall maxr provided the best performance for stations 9002 22 001 and 205 008 as the functional dependence between the distribution parameters and each covariate is obtained via the cubic splines the number of effective degrees of freedom for these was optimised according to the gaic value in order to avoid model over fitting and balance the complexity and accuracy and are all between 1 and 3 when the number of degrees of freedom is equal to zero the fit is linear the results in table 3 also indicate that using the ea index as the covariate model 8 provides the best non stationary model for station 55 029 this suggests that the variability in atmospheric circulation may have an impact upon flooding in this catchment additionally the peak flood series from station 68 001 shows a strong correlation with the annual rainfall amount as indicated by the lowest gaic value for model 4 meanwhile the time varying non stationary model shows the best performance for station 75 017 the estimated quantiles for the above six best fitted non stationary models are plotted against the selected covariates in fig 3 in addition the fitting quality of the six best models is evaluated via the worm plots in fig 4 here the standard residuals of all the models are seen to be within the 95 confidence interval indicating good statistical performance in this procedure the stationary model model 0 for each station is considered as the criterion for choosing covariates if a non stationary model is superior to the stationary model at a given station the flood series at this station can be regarded as vulnerable to non stationarity although the non stationary model with the lowest gaic value is the best model for such a station any other non stationary models that exhibit better performance than the stationary model are also considered to be reasonable choices for instance although model 5 provides the best performance for station 9002 models 1 2 4 and 8 are also preferable to the stationary model table 3 thus indicating that the time global temperature change annual rainfall and ea index can also be selected as predictors for this station among the 158 stations 154 are found to be vulnerable to non stationarity due to one or more of the covariates while only 4 stations completely lack non stationarity the non stationary analysis for all 158 stations used in this study is summarised in table 4 where the annual rainfall and annual maximum daily rainfall are found to be the best covariates for the majority of the stations at the same time the global mean temperature and the local temperature never provide the best performance this may suggest that global warming and local temperature changes do not have a direct correlation with the observed changes in flood series aside from the annual rainfall amount and maximum daily rainfall the variability of climate indices particularly the nao and ea patterns are also relevant to the non stationarity in flood series at a number of catchments based on the non stationary models which are preferred to the stationary model for each station it is observed that only 12 of the stations display temporal trends in flood series the results confirm that the use of physically based covariates instead of time can produce a better fitting model for non stationary flood analysis the spatial distribution of the best models for each station is discussed in section 3 3 3 2 non stationary models using multiple covariates in the previous section the candidate covariates were considered separately and independently based on the assumption that non stationarity in flood series is primarily caused by a single variable assumption 1 in the present section the assumption that the non stationarity is caused by some combination of variables assumption 2 is tested the distribution parameters μ and σ for each station were first subjected to a step wise gaic based selection procedure in which one candidate covariate could be eliminated or added at each step to ensure that all covariates included in the final model are significant two distinct strategies strategy a b available in gamlss were applied to each station for the step wise gaic based selection strategy a considers each parameter separately whereas strategy b forces both distribution parameters to vary with the same covariates the final models obtained are presented in table 5 along with the best performing single covariate models that were previously identified for the same six stations it can be seen that the step wise selected models for some stations e g 22 001 55 029 68 001 75 017 have the same combinations for both parameters while those for other stations e g 9002 205008 contain different subsets of covariates for each parameter due to the use of the two above mentioned strategies the fitting quality for each of the selected models was evaluated using the probability plot correlation coefficient test that was introduced by filliben coefficients with values greater than 0 98 indicating a high goodness of fit for all the models in table 5 furthermore the worm plots for the residuals of the selected multiple covariate non stationary models for the six stations are presented in fig 5 the standardised residuals of the six models are found to be within the 95 confidence boundary limit thus indicating no discrepancy in the model fitting the results demonstrate that the use of multiple covariates can provide better non stationary models than the use of single covariates for the six selected stations it is worth emphasising that the result of the step wise selection could be either some combinations of covariates or one single covariate this indicates that the use of multiple covariates does not necessarily provide better models than the use of only a single covariate at each station a statistical analysis based on the results of strategy b indicates that of the 158 stations 113 stations 70 have an optimal non stationary model in which the distribution parameters vary with multiple covariates 44 stations 28 have an optimal non stationary model in which the parameters vary with a single covariate and 4 stations 3 do not show any non stationarity the results may suggest that the non stationarity is more likely to be induced by a combination of variables rather than a single variable additional information on the various combinations selected for each station is provided in table s 1 of the supplementary material 3 3 spatial patterns the spatial distribution of the best covariate for each station when considering only the best model for each flood series is presented in fig 6 the most significant covariates are found to be rainfall related variables such as the annual rainfall amount and maximum daily rainfall the best model for the majority of stations in the south of england especially the midlands east anglia and the southeast of england is that with the annual rainfall amount as the covariate the majority of stations for which the best performing model is that with the maximum daily rainfall as covariate are located in scotland northern ireland wales and the southwest of england as floods are produced by rainfall excess with a hydrological response this difference could be associated with the distinct catchment geological characteristics of these regions based on the individual catchment geological information provided by the nrfa the regions that are better modelled with the annual rainfall amount as the covariate mainly present a high percentage of a combination of high and moderate permeability bedrock this would allow for greater infiltration and deep percolation processes to take place where base flow contributions could highly govern flood flows through the slowly accumulated rainwater in the aquifers in contrast the regions that are better modelled with the maximum daily rainfall as the covariate are primarily dominated by low permeability bedrock something that makes the hydrologic response of the catchment highly susceptible to rainfall events of higher intensity in this case catchment runoff could be the flood flow controlling factor which is heavily linked to the maximum daily precipitation it has to be noted that the majority of the regions that belong to this group are primarily mountainous although that is not absolute hence rainfall intensity in these regions could be further amplified by orographic contributions apart from rainfall related covariates the results in table 4 indicate that two atmospheric circulation patterns namely the nao and ea are also relevant to the non stationarity of flooding at a number of catchments two maps indicating whether the flood series from each station exhibits non stationarity due to the nao or ea are presented in fig 7 a large spatial variability is evident across the uk but clear patterns are difficult to discern thus unlike the rainfall related covariates the nao and ea cannot be the most dominant drivers even though several stations exhibit correlations with these climate indices these indices are therefore more suitable as part of a combination in multiple covariate non stationary flood modelling 4 conclusions and future investigations in the present study peak flow series from 158 gauging stations throughout the uk were analysed using both stationary and non stationary models based on the generalised additive models for location scale and shape gamlss framework nine candidate covariates were used for non stationary models to obtain information on the significant drivers of non stationarity in each flood series leading to the following conclusions 1 only 12 of the stations exhibited temporal trends hence time is not considered as the optimum covariate for non stationary flood analysis this indicates that time varying non stationary flood frequency models may not always be suitable and that better fitting models can be constructed on physically based covariates 2 although climate change has been previously identified as the primary source of non stationarity in flood series the present findings demonstrate that neither local temperature changes nor global warming have any direct correlation with the variability of flooding at most of the studied catchments 3 for the majority of the stations the best performing models were found to be the non stationary models with annual rainfall or maximum daily rainfall as the covariates as floods are induced by rainfall excess with a hydrological response rainfall related variables were found to be the most significant predictors of non stationary flood modelling the individual catchment geological characteristics could also be a significant factor the spatial distribution of soils with low and high moderate permeability was found to match to a great extent the flood correlations with maximum daily and annual rainfalls respectively the influence of rainfall related covariates with various time periods as well as the catchments geological features could be the focus for future detailed investigations 4 the non stationary models using multiple covariates were found to be superior to those using single covariates in the majority of stations this implies that non stationarity in flood series is more likely to be caused by a combination of factors rather than a single element however the optimal combination selected via a step wise procedure was found to differ from one station to another possibly due to their different catchment characteristics hence future investigations should consider the influence of catchment characteristics upon the flood generation mechanism and examine their potential relevance to the flood non stationarity 5 for several stations in the uk the variability of two atmospheric circulation patterns nao and ea was also found to be relevant to the changes in flood series however unlike rainfall related covariates these climate indices are not the main predictors for modelling floods and are more suitable as part of a combination for multiple covariate non stationary modelling the findings of this study contribute to the understanding of non stationary flood behaviour and provide new insights into the flood generating mechanisms which are important for flood risk and water resources management to further increase understanding future investigations could be focused on non stationary flood frequency analysis in the uk using three parameter distributions particularly the widely used generalised logistic distribution as recommended by the flood estimation handbook feh robson and reed 1999 can be further explored furthermore smoothing non parametric models can offer greater flexibility but reduce the extrapolation capability it is worth assessing whether the smoothing techniques are necessary for non stationary flood analysis and whether the linear models are adequate in capturing the relationship between the parameters and predictors finally since the flood generating mechanisms are particularly complex for a more complete model specification explanatory variables related to soil texture and moisture deficit evapotranspiration and urbanization

4636,the lack of comprehensive studies involving the quantification of groundwater depletion and aquifer deterioration has challenged the sustainable management of groundwater resources in semi arid regions in this study we formulated a new pragmatic relationship consisting of a set of equations to quantify contaminated groundwater volume and groundwater virtually lost through contamination we also used extensive monitoring of the hydraulic head and its spatio temporal variations as well as groundwater modeling to quantify total aquifer volume aquifer storage and aquifer depletion the watershed is divided into three distinct zones based on groundwater level fluctuations and recharge intermediate borewell zone ibw random borewell zone rbw and slow borewell zone sbw zones this study provides an advanced understanding of the relationship between aquifer depletion geogenic contamination and the resultant virtual groundwater loss our long term study reveals a negative change in storage groundwater loss in poor monsoon years and a reduction in total groundwater volume which can result in aquifer depletion over time and low groundwater reserves the decadal estimations of groundwater gain loss for a period of ten years 2001 2010 in the ibw zone of the aquifer show a groundwater gain of 3 03 mcm million cubic metes but at the same time this zone has virtually lost 1 06 mcm to contamination similarly 1 3 mcm gain is estimated in the rbw zone and 0 53 mcm loss of groundwater is estimated in the sbw the virtual groundwater losses through contamination in rbw and sbw zones are 4 5 mcm and 16 mcm in such a situation an aquifer depletion stage beyond an economic level will be reached in most of the watershed in a few years the contamination in these years is also high which may result in virtual loss through contamination under such conditions the groundwater resource may be conditionally renewable as a part of the groundwater volume remains contaminated and unusable these results highlight the need to understand the interconnection between groundwater contamination and continued over exploitation which gradually moves towards aquifer depletion and conditionally renewable groundwater resources keywords sustainable groundwater management groundwater depletion hard rock aquifers semi arid aquifers groundwater contamination 1 introduction groundwater is an integral component of the hydrological system recent investigations like hydrological modeling wada et al 2014 and earth observations rodell et al 2009a 2009b famiglietti 2014 have quantified alarming rates of groundwater depletion globally the sustainable groundwater development is not only constrained by resource availability but also by quality deterioration morris et al 2003 wada et al s 2010 study carried out in sub humid and arid regions states that total global groundwater depletion during the period of 40 years 1960 2000 has increased from 126 32 km3 yr in 1960 to 283 40 km3 yr over exploitation and excessive pumping can lead to groundwater depletion where groundwater is extracted at a faster rate than it can be replenished this eventually renders a groundwater system vulnerable to contamination pollution and degradation the availability of groundwater and the suitability of its quality for different uses are inextricably intertwined alley et al 1999 many researchers have carried out considerable work on groundwater sustainability and related factors like quantification of sustainability metrics pandey et al 2011 gleeson et al 2012a global groundwater assessments and stress indices richey et al 2015 the impacts of groundwater withdrawals on global groundwater storage gleeson et al 2012b döll et al 2012 and temporal changes in groundwater storage influence the complex interactions in global aquifer systems thomas et al 2017 however limited research has been carried out to study the integrated effects of groundwater depletion and groundwater contamination on groundwater sustainability and renewability the objective of our study is to quantify spatio temporal aquifer depletion through hydraulic head monitoring and groundwater modeling at a watershed scale as well as quantify contaminated groundwater volume through volume concentration relationship to investigate virtual groundwater loss from the aquifer system we introduce a new concept of virtual groundwater loss through contamination our concept of virtual groundwater loss through contamination is different from the definitions provided by allan 1998 hoekstra chapagain 2008 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 which state that virtual water and water footprint is the amount of water embedded in an agricultural product and covers the entire food supply chain from production to delivery including pollution produced in the process between the interconnected regions involving exchange however our concept of virtual groundwater loss considers the volume of the contaminated groundwater physically available in the aquifer but not fit for use we use the term virtual groundwater loss as this volume is present in the aquifer but cannot be considered a part of groundwater resource as it is contaminated beyond the permissible limit this is an entirely new concept and the novelty and uniqueness of the study is its ability to quantify the contaminated groundwater volume using the volume concentration relation this research generates an idea about the degraded volume of groundwater in an aquifer aquifer depletion through ground based observations like hydraulic head monitoring and numerical modeling effects of dilution from rainfall as well as solutes from irrigation return flow the scope of the study is an overview and new insights to understand the integrated effects of groundwater depletion and aquifer contamination as well as advance our understanding of groundwater renewability and sustainable groundwater resource management this study was performed on the southern india watershed maheshwaram as this region is witnessing alarming declines in groundwater resources as well as fluoride contamination and data time series of 10 years was used the

saprolite layer having a thickness of 10 15 m the latter is followed by fissured unweathered granite having a thickness of 15 20 m which is followed by almost unfractured bedrock composed of granite the weathered rock has an average depth of 11 m while that of fractured rock is 18 m fractures are the dominant structural features of the study area gsi 2002 maréchal et al 2004 2006 dewandel et al 2006 zaidi et al 2007 ahmed et al 2010 the unweathered bedrock is permeable only where tectonic fractures are present 2 2 hydrogeology and hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer the aquifer is considered as a two tier aquifer system because of the laminated saprolite and fissured layer which has poor storage capacity while the saprolite layer has poor transmissivity but high storage capacity dewandel et al 2006 the two zones viz weathered and fractured form the aquifer but have no separation layer as typically found in granitic aquifers these zones have very different hydraulic characteristics another peculiar structure in the area is many dolerite dykes much younger than the host granites some dykes are not exposed to the surface and at exposed surfaces they are fragmented from the top to a certain depth behaving as conduits this property is of significance in the case of depleting aquifer such as the one under study the water table lies as deep as 15 25 m below ground level bgl the water table variation from south to north fig 2 is approximately 9 m 610 and 619 amsl the study carried out by maréchal et al 2006 in this watershed states that irf irrigation return flow to the aquifer is between 70 and 90 mm year and the range of natural recharge from rainfall is 55 200 mm year the various hydraulic tests like slug tests and flowmeter measurements carried out in the watershed at different scales have been used to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of the aquifers it was observed that the average hydraulic conductivities obtained with slug tests in the near vicinity of the wells is kaverage 4 4 10 6 m s whereas the injection tests with flowmeter measurements revealed the depth of the conductive fracture zones cfz and their hydraulic conductivities which is kaverage 8 8 10 5 m s through these tests it is observed that the extension of the most conductive part of the weathered fractured layer is 35 m deep a double porosity model used for distinguishing the part of drainage porosity located in the blocks 90 drainage porosity of bocks sb 5 7 10 3 from that linked to fractures 10 drainage porosity of the fractures sf 5 8 10 4 maréchal et al 2018 the packer and injection tests carried in the watershed show that a highly permeable part of the aquifer is located at the interface between the saprolite bottom and the top of the fractured layer boisson et al 2015 this highly permeable part of the aquifer is considered to play a significant role in the aquifer connectivity maréchal et al 2018 2 3 environmental issues maheshwaram watershed is experiencing the basin closure and baseflow has ceased to contribute to the surface water kumar and ahmed 2007 maréchal et al 2006 groundwater contamination and over exploitation are the main environmental problems of the watershed moreover the watershed is contaminated with fluoride which poses a threat to drinking water for local inhabitants as mentioned earlier the geology of the watershed is composed of archean granites according to atal et al 2009 the main processes responsible for the geogenic release of fluoride is the alteration of biotite producing kaolinite through intermediate weathering stages of chlorite and fluoro apatite through rock dissolution the anthropogenic sources of fluoride are attributed to evaporation in the paddy fields and water rock interaction of irrigation return flow pauwels et al 2011 3 materials and methods 3 1 compartmentalization of the watershed and its effects on hydrochemistry the work carried out by guihéneuf et al 2014 sarah et al 2014 highlighted the aquifer connectivity under different water table conditions guihéneuf et al 2014 report that the aquifer moves from regional to local flow conditions under varied water table fluctuations e g under the low water table conditions which are usually noticed during the pre monsoon period lateral compartmentalization is induced by the smaller lateral extensions of deeper fractures the changes in the hydraulic connectivity because of water table fluctuations and discontinuities also affect groundwater chemistry and solute transport maréchal et al 2018 the temporal evolution of hydrochemical data and different recharge mechanisms observed in the maheshwaram watershed demonstrates the stratification in the groundwater chemistry local geochemical heterogeneity varied hydraulic connectivity and preferential flow paths perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 maréchal et al 2018 attribute the spatial variations in groundwater chemistry to different residence times water rock interaction times because of different transmissivity zones within the compartment sarah et al 2014 divided the maheshwaram watershed into three zones to capture the hydrogeological heterogeneity the division is based on the correlation of amplitude of water table fluctuations and slope of rise and fall to recharge in this paper we used the same zones to capture the chemical heterogeneity and avoid the uncertainties due to compartmentalization pointed out by the previous works the three zones fig 1 are classified as rapid borewell zone rbw where the amplitude of the water level fluctuation can reach 15 m and the peak of the water level is attained in less than two months after the first rainfall event of the monsoon the slow borewell zone sbw shows very slow responses to rainfall i e the peak of the water level is attained in more than two months the amplitude of the fluctuation is less than 6 m in the sbw the intermediate borewell zone ibw where borewells show an intermediate response to rainfall neither comparatively fast nor slow water level variations and with amplitudes of 8 m sarah et al 2014 fluoride f was taken as the main contaminant in the watershed the fluoride concentration in the watershed varies from 0 5 to 7 5 mg l fig 3 approximately varying both temporally as well as spatially the fluoride data in the watershed were collected from various fluoride concentration measuring campaigns carried out from 2001 to 2010 under certain projects taken by indo french center for groundwater research india the higher f concentrations up to 17 3 mg l have also been reported by pauwels et al 2015 these concentrations are reduced after recharge from the rainfall and the minimum concentrations are observed in the post monsoon period when groundwater levels are at their peak after being recharged from the rainfall which also creates a dilution effect on the f concentrations fig 3 further investigations by pauwels et al 2015 through borehole logging demonstrated a strong stratification of groundwater with respect to f which increases with the increasing depth and residence time the groundwater in the maheshwaram watershed is undersaturated with respect to fluorite and almost supersaturated to calcite pettenati et al 2013 sreedevi et al 2006 further suggests that f enrichment of the groundwater is likely to continue in the future in the absence of precipitation and the continued groundwater over exploitation further irrigation return flow irf forms the major water budget component maréchal et al 2006 of the study area adding up more solute concentration to the aquifer perrin et al 2012 further state that irrigation return flow can contribute to as much as half of the aquifer recharge in the future and the water table evaporation is insignificant in this case low recharge rates and higher irf can worsen the problem as natural recharge is too low to produce a dilution effect for f 3 2 data set water level water quality and geometry of the aquifer the monthly water level recordings were taken manually as well as from automatic water level recorders fitted in the observation wells named ifps indo french project piezometers the monitoring network consists of 25 borewells negligibly influenced by the pumping in the nearby wells zaidi et al 2007 the observation period selected from the study is ten years from 2001 to 2010 the f samples 50 80 season were taken from both the irrigation wells named ifw and ifp indo french monitoring network borewells and the data repository of the indo french centre for groundwater research fig 1 the collected samples were analyzed for major and trace elements determined in the laboratory using ion chromatography and icpms inductive coupled plasma mass spectrophotometer the average concentration of the f in the rbw zone is 2 mg l while as minimum concentration is 0 8 mg l and the maximum is 2 5 mg l while in the ibw zone the average fluoride concentration is 2 5 mg l of fluoride the minimum and maximum f concentration is 1 5 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively in the sbw zone the maximum f concentration is 7 5 mg l and the minimum is 2 5 mg l while as average f concentration is 4 mg l the depth to bedrock elevation the limit between weathered and fractured layers was interpreted from the vertical electric sounding electrical resistivity tomography and lithologs of the ifp indo french project observational borewells engerrand 2002 the altitude of the base of the weathered and fractured layer is shown in fig 4 engerrand 2002 4 depletion estimates by groundwater modeling and quantification of total aquifer volume through a change in storage maheshwaram watershed is modeled with visual modflow flex software developed by schlumberger this was used to build a conceptual model of the watershed and then numerical modeling was carried using modflow harbaugh 2005 the watershed is taken as a two layer system the first one as porous formation representing the weathered layer the aquifer in the weathered layer is dry during the simulation period with comparatively low variability in hydraulic conductivity the first layer is simulated as an equivalent porous medium representing weathered zone and the second layer is simulated as a dual porosity medium priscu 1997 kim and lee 2000 altinors and onder 2010 ghasemizadeh et al 2015 representing the fissured fractured zone without any confining layer in between with highly variable hydraulic conductivity ahmed and sreedevi 2003 hence the aquifer simulated is a single aquifer consisting of two distinct layers viz weathered zone and the fissured fractured zone thus the two layers have different system characteristics but with a single value of the water level the entire area was divided into meshes of 250 m by 250 m size giving about 1200 meshes in each layer a reasonably optimal size for a hard rock aquifer system 4 1 model set up and calibration the model set up and calibration is discussed in the following sections 4 1 1 steady state condition in the steady state condition the model was run for 365 days and the recharge during the wet period and averaged groundwater withdrawal values for the period of one year january 2001 to january 2002 were used to carry out the simulation the estimated groundwater abstractions during these months were summed up and divided by 365 days to get an average constant daily rate of withdrawal rate the main consumer of groundwater in the maheshwaram watershed is paddy cultivation which consumes about 80 of the irrigated water maréchal et al 2006 of the total abstracted volume the total abstracted volume was about 10 mcm yr calculated from the land use landcover method and 12 mcm yr from the borewell inventory method we could observe that there exist three recharge zones in the maheshwaram watershed one zone is where recharge ranges between 150 and 200 mm yr and falls under the ibw zone the average recharge assigned to this zone is 175 mm yr fig 1 the second zone rbw zone is where recharge ranges between 100 and 150 mm yr the average recharge assigned to this zone is 125 mm yr the third zone sbw zone is where recharge ranges between 75 and 120 mm yr the average recharge value assigned to this zone is 100 mm yr as mentioned earlier the hydraulic characteristics of the two zones are different so they were assigned differently to the model the values of transmissivity and storativity for the first layer were not available and taken from the available literature viz ahmed et al 2003 dewandel et al 2012 for the second layer these parameters were assigned to the model based on the hydraulic experiments including pumping tests as well as injection tests carried out in the project ahmed et al 2003 as well as the hydraulic conductivity values from the hydraulic conductivity map dewandel et al 2012 fig 5 the recharge values were calculated from the lithologically constrained rainfall method which gives the monthly recharge values chandra et al 2012 this model was calibrated for the hydraulic conductivity and recharge by comparing the water levels the values were adjusted during trial and error runs through a sensitivity analysis test although most of the wells 98 in the watershed have provided satisfactory values we observed the underestimation in simulated water levels in the sbw zone in the rbw and ibw zone the residuals are within the range of 2 m while in the sbw zone the residuals are within the range of 3 m fig 6 4 1 2 transient condition the groundwater flow in the maheshwaram watershed is simulated in a transient regime to represent the piezometric variations observed in the bore wells from january 2001 to december 2010 using initial heads computed in 2001 under the steady state model each year in the transient model was divided mainly into 12 stress periods pre monsoon nov may and post monsoon june october each stress period was divided into 10 time steps to capture the small scale frequent variations this being semi confined to the unconfined aquifer the water levels follow the topography in the major flow direction thus the area being a perfect watershed the inflows and outflows at the boundaries are very small and balance each other all boundary meshes in the eastern and western sides that have been assigned no flow boundary condition as the groundwater flow is parallel to these boundaries the northernmost boundary where there exists a watershed exit was assigned a prescribed head boundary type 1 boundary condition the streams are non perennial and no major surface water network exists in the area except few water tanks the dykes present in the area are conducive in the ist layer weathered layer but act as barriers in the 2nd layer fractured layer fig 7 the hydraulic conductivity of the dykes in the second layer is taken as low as 1 0e 05 dewandel et al 2012 the quartz vein running in a north south direction is highly fractured and forms a very prominent linear feature of the watershed was assigned a hydraulic conductivity of 45 m d the hydraulic conductivity of the weathered layer ranges from 0 to 4 5 m d and to fractured zone as 0 45 m d the specific yield coefficient is taken to 2 0 2 4 in the weathered rocks rangarajan and rao 2004 in the fissured granite this coefficient is assumed constant at a value of 0 01 which is consistent with the pumping tests performed in the watershed maréchal et al 2004 2006 the storativity of the weathered layer has been taken as 8 10 5 and 1 10 5 for the fractured layer 4 2 sensitive analysis and validation of the model most of the wells 98 in the watershed were satisfactorily simulated but we observed an underestimation in simulated water levels in the sbw zone this may be because the zone is heavily pumped for agricultural purposes and the variation in groundwater abstraction rates during the pre monsoon nov may and post monsoon june oct in the rbw and ibw zone the residuals are within the range of 2 m while in the sbw zone the residuals are within the range of 3 m fig 8 the sensitivity analysis was carried out in general by changing aquifer characteristics limited to the first layer and the change in recharge and withdrawal values and the corresponding change in the simulated water levels were analyzed the following table table 1 describes the sensitivity analysis the comparison was made using the representative well in each zone sarah et al 2014 these representative wells were taken from an earlier study using block kriging to check through block estimation on the zone ahmed et al 2010 however the sensitivity analysis for the model revealed that the rbw zone is more sensitive to a change in groundwater abstraction as there was almost negligible change in the rms error for change in the other parameters recharge hydraulic conductivity and specific yield the sbw and ibw zones are sensitive to changes in groundwater recharge but not much sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and specific yield computed versus observed heads for each calibration target during all time steps considering a total of 891 observed data points in the entire simulation show that maximum and minimum residuals were 20 m and 0 2 m observed in rbw and sbw zones respectively with rms 5 93 m in the transient calibration statistics the numerical error is an order of 0 014 in the water mass balance during the model run to validate the data from the model we obtained the groundwater level data from ifcgr csir ngri india the validation of the model carried out using the monthly groundwater level data 2016 2020 from automatic water level recorders fitted in one observation well fig 9 falling under the rbw zone fig 9 shows the residual range within 4 m and the groundwater levels have further decreased during these years which is not captured by the model as mentioned above this zone is sensitive to change in groundwater abstraction which indicates that withdrawal conditions have changed in the watershed leading to decreased groundwater levels 4 3 projected groundwater depletion estimates to carry out the projections for groundwater status by 2025 we carried the following steps in 1st step we calculated the storage capacity of each layer using the following equation engerrand 2002 1 storage capacity i 1 n h i s s y with n the total number of meshes in the layer hi the height of the mesh in m s is the surface area of the mesh 250 m 250 m sy the specific yield of the layer 0 024 for layer 1 and 0 01 for layer 2 in the 2nd step the minimum groundwater storage of each layer has also been calculated per year using the formula engerrand 2002 2 minimum groundwater storage i 1 n h i s s y whereas h i is the hydraulic head for may calculated in the layer for each mesh we selected a hydraulic head for may to estimate the minimum groundwater storage as this is the time in the hydrological cycle where the groundwater levels are minimum to carry out these predictions we used the business as usual scenario for the recharge and changing scenario for groundwater abstraction from the previous studies the changing scenario for groundwater abstraction was used because maheshwaram is a fast urbanizing watershed and land use is also changing rapidly the assumptions made are recharge is at a constant value i e approximately 12 of the rainfall equal to the average recharge calculated between 2000 and 2015 for estimating the water demand we used the scenarios from the study of sarah et al 2014 in this scenario groundwater abstractions are set constant from 2008 to 2015 but increase by a flat 20 for domestic and industrial withdrawals in 2016 and again becomes constant from 2016 to 2025 this increase is attributed to the rapid urbanization khan et al 2011 which is mostly observed in the rbw and sbw zones fig 5 the groundwater withdrawal was estimated separately for the three zones rbw sbw and ibw sarah et al 2014 5 total groundwater volume estimation the total volume of groundwater was quantified with 10 year hydraulic head data 2000 2010 using the height of the water column area of the watershed and specific yield the height of the water column was calculated both in dry and wet seasons by subtracting the known average depth to bedrock elevation interpreted from the vertical electrical sounding and lithologs of the drilled borewells from the water level above mean sea level the method used here is specific yield s y or fillable porosity where the total volume is obtained by multiplying the height of the water column with specific yield and area overlying the aquifer the total volume of groundwater was estimated in both the dry and wet periods the equation for estimating the same is 3 v t h a s y whereas vt is the total volume of groundwater cubic meters in the aquifer h is the average height of the water column m saturated thickness 15 m and average difference between saturated thickness in dry and wet seasons is 6 m sy is the specific yield 0 01 maréchal et al 2006 and a is the area of influence of the aquifer 53 km2 with the change in fracture and porosity with depth specific yield sy also changes particularly in hard rock aquifers maréchal et al 2004 dewandel et al 2006 the previous works of maréchal et al 2006 where estimation of groundwater budgets in years 2002 and 2003 indicated that the specific yield varies insignificantly this is because the location of the water table is in the fissured layer where the water table fluctuations are small enough to influence sy so this part of the aquifer is characterized by a constant sy maréchal et al 2006 further it was demonstrated by dewandel et al 2012 that sy is constant at the watershed scale variations in this case when the water level rises and flow takes place in the first layer then only sy plays its role 5 1 estimation of contaminated groundwater volume the contaminated groundwater is the volume of contaminated groundwater with f concentrations higher than the maximum threshold limit 1 5 mg l we used the quantified mass of fluoride the threshold concentration of fluoride 1 5 mg l total groundwater volume in the aquifer and total dilution volume needed to estimate the contaminated groundwater volume here we used the pre and post monsoon averaged fluoride concentration data for the rbw sbw and ibw zones the detailed steps are mentioned below it is difficult to know the volumetric assessment of contaminated groundwater in an aquifer to overcome this first the total dilution volume also called grey water footprint by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the volume of water required to dilute pollutants until it meets the permissible water quality standards was calculated this is the volume that may or may not be present in the aquifer however certain assumptions are used here 1 the f is in the liquid phase which is readily available for the dilution process 2 the natural recharge from rainfall which dilutes the f concentration is free from f the second step included the subtraction of total groundwater volume from the dilution volume which gives the contaminated groundwater volume 4 v dt m f c f th vdt million cubic meters is the total dilution volume mf is the mass of the f present in the aquifer c f th is the threshold concentration of the f after computing all the above described components the volume of the contaminated groundwater in the aquifer was estimated by the relation shown below 5 v c v dt v t v c mcm is the contaminated groundwater volume with f concentrations above the threshold limit 1 5 mg l undiluted groundwater volume with f concentration above the threshold limit even after recharge during the wet period defines the contaminated volume hence dilution volume required but not compensated from recharge was subtracted from the change in storage as this volume of groundwater is considered undiluted or contaminated 5 2 mass of the fluoride in groundwater the mass of the m f f is calculated by multiplying the total volume of groundwater with the actual average concentration of the f 6 m f v t c f where vt is the total volume of groundwater and c f is the actual average f concentration in groundwater 2 mg l in rbw zone 2 5 mg l in ibw zone and 4 mg l in sbw zone 5 3 computation of change in storage δs physical groundwater loss or gain the computation of change in groundwater storage δs estimation was done with the double water table fluctuation method dwtf maréchal et al 2006 gec 1997 the dwtf method eqs 5 and 6 is a method where δs is calculated by multiplying the groundwater table fluctuations i e δh with the specific yield sy of the aquifer meinzer 1923 meinzer and stearns 1929 healy and cook 2002 7 δ s d r y δh dry s y a 8 δ s wet δh wet s y a where δh m is the water level fluctuation for the respective periods dry or wet sy is the specific yield or the fillable porosity of the unconfined aquifer and a is the areal extent of the aquifer in the double water table fluctuation method a hydrological year is divided into two seasons i e dry and wet the storage change is estimated separately in the dry season when there is no natural recharge and in the wet season when recharge occurs where δsdry and δswet are the changes in storage during the dry november may and wet june october periods δhdry and δhwet are the water level fluctuations in the two periods respectively sarah et al 2014 5 4 computation of virtual groundwater loss revised change in storage δs given below is the equation for estimating the revised change in storage δs δs δs v c where δs is the revised change in storage δs is the already estimated change in storage and vc is the already estimated volume of contaminated groundwater it should be noted that the contaminated volumes that were not diluted even during the wet period after recharge were subtracted from the change in storage water balance this means that contamination is very high and recharge is too low to affect the contaminated volume this was done to avoid any misleading calculations when estimating the revised change in storage 5 5 uncertainties associated with the method the fluoride concentration is believed to have high lateral and vertical variability indicating a strong stratification of groundwater with a general increase of the f concentration with depth the watershed also shows the existence of hydrochemical compartments maréchal et al 2018 although our volume concentration method takes into consideration the lateral variability of the watershed in terms of compartmentation it does not take into account the vertical heterogeneity of the watershed with respect to f concentration which may give rise to estimation uncertainties moreover we assume that f in the aquifer is readily available for dilution which may not be the case always 6 results and discussions 6 1 contaminated groundwater volume vc the set of equations eqs 3 6 is used to quantify the contaminated groundwater volume vc the volume of contaminated water vc is a state indicator that has been useful to know the present status and future trends in groundwater quality and has also helped to analyze and visualize groundwater quality contamination both in space and time the dilution from rainfall controls the natural attenuation of fluoride in groundwater also visible in pre monsoon prm and post monsoon pom fluoride concentration in the watershed fig 10 the quantification of the contaminated volumes in the watershed shows that natural recharge approximately ranging from 9 to 12 of rainfall sarah et al 2014 rangarajan and athavale 2000 has been effective in controlling the contamination this may not be always the case especially in over exploited closed basin aquifers where groundwater abstraction solute addition from the irrigation return flow and contamination are high and recharge is too low to compensate for the withdrawal rates and dilute the contaminated groundwater the positive dilution volumes indicate that the concentration of the fluoride in the groundwater is above the threshold or permissible limit of f 1 5 mg l and some dilution volume is required but not present in the aquifer to bring down the concentrations below the threshold limit hence these undiluted volumes of contaminated groundwater in the aquifer are converted into the contaminated volume negative dilution volume indicates that f concentration in the aquifer is below the threshold limit 1 5 mg l and no dilution is required hence water in the aquifer is non contaminated although the f contamination is still present in the aquifer this concentration is below or equal to the f permissible limits i e 1 5 mg l who 2020 if the contamination is high in the non monsoon period but reaches the threshold limit or below 1 5 mg l in the monsoon period the contaminated volumes are assumed to be in control hence not considered if we look at the overall picture of the watershed in the years 2002 2004 2005 2006 and 2009 both contamination and the virtual groundwater loss is high despite the natural recharge fig 10 and fig 11 also being high the natural recharge is not enough to dilute the fluoride concentration and bring it down the threshold value the volume of fresh water that should be added to this contaminated groundwater is unavailable the possible reason under such conditions is that the aquifer is highly contaminated by f fluoride concentrations sometimes show an increasing trend both in pre and post monsoon seasons in the watershed attributed to an increased residence time of groundwater because of the endothermic nature of the watershed or different recharge mechanisms due to the discontinuity of the hard rock aquifer systems pauwels et al 2015 alazard et al 2015 6 2 role of compartmentalization factor considering the compartmentalization in the watershed the scenario turns different in different zones the groundwater loss gain during 10 years 2001 2010 by the aquifer in the ibw zone is shown in fig 12 it is observed that this zone has gained 3 03 mcm groundwater during a decade however considering the groundwater contamination it is observed that the virtual groundwater loss is 1 06 mcm the rbw zone fig 12 in the maheshwaram watershed has gained groundwater 1 3 mcm in 10 years 2001 2010 on the other hand the estimation of virtual groundwater loss shows that the misleading conclusion can be drawn from the storage estimations devoid of quantification of contaminated groundwater taking the effects of groundwater contamination on the quantity of groundwater into consideration it is noted that the same rbw zone has lost 4 5 mcm in a decade however in the sbw zone fig 12 groundwater losses both physical 0 53 mcm and virtual 16 mcm are relatively much higher in 10 years 2001 2010 from this observation it is concluded that the contamination and recharge relationship is controlled by different hydraulic conductivity zones in the watershed e g sbw zone has more natural dykes than rbw and ibw zone which can influence the dilution from recharge as well as solute transport 6 3 virtual groundwater loss the differences in physical and virtual groundwater losses observed in these zones are attributed to factors like the different concentrations of fluoride volumes of abstracted groundwater different recharge population density and urbanization for instance the groundwater abstraction reported in the rbw zone is 6 mcm 4 mcm in the ibw zone and 5 mcm in the sbw zone sarah et al 2014 while as average recharge in the rbw zone is 125 mm yr 175 mm yr in ibw zone and 100 mm yr in sbw zone the contamination of groundwater low recharge conditions over exploitation higher population coupled with fast urbanization sarah 2013 has proved to be detrimental for the groundwater resource in the zones rbw and sbw apart from that the water rock interaction plays a key role in the fluoride accumulation as the groundwater exploitation increases the water rock interaction time and higher irrigation return flow containing anthropogenic sources like fertilizers contribute to the near surface fluoride accumulation hem 1985 saxena and ahmed 2003 milnes and renard 2004 sreedevi et al 2006 perrin et al 2011 pauwels et al 2015 the higher groundwater abstraction for agricultural purposes in the zones rbw and sbw also means higher irrigation return flow as 30 40 of the abstracted groundwater returns to the aquifer in the dry season and 40 50 in the wet season maréchal et al 2006 which is a major contributor of fluoride contamination and higher virtual loss of groundwater in these zones the estimation of physical and virtual groundwater loss demonstrates the combined effect of groundwater exploitation and contamination on the groundwater resource the virtual loss is the groundwater lost through contamination as the deterioration of groundwater quality is gradual and may not be recognized until large volumes have been affected foster and chilton 2004 which may take thousands of years it is observed that if the volume of fresh water that should be added to the contaminated groundwater to dilute it to acceptable levels is greater than the change in groundwater storage groundwater can be considered conditionally renewable this scenario seems difficult in rbw and sbw zones where the rate of recharge is low and groundwater abstraction is high the quantification of the contaminated groundwater volume shows all the zones of the watershed are sensitive to contamination the zones rbw and sbw are over sensitive to contamination which means judicious planning and management of groundwater resources is required in these two zones to maintain sustainability and ensure renewability of all the three zones sbw zone is the most sensitive zone as far as quality degradation of groundwater is concerned the groundwater resource in this zone has been converted into a non renewable groundwater resource because of continued over exploitation and quality deterioration the vulnerability of these zones to contamination demonstrates that industrial urbanization and over exploitation will prove detrimental to the groundwater resource various studies in the watershed discussed above show that f contamination will persist and may even worsen the aquifer conditions in the maheshwaram watershed shows that the aquifer is suffering both from depletion and contamination the recharge events unless bigger may not recover the renewability of the aquifer it can take years to replenish the quality of the groundwater resource in these conditions here the contamination not only results in a reduction in the volume of immediately usable water but also challenges the concept of quantitative groundwater renewability 6 4 projected aquifer depletion and total groundwater volume if groundwater abstractions exceed recharge and are not balanced by increased recharge and decreased discharge over several years a long term decline of hydraulic heads and groundwater storage i e groundwater depletion will result döll et al 2014 this is what is happening in the maheshwaram watershed according to bierkens and wada 2019 groundwater gets disconnected from the stream when its level drops below the river bed due to excessive withdrawal rates the maheshwaram watershed is also experiencing a basin closure induced by accelerated groundwater table decline as the surface water system has disconnected perrin et al 2011 fig 13 demonstrates the multi year variability of total groundwater volume showing episodic depletion and recovery but the increased withdrawal rates and limited precipitation in years 2002 2004 2006 and 2009 have caused large depletion rates which are not balanced by the partial recovery of the water table through recharge during the wet season however the trend shows a slight groundwater depletion fig 14 the aquifer shows a negative change in storage groundwater loss in poor monsoon years 2002 2004 2006 and 2009 fig 11 the groundwater modeling carried out using predictive scenarios see section 4 3 reveals that the watershed will experience watershed desaturation and the groundwater reserves may be depleted in most of the parts of the watershed by 2025 fig 15 the water demand by 2025 will reach 1 5e 07 m3 year but the available groundwater storage fig 15 and fig 16 in optimal groundwater storage zones is 3 5e 07 m3 year and 2 5e 07 m3 year in low groundwater storage zones in depleted groundwater storage zones the groundwater demand is more than storage 1 8e 07 m3 year most of the wells will get dry in depleted zones and the recharge from precipitation would not be optimal to increase the storage in the low groundwater storage zones the aquifer will be entirely dependent on recharge in the case of the maheshwaram watershed because of its semi arid climate it is already low 12 of the total rainfall rangarajan and athavale 2000 the groundwater is considered conditionally renewable under these conditions the long term assessment and estimation of revised change in storage or revised water balance show the trends that provide information on the functioning of the system or its response to contamination for instance in the watersheds like maheshwaram facing groundwater depletion and contamination at the same time groundwater quality studies must be incorporated with quantitative studies to eliminate any misleading information coming out from these studies when combined these studies will prove effective in any planning and management of the stressed water resources in these types of fragile and contaminated watersheds this indicator shows that the watershed is sensitive to contamination as the groundwater resource is highly vulnerable because of continued over exploitation and quality deterioration as well as low replenishment from recharge 6 5 implications of aquifer depletion and the new insights from the concept of virtual groundwater loss studying the hydrodynamics and contaminant concentration in both space and time with different zones provides an important study regarding the efficient management of groundwater resources in over exploited watersheds suffering contamination investigation in different compartments of the watershed having different recharge conditions groundwater withdrawal rates and hydrodynamics reveals that while designing and outlining the policies for aquifer management the local heterogeneities must be taken into consideration for these to be successful based on this sensitivities and vulnerability of the zones to over exploitation contamination should be evaluated e g the groundwater depletion status virtual groundwater loss and contamination in all three zones of the watershed provide an altogether different picture when studied as different units and need different management approaches for instance the sensitivity analysis of the numerical groundwater model see section 4 4 demonstrates that lowering the groundwater abstraction rate in the rbw zone can recover the groundwater quality and storage as this zone is more sensitive to groundwater abstraction while as managed aquifer recharge in the zones ibw and sbw can prove more beneficial for the aquifer system to restore its quality and depletion as this zone is sensitive to recharge the gradually lowering aquifer volumes and aquifer depletion in most parts of this semi arid watershed by 2025 may give rise to food security concerns and economic crisis among the farmers as most of the people in this watershed depend on paddy cultivation for their livelihood under the absence or lowering of groundwater reserves sustaining agriculture is difficult as india is an agrarian economy this comprehensive study in the maheshwaram watershed provides an example of alarming situations rising from aquifer depletion and contamination in hard rock aquifers of india where surface water resources are limited the virtual groundwater loss which is a new concept of quantifying the contamination and subtracting the contaminated groundwater volume also provides new insights for the management of aquifers for instance in the case of the maheshwaram watershed the quantification of decadal groundwater change in storage indicates ibw and rbw zones have gained groundwater however the quantification of contaminated groundwater volume and its subtraction from the groundwater storage in all three zones shows that the quantitative groundwater studies provide a false picture of groundwater status and hence failure in management policies in stressed aquifer systems 7 conclusion the integrated studies of the spatio temporal quantification of contaminated groundwater volume and groundwater depletion through volume concentration relationship hydraulic head monitoring and groundwater modeling respectively advances our understanding of groundwater contamination coupled with groundwater depletion the study indicates that hard rock aquifers having discontinuities do not behave as single units rather different units dominantly governed by local heterogeneities the series of equations eqs 3 6 formulated to quantify the contaminated groundwater volume can be used to quantify contamination in aquifers with similar climatic and geological settings the contaminated depleting aquifers are proving to be a major challenge in watershed governance policy and management plans this study takes into consideration the compartmentalization of the aquifer system investigates both groundwater storage and virtual groundwater loss in space and time to provide a comprehensive picture of the hard rock aquifers in over exploited watersheds the newly introduced concept of virtual groundwater loss indicates that a certain amount of groundwater in the system which remains contaminated beyond the permissible limit for a considerably long period cannot be taken as a resource the groundwater quantity estimates devoid of contamination investigations in fragile and overexploited aquifers can be misleading it should be taken care of while designing the management and decision making involving watershed policies considering the compartmentalization at the watershed scale the groundwater resource is conditionally renewable the management policies which may work in one unit of the aquifer may fail in another unit of the same aquifer owing to their different recharge mechanisms and rates withdrawal rates geological heterogeneities the study predicts the status of the groundwater reserves by 2025 where most of the watershed will face desaturation and virtual groundwater loss will also make groundwater resources conditionally renewable this study can be replicable to any watershed with similar geological and hydrogeological settings however it further needs a real time simulation of soil moisture movement in the unsaturated zone rock water interaction and investigation of vertical f variability as the f concentration generally increases

4636,the lack of comprehensive studies involving the quantification of groundwater depletion and aquifer deterioration has challenged the sustainable management of groundwater resources in semi arid regions in this study we formulated a new pragmatic relationship consisting of a set of equations to quantify contaminated groundwater volume and groundwater virtually lost through contamination we also used extensive monitoring of the hydraulic head and its spatio temporal variations as well as groundwater modeling to quantify total aquifer volume aquifer storage and aquifer depletion the watershed is divided into three distinct zones based on groundwater level fluctuations and recharge intermediate borewell zone ibw random borewell zone rbw and slow borewell zone sbw zones this study provides an advanced understanding of the relationship between aquifer depletion geogenic contamination and the resultant virtual groundwater loss our long term study reveals a negative change in storage groundwater loss in poor monsoon years and a reduction in total groundwater volume which can result in aquifer depletion over time and low groundwater reserves the decadal estimations of groundwater gain loss for a period of ten years 2001 2010 in the ibw zone of the aquifer show a groundwater gain of 3 03 mcm million cubic metes but at the same time this zone has virtually lost 1 06 mcm to contamination similarly 1 3 mcm gain is estimated in the rbw zone and 0 53 mcm loss of groundwater is estimated in the sbw the virtual groundwater losses through contamination in rbw and sbw zones are 4 5 mcm and 16 mcm in such a situation an aquifer depletion stage beyond an economic level will be reached in most of the watershed in a few years the contamination in these years is also high which may result in virtual loss through contamination under such conditions the groundwater resource may be conditionally renewable as a part of the groundwater volume remains contaminated and unusable these results highlight the need to understand the interconnection between groundwater contamination and continued over exploitation which gradually moves towards aquifer depletion and conditionally renewable groundwater resources keywords sustainable groundwater management groundwater depletion hard rock aquifers semi arid aquifers groundwater contamination 1 introduction groundwater is an integral component of the hydrological system recent investigations like hydrological modeling wada et al 2014 and earth observations rodell et al 2009a 2009b famiglietti 2014 have quantified alarming rates of groundwater depletion globally the sustainable groundwater development is not only constrained by resource availability but also by quality deterioration morris et al 2003 wada et al s 2010 study carried out in sub humid and arid regions states that total global groundwater depletion during the period of 40 years 1960 2000 has increased from 126 32 km3 yr in 1960 to 283 40 km3 yr over exploitation and excessive pumping can lead to groundwater depletion where groundwater is extracted at a faster rate than it can be replenished this eventually renders a groundwater system vulnerable to contamination pollution and degradation the availability of groundwater and the suitability of its quality for different uses are inextricably intertwined alley et al 1999 many researchers have carried out considerable work on groundwater sustainability and related factors like quantification of sustainability metrics pandey et al 2011 gleeson et al 2012a global groundwater assessments and stress indices richey et al 2015 the impacts of groundwater withdrawals on global groundwater storage gleeson et al 2012b döll et al 2012 and temporal changes in groundwater storage influence the complex interactions in global aquifer systems thomas et al 2017 however limited research has been carried out to study the integrated effects of groundwater depletion and groundwater contamination on groundwater sustainability and renewability the objective of our study is to quantify spatio temporal aquifer depletion through hydraulic head monitoring and groundwater modeling at a watershed scale as well as quantify contaminated groundwater volume through volume concentration relationship to investigate virtual groundwater loss from the aquifer system we introduce a new concept of virtual groundwater loss through contamination our concept of virtual groundwater loss through contamination is different from the definitions provided by allan 1998 hoekstra chapagain 2008 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 which state that virtual water and water footprint is the amount of water embedded in an agricultural product and covers the entire food supply chain from production to delivery including pollution produced in the process between the interconnected regions involving exchange however our concept of virtual groundwater loss considers the volume of the contaminated groundwater physically available in the aquifer but not fit for use we use the term virtual groundwater loss as this volume is present in the aquifer but cannot be considered a part of groundwater resource as it is contaminated beyond the permissible limit this is an entirely new concept and the novelty and uniqueness of the study is its ability to quantify the contaminated groundwater volume using the volume concentration relation this research generates an idea about the degraded volume of groundwater in an aquifer aquifer depletion through ground based observations like hydraulic head monitoring and numerical modeling effects of dilution from rainfall as well as solutes from irrigation return flow the scope of the study is an overview and new insights to understand the integrated effects of groundwater depletion and aquifer contamination as well as advance our understanding of groundwater renewability and sustainable groundwater resource management this study was performed on the southern india watershed maheshwaram as this region is witnessing alarming declines in groundwater resources as well as fluoride contamination and data time series of 10 years was used the watershed consists of a hard rock aquifer system and semi arid climate 2 site description the maheshwaram watershed 53 km2 fig 1 in telangana india is a hard rock formation composed of archean granites of the hyderabad group the mean annual precipitation is 750 mm which occurs as rainfall in the monsoon season june october the potential evapotranspiration is 1800 mm the watershed has a nearly flat topography with elevations ranging from 590 to 670 m amsl meters above mean sea level sarah et al 2014 paddy is the predominant cultivation of the area consuming the major part of the irrigation water khan et al 2011 2 1 geology the geology of the watershed of medium to coarse grained archean granites of the hyderabad group the fine grained leucocratic granite is found in the south west and southern parts of the watershed fig 1 the geological features present in the watershed are highly fractured quartz veins running in a north south direction and dolerite dykes fractures also form the dominant structural features in the watershed the weathering profile is composed of red soil 10 40 cm forming a thin layer followed by a 1 3 m thick layer of sandy regolith and laminated saprolite layer having a thickness of 10 15 m the latter is followed by fissured unweathered granite having a thickness of 15 20 m which is followed by almost unfractured bedrock composed of granite the weathered rock has an average depth of 11 m while that of fractured rock is 18 m fractures are the dominant structural features of the study area gsi 2002 maréchal et al 2004 2006 dewandel et al 2006 zaidi et al 2007 ahmed et al 2010 the unweathered bedrock is permeable only where tectonic fractures are present 2 2 hydrogeology and hydrodynamic properties of the aquifer the aquifer is considered as a two tier aquifer system because of the laminated saprolite and fissured layer which has poor storage capacity while the saprolite layer has poor transmissivity but high storage capacity dewandel et al 2006 the two zones viz weathered and fractured form the aquifer but have no separation layer as typically found in granitic aquifers these zones have very different hydraulic characteristics another peculiar structure in the area is many dolerite dykes much younger than the host granites some dykes are not exposed to the surface and at exposed surfaces they are fragmented from the top to a certain depth behaving as conduits this property is of significance in the case of depleting aquifer such as the one under study the water table lies as deep as 15 25 m below ground level bgl the water table variation from south to north fig 2 is approximately 9 m 610 and 619 amsl the study carried out by maréchal et al 2006 in this watershed states that irf irrigation return flow to the aquifer is between 70 and 90 mm year and the range of natural recharge from rainfall is 55 200 mm year the various hydraulic tests like slug tests and flowmeter measurements carried out in the watershed at different scales have been used to investigate the hydrodynamic properties of the aquifers it was observed that the average hydraulic conductivities obtained with slug tests in the near vicinity of the wells is kaverage 4 4 10 6 m s whereas the injection tests with flowmeter measurements revealed the depth of the conductive fracture zones cfz and their hydraulic conductivities which is kaverage 8 8 10 5 m s through these tests it is observed that the extension of the most conductive part of the weathered fractured layer is 35 m deep a double porosity model used for distinguishing the part of drainage porosity located in the blocks 90 drainage porosity of bocks sb 5 7 10 3 from that linked to fractures 10 drainage porosity of the fractures sf 5 8 10 4 maréchal et al 2018 the packer and injection tests carried in the watershed show that a highly permeable part of the aquifer is located at the interface between the saprolite bottom and the top of the fractured layer boisson et al 2015 this highly permeable part of the aquifer is considered to play a significant role in the aquifer connectivity maréchal et al 2018 2 3 environmental issues maheshwaram watershed is experiencing the basin closure and baseflow has ceased to contribute to the surface water kumar and ahmed 2007 maréchal et al 2006 groundwater contamination and over exploitation are the main environmental problems of the watershed moreover the watershed is contaminated with fluoride which poses a threat to drinking water for local inhabitants as mentioned earlier the geology of the watershed is composed of archean granites according to atal et al 2009 the main processes responsible for the geogenic release of fluoride is the alteration of biotite producing kaolinite through intermediate weathering stages of chlorite and fluoro apatite through rock dissolution the anthropogenic sources of fluoride are attributed to evaporation in the paddy fields and water rock interaction of irrigation return flow pauwels et al 2011 3 materials and methods 3 1 compartmentalization of the watershed and its effects on hydrochemistry the work carried out by guihéneuf et al 2014 sarah et al 2014 highlighted the aquifer connectivity under different water table conditions guihéneuf et al 2014 report that the aquifer moves from regional to local flow conditions under varied water table fluctuations e g under the low water table conditions which are usually noticed during the pre monsoon period lateral compartmentalization is induced by the smaller lateral extensions of deeper fractures the changes in the hydraulic connectivity because of water table fluctuations and discontinuities also affect groundwater chemistry and solute transport maréchal et al 2018 the temporal evolution of hydrochemical data and different recharge mechanisms observed in the maheshwaram watershed demonstrates the stratification in the groundwater chemistry local geochemical heterogeneity varied hydraulic connectivity and preferential flow paths perrin et al 2011 alazard et al 2015 maréchal et al 2018 attribute the spatial variations in groundwater chemistry to different residence times water rock interaction times because of different transmissivity zones within the compartment sarah et al 2014 divided the maheshwaram watershed into three zones to capture the hydrogeological heterogeneity the division is based on the correlation of amplitude of water table fluctuations and slope of rise and fall to recharge in this paper we used the same zones to capture the chemical heterogeneity and avoid the uncertainties due to compartmentalization pointed out by the previous works the three zones fig 1 are classified as rapid borewell zone rbw where the amplitude of the water level fluctuation can reach 15 m and the peak of the water level is attained in less than two months after the first rainfall event of the monsoon the slow borewell zone sbw shows very slow responses to rainfall i e the peak of the water level is attained in more than two months the amplitude of the fluctuation is less than 6 m in the sbw the intermediate borewell zone ibw where borewells show an intermediate response to rainfall neither comparatively fast nor slow water level variations and with amplitudes of 8 m sarah et al 2014 fluoride f was taken as the main contaminant in the watershed the fluoride concentration in the watershed varies from 0 5 to 7 5 mg l fig 3 approximately varying both temporally as well as spatially the fluoride data in the watershed were collected from various fluoride concentration measuring campaigns carried out from 2001 to 2010 under certain projects taken by indo french center for groundwater research india the higher f concentrations up to 17 3 mg l have also been reported by pauwels et al 2015 these concentrations are reduced after recharge from the rainfall and the minimum concentrations are observed in the post monsoon period when groundwater levels are at their peak after being recharged from the rainfall which also creates a dilution effect on the f concentrations fig 3 further investigations by pauwels et al 2015 through borehole logging demonstrated a strong stratification of groundwater with respect to f which increases with the increasing depth and residence time the groundwater in the maheshwaram watershed is undersaturated with respect to fluorite and almost supersaturated to calcite pettenati et al 2013 sreedevi et al 2006 further suggests that f enrichment of the groundwater is likely to continue in the future in the absence of precipitation and the continued groundwater over exploitation further irrigation return flow irf forms the major water budget component maréchal et al 2006 of the study area adding up more solute concentration to the aquifer perrin et al 2012 further state that irrigation return flow can contribute to as much as half of the aquifer recharge in the future and the water table evaporation is insignificant in this case low recharge rates and higher irf can worsen the problem as natural recharge is too low to produce a dilution effect for f 3 2 data set water level water quality and geometry of the aquifer the monthly water level recordings were taken manually as well as from automatic water level recorders fitted in the observation wells named ifps indo french project piezometers the monitoring network consists of 25 borewells negligibly influenced by the pumping in the nearby wells zaidi et al 2007 the observation period selected from the study is ten years from 2001 to 2010 the f samples 50 80 season were taken from both the irrigation wells named ifw and ifp indo french monitoring network borewells and the data repository of the indo french centre for groundwater research fig 1 the collected samples were analyzed for major and trace elements determined in the laboratory using ion chromatography and icpms inductive coupled plasma mass spectrophotometer the average concentration of the f in the rbw zone is 2 mg l while as minimum concentration is 0 8 mg l and the maximum is 2 5 mg l while in the ibw zone the average fluoride concentration is 2 5 mg l of fluoride the minimum and maximum f concentration is 1 5 mg l and 3 5 mg l respectively in the sbw zone the maximum f concentration is 7 5 mg l and the minimum is 2 5 mg l while as average f concentration is 4 mg l the depth to bedrock elevation the limit between weathered and fractured layers was interpreted from the vertical electric sounding electrical resistivity tomography and lithologs of the ifp indo french project observational borewells engerrand 2002 the altitude of the base of the weathered and fractured layer is shown in fig 4 engerrand 2002 4 depletion estimates by groundwater modeling and quantification of total aquifer volume through a change in storage maheshwaram watershed is modeled with visual modflow flex software developed by schlumberger this was used to build a conceptual model of the watershed and then numerical modeling was carried using modflow harbaugh 2005 the watershed is taken as a two layer system the first one as porous formation representing the weathered layer the aquifer in the weathered layer is dry during the simulation period with comparatively low variability in hydraulic conductivity the first layer is simulated as an equivalent porous medium representing weathered zone and the second layer is simulated as a dual porosity medium priscu 1997 kim and lee 2000 altinors and onder 2010 ghasemizadeh et al 2015 representing the fissured fractured zone without any confining layer in between with highly variable hydraulic conductivity ahmed and sreedevi 2003 hence the aquifer simulated is a single aquifer consisting of two distinct layers viz weathered zone and the fissured fractured zone thus the two layers have different system characteristics but with a single value of the water level the entire area was divided into meshes of 250 m by 250 m size giving about 1200 meshes in each layer a reasonably optimal size for a hard rock aquifer system 4 1 model set up and calibration the model set up and calibration is discussed in the following sections 4 1 1 steady state condition in the steady state condition the model was run for 365 days and the recharge during the wet period and averaged groundwater withdrawal values for the period of one year january 2001 to january 2002 were used to carry out the simulation the estimated groundwater abstractions during these months were summed up and divided by 365 days to get an average constant daily rate of withdrawal rate the main consumer of groundwater in the maheshwaram watershed is paddy cultivation which consumes about 80 of the irrigated water maréchal et al 2006 of the total abstracted volume the total abstracted volume was about 10 mcm yr calculated from the land use landcover method and 12 mcm yr from the borewell inventory method we could observe that there exist three recharge zones in the maheshwaram watershed one zone is where recharge ranges between 150 and 200 mm yr and falls under the ibw zone the average recharge assigned to this zone is 175 mm yr fig 1 the second zone rbw zone is where recharge ranges between 100 and 150 mm yr the average recharge assigned to this zone is 125 mm yr the third zone sbw zone is where recharge ranges between 75 and 120 mm yr the average recharge value assigned to this zone is 100 mm yr as mentioned earlier the hydraulic characteristics of the two zones are different so they were assigned differently to the model the values of transmissivity and storativity for the first layer were not available and taken from the available literature viz ahmed et al 2003 dewandel et al 2012 for the second layer these parameters were assigned to the model based on the hydraulic experiments including pumping tests as well as injection tests carried out in the project ahmed et al 2003 as well as the hydraulic conductivity values from the hydraulic conductivity map dewandel et al 2012 fig 5 the recharge values were calculated from the lithologically constrained rainfall method which gives the monthly recharge values chandra et al 2012 this model was calibrated for the hydraulic conductivity and recharge by comparing the water levels the values were adjusted during trial and error runs through a sensitivity analysis test although most of the wells 98 in the watershed have provided satisfactory values we observed the underestimation in simulated water levels in the sbw zone in the rbw and ibw zone the residuals are within the range of 2 m while in the sbw zone the residuals are within the range of 3 m fig 6 4 1 2 transient condition the groundwater flow in the maheshwaram watershed is simulated in a transient regime to represent the piezometric variations observed in the bore wells from january 2001 to december 2010 using initial heads computed in 2001 under the steady state model each year in the transient model was divided mainly into 12 stress periods pre monsoon nov may and post monsoon june october each stress period was divided into 10 time steps to capture the small scale frequent variations this being semi confined to the unconfined aquifer the water levels follow the topography in the major flow direction thus the area being a perfect watershed the inflows and outflows at the boundaries are very small and balance each other all boundary meshes in the eastern and western sides that have been assigned no flow boundary condition as the groundwater flow is parallel to these boundaries the northernmost boundary where there exists a watershed exit was assigned a prescribed head boundary type 1 boundary condition the streams are non perennial and no major surface water network exists in the area except few water tanks the dykes present in the area are conducive in the ist layer weathered layer but act as barriers in the 2nd layer fractured layer fig 7 the hydraulic conductivity of the dykes in the second layer is taken as low as 1 0e 05 dewandel et al 2012 the quartz vein running in a north south direction is highly fractured and forms a very prominent linear feature of the watershed was assigned a hydraulic conductivity of 45 m d the hydraulic conductivity of the weathered layer ranges from 0 to 4 5 m d and to fractured zone as 0 45 m d the specific yield coefficient is taken to 2 0 2 4 in the weathered rocks rangarajan and rao 2004 in the fissured granite this coefficient is assumed constant at a value of 0 01 which is consistent with the pumping tests performed in the watershed maréchal et al 2004 2006 the storativity of the weathered layer has been taken as 8 10 5 and 1 10 5 for the fractured layer 4 2 sensitive analysis and validation of the model most of the wells 98 in the watershed were satisfactorily simulated but we observed an underestimation in simulated water levels in the sbw zone this may be because the zone is heavily pumped for agricultural purposes and the variation in groundwater abstraction rates during the pre monsoon nov may and post monsoon june oct in the rbw and ibw zone the residuals are within the range of 2 m while in the sbw zone the residuals are within the range of 3 m fig 8 the sensitivity analysis was carried out in general by changing aquifer characteristics limited to the first layer and the change in recharge and withdrawal values and the corresponding change in the simulated water levels were analyzed the following table table 1 describes the sensitivity analysis the comparison was made using the representative well in each zone sarah et al 2014 these representative wells were taken from an earlier study using block kriging to check through block estimation on the zone ahmed et al 2010 however the sensitivity analysis for the model revealed that the rbw zone is more sensitive to a change in groundwater abstraction as there was almost negligible change in the rms error for change in the other parameters recharge hydraulic conductivity and specific yield the sbw and ibw zones are sensitive to changes in groundwater recharge but not much sensitive to hydraulic conductivity and specific yield computed versus observed heads for each calibration target during all time steps considering a total of 891 observed data points in the entire simulation show that maximum and minimum residuals were 20 m and 0 2 m observed in rbw and sbw zones respectively with rms 5 93 m in the transient calibration statistics the numerical error is an order of 0 014 in the water mass balance during the model run to validate the data from the model we obtained the groundwater level data from ifcgr csir ngri india the validation of the model carried out using the monthly groundwater level data 2016 2020 from automatic water level recorders fitted in one observation well fig 9 falling under the rbw zone fig 9 shows the residual range within 4 m and the groundwater levels have further decreased during these years which is not captured by the model as mentioned above this zone is sensitive to change in groundwater abstraction which indicates that withdrawal conditions have changed in the watershed leading to decreased groundwater levels 4 3 projected groundwater depletion estimates to carry out the projections for groundwater status by 2025 we carried the following steps in 1st step we calculated the storage capacity of each layer using the following equation engerrand 2002 1 storage capacity i 1 n h i s s y with n the total number of meshes in the layer hi the height of the mesh in m s is the surface area of the mesh 250 m 250 m sy the specific yield of the layer 0 024 for layer 1 and 0 01 for layer 2 in the 2nd step the minimum groundwater storage of each layer has also been calculated per year using the formula engerrand 2002 2 minimum groundwater storage i 1 n h i s s y whereas h i is the hydraulic head for may calculated in the layer for each mesh we selected a hydraulic head for may to estimate the minimum groundwater storage as this is the time in the hydrological cycle where the groundwater levels are minimum to carry out these predictions we used the business as usual scenario for the recharge and changing scenario for groundwater abstraction from the previous studies the changing scenario for groundwater abstraction was used because maheshwaram is a fast urbanizing watershed and land use is also changing rapidly the assumptions made are recharge is at a constant value i e approximately 12 of the rainfall equal to the average recharge calculated between 2000 and 2015 for estimating the water demand we used the scenarios from the study of sarah et al 2014 in this scenario groundwater abstractions are set constant from 2008 to 2015 but increase by a flat 20 for domestic and industrial withdrawals in 2016 and again becomes constant from 2016 to 2025 this increase is attributed to the rapid urbanization khan et al 2011 which is mostly observed in the rbw and sbw zones fig 5 the groundwater withdrawal was estimated separately for the three zones rbw sbw and ibw sarah et al 2014 5 total groundwater volume estimation the total volume of groundwater was quantified with 10 year hydraulic head data 2000 2010 using the height of the water column area of the watershed and specific yield the height of the water column was calculated both in dry and wet seasons by subtracting the known average depth to bedrock elevation interpreted from the vertical electrical sounding and lithologs of the drilled borewells from the water level above mean sea level the method used here is specific yield s y or fillable porosity where the total volume is obtained by multiplying the height of the water column with specific yield and area overlying the aquifer the total volume of groundwater was estimated in both the dry and wet periods the equation for estimating the same is 3 v t h a s y whereas vt is the total volume of groundwater cubic meters in the aquifer h is the average height of the water column m saturated thickness 15 m and average difference between saturated thickness in dry and wet seasons is 6 m sy is the specific yield 0 01 maréchal et al 2006 and a is the area of influence of the aquifer 53 km2 with the change in fracture and porosity with depth specific yield sy also changes particularly in hard rock aquifers maréchal et al 2004 dewandel et al 2006 the previous works of maréchal et al 2006 where estimation of groundwater budgets in years 2002 and 2003 indicated that the specific yield varies insignificantly this is because the location of the water table is in the fissured layer where the water table fluctuations are small enough to influence sy so this part of the aquifer is characterized by a constant sy maréchal et al 2006 further it was demonstrated by dewandel et al 2012 that sy is constant at the watershed scale variations in this case when the water level rises and flow takes place in the first layer then only sy plays its role 5 1 estimation of contaminated groundwater volume the contaminated groundwater is the volume of contaminated groundwater with f concentrations higher than the maximum threshold limit 1 5 mg l we used the quantified mass of fluoride the threshold concentration of fluoride 1 5 mg l total groundwater volume in the aquifer and total dilution volume needed to estimate the contaminated groundwater volume here we used the pre and post monsoon averaged fluoride concentration data for the rbw sbw and ibw zones the detailed steps are mentioned below it is difficult to know the volumetric assessment of contaminated groundwater in an aquifer to overcome this first the total dilution volume also called grey water footprint by hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 the volume of water required to dilute pollutants until it meets the permissible water quality standards was calculated this is the volume that may or may not be present in the aquifer however certain assumptions are used here 1 the f is in the liquid phase which is readily available for the dilution process 2 the natural recharge from rainfall which dilutes the f concentration is free from f the second step included the subtraction of total groundwater volume from the dilution volume which gives the contaminated groundwater volume 4 v dt m f c f th vdt million cubic meters is the total dilution volume mf is the mass of the f present in the aquifer c f th is the threshold concentration of the f after computing all the above described components the volume of the contaminated groundwater in the aquifer was estimated by the relation shown below 5 v c v dt v t v c mcm is the contaminated groundwater volume with f concentrations above the threshold limit 1 5 mg l undiluted groundwater volume with f concentration above the threshold limit even after recharge during the wet period defines the contaminated volume hence dilution volume required but not compensated from recharge was subtracted from the change in storage as this volume of groundwater is considered undiluted or contaminated 5 2 mass of the fluoride in groundwater the mass of the m f f is calculated by multiplying the total volume of groundwater with the actual average concentration of the f 6 m f v t c f where vt is the total volume of groundwater and c f is the actual average f concentration in groundwater 2 mg l in rbw zone 2 5 mg l in ibw zone and 4 mg l in sbw zone 5 3 computation of change in storage δs physical groundwater loss or gain the computation of change in groundwater storage δs estimation was done with the double water table fluctuation method dwtf maréchal et al 2006 gec 1997 the dwtf method eqs 5 and 6 is a method where δs is calculated by multiplying the groundwater table fluctuations i e δh with the specific yield sy of the aquifer meinzer 1923 meinzer and stearns 1929 healy and cook 2002 7 δ s d r y δh dry s y a 8 δ s wet δh wet s y a where δh m is the water level fluctuation for the respective periods dry or wet sy is the specific yield or the fillable porosity of the unconfined aquifer and a is the areal extent of the aquifer in the double water table fluctuation method a hydrological year is divided into two seasons i e dry and wet the storage change is estimated separately in the dry season when there is no natural recharge and in the wet season when recharge occurs where δsdry and δswet are the changes in storage during the dry november may and wet june october periods δhdry and δhwet are the water level fluctuations in the two periods respectively sarah et al 2014 5 4 computation of virtual groundwater loss revised change in storage δs given below is the equation for estimating the revised change in storage δs δs δs v c where δs is the revised change in storage δs is the already estimated change in storage and vc is the already estimated volume of contaminated groundwater it should be noted that the contaminated volumes that were not diluted even during the wet period after recharge were subtracted from the change in storage water balance this means that contamination is very high and recharge is too low to affect the contaminated volume this was done to avoid any misleading calculations when estimating the revised change in storage 5 5 uncertainties associated with the method the fluoride concentration is believed to have high lateral and vertical variability indicating a strong stratification of groundwater with a general increase of the f concentration with depth the watershed also shows the existence of hydrochemical compartments maréchal et al 2018 although our volume concentration method takes into consideration the lateral variability of the watershed in terms of compartmentation it does not take into account the vertical heterogeneity of the watershed with respect to f concentration which may give rise to estimation uncertainties moreover we assume that f in the aquifer is readily available for dilution which may not be the case always 6 results and discussions 6 1 contaminated groundwater volume vc the set of equations eqs 3 6 is used to quantify the contaminated groundwater volume vc the volume of contaminated water vc is a state indicator that has been useful to know the present status and future trends in groundwater quality and has also helped to analyze and visualize groundwater quality contamination both in space and time the dilution from rainfall controls the natural attenuation of fluoride in groundwater also visible in pre monsoon prm and post monsoon pom fluoride concentration in the watershed fig 10 the quantification of the contaminated volumes in the watershed shows that natural recharge approximately ranging from 9 to 12 of rainfall sarah et al 2014 rangarajan and athavale 2000 has been effective in controlling the contamination this may not be always the case especially in over exploited closed basin aquifers where groundwater abstraction solute addition from the irrigation return flow and contamination are high and recharge is too low to compensate for the withdrawal rates and dilute the contaminated groundwater the positive dilution volumes indicate that the concentration of the fluoride in the groundwater is above the threshold or permissible limit of f 1 5 mg l and some dilution volume is required but not present in the aquifer to bring down the concentrations below the threshold limit hence these undiluted volumes of contaminated groundwater in the aquifer are converted into the contaminated volume negative dilution volume indicates that f concentration in the aquifer is below the threshold limit 1 5 mg l and no dilution is required hence water in the aquifer is non contaminated although the f contamination is still present in the aquifer this concentration is below or equal to the f permissible limits i e 1 5 mg l who 2020 if the contamination is high in the non monsoon period but reaches the threshold limit or below 1 5 mg l in the monsoon period the contaminated volumes are assumed to be in control hence not considered if we look at the overall picture of the watershed in the years 2002 2004 2005 2006 and 2009 both contamination and the virtual groundwater loss is high despite the natural recharge fig 10 and fig 11 also being high the natural recharge is not enough to dilute the fluoride concentration and bring it down the threshold value the volume of fresh water that should be added to this contaminated groundwater is unavailable the possible reason under such conditions is that the aquifer is highly contaminated by f fluoride concentrations sometimes show an increasing trend both in pre and post monsoon seasons in the watershed attributed to an increased residence time of groundwater because of the endothermic nature of the watershed or different recharge mechanisms due to the discontinuity of the hard rock aquifer systems pauwels et al 2015 alazard et al 2015 6 2 role of compartmentalization factor considering the compartmentalization in the watershed the scenario turns different in different zones the groundwater loss gain during 10 years 2001 2010 by the aquifer in the ibw zone is shown in fig 12 it is observed that this zone has gained 3 03 mcm groundwater during a decade however considering the groundwater contamination it is observed that the virtual groundwater loss is 1 06 mcm the rbw zone fig 12 in the maheshwaram watershed has gained groundwater 1 3 mcm in 10 years 2001 2010 on the other hand the estimation of virtual groundwater loss shows that the misleading conclusion can be drawn from the storage estimations devoid of quantification of contaminated groundwater taking the effects of groundwater contamination on the quantity of groundwater into consideration it is noted that the same rbw zone has lost 4 5 mcm in a decade however in the sbw zone fig 12 groundwater losses both physical 0 53 mcm and virtual 16 mcm are relatively much higher in 10 years 2001 2010 from this observation it is concluded that the contamination and recharge relationship is controlled by different hydraulic conductivity zones in the watershed e g sbw zone has more natural dykes than rbw and ibw zone which can influence the dilution from recharge as well as solute transport 6 3 virtual groundwater loss the differences in physical and virtual groundwater losses observed in these zones are attributed to factors like the different concentrations of fluoride volumes of abstracted groundwater different recharge population density and urbanization for instance the groundwater abstraction reported in the rbw zone is 6 mcm 4 mcm in the ibw zone and 5 mcm in the sbw zone sarah et al 2014 while as average recharge in the rbw zone is 125 mm yr 175 mm yr in ibw zone and 100 mm yr in sbw zone the contamination of groundwater low recharge conditions over exploitation higher population coupled with fast urbanization sarah 2013 has proved to be detrimental for the groundwater resource in the zones rbw and sbw apart from that the water rock interaction plays a key role in the fluoride accumulation as the groundwater exploitation increases the water rock interaction time and higher irrigation return flow containing anthropogenic sources like fertilizers contribute to the near surface fluoride accumulation hem 1985 saxena and ahmed 2003 milnes and renard 2004 sreedevi et al 2006 perrin et al 2011 pauwels et al 2015 the higher groundwater abstraction for agricultural purposes in the zones rbw and sbw also means higher irrigation return flow as 30 40 of the abstracted groundwater returns to the aquifer in the dry season and 40 50 in the wet season maréchal et al 2006 which is a major contributor of fluoride contamination and higher virtual loss of groundwater in these zones the estimation of physical and virtual groundwater loss demonstrates the combined effect of groundwater exploitation and contamination on the groundwater resource the virtual loss is the groundwater lost through contamination as the deterioration of groundwater quality is gradual and may not be recognized until large volumes have been affected foster and chilton 2004 which may take thousands of years it is observed that if the volume of fresh water that should be added to the contaminated groundwater to dilute it to acceptable levels is greater than the change in groundwater storage groundwater can be considered conditionally renewable this scenario seems difficult in rbw and sbw zones where the rate of recharge is low and groundwater abstraction is high the quantification of the contaminated groundwater volume shows all the zones of the watershed are sensitive to contamination the zones rbw and sbw are over sensitive to contamination which means judicious planning and management of groundwater resources is required in these two zones to maintain sustainability and ensure renewability of all the three zones sbw zone is the most sensitive zone as far as quality degradation of groundwater is concerned the groundwater resource in this zone has been converted into a non renewable groundwater resource because of continued over exploitation and quality deterioration the vulnerability of these zones to contamination demonstrates that industrial urbanization and over exploitation will prove detrimental to the groundwater resource various studies in the watershed discussed above show that f contamination will persist and may even worsen the aquifer conditions in the maheshwaram watershed shows that the aquifer is suffering both from depletion and contamination the recharge events unless bigger may not recover the renewability of the aquifer it can take years to replenish the quality of the groundwater resource in these conditions here the contamination not only results in a reduction in the volume of immediately usable water but also challenges the concept of quantitative groundwater renewability 6 4 projected aquifer depletion and total groundwater volume if groundwater abstractions exceed recharge and are not balanced by increased recharge and decreased discharge over several years a long term decline of hydraulic heads and groundwater storage i e groundwater depletion will result döll et al 2014 this is what is happening in the maheshwaram watershed according to bierkens and wada 2019 groundwater gets disconnected from the stream when its level drops below the river bed due to excessive withdrawal rates the maheshwaram watershed is also experiencing a basin closure induced by accelerated groundwater table decline as the surface water system has disconnected perrin et al 2011 fig 13 demonstrates the multi year variability of total groundwater volume showing episodic depletion and recovery but the increased withdrawal rates and limited precipitation in years 2002 2004 2006 and 2009 have caused large depletion rates which are not balanced by the partial recovery of the water table through recharge during the wet season however the trend shows a slight groundwater depletion fig 14 the aquifer shows a negative change in storage groundwater loss in poor monsoon years 2002 2004 2006 and 2009 fig 11 the groundwater modeling carried out using predictive scenarios see section 4 3 reveals that the watershed will experience watershed desaturation and the groundwater reserves may be depleted in most of the parts of the watershed by 2025 fig 15 the water demand by 2025 will reach 1 5e 07 m3 year but the available groundwater storage fig 15 and fig 16 in optimal groundwater storage zones is 3 5e 07 m3 year and 2 5e 07 m3 year in low groundwater storage zones in depleted groundwater storage zones the groundwater demand is more than storage 1 8e 07 m3 year most of the wells will get dry in depleted zones and the recharge from precipitation would not be optimal to increase the storage in the low groundwater storage zones the aquifer will be entirely dependent on recharge in the case of the maheshwaram watershed because of its semi arid climate it is already low 12 of the total rainfall rangarajan and athavale 2000 the groundwater is considered conditionally renewable under these conditions the long term assessment and estimation of revised change in storage or revised water balance show the trends that provide information on the functioning of the system or its response to contamination for instance in the watersheds like maheshwaram facing groundwater depletion and contamination at the same time groundwater quality studies must be incorporated with quantitative studies to eliminate any misleading information coming out from these studies when combined these studies will prove effective in any planning and management of the stressed water resources in these types of fragile and contaminated watersheds this indicator shows that the watershed is sensitive to contamination as the groundwater resource is highly vulnerable because of continued over exploitation and quality deterioration as well as low replenishment from recharge 6 5 implications of aquifer depletion and the new insights from the concept of virtual groundwater loss studying the hydrodynamics and contaminant concentration in both space and time with different zones provides an important study regarding the efficient management of groundwater resources in over exploited watersheds suffering contamination investigation in different compartments of the watershed having different recharge conditions groundwater withdrawal rates and hydrodynamics reveals that while designing and outlining the policies for aquifer management the local heterogeneities must be taken into consideration for these to be successful based on this sensitivities and vulnerability of the zones to over exploitation contamination should be evaluated e g the groundwater depletion status virtual groundwater loss and contamination in all three zones of the watershed provide an altogether different picture when studied as different units and need different management approaches for instance the sensitivity analysis of the numerical groundwater model see section 4 4 demonstrates that lowering the groundwater abstraction rate in the rbw zone can recover the groundwater quality and storage as this zone is more sensitive to groundwater abstraction while as managed aquifer recharge in the zones ibw and sbw can prove more beneficial for the aquifer system to restore its quality and depletion as this zone is sensitive to recharge the gradually lowering aquifer volumes and aquifer depletion in most parts of this semi arid watershed by 2025 may give rise to food security concerns and economic crisis among the farmers as most of the people in this watershed depend on paddy cultivation for their livelihood under the absence or lowering of groundwater reserves sustaining agriculture is difficult as india is an agrarian economy this comprehensive study in the maheshwaram watershed provides an example of alarming situations rising from aquifer depletion and contamination in hard rock aquifers of india where surface water resources are limited the virtual groundwater loss which is a new concept of quantifying the contamination and subtracting the contaminated groundwater volume also provides new insights for the management of aquifers for instance in the case of the maheshwaram watershed the quantification of decadal groundwater change in storage indicates ibw and rbw zones have gained groundwater however the quantification of contaminated groundwater volume and its subtraction from the groundwater storage in all three zones shows that the quantitative groundwater studies provide a false picture of groundwater status and hence failure in management policies in stressed aquifer systems 7 conclusion the integrated studies of the spatio temporal quantification of contaminated groundwater volume and groundwater depletion through volume concentration relationship hydraulic head monitoring and groundwater modeling respectively advances our understanding of groundwater contamination coupled with groundwater depletion the study indicates that hard rock aquifers having discontinuities do not behave as single units rather different units dominantly governed by local heterogeneities the series of equations eqs 3 6 formulated to quantify the contaminated groundwater volume can be used to quantify contamination in aquifers with similar climatic and geological settings the contaminated depleting aquifers are proving to be a major challenge in watershed governance policy and management plans this study takes into consideration the compartmentalization of the aquifer system investigates both groundwater storage and virtual groundwater loss in space and time to provide a comprehensive picture of the hard rock aquifers in over exploited watersheds the newly introduced concept of virtual groundwater loss indicates that a certain amount of groundwater in the system which remains contaminated beyond the permissible limit for a considerably long period cannot be taken as a resource the groundwater quantity estimates devoid of contamination investigations in fragile and overexploited aquifers can be misleading it should be taken care of while designing the management and decision making involving watershed policies considering the compartmentalization at the watershed scale the groundwater resource is conditionally renewable the management policies which may work in one unit of the aquifer may fail in another unit of the same aquifer owing to their different recharge mechanisms and rates withdrawal rates geological heterogeneities the study predicts the status of the groundwater reserves by 2025 where most of the watershed will face desaturation and virtual groundwater loss will also make groundwater resources conditionally renewable this study can be replicable to any watershed with similar geological and hydrogeological settings however it further needs a real time simulation of soil moisture movement in the unsaturated zone rock water interaction and investigation of vertical f variability as the f concentration generally increases

4637,drainage is a very effective form of remedial treatment for many landslides in recent years siphon drainage technologies have made great progress for landslides and siphon pipes with a diameter of 4 mm are recommended to ensure that the siphon drainage runs continuously based on theoretical analysis for the flow velocity of a siphon this study proposes a new siphon drainage system with variable diameters for landslides to improve the drainage capacity of the existing siphon drainage systems in addition to the basic concept of the new siphon system the estimation method of the drainage capacity of the new system is also developed a series of experimental tests are conducted to verify the new siphon drainage system and the estimation method of the drainage capacity the experimental results show that a for all siphons with variable diameters the calculated values are very close to the experimental measurements and all of the error rates are less than 4 b therefore the developed calculation method of the velocity of a siphon with variable diameters is validated c for all schemes with variable diameters the increase rate of velocity ranges 15 and 116 comparing with those with constant diameters and d the promotion effect brought by variable diameters for higher lift siphons is obviously better than that of lower lift siphons finally an ancient landslide located in zhejiang province china is used as a sample to illustrate how to design a siphon with variable diameters keywords landslide drainage siphon stability slopes variable diameters 1 introduction landslide is one of the most serious disasters that human beings have been facing the rise of groundwater is a main factor that triggers landslides balzano et al 2019 chen et al 2018 wei et al 2020a zhu et al 2020 marino et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and hence drainage is a very effective form of remedial treatment for many landslides zâruba and mencl 1982 sun et al 2010 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2020b tohari et al 2021 compared to traditional drainage methods such as horizontal drainage boreholes and surface drainage ditches siphon drainage for landslide slope has the following advantages sun et al 2016 a convenient arrangement of drain boreholes b strong water collection capacity c good interception and drainage effect d small required drilling length and e fast construction speed the rainfall which is the main supply source of groundwater for most landslides is often uneven in different seasons so the drainage demand for increasing the stability of a landslide is often intermittent with respect to the upward pipe of a siphon drainage system henry s law sander 2015 shows that as the flow rises the pressure decreases and the air dissolved in water will release zheng et al 2021 in the dry seasons the groundwater level is low i e the lift of a siphon drainage is high so the water in the siphon pipe flows slowly and even stops in this situation the bubbles air releasing from water accumulate at the top of the pipe mei et al 2017 and the excessive accumulation of bubbles might break the drainage process cai et al 2015 which means the siphon drainage system needs to be restarted manually by extracting the air from siphon pipes using vacuum pump it is worth mentioning that regarding siphon drainage pipes distributed in a landslide it is always very difficult to restart siphon manually due to the restrictions of traffic conditions and other factors shang et al 2015 in order to solve the long term and effective problem of siphon process for landslides slopes a series of theoretical experimental numerical simulation and engineering application studies were performed by sun and her co workers xiong et al 2014 cai et al 2014 2015 shang et al 2015 sun et al 2016 2018 2019a 2019b 2021 mei et al 2017 yu et al 2019 and some of the important conclusions are that a when the internal diameter of the siphon pipe is smaller than or equal to 4 mm plug flow can be formed in the pipe b plug flow can prevent the accumulation of bubbles at the top of pipe and allows high lift siphon drainage to operate continuously and c hence the internal diameter of 4 mm is the best choice of the siphon drainage system for landslides zheng et al 2021 re examined the siphon process and recognized that the existing classic formula of the flow velocity of a siphon is only applicable to continuous flow however the flow of a siphon may be non continuous flow zheng et al 2021 proposed new formulae of flow velocity of a siphon considering air release based on the theory developed by zheng et al 2021 this study mainly aims to propose a new siphon drainage system to improve their drainage capacity for landslides slopes in addition the estimation method of the drainage capacity of the proposed siphon drainage system is also developed finally a series of experimental tests are conducted to validate the new siphon drainage system and the estimation method of the drainage capacity 2 concepts of the siphon drainage system with variable diameters 2 1 why is a 4 mm internal diameter recommended for siphon drainage systems for landslides without human intervention the groundwater level in a landslide varies in different seasons as shown in fig 1 in the wet season the groundwater level is probably high and the landslide may be instable while in the dry season the groundwater level is probably low and the landslide is probably stable the groundwater level under which the landslide is totally stable is named controlling groundwater level fig 1 so in the wet season the siphon runs to lower the groundwater level below the controlling groundwater level while in the dry season the water in the siphon pipe flows slowly and even stops note that a the standpipe in fig 1 is an impervious pipe with end seal and is used to ensure that the inlet of the siphon pipe is always under water and b the inclined borehole in fig 1 is designed to ensure that the height difference between the landslide groundwater control level and the top of the siphon system is less than the height of the water column corresponding to the local atmospheric pressure sun et al 2019b when the flow in siphon pipe has a low velocity three types fig 2 of flow can be observed at the vertex the top of the siphon which are wall pressing flow slug flow and incomplete slug flow cai et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 slug flow can discharge bubbles together with water and ensure that the siphon drainage runs continuously while wall pressing flow or incomplete slug flow cannot discharge bubbles which may lead to interruption of the siphon drainage the flow types are significantly influenced by the diameter of the siphon pipe the analytical numerical experimental and practical results cai et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 shang et al 2015 show that the internal diameter of siphon pipes for continuous siphon drainage for landslides should be less than or equal to 4 mm in order to obtain the maximum drainage capacity a 4 mm internal diameter is recommended for siphon drainage systems for landslides 2 2 calculation of the flow velocity of a siphon siphon flow is pressurized pipe flow with respect to the calculation of the flow velocity some textbooks munson et al 2013 sklhmre 2016 and research papers potter and barnes 1971 kuwahara et al 2014 give the calculation formula as follows 1 v 2 g h 1 1 λ l d ζ where v is the flow velocity g is the gravity acceleration h 1 is the height from the end of outflow section to the liquid surface of inlet λ is pipe friction coefficient l is the length of the siphon pipe d is the diameter of the siphon pipe and ζ is the local loss coefficient eq 1 is derivated based on bernoulli s equation and assuming that the flow is continuous zheng et al 2021 re examined the siphon process and pointed out that a when v up v w where v up and v w are the flow velocities calculated by analyzing the upward pipe and whole pipe using bernoulli s equation respectively the flow in siphon pipe can be considered as continuous flow b when v up v w the flow in siphon pipe is not continuous flow but pulse flow and c therefore the flow velocity v of a siphon should be expressed as 2 v min v up v w where the function min means the value is equal to the smaller value of the two values in the parentheses and v up and v w can be given by zheng et al 2021 3 v up 2 g δ h 1 λ l up d ζ up 4 v w 2 g h 1 1 λ l d ζ where h h max h 0 where h 0 is the height from the liquid surface of inlet to the highest point of the siphon system and h max is the height of the water column corresponding to local atmospheric pressure and l up and ζ up are the length and local loss coefficient of the upward pipe respectively it should be noted that eqs 3 and 4 do not consider the air release from water in a real siphon process as the flow increases the pressure decreases and the air dissolved in water must release zheng et al 2021 considering the air release the flow becomes air water two phase flow similarly the flow may be continuous flow or pulse flow and the flow velocity v of a siphon considering the air release can be given by zheng et al 2021 5 v min v up v w where v up and v w are the flow velocities calculated by analyzing the upward pipe and whole pipe using bernoulli s equation respectively considering the air release and v v up and v w are referred to the mean flow velocity of the water phase which are equal to the volume rates of water flow the area of a cross section of the pipe according to conservation of mass of water so the real velocities of water at different positions are different and hence it is impossible to give a formula like eq 3 or 4 to calculate v up and v w zheng et al 2021 developed the related calculation procedures which can also give the proportion of water to water and air at any position 2 3 some calculation cases in order to better understand the conclusion that the velocity of a siphon may be determined by the lift h 0 or the height difference h 1 between the liquid surfaces zheng et al 2021 some calculation cases are performed a siphon system is shown in fig 3 the pipe was made of polyurethane tubing pu and has a 4 mm diameter the siphon system has a curvature radius of 0 1 m at the vertex the lengths of the upward pipe and whole pipe are assumed as h 0 and h 0 h 1 respectively the local atmospheric pressure is equal to the standard atmospheric pressure 101 325 kpa for simplicity firstly air release is not considered which may influence on the accuracy of calculation but will not influence on the law of calculation so eqs 2 4 are applied to calculate the values of v v up and v w respectively the following formulae are applied to determine the pipe friction coefficient λ zheng et al 2021 6 λ 64 re for 0 re 2320 a 0 000007 r e 0 0108 for 2320 re 4000 b 0 316 r e 0 25 for 4000 re 100000 c where re is the reynolds number eq 6a is applicable to laminar flow and eq 6c is the blasius equation li et al 2011 eq 6b is obtained by a linear fitting of the two points 2320 64 2320 and 4000 0 316 40000 25 0 262 is assigned as the value of ζ sklhmre 2016 with respect to different values of h 0 the obtained values of v up and v w are plotted in fig 4 the results in fig 4 show that a when h 0 less than 5 m and h 1 0 1 to 5000 m v w v up i e when h 0 less than 5 m the velocity is determined by h 1 eq 2 and b when h 0 5 7 m and h 1 50 m v up v w i e when h 0 5 7 m and h 1 50 m the velocity is determined by h 0 eq 2 based on the results of these cases we can obtain the following understanding that when the lift is high e g h 0 6 m and the height difference is large e g h 1 50 m the drainage capacity of a siphon system is determined by v up to further study the relationship between v and h 1 for a low lift e g h 0 6 m some calculation cases are performed and the results are given in fig 5 the information in fig 5 shows that a for a particular h 0 as h 1 increases v w increases first and then tends to be stable b for a same h 1 v w decreases with the increase of h 0 and with respect to a sufficiently large h 1 the values of v w are very close for different values of h 0 c when h 0 6 m v w50 v w5000 88 4 and v w100 v w5000 93 8 where v w50 v w100 and v w5000 are the values of v for h 1 50 m h 1 100 m and h 1 5000 m respectively and d therefore to maximize the drainage capacity of the siphon for a low lift a value 50 m is recommended to assign to h 1 and 100 m is better for simplicity in this study when v up v w the lift of a siphon is defined as a low lift and when v up v w the lift of a siphon is defined as a high lift with respect to h 1 50 m some cases are analyzed considering air release based on the procedures developed by zheng et al 2021 the values of pressure p top at the top of siphons are obtained as plotted in fig 6 the results in fig 6 show that a as h 0 increases p top sharply decreases to one value close to zero and the values v up v w decrease b when v up v w less than 1 i e v up v w p top is less than vapor pressure of water which means that cavitation occurs to potentially reduce the durability of siphon pipes and c therefore for a siphon with a high lift increasing v up may decrease the damage risk of a siphon pipe due to the cavitation note that the vapor pressure of water is related to the temperature and is equal to 3 3 kpa for the temperature of 25 munson et al 2013 2 4 concepts of the siphon drainage system with variable diameters based on analysis above we know that a when the groundwater level is high i e the siphon has a low lift h 1 should be designed as sufficiently large such as 50 m to ensure that the siphon system has the maximum drainage capacity to reduce the groundwater level b as the groundwater level decreases to some level i e the siphon system becomes the siphon with a high lift the drainage capacity is determined by h 0 c in order to ensure the stability of landslides landslides should avoid high groundwater levels so the siphon drainage systems should be in operation with high lifts and d therefore the key to ensure the stability of a landslide is to improve the drainage capacity of the siphon drainage system under a high lift obviously the drainage capacity of a siphon system is determined by the volume rate of flow of a single siphon pipe and the number of pipes improving the volume rate of flow of a single siphon pipe can effectively save costs according to eq 3 the volume rate of flow of the upward pipe q up can be given by 7 q up 0 25 π d 2 2 g δ h 1 λ l up d ζ up eq 7 indicates that it can increase q up to enlarge d however as described above the internal diameter of siphon pipes at the top should be less than or equal to 4 mm to ensure continuous operation of a siphon drainage system not unnaturally a siphon drainage system with variable diameters can be designed of which a part of the upward pipe can be designed as the pipe with a diameter of 4 mm and the rest part of the upward pipe and all of the downward pipe can be designed as the pipe with a diameter of 4 mm fig 7 3 calculation of flow velocity of a siphon with variable diameters 3 1 no considering air release similar to the siphon system with a constant diameter zheng et al 2021 the final velocity is determined by the smaller one of v upv and v wv where v upv and v wv are the flow velocities calculated by analyzing the upward pipe and whole pipe using bernoulli s equation without considering air release respectively it should be noted that v upv is the velocity corresponding to the small diameter d s of the upward pipe fig 7 when our analysis object is the upward pipe based on bernoulli s equation we can obtain 8 v upv 2 2 g 1 λ l l upl d s 4 d l 5 d s 4 d l 4 ζ upl λ s l ups d s ζ ups h 0 h max where l upl and l ups are the lengths of lds and sds fig 7 respectively d l and d s are the diameter of lds and sds respectively and ζ upl and ζ ups are the local loss coefficients of lds and sds respectively substitution of h h max h 0 into eq 8 gives 9 v upv 2 g δ h 1 λ l l upl d s 4 d l 5 d s 4 d l 4 ζ upl λ s l ups d s ζ ups when our analysis object is the whole pipe based on bernoulli s equation v wv can be given by 10 v wv 2 g h 1 1 λ l l upl d s 4 d l 5 d s 4 d l 4 ζ upl λ s l ups l down d s ζ ups ζ down it should be noted that v w is also the velocity of the whole pipe corresponding to d s therefore the real flow velocity v v of a siphon with variable diameters can be expressed as 11 v v min v upv v wv since λ l and λ s are probably related to v v munson et al 2013 v v in eq 11 needs to be solved by iteration 3 2 considering air release similarly when air release is considered v v should be equal to the smaller of the velocities of the upward pipe v upv and the whole pipe v wv where v v v upv and v wv refer to the mean flow velocity of water and are equal to the volume rates of water flow the area of a cross section having the small diameter d s henry s law sander 2015 states that the amount of dissolved gas in the liquid is proportional to its partial pressure in the gas phase and the proportionality factor is called the henry s law constant there are many variants of henry s law constants and in this study the following definition is adopted sander 2015 12 h c a p where h is the henry s law solubility constant mol m 3 pa 1 c a is the concentration of a species in the aqueous phase mol m 3 and p is the partial pressure of that species in the gas phase under equilibrium conditions pa based on henry s law zheng et al 2021 derived the formula of the proportion k w x of water to water and air at one position as follows 13 k w x p x h a p la p x r t p x where h a is the henry s law constant of air p la is the local atmospheric pressure px is the pressure at r 8 314472 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant t is the air temperature according to the conservation of mass and assuming that there is no relative motion between the water and air the flow velocity v wa x v of water and air at can be given by 14 v wa x v v upv d s 2 k w x d x 2 v upv d s 2 d x 2 h a p la p x r t p x p x where dx is the diameter of the pipe at x it should be noted that v upv is the velocity of water without air similar to the siphon system with constant diameter zheng et al 2021 the upward pipe is our analysis object and we can obtain 15 p i ρ g h max v upv 2 2 g i 1 i v waupv i 1 2 λ i 1 l i d i v waupv i 1 2 ζ up i h i a v waupv i v upv d s 2 d i 2 h a p l a p i r t p i p i b where i means the i th section of the upward pipe and can be equal to 1 to i i represents the number of divided sections of the upward pipe and should be assigned a sufficiently large value ζ up i is the local loss coefficient of the i th section and if the i th section does not have local loss ζ up i 0 v waupv i and v waupv i 1 are the velocities of the water and air of the i th and i 1 th sections of the upward pipe respectively di is the diameter of the i th section of the upward pipe λi 1 is the obtained pipe friction coefficient based on v waupv i 1 and di the calculation flow chart of the velocity of the upward pipe considering air release is given in fig 8 where v upv can be determined by eq 9 ε is the convergence criterion and δ is the iteration step size it should be noted that a because v upv v upv δ 0 and b pi is the pressure so pi 0 similar to the siphon system with constant diameter zheng et al 2021 the whole pipe is our analysis object and

respectively the calculation flow chart of the velocity of the whole pipe considering air release is given in fig 9 where v wv can be determined by eq 10 similarly δ 0 and pi 0 finally the flow

of pu had a curvature radius of 0 1 m at the vertex sixteen experiments were performed and the schemes are given in table 1 the flow velocity was measured by weighing the water collected in the outlet tank for some time it should be noted that a single phase flowmeter did not work well in these experiments since the flow contained much air released from the water due to the decrease in pressure it should be noted that h 1 was not set as a value 50 m due to the limited experimental conditions 4 2 experimental results and discussion for the different schemes the measured and calculated values of the flow velocity are plotted in fig 10 it should be noted that in the calculations for the experiments a the calculated values are determined by eq 17 b the pipe friction coefficient λ is determined by eq 6 c the value of h a can be expressed as h a k n 2 h n 2 k o 2 h o 2 where k n2 and k o2 are the proportions of n2 and o2 in air and generally equal to 79 and 21 respectively and h n2 and h o2 are the henry s law constants of n2 and o2 in air respectively and can be determined by the expression between h at temperature t denoted as h t and h at the reference temperature t 298 15 k denoted as h as follows sander 2015 18 h t h exp δ sol h r 1 t 1 t where sol h represents the enthalpy of dissolution and r 8 314472 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant and d the values of h and sol h r in eq 18 for o2 and n2 are tabulated in table 2 sander 2015 the results in fig 10 show that a for all siphons with variable diameters the calculated values v vcalculated are very close to the experimental measurements v vmeasured and all of the error rates er are less than 4 b therefore the developed calculation method of the velocity of a siphon with variable diameters is validated and c for siphons with a constant diameter the calculated value v calculated for scheme 1 is very close to the experimental measurements v measured while the calculated values v calculated for schemes 4 7 and 12 have relatively large er which are around 18 with respect to schemes 4 7 and 12 because the all calculation results of v up eq 3 are less than those of v w eq 4 they are the siphons with high lift i e their velocities are determined by the lift table 1 shows that schemes 4 7 and 12 have the same lift so the three schemes can be regarded as the same for schemes 4 7 and 12 re is 2320 i e the flow is non laminar flow with respect to non laminar flow the value of λ is not easy to precisely determine and the equations eq 6 used in this study are empirical formulae as a rule of thumb a 10 accuracy for λ is the best expected munson et al 2013 besides each siphon system of the aforementioned three schemes have a constant diameter and high lift so much air is released in the siphon process as stated by zheng et al 2021 it is assumed that there is no relative motion between the water and air which may bring some errors the more air is released the greater the brought error may be in order to study the promotion effect brought by variable diameters the increase rate of velocity irv of each siphon with variable diameters is calculated based on the follows 19 irv v v v v where v v is the velocity of the siphon with variable diameters and v is the velocity of the siphon with a constant diameter which has the same situation as the aforementioned siphon with variable diameters for example for scheme 2 irv 2 v v2 v 1 v 1 and for scheme 16 irv 16 v v16 v 12 v 12 the values of irv for all schemes with variable diameters are given in fig 11 note that all measured values of velocity are used for eq 19 the results in fig 11 show that a for all schemes with variable diameters the irv ranges 15 and 116 comparing with those with constant diameters b for the same h 0 h 1 and d l the value of irv increases as the location l upl of variable diameter increases c for the same h 0 h 1 and l upl irv increases with the growth of d l and d the promotion effect brought by variable diameters for higher lift siphons is obviously better than that of lower lift siphons it is worth remembering that the final velocity is determined by the smaller one of v upv and v wv so the maximum value of irv is equal to v wv v v for example with respect to h 0 8 25 m h 1 24 m and l upl 8 m d l 6 5 mm is sufficiently large to ensure v upv v wv so further increase of d l will not bring any increase of velocity therefore we can compare the values of v upv and v wv to estimate the value of d l besides with respective to the location of variable diameters around 0 2 m below of the top of siphons is recommend to ensure the long term stability of siphons the conclusion from zheng et al 2021 shows that when v upv v wv the released air is much less than that when v upv v wv therefore the variable diameters significantly less air release which is consistent with the observed bubbles during the experiments and is beneficial to the long term stability of siphon systems 5 a sample of the siphon with variable diameters sun et al 2019b reported an ancient landslide located on the left 205 national road k1692 in zhejiang province china the landslide has a width along the highway of approximately 220 m and a length perpendicular to the highway of approximately 300 m the area where the landslide is located has abundant rainfall the annual average rainy days are 166 d and the annual average precipitation reaches 1762 mm to increase the stability of the landslide a siphon drainage system fig 12 with constant diameter was completed and started to drain on september 13 2013 the flow monitoring shows that the drainage system has worked well so far and provides an average daily discharge of 5 5 m3 here we try to design a siphon with variable diameters for the ancient landslide as a sample the designed location drilling depth and inclined angle of the siphon system with variable diameters are selected as the same as those of the siphon system with the constant diameter fig 12 the lift corresponding to the highest groundwater level before drainage can be regarded as the minimum value of h 0 which is equal to 4 5 m since stability analysis of a landslide is not the point of this study assume that the target controlling groundwater level is 5 m below the highest groundwater level before drainage fig 12 shows l up 32 m the value of the downward pipe can be determined by 20 l downward h 0 h 1 sin α where α is the mean slope angle of the landslide and is equal to 32 first of all the ultimate value of v w should be estimated by ensure to maximize the drainage capacity of the siphon with l up 32 m and a constant diameter of 4 mm for the preliminary calculation air release can be ignored so eq 4 is used to calculate the values of v w for different values of h 1 which are given in fig 13 the information in fig 13 shows that the ultimate value of v w is around 1 m s so h 1 can be designed as 150 200 m and in this study 150 m is adopted it should be noted that the results of fig 13 are different from that of fig 5 because in this ancient landslide case l up is equal to 32 m while in fig 5 l up is assumed to be equal to h 0 secondly calculate the values of v upv of the siphon with different values of d l and h 0 0 2 m below of the top of siphons is selected as the location of variable diameters for the preliminary calculation air release can be ignored so eq 9 is used to calculate the values of v upv the results are plotted in fig 14 the results show that a for different values of h 0 the siphon with a larger d s has larger drainage capacity and b 0 008 mm can be selected as the designed value of d s to ensure v upv is always larger than the ultimate value of v w which is equal to 1 m s finally calculation procedures figs 8 and 9 are used to check the calculation by considering air release with respect to h 0 4 5 m 9 5 m h 1 150 m and d s 0 008 mm the results are given in fig 15 the results show that when the groundwater level ranges the highest groundwater level before drainage h 0 4 5 m and the target controlling groundwater level h 0 9 5 m the drainage system is always able to drainage with a value v v close to the ultimate drainage capacity 1 m s therefore the designs of h 1 150 m and d s 0 008 mm for the siphon system is proper to study the improvement effect of the variable diameters the velocity v of the siphon system with constant diameter 4 mm is also calculated and plotted in fig 15 comparison between v v and v clearly shows the variable diameters significantly improve the drainage capacity of a siphon system 6 conclusions to improve the stability of landslides slopes this study proposed a new siphon drainage system the siphon drainage system with variable diameters fig 7 of which the diameter of a part of the upward pipe is designed as 4 mm and the diameter of the rest part of the upward pipe and all of the downward pipe are designed as 4 mm for the new siphon drainage systems we presented the formulae of the flow velocity to estimate the drainage capacity of the new system the flow of a siphon may be continuous or non continuous flow zheng et al 2021 these presented formulae fig 9 can cover continuous and discontinuous flow and can consider the influence of the release of air from liquid on the flow velocity a series of physical experiments were conducted to verify the new siphon drainage system and the estimation method of the drainage capacity the increase rate of velocity irv eq 19 was defined to quantitatively assess the promotion effect brought by variable diameters the experimental results figs 10 and 11 show that a for all siphons with variable diameters the calculated values are very close to the experimental measurements and all of the error rates are less than 4 b therefore the developed calculation method of the velocity of a siphon with variable diameters is validated c for all schemes with variable diameters the irv ranges 15 and 116 comparing with the siphons with constant diameters and d the promotion effect brought by variable diameters for higher lift siphons is obviously better than that of lower lift siphons besides the variable diameters significantly less air release which is beneficial to the long term stability of siphon systems besides an ancient landslide located in zhejiang province china was used as a sample to illustrate how to design a siphon with variable diameters the design procedures were described in detail to further study the improvement effect of the variable diameters the velocities of the systems with variable diameters and constant diameter were compared the results fig 15 clearly show the variable diameters significantly improve the drainage capacity of a siphon system credit

4637,drainage is a very effective form of remedial treatment for many landslides in recent years siphon drainage technologies have made great progress for landslides and siphon pipes with a diameter of 4 mm are recommended to ensure that the siphon drainage runs continuously based on theoretical analysis for the flow velocity of a siphon this study proposes a new siphon drainage system with variable diameters for landslides to improve the drainage capacity of the existing siphon drainage systems in addition to the basic concept of the new siphon system the estimation method of the drainage capacity of the new system is also developed a series of experimental tests are conducted to verify the new siphon drainage system and the estimation method of the drainage capacity the experimental results show that a for all siphons with variable diameters the calculated values are very close to the experimental measurements and all of the error rates are less than 4 b therefore the developed calculation method of the velocity of a siphon with variable diameters is validated c for all schemes with variable diameters the increase rate of velocity ranges 15 and 116 comparing with those with constant diameters and d the promotion effect brought by variable diameters for higher lift siphons is obviously better than that of lower lift siphons finally an ancient landslide located in zhejiang province china is used as a sample to illustrate how to design a siphon with variable diameters keywords landslide drainage siphon stability slopes variable diameters 1 introduction landslide is one of the most serious disasters that human beings have been facing the rise of groundwater is a main factor that triggers landslides balzano et al 2019 chen et al 2018 wei et al 2020a zhu et al 2020 marino et al 2021 wang et al 2021 and hence drainage is a very effective form of remedial treatment for many landslides zâruba and mencl 1982 sun et al 2010 wang et al 2020 wei et al 2020b tohari et al 2021 compared to traditional drainage methods such as horizontal drainage boreholes and surface drainage ditches siphon drainage for landslide slope has the following advantages sun et al 2016 a convenient arrangement of drain boreholes b strong water collection capacity c good interception and drainage effect d small required drilling length and e fast construction speed the rainfall which is the main supply source of groundwater for most landslides is often uneven in different seasons so the drainage demand for increasing the stability of a landslide is often intermittent with respect to the upward pipe of a siphon drainage system henry s law sander 2015 shows that as the flow rises the pressure decreases and the air dissolved in water will release zheng et al 2021 in the dry seasons the groundwater level is low i e the lift of a siphon drainage is high so the water in the siphon pipe flows slowly and even stops in this situation the bubbles air releasing from water accumulate at the top of the pipe mei et al 2017 and the excessive accumulation of bubbles might break the drainage process cai et al 2015 which means the siphon drainage system needs to be restarted manually by extracting the air from siphon pipes using vacuum pump it is worth mentioning that regarding siphon drainage pipes distributed in a landslide it is always very difficult to restart siphon manually due to the restrictions of traffic conditions and other factors shang et al 2015 in order to solve the long term and effective problem of siphon process for landslides slopes a series of theoretical experimental numerical simulation and engineering application studies were performed by sun and her co workers xiong et al 2014 cai et al 2014 2015 shang et al 2015 sun et al 2016 2018 2019a 2019b 2021 mei et al 2017 yu et al 2019 and some of the important conclusions are that a when the internal diameter of the siphon pipe is smaller than or equal to 4 mm plug flow can be formed in the pipe b plug flow can prevent the accumulation of bubbles at the top of pipe and allows high lift siphon drainage to operate continuously and c hence the internal diameter of 4 mm is the best choice of the siphon drainage system for landslides zheng et al 2021 re examined the siphon process and recognized that the existing classic formula of the flow velocity of a siphon is only applicable to continuous flow however the flow of a siphon may be non continuous flow zheng et al 2021 proposed new formulae of flow velocity of a siphon considering air release based on the theory developed by zheng et al 2021 this study mainly aims to propose a new siphon drainage system to improve their drainage capacity for landslides slopes in addition the estimation method of the drainage capacity of the proposed siphon drainage system is also developed finally a series of experimental tests are conducted to validate the new siphon drainage system and the estimation method of the drainage capacity 2 concepts of the siphon drainage system with variable diameters 2 1 why is a 4 mm internal diameter recommended for siphon drainage systems for landslides without human intervention the groundwater level in a landslide varies in different seasons as shown in fig 1 in the wet season the groundwater level is probably high and the landslide may be instable while in the dry season the groundwater level is probably low and the landslide is probably stable the groundwater level under which the landslide is totally stable is named controlling groundwater level fig 1 so in the wet season the siphon runs to lower the groundwater level below the controlling groundwater level while in the dry season the water in the siphon pipe flows slowly and even stops note that a the standpipe in fig 1 is an impervious pipe with end seal and is used to ensure that the inlet of the siphon pipe is always under water and b the inclined borehole in fig 1 is designed to ensure that the height difference between the landslide groundwater control level and the top of the siphon system is less than the height of the water column corresponding to the local atmospheric pressure sun et al 2019b when the flow in siphon pipe has a low velocity three types fig 2 of flow can be observed at the vertex the top of the siphon which are wall pressing flow slug flow and incomplete slug flow cai et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 slug flow can discharge bubbles together with water and ensure that the siphon drainage runs continuously while wall pressing flow or incomplete slug flow cannot discharge bubbles which may lead to interruption of the siphon drainage the flow types are significantly influenced by the diameter of the siphon pipe the analytical numerical experimental and practical results cai et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 shang et al 2015 show that the internal diameter of siphon pipes for continuous siphon drainage for landslides should be less than or equal to 4 mm in order to obtain the maximum drainage capacity a 4 mm internal diameter is recommended for siphon drainage systems for landslides 2 2 calculation of the flow velocity of a siphon siphon flow is pressurized pipe flow with respect to the calculation of the flow velocity some textbooks munson et al 2013 sklhmre 2016 and research papers potter and barnes 1971 kuwahara et al 2014 give the calculation formula as follows 1 v 2 g h 1 1 λ l d ζ where v is the flow velocity g is the gravity acceleration h 1 is the height from the end of outflow section to the liquid surface of inlet λ is pipe friction coefficient l is the length of the siphon pipe d is the diameter of the siphon pipe and ζ is the local loss coefficient eq 1 is derivated based on bernoulli s equation and assuming that the flow is continuous zheng et al 2021 re examined the siphon process and pointed out that a when v up v w where v up and v w are the flow velocities calculated by analyzing the upward pipe and whole pipe using bernoulli s equation respectively the flow in siphon pipe can be considered as continuous flow b when v up v w the flow in siphon pipe is not continuous flow but pulse flow and c therefore the flow velocity v of a siphon should be expressed as 2 v min v up v w where the function min means the value is equal to the smaller value of the two values in the parentheses and v up and v w can be given by zheng et al 2021 3 v up 2 g δ h 1 λ l up d ζ up 4 v w 2 g h 1 1 λ l d ζ where h h max h 0 where h 0 is the height from the liquid surface of inlet to the highest point of the siphon system and h max is the height of the water column corresponding to local atmospheric pressure and l up and ζ up are the length and local loss coefficient of the upward pipe respectively it should be noted that eqs 3 and 4 do not consider the air release from water in a real siphon process as the flow increases the pressure decreases and the air dissolved in water must release zheng et al 2021 considering the air release the flow becomes air water two phase flow similarly the flow may be continuous flow or pulse flow and the flow velocity v of a siphon considering the air release can be given by zheng et al 2021 5 v min v up v w where v up and v w are the flow velocities calculated by analyzing the upward pipe and whole pipe using bernoulli s equation respectively considering the air release and v v up and v w are referred to the mean flow velocity of the water phase which are equal to the volume rates of water flow the area of a cross section of the pipe according to conservation of mass of water so the real velocities of water at different positions are different and hence it is impossible to give a formula like eq 3 or 4 to calculate v up and v w zheng et al 2021 developed the related calculation procedures which can also give the proportion of water to water and air at any position 2 3 some calculation cases in order to better understand the conclusion that the velocity of a siphon may be determined by the lift h 0 or the height difference h 1 between the liquid surfaces zheng et al 2021 some calculation cases are performed a siphon system is shown in fig 3 the pipe was made of polyurethane tubing pu and has a 4 mm diameter the siphon system has a curvature radius of 0 1 m at the vertex the lengths of the upward pipe and whole pipe are assumed as h 0 and h 0 h 1 respectively the local atmospheric pressure is equal to the standard atmospheric pressure 101 325 kpa for simplicity firstly air release is not considered which may influence on the accuracy of calculation but will not influence on the law of calculation so eqs 2 4 are applied to calculate the values of v v up and v w respectively the following formulae are applied to determine the pipe friction coefficient λ zheng et al 2021 6 λ 64 re for 0 re 2320 a 0 000007 r e 0 0108 for 2320 re 4000 b 0 316 r e 0 25 for 4000 re 100000 c where re is the reynolds number eq 6a is applicable to laminar flow and eq 6c is the blasius equation li et al 2011 eq 6b is obtained by a linear fitting of the two points 2320 64 2320 and 4000 0 316 40000 25 0 262 is assigned as the value of ζ sklhmre 2016 with respect to different values of h 0 the obtained values of v up and v w are plotted in fig 4 the results in fig 4 show that a when h 0 less than 5 m and h 1 0 1 to 5000 m v w v up i e when h 0 less than 5 m the velocity is determined by h 1 eq 2 and b when h 0 5 7 m and h 1 50 m v up v w i e when h 0 5 7 m and h 1 50 m the velocity is determined by h 0 eq 2 based on the results of these cases we can obtain the following understanding that when the lift is high e g h 0 6 m and the height difference is large e g h 1 50 m the drainage capacity of a siphon system is determined by v up to further study the relationship between v and h 1 for a low lift e g h 0 6 m some calculation cases are performed and the results are given in fig 5 the information in fig 5 shows that a for a particular h 0 as h 1 increases v w increases first and then tends to be stable b for a same h 1 v w decreases with the increase of h 0 and with respect to a sufficiently large h 1 the values of v w are very close for different values of h 0 c when h 0 6 m v w50 v w5000 88 4 and v w100 v w5000 93 8 where v w50 v w100 and v w5000 are the values of v for h 1 50 m h 1 100 m and h 1 5000 m respectively and d therefore to maximize the drainage capacity of the siphon for a low lift a value 50 m is recommended to assign to h 1 and 100 m is better for simplicity in this study when v up v w the lift of a siphon is defined as a low lift and when v up v w the lift of a siphon is defined as a high lift with respect to h 1 50 m some cases are analyzed considering air release based on the procedures developed by zheng et al 2021 the values of pressure p top at the top of siphons are obtained as plotted in fig 6 the results in fig 6 show that a as h 0 increases p top sharply decreases to one value close to zero and the values v up v w decrease b when v up v w less than 1 i e v up v w p top is less than vapor pressure of water which means that cavitation occurs to potentially reduce the durability of siphon pipes and c therefore for a siphon with a high lift increasing v up may decrease the damage risk of a siphon pipe due to the cavitation note that the vapor pressure of water is related to the temperature and is equal to 3 3 kpa for the temperature of 25 munson et al 2013 2 4 concepts of the siphon drainage system with variable diameters based on analysis above we know that a when the groundwater level is high i e the siphon has a low lift h 1 should be designed as sufficiently large such as 50 m to ensure that the siphon system has the maximum drainage capacity to reduce the groundwater level b as the groundwater level decreases to some level i e the siphon system becomes the siphon with a high lift the drainage capacity is determined by h 0 c in order to ensure the stability of landslides landslides should avoid high groundwater levels so the siphon drainage systems should be in operation with high lifts and d therefore the key to ensure the stability of a landslide is to improve the drainage capacity of the siphon drainage system under a high lift obviously the drainage capacity of a siphon system is determined by the volume rate of flow of a single siphon pipe and the number of pipes improving the volume rate of flow of a single siphon pipe can effectively save costs according to eq 3 the volume rate of flow of the upward pipe q up can be given by 7 q up 0 25 π d 2 2 g δ h 1 λ l up d ζ up eq 7 indicates that it can increase q up to enlarge d however as described above the internal diameter of siphon pipes at the top should be less than or equal to 4 mm to ensure continuous operation of a siphon drainage system not unnaturally a siphon drainage system with variable diameters can be designed of which a part of the upward pipe can be designed as the pipe with a diameter of 4 mm and the rest part of the upward pipe and all of the downward pipe can be designed as the pipe with a diameter of 4 mm fig 7 3 calculation of flow velocity of a siphon with variable diameters 3 1 no considering air release similar to the siphon system with a constant diameter zheng et al 2021 the final velocity is determined by the smaller one of v upv and v wv where v upv and v wv are the flow velocities calculated by analyzing the upward pipe and whole pipe using bernoulli s equation without considering air release respectively it should be noted that v upv is the velocity corresponding to the small diameter d s of the upward pipe fig 7 when our analysis object is the upward pipe based on bernoulli s equation we can obtain 8 v upv 2 2 g 1 λ l l upl d s 4 d l 5 d s 4 d l 4 ζ upl λ s l ups d s ζ ups h 0 h max where l upl and l ups are the lengths of lds and sds fig 7 respectively d l and d s are the diameter of lds and sds respectively and ζ upl and ζ ups are the local loss coefficients of lds and sds respectively substitution of h h max h 0 into eq 8 gives 9 v upv 2 g δ h 1 λ l l upl d s 4 d l 5 d s 4 d l 4 ζ upl λ s l ups d s ζ ups when our analysis object is the whole pipe based on bernoulli s equation v wv can be given by 10 v wv 2 g h 1 1 λ l l upl d s 4 d l 5 d s 4 d l 4 ζ upl λ s l ups l down d s ζ ups ζ down it should be noted that v w is also the velocity of the whole pipe corresponding to d s therefore the real flow velocity v v of a siphon with variable diameters can be expressed as 11 v v min v upv v wv since λ l and λ s are probably related to v v munson et al 2013 v v in eq 11 needs to be solved by iteration 3 2 considering air release similarly when air release is considered v v should be equal to the smaller of the velocities of the upward pipe v upv and the whole pipe v wv where v v v upv and v wv refer to the mean flow velocity of water and are equal to the volume rates of water flow the area of a cross section having the small diameter d s henry s law sander 2015 states that the amount of dissolved gas in the liquid is proportional to its partial pressure in the gas phase and the proportionality factor is called the henry s law constant there are many variants of henry s law constants and in this study the following definition is adopted sander 2015 12 h c a p where h is the henry s law solubility constant mol m 3 pa 1 c a is the concentration of a species in the aqueous phase mol m 3 and p is the partial pressure of that species in the gas phase under equilibrium conditions pa based on henry s law zheng et al 2021 derived the formula of the proportion k w x of water to water and air at one position as follows 13 k w x p x h a p la p x r t p x where h a is the henry s law constant of air p la is the local atmospheric pressure px is the pressure at r 8 314472 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant t is the air temperature according to the conservation of mass and assuming that there is no relative motion between the water and air the flow velocity v wa x v of water and air at can be given by 14 v wa x v v upv d s 2 k w x d x 2 v upv d s 2 d x 2 h a p la p x r t p x p x where dx is the diameter of the pipe at x it should be noted that v upv is the velocity of water without air similar to the siphon system with constant diameter zheng et al 2021 the upward pipe is our analysis object and we can obtain 15 p i ρ g h max v upv 2 2 g i 1 i v waupv i 1 2 λ i 1 l i d i v waupv i 1 2 ζ up i h i a v waupv i v upv d s 2 d i 2 h a p l a p i r t p i p i b where i means the i th section of the upward pipe and can be equal to 1 to i i represents the number of divided sections of the upward pipe and should be assigned a sufficiently large value ζ up i is the local loss coefficient of the i th section and if the i th section does not have local loss ζ up i 0 v waupv i and v waupv i 1 are the velocities of the water and air of the i th and i 1 th sections of the upward pipe respectively di is the diameter of the i th section of the upward pipe λi 1 is the obtained pipe friction coefficient based on v waupv i 1 and di the calculation flow chart of the velocity of the upward pipe considering air release is given in fig 8 where v upv can be determined by eq 9 ε is the convergence criterion and δ is the iteration step size it should be noted that a because v upv v upv δ 0 and b pi is the pressure so pi 0 similar to the siphon system with constant diameter zheng et al 2021 the whole pipe is our analysis object and

respectively the calculation flow chart of the velocity of the whole pipe considering air release is given in fig 9 where v wv can be determined by eq 10 similarly δ 0 and pi 0 finally the flow

upv 4 validation of tests 4 1 experimental setup and scheme in order to verify the siphon drainage system with variable diameters the experimental setup as shown in fig 7 was established the pipe made of pu had a curvature radius of 0 1 m at the vertex sixteen experiments were performed and the schemes are given in table 1 the flow velocity was measured by weighing the water collected in the outlet tank for some time it should be noted that a single phase flowmeter did not work well in these experiments since the flow contained much air released from the water due to the decrease in pressure it should be noted that h 1 was not set as a value 50 m due to the limited experimental conditions 4 2 experimental results and discussion for the different schemes the measured and calculated values of the flow velocity are plotted in fig 10 it should be noted that in the calculations for the experiments a the calculated values are determined by eq 17 b the pipe friction coefficient λ is determined by eq 6 c the value of h a can be expressed as h a k n 2 h n 2 k o 2 h o 2 where k n2 and k o2 are the proportions of n2 and o2 in air and generally equal to 79 and 21 respectively and h n2 and h o2 are the henry s law constants of n2 and o2 in air respectively and can be determined by the expression between h at temperature t denoted as h t and h at the reference temperature t 298 15 k denoted as h as follows sander 2015 18 h t h exp δ sol h r 1 t 1 t where sol h represents the enthalpy of dissolution and r 8 314472 m3 pa mol 1 k 1 is the gas constant and d the values of h and sol h r in eq 18 for o2 and n2 are tabulated in table 2 sander 2015 the results in fig 10 show that a for all siphons with variable diameters the calculated values v vcalculated are very close to the experimental measurements v vmeasured and all of the error rates er are less than 4 b therefore the developed calculation method of the velocity of a siphon with variable diameters is validated and c for siphons with a constant diameter the calculated value v calculated for scheme 1 is very close to the experimental measurements v measured while the calculated values v calculated for schemes 4 7 and 12 have relatively large er which are around 18 with respect to schemes 4 7 and 12 because the all calculation results of v up eq 3 are less than those of v w eq 4 they are the siphons with high lift i e their velocities are determined by the lift table 1 shows that schemes 4 7 and 12 have the same lift so the three schemes can be regarded as the same for schemes 4 7 and 12 re is 2320 i e the flow is non laminar flow with respect to non laminar flow the value of λ is not easy to precisely determine and the equations eq 6 used in this study are empirical formulae as a rule of thumb a 10 accuracy for λ is the best expected munson et al 2013 besides each siphon system of the aforementioned three schemes have a constant diameter and high lift so much air is released in the siphon process as stated by zheng et al 2021 it is assumed that there is no relative motion between the water and air which may bring some errors the more air is released the greater the brought error may be in order to study the promotion effect brought by variable diameters the increase rate of velocity irv of each siphon with variable diameters is calculated based on the follows 19 irv v v v v where v v is the velocity of the siphon with variable diameters and v is the velocity of the siphon with a constant diameter which has the same situation as the aforementioned siphon with variable diameters for example for scheme 2 irv 2 v v2 v 1 v 1 and for scheme 16 irv 16 v v16 v 12 v 12 the values of irv for all schemes with variable diameters are given in fig 11 note that all measured values of velocity are used for eq 19 the results in fig 11 show that a for all schemes with variable diameters the irv ranges 15 and 116 comparing with those with constant diameters b for the same h 0 h 1 and d l the value of irv increases as the location l upl of variable diameter increases c for the same h 0 h 1 and l upl irv increases with the growth of d l and d the promotion effect brought by variable diameters for higher lift siphons is obviously better than that of lower lift siphons it is worth remembering that the final velocity is determined by the smaller one of v upv and v wv so the maximum value of irv is equal to v wv v v for example with respect to h 0 8 25 m h 1 24 m and l upl 8 m d l 6 5 mm is sufficiently large to ensure v upv v wv so further increase of d l will not bring any increase of velocity therefore we can compare the values of v upv and v wv to estimate the value of d l besides with respective to the location of variable diameters around 0 2 m below of the top of siphons is recommend to ensure the long term stability of siphons the conclusion from zheng et al 2021 shows that when v upv v wv the released air is much less than that when v upv v wv therefore the variable diameters significantly less air release which is consistent with the observed bubbles during the experiments and is beneficial to the long term stability of siphon systems 5 a sample of the siphon with variable diameters sun et al 2019b reported an ancient landslide located on the left 205 national road k1692 in zhejiang province china the landslide has a width along the highway of approximately 220 m and a length perpendicular to the highway of approximately 300 m the area where the landslide is located has abundant rainfall the annual average rainy days are 166 d and the annual average precipitation reaches 1762 mm to increase the stability of the landslide a siphon drainage system fig 12 with constant diameter was completed and started to drain on september 13 2013 the flow monitoring shows that the drainage system has worked well so far and provides an average daily discharge of 5 5 m3 here we try to design a siphon with variable diameters for the ancient landslide as a sample the designed location drilling depth and inclined angle of the siphon system with variable diameters are selected as the same as those of the siphon system with the constant diameter fig 12 the lift corresponding to the highest groundwater level before drainage can be regarded as the minimum value of h 0 which is equal to 4 5 m since stability analysis of a landslide is not the point of this study assume that the target controlling groundwater level is 5 m below the highest groundwater level before drainage fig 12 shows l up 32 m the value of the downward pipe can be determined by 20 l downward h 0 h 1 sin α where α is the mean slope angle of the landslide and is equal to 32 first of all the ultimate value of v w should be estimated by ensure to maximize the drainage capacity of the siphon with l up 32 m and a constant diameter of 4 mm for the preliminary calculation air release can be ignored so eq 4 is used to calculate the values of v w for different values of h 1 which are given in fig 13 the information in fig 13 shows that the ultimate value of v w is around 1 m s so h 1 can be designed as 150 200 m and in this study 150 m is adopted it should be noted that the results of fig 13 are different from that of fig 5 because in this ancient landslide case l up is equal to 32 m while in fig 5 l up is assumed to be equal to h 0 secondly calculate the values of v upv of the siphon with different values of d l and h 0 0 2 m below of the top of siphons is selected as the location of variable diameters for the preliminary calculation air release can be ignored so eq 9 is used to calculate the values of v upv the results are plotted in fig 14 the results show that a for different values of h 0 the siphon with a larger d s has larger drainage capacity and b 0 008 mm can be selected as the designed value of d s to ensure v upv is always larger than the ultimate value of v w which is equal to 1 m s finally calculation procedures figs 8 and 9 are used to check the calculation by considering air release with respect to h 0 4 5 m 9 5 m h 1 150 m and d s 0 008 mm the results are given in fig 15 the results show that when the groundwater level ranges the highest groundwater level before drainage h 0 4 5 m and the target controlling groundwater level h 0 9 5 m the drainage system is always able to drainage with a value v v close to the ultimate drainage capacity 1 m s therefore the designs of h 1 150 m and d s 0 008 mm for the siphon system is proper to study the improvement effect of the variable diameters the velocity v of the siphon system with constant diameter 4 mm is also calculated and plotted in fig 15 comparison between v v and v clearly shows the variable diameters significantly improve the drainage capacity of a siphon system 6 conclusions to improve the stability of landslides slopes this study proposed a new siphon drainage system the siphon drainage system with variable diameters fig 7 of which the diameter of a part of the upward pipe is designed as 4 mm and the diameter of the rest part of the upward pipe and all of the downward pipe are designed as 4 mm for the new siphon drainage systems we presented the formulae of the flow velocity to estimate the drainage capacity of the new system the flow of a siphon may be continuous or non continuous flow zheng et al 2021 these presented formulae fig 9 can cover continuous and discontinuous flow and can consider the influence of the release of air from liquid on the flow velocity a series of physical experiments were conducted to verify the new siphon drainage system and the estimation method of the drainage capacity the increase rate of velocity irv eq 19 was defined to quantitatively assess the promotion effect brought by variable diameters the experimental results figs 10 and 11 show that a for all siphons with variable diameters the calculated values are very close to the experimental measurements and all of the error rates are less than 4 b therefore the developed calculation method of the velocity of a siphon with variable diameters is validated c for all schemes with variable diameters the irv ranges 15 and 116 comparing with the siphons with constant diameters and d the promotion effect brought by variable diameters for higher lift siphons is obviously better than that of lower lift siphons besides the variable diameters significantly less air release which is beneficial to the long term stability of siphon systems besides an ancient landslide located in zhejiang province china was used as a sample to illustrate how to design a siphon with variable diameters the design procedures were described in detail to further study the improvement effect of the variable diameters the velocities of the systems with variable diameters and constant diameter were compared the results fig 15 clearly show the variable diameters significantly improve the drainage capacity of a siphon system credit

4638,it is of great significance to evaluate satellite precipitation products performance for short duration heavy precipitation in typhoon events in this study the performance of gpm global precipitation measurement imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm with different run products early run imerg er late run imerg lr and final run imerg fr were evaluated when typhoon lekima landed in the eastern coastal area of china in 2019 taking the rain gauge data as the reference we carried out the study by comparing precipitation characteristics verifying evaluation indices and analyzing the heavy precipitation process the differences between imerg products in different stages and affected areas of the typhoon lekima were compared on the whole the correlation coefficient cc of imerg products was 0 51 0 56 and the imerg fr had the best probability of detection pod 0 88 followed by imerg lr pod 0 84 and imerg er pod 0 81 with an increase in release latency the precipitation retrieved by imerg products increased and gradually approached the rain gauge observations the evaluation indices result showed that imerg products tend to underestimate precipitation and failed to show good performance for high intensity precipitation the error was positively related to the precipitation intensity the performance of imerg lr was very close to that of imerg fr during the typhoon short duration heavy precipitation although imerg fr had higher latency and more processing keywords precipitation imerg evaluation typhoon lekima 1 introduction typhoon activities often produce excessive precipitation resulting in freshwater flooding maggioni and massari 2018 and landslide kirschbaum and stanley 2018 most of the precipitation is caused by typhoon events in china s eastern coastal area every year zhou and wu 2019 heavy precipitation of typhoons will cause substantial economic losses and casualties fang et al 2017 jiansheng et al 2020 it is of great practical significance to scientifically recognize the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of typhoon precipitation and mitigate its impact on coastal areas due to typhoon precipitation s complex physical process and spatial variability it is challenging to capture quickly and measure accurately besides the lack of large scale precipitation data will lead to difficulties in establishing typhoon prediction models young et al 2017 in recent years with the development of satellite remote sensing technology satellite precipitation products have become a new source of precipitation data gradually playing an important role in precipitation monitoring research maggioni et al 2016 the use of satellite precipitation products is a practical method to estimate

and resolution hou et al 2014 skofronick jackson et al 2017 among the evaluation and comparison of various satellite precipitation products imerg gpm mission s widely used product shows excellent precipitation detection performance aslami et al 2019 peng et al 2020 tan and santo 2018 with its stable performance imerg is often used for extreme precipitation analysis on the one hand imerg is used to study heavy precipitation by taking rain gauge data as precipitation observations prakash et al 2016 detected the frequency of heavy precipitation events throughout india fang et al 2019 examined the extreme precipitation events in china and found that imerg generally underestimated the extreme rainfall rate while overestimated the total annual extreme precipitation imerg products performed satisfactorily in detecting the spatial variability of precipitation with an accuracy rate of nearly 62 for reconstructed precipitation omranian et al 2018 moreover comparing the daily heavy precipitation recorded by the global rain gauge network with imerg libertino et al 2016 found that the matching rate between them was close to 60 on the other hand previous studies often evaluate heavy precipitation brought by typhoons or storms habib et al 2009 evaluated heavy precipitation during six tropical storms in louisiana usa it was found that precipitation products tracked reasonably well the temporal evolution of rainfall during the analyzed storms however precipitation products were characterized with varying degrees of bias across the different analyzed storms and tended to overestimate low rain rates and underestimate high rain rates wang et al 2017a compared the eight typhoons in china s coastal area in 2014 and 2015 and explored the applicability of imerg in different typhoon paths the tendency of satellite precipitation products to underestimate heavy precipitation in typhoon events was found zhang et al 2019 evaluated the performance of extreme storms in guangdong china and analyzed the performance differences of imerg at different precipitation rates it was found that the detection correlation of imerg was all higher than 0 7 which can capture the spatio temporal patterns of storm accumulated rainfall besides imerg underestimated the storm accumulated precipitation and the underestimation error is between 19 38 and 58 77 the studies of typhoon heavy rainfall events in southern china and taiwan island found that imerg can capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of heavy precipitation chen et al 2013 huang et al 2019 these studies indicate that satellite precipitation products can show the spatial pattern of heavy typhoon precipitation and valuable in typhoon event monitoring it should be noted that previous studies usually focused on the overall evaluation of heavy typhoon precipitation habib et al 2009 wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2019 the evaluation of precipitation variation characteristics at each moment of typhoon movement needs further discussion imerg provides three different run products early run late run and final run after this referred to as imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr the release latency and retrieved precipitation of these products are different comparative evaluations of imerg products have been conducted in several study areas including the temperate broad leaved forest climate in austria o et al 2017 the tropical desert climate in saudi arabia mahmoud et al 2018 and the subtropical monsoon climate in pearl river basin of china wang et al 2017b and the temperate monsoon climate in huaihe river basin of china su et al 2019 in these months or even the annual scale comparison imerg fr is generally verified to have high accuracy and reasonable practicability however when the study object is short duration heavy precipitation the performance of each run product is unknown using satellite precipitation products to describe the characteristics of heavy precipitation accurately and distinguish convective versus stratiform precipitation regions in tropical cyclones are particularly crucial for disaster management kaku 2019 in order to conduct a comprehensive verification it is necessary to evaluate the performance of different imerg products under the background of typhoon precipitation the powerful typhoon lekima number 1909 in 2019 was characterized by strong landfall intensity and large scale impact han et al 2021 the purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the v06 version of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr for the lekima heavy precipitation event the rain gauge data was used as observed precipitation to compare the characteristics and differences of these imerg products in each stage and affected area of the whole typhoon event from the aspects in retrieved precipitation characteristics evaluation indices verification rainfall process changes and extreme precipitation statistics through the analysis and evaluation of different run products precipitation process of lekima was studied and the effect of imerg products on typhoon precipitation monitoring was explored this study can provide a reference for monitoring typhoon heavy precipitation and recommend more suitable satellite precipitation products to researchers and users 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and typhoon process the study area fig 1 is located in the eastern coastal region of china along the route of lekima typhoon including zhejiang province jiangsu province shandong province and shanghai municipality city except for the mountainous and hilly terrain in zhejiang average elevation is 312 54 m the rest of the provinces and city are generally plain areas average elevation is between 4 59 and 91 07 m the study area has abundant precipitation with annual mean precipitation of 800 1400 mm meanwhile the study area is susceptible to typhoons in the summer especially in zhejiang where more than 40 typhoons landed in 1949 2019 typhoons and their heavy precipitation are harmful to regional economic development this study s period selected is from august 9th to 12th in beijing time utc 8 h typhoon lekima landed in zhejiang at 1 45 a m on august 10th beijing time with a maximum wind speed scale of 16 52 m s super typhoon then it moved northward along the land crossed zhejiang and jiangsu and into the yellow sea during this process the wind speed gradually decreased it landed again in shandong at 8 50p m on august 11th when the wind speed reached scale of 9 23 m s tropical storm after that the typhoon moved to the bohai sea and gradually weakened china meteorological administration stopped monitoring it on august 13th affected by the typhoon lekima the precipitation intensity and spatial coverage in the study area increased rapidly and many floods occurred the rainfall in zhejiang gradually increased on the 9th peaked on the 10th morning and gradually weakened on the 11th and 12th the rainfall in jiangsu and shanghai peaked on the 10th afternoon after that the rainfall peaked in shandong on the 11th morning and eventually decreased 2 2 imerg precipitation product imerg precipitation product is based on the gpm constellation of passive microwave sensors low earth orbit satellites and infrared sensors geostationary satellites fused with the high spatial and temporal precipitation observation data huffman et al 2000a 2020b imerg released the version v06 in 2019 compared with version v05 it had been optimized and adjusted in data processing algorithms and verification huffman et al 2020b with the addition of gpm microwave imager gmi and dual frequency precipitation radar dpr imerg has enhanced the detection ability to trace and solid precipitation thus improving the detection accuracy effectively skofronick jackson et al 2018 three imerg products are available for download https gpm nasa gov data access downloads gpm imerg er and imerg lr are quasi real time products with release latency of 4 and 12 hours respectively imerg fr is a late stage research product with a delay of 3 5 months the spatial resolution of imerg products is 0 1 and the temporal resolution is available in many options imerg er has four types in temporal resolution 30 min 3 h 1 d and 7d and imerg lr has five types 30 min 3 h 1 d 7d and 1 month the range in the temporal resolution of imerg fr is 30 min 1 d and 1 month imerg products cover all degrees of longitude and latitude 60 n 60 s imerg er only uses forward propagation and imerg lr adds backward propagation jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 the data used by imerg fr is more abundant and corrected by monthly precipitation analysis of the global precipitation climate center gpcc it can be seen that the processing and usage data from imerg er to imerg fr are enhanced continuously while the release time is also extending 2 3 rain gauge data the hourly rain gauges were selected as the observation data these data were derived from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn all observation data were subjected to strict quality control and had high accuracy and reliability which were suitable as the reference for the evaluation of satellite precipitation products chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 some gauges have missing records at certain times due to this study s short time 96 h the missing gauges were directly removed to avoid statistical errors and 253 gauges were reserved for studying analysis 3 methods 3 1 evaluation indices and imerg comparison in this study evaluation indices were used to evaluate imerg products performance mainly including three statistical indices and three categorical indices table 1 statistical indices verify the accuracy characteristics of satellite precipitation products 1 correlation coefficient cc quantify the linear correlation between imerg products and rain gauge data 2 root mean square error rmse represents the dispersion degree of the data set reflecting the overall error level of imerg products 3 relative bias rb the average error trend reflects the phenomenon that imerg products overestimate or underestimate precipitation categorical indices evaluate the ability of satellite precipitation products to identify precipitation events 1 probability of detection pod the ratio of precipitation detected by imerg products to observed precipitation 2 false alarm ratio far the fraction of events estimated by the imerg but not detected by the rain gauge 3 critical success index csi reflects the overall performance of imerg products by integrating the features of accurate prediction false prediction and missing precipitation events in the table p represents the imerg and g represents the rain gauge h is the frequency of accurate precipitation forecast f is the frequency of false precipitation report and m is the frequency of missed precipitation report based on error percent ep and agreement index ai the precipitation change process of three imerg products was analyzed ep is the error ratio of imerg relative to the rain gauge at each time ai measures the consistency between imerg and rain gauge gebregiorgis et al 2018 huang et al 2019 the closer ai is to 1 the better the consistency between imerg products and rain gauge data 1 ep g i p i g i 100 2 ai 1 g i p i 2 p i g g i g 2 where p is imerg product and g is the rain gauge in order to analyze the spatial difference between imerg products and rain gauge data when wind speed changes it is necessary to determine the typhoon rainband it is more reasonable to select the rain gauges in the principal rainband for subsequent analysis here the maximum wind speed radius is used as the typhoon rainband the maximum wind speed radius is related to wind speed and geographic latitude willoughby and rahn 2004 3 l 51 6 exp 0 0223 v fmax 0 0281 α where v fmax is the maximum wind speed and α is the latitude 3 2 evaluation process this study focuses on evaluating and comparing the differences of imerg products first during the typhoon imerg performance and characteristics in different regions were compared then according to the selected indices the evaluation results of imerg products in time space and precipitation intensity were further analyzed finally the spatial differences of imerg products and rain gauges during changes in wind speed were explored when the typhoon made landfall this difference was defined as the rain gauge s interpolation result minus the imerg precipitation totals the rainfall variation process and extreme precipitation characteristics during the typhoon were analyzed the precipitation level scheme used in the study comes from the china meteorological administration it is divided into six levels according to the cumulative precipitation within 24 hours light rain lr 0 1 9 9 mm moderate rain mr 10 24 9 mm heavy rain hr 25 49 9 mm rainstorm rs 50 99 9 mm heavy rainstorm hrs 100 249 9 mm extra heavy rainstorm ehrs greater than 250 mm it should be noted that the ground reference data and imerg products selected in this study are different in data type and temporal scale these differences need to be reduced through operation definition and preprocessing hu et al 2020 tang et al 2016 tong et al 2014 rain gauge data are discontinuous in space and interpolation processing often brings uncertainty katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 in order to ensure the accuracy of the rain gauge data this study compared and evaluated imerg on the point scale when displaying the difference between precipitation level and wind speed scale the rain gauge results are interpolated to the grid with spatial resolution of 0 1 for intuitive comparison imerg products have been processed as hourly products and converted to beijing time for unified time presentation in this study 4 results 4 1 overall comparison of imerg products all imerg products showed similar precipitation change trends fig 2 prior to landfall august 9th the precipitation in the study area gradually increased the mean precipitation rate was greatest from 10 to 11th and began to subside on 12th the mean hourly precipitations of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were 0 85 mm 1 07 mm and 1 38 mm respectively with the change of release latency the precipitation of different imerg products gradually increases from the perspective of precipitation level the daily difference between imerg products and rain gauge data was evaluated fig 3 imerg products could display the process of precipitation migration changes along with typhoon movement compared with the rain gauge data however in terms of the proportion of extreme precipitation rs hrs ehrs imerg products were all lower than the result of rain gauges from imerg er to imerg fr this difference gradually decreased imerg er and imerg lr quasi real time precipitation products had the overall mean differences were 20 53 and 15 71 in predicting extreme precipitation with the further processing of the products the imerg fr released with 3 5 months latency reduced this error and the overall mean difference was 7 53 as shown in fig 4 a d each region s precipitation change is closely related to typhoon activity according to the cumulative precipitation results the differences between imerg products can be seen intuitively fig 4e h precipitation results of different imerg products gradually increased with the release latency imerg er and imerg lr were always lower than those of rain gauge observations imerg fr was significantly lower than the observed data in shandong and jiangsu the difference is 10 18 and 5 79 mm day respectively however imerg fr was higher than the observed data in zhejiang with a difference of 4 58 mm day and consistent with the observed one in shanghai imerg quasi real time precipitation products underestimated cumulative precipitation imerg fr products optimized the underestimate phenomenon but the performance was different in each region overall imerg fr with 3 5 months latency was closer to the rain gauge observations but the quasi real time precipitation products performed better on some dates for example the mean daily precipitation of imerg er was closer than imerg fr in shandong on the 9th and the mean daily precipitation of imerg lr was closer than imerg fr in zhejiang on the 10th table 2 the differences between imerg products were small below 0 84 mm day when the daily precipitation accumulation was light rain with the increase in daily precipitation imerg products showed noticeable step changes in precipitation value there is a rapid short term demand to obtain precipitation when monitoring typhoons and imerg lr is a good choice for the analysis of typhoon precipitation characteristics in quasi real time 4 2 analysis of evaluation indices the performance of imerg products was evaluated based on statistical and categorical indices table 3 the statistical significance of the linear correlation between imerg products and rain gauge data had been tested and the p value was 0 01 which was statistically significant there were some slight differences between these products on cc and rmse rb showed that imerg er and imerg fr underestimate precipitation which is consistent with the previous conclusion for this typhoon event the pod of all imerg products was higher than 0 8 the far was lower than 0 3 and the mean csi was 0 65 showing good performance as shown in fig 5 the cc of imerg products was concentrated in the range of 0 5 0 7 at the threshold above 0 7 imerg lr and imerg fr had 60 and 57 counts far higher than 36 counts of imerg er the distribution of cc had no apparent regional aggregation the rmse was mainly within the range of 2 4 mm accounting for 48 62 moreover the gauges with rmse greater than 4 mm were mainly found in eastern zhejiang and central shandong the rb of imerg er and imerg lr was generally below 0 mm for 88 93 and 79 84 of the gauges indicating precipitation underestimation imerg fr was higher in counts with rb above 0 mm than that of the other two products the improvement of imerg lr was the best because from imerg er to imerg lr cc had great improvement while imerg lr to imerg fr had slight improvement the error distributions of rmse were similar for these products in the range of rb 0 5 0 5 mm the counts of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were 138 176 and 190 respectively we set different precipitation thresholds for categorical indices and observed their characteristics fig 6 with an increase in the threshold pod decreased while far increased gradually when the threshold increased to 5 mm hour csi stabilized at 0 3 it can be seen that imerg fails to show good performance in detection for high intensity precipitation judging by the categorical indices results three imerg products were roughly at the same performance level imerg fr probability of detection performed slightly better and the false alarm ratio of imerg lr was the best one of the three products it should be noted that the result in fig 6 is only based on the small sample size of this typhoon event and there is a potential problem of low robustness the correlation between imerg and rain gauge data was analyzed fig 7 the line fits are all below the y x line indicating that all three imerg products on average underestimate the gauge observed precipitation in all days from imerg er to imerg fr the slope increased obviously reflecting the gradual optimization of fitting degree the 10th was the date with the highest precipitation and intensity in the study area the intercept on this day was significantly higher than other dates with the expansion of gauge precipitation range on the horizontal coordinate in fig 7 12th 9th 11th 10th the intercepts showed an increasing trend in table 4 the result of daily evaluation indices during the study period was listed the statistical significance of correlation of imerg lr august 10th imerg er august 12th and imerg fr august 12th was between 0 01 and 0 05 level moreover the statistical significance of correlation of the remaining data was at the 0 01 level it can be seen that the daily cc of imerg lr and imerg fr was better than that of imerg er imerg lr even performed better than imerg fr on some dates in cc the rmse of three imerg products were actually on the same level and the imerg lr had a lower daily rmse and performed relatively best as the overall evaluation mentioned above the rb of imerg fr was the best with the lowest deviation however the rb results in table 4 showed that the actual rb of imerg products with shorter release latency was low it can be seen that the positive and negative rb results on different dates in the overall evaluation offset this imperceptible error imerg fr had the best pod compared with other imerg products but the far performed poorly the performance of imerg lr was close to imerg fr although imerg fr has higher latency and more processing in this typhoon event we found that imerg fr had very little advantage over imerg lr in precipitation performance despite the increased latency 4 3 imerg precipitation inspection during lekima land movement during the typhoon lekima land movement the rain gauges precipitation interpolation fig 8 a b and precipitation difference between imerg and rain gauge data fig 8e p when the wind speed scale changed was calculated after the typhoon landed at 03 h and 05 h on the 10th the wind speed changed from scale 16 to 15 and then to 12 precipitation at these moments was mainly in zhejiang as well as nearby shanghai and southern jiangsu imerg er showed an underestimation of precipitation the difference is positive accounting for 85 04 of gauges and the mean underestimation was 1 51 mm hour imerg lr overestimated precipitation in the northern region from the typhoon 2 57 mm hour while imerg fr overestimated precipitation in the central region of the typhoon 4 69 mm hour at 09 h on the 10th the wind speed changed from scale 12 to 11 at this moment the typhoon center was still located in zhejiang it can be seen that the precipitation difference around the typhoon center was complex in jiangsu and northern areas the imerg products were closer to the rain gauge observations and imerg lr and imerg fr performed relatively well at 20 h on the 10th the typhoon moved to the boundary between zhejiang and jiangsu and the wind speed changed from scale 11 to 9 the rain gauge result showed strong precipitation clusters in the northern part of the typhoon center the tendency of these clusters to underestimate precipitation was clear within the typhoon rainband imerg products overestimated precipitation at 03 h table 5 after that imerg er underestimated precipitation in the next three wind speed changes ranging from 1 55 to 2 66 mm hour imerg lr underestimated precipitation at 05 h and 20 h and overestimated precipitation at 09 h imerg fr underestimated precipitation at 20 h and overestimated precipitation at 05 h and 09 h moreover from imerg er to imerg fr there is a tendency to overestimate precipitation when typhoon wind speed changes gradually the indices of extreme precipitation during the typhoon including maximum hourly precipitation the hourly precipitation at the top 1 and 5 for comparison the overall mean precipitation was introduced were summarized as shown in table 6 the order of the maximum hourly precipitation was imerg lr imerg er rain gauge imerg fr rain gauge data had the largest value in the mean hourly precipitation at the top 1 and 5 in terms of high intensity precipitation there was always a difference between imerg products and observed precipitation the shorter the imerg release latency the larger the error combined with the indices result shown in fig 6 the performance of imerg products was not ideal under the high intensity precipitation based on ep and ai the precipitation change process of imerg products was analyzed fig 9 counts on the x axis of fig 9 indicate the number of comparisons and counts greater than 10 mm hour were counted here in the whole study period the error rate over 87 times was above 0 which represented that the imerg precipitation was lower than rain gauge observations the ep change trend of imerg fr was always lower than other imerg products showing relatively good performance imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr had 38 36 38 85 and 40 29 respectively when the agreement degree with the rain gauges was equal to 0 about half of the time imerg products consistency exceeded 0 5 indicating the consistency is good 5 discussions 5 1 the influence of rain gauge density and data overlap the rain gauges used in the study are evenly distributed in space furthermore most of the study area is in the plains 88 93 of the gauges below 100 m the impact of topography is not obvious however the density characteristics of rain gauge distribution will affect the statistical result tian et al 2017 counted the rain gauge density used in previous studies on satellite precipitation products and we made a comparison here the rain gauge density in this study was 0 067 site 100 km2 ranking sixteenth among thirty five previous studies the rain gauge density provided in this study was far from high density greater than 1 5 site 100 km2 high density gauge networks tend to provide better evaluation indices results and low density gauge networks may underestimate the performance of satellite rainfall products tang et al 2018 tian et al 2017 imerg fr combined with gpcc data to obtain monthly climatological adjustment thus these corrected sites have a data overlap effect on imerg fr gpcc does not provide these adjusted sites directly but releases a grid site number at 1 spatial resolution worldwide the percent between the number of gpcc sites and the rain gauges used in each grid was calculated fig 10 in some marginal areas the proportion reached 100 in other areas especially under the typhoon movement path the percent was between 10 and 40 it can be seen that most rain gauges used in this study were independent of gpcc the data overlap phenomenon exists but had a low impact on this study through the process of rain gauge adjustment the performance of the imerg fr product should be improved however according to the result presented in this study the quasi real time product imerg lr showed performance close to that of imerg fr the cc and csi were equal to each other in the typhoon event and the rmse difference is only 0 15 mm at certain moments imerg lr has performed even better on august 9th the cc and csi of imerg lr were 0 04 and 0 02 higher than that of imerg fr and the rmse difference was 0 23 mm besides the release delay of imerg lr 4 hours is much lower than imerg fr 3 5 months which is more suitable for quasi real time monitoring and analysis of typhoon precipitation 5 2 correction test for imerg products the difference characteristics of imerg precipitation in observation thresholds of the rain gauge data were further analyzed and the correction scheme was tested to improve the accuracy the difference between the imerg products and the rain gauge data is significantly correlated with the typhoon movement taking imerg lr as an example there were obvious differences on august 10th zhejiang and the amplitude range was 2 2 mm hour after the typhoon left zhejiang on the 11th and 12th the difference was reduced to 0 05 mm hour similarly when the typhoon landed in shandong on the 11th the mean daily difference was 47 04 mm and the difference range of other dates was only 1 44 17 04 mm fig 11 shows the hourly difference between imerg and rain gauge data within the threshold of 0 8 mm hour in four regions of the study area imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were 81 86 68 45 and 58 18 of scatter points above zero value which verified that imerg products underestimate precipitation a rule for imerg er and imerg lr was that the mean difference keeps increasing overall with hourly rain gauge precipitation the mean difference of imerg fr was around 0 mm hour showing good performance when the rain gauge precipitation was higher than 5 mm hour the difference rose sharply the difference ranges of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were 0 06 3 52 mm hour 0 05 1 98 mm hour and 0 01 1 06 mm hour respectively when trying to correct imerg products we found that the error of imerg er and imerg lr increased in the threshold of 0 1 mm hour as shown in fig 11 the difference is actually small in this threshold therefore a segmented scheme was adopted and the original values of imerg er and imerg lr were maintained in this threshold and the correction formulas were adopted for other thresholds for imerg fr the segmentation threshold is 5 mm hour we used the data on august 9th and 10th to build the correction model then evaluated the corrected imerg on august 11th and 12th after correction the mean differences of imerg er and imerg lr decreased from 0 86 and 0 64 mm hour to 0 41 and 0 27 mm hour and the correction effect was more significant for the range 2 4 mm hour the mean difference in imerg fr decreased from 0 32 to 0 19 mm hour therefore we propose this scheme to monitor typhoon short duration heavy precipitation based on the quasi real time imerg products establish the correction model through empirical methods 5 3 limitation and prospect this study evaluated the performance of imerg products during typhoon lekima and got preliminary results however it should be noted that the study was only based on extreme precipitation from a single typhoon and the observation time and data were limited although 253 rain gauges were provided the evaluation indices were obtained based on small sample size resulting in unreliable results such as the indices jumped at 20 mm hour in fig 6 in the precipitation analysis of imerg at the moment of wind speed changes the factors causing regional deviation may come from the different contributions of sensors at different observation times the evaluation in this study is a point based comparison for the case of multiple rain gauges in one imerg grid the observation errors of point each rain gauge is evaluated separately and area the rain gauges in the grid are averaged and then evaluated will be affected we compared the two schemes and believed that the error was small in this study the average errors of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr are 0 40 0 93 and 0 91 we want to emphasize the potential uncertainty caused by the evaluation of a single typhoon event this indicates that it is necessary to collect more typhoon heavy rainfall events for further study it is of great significance to quantify compare and summarize the performance of imerg products in typhoon events 6 conclusions it is challenging to forecast the short duration heavy precipitation caused by typhoon events in this study we selected the typhoon lekima in 2019 as an example and the hourly and daily precipitation performance of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were evaluated based on rain gauge data comparing different latency satellite precipitation products can provide application advice and recommend suitable products for users in monitoring the typhoon heavy precipitation process it should be noted that the following conclusions are based on the single typhoon event in this study and may not be representative of all typhoons 1 from the perspective of rainfall change and precipitation level the difference characteristics of three imerg products were analyzed with the release latency the precipitation of different imerg products gradually increases the quasi real time products imerg er and imerg lr have large errors for extreme precipitation imerg fr optimizes this error and is closer to the rain gauge observation 2 based on evaluation indices imerg products tend to underestimate precipitation and fail to perform well for high intensity precipitation comparing the spatial difference between imerg products and rain gauges when typhoon wind speed changes imerg lr and imerg fr perform relatively well there is a significant positive correlation between the observation error of imerg products and precipitation intensity during the typhoon 3 the overall performance of imerg lr is close to that of imerg fr although imerg fr has higher latency and more processing considering the typhoon time response and product performance accuracy imerg lr is suitable for the analysis of typhoon precipitation the accuracy of regional

4638,it is of great significance to evaluate satellite precipitation products performance for short duration heavy precipitation in typhoon events in this study the performance of gpm global precipitation measurement imerg integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm with different run products early run imerg er late run imerg lr and final run imerg fr were evaluated when typhoon lekima landed in the eastern coastal area of china in 2019 taking the rain gauge data as the reference we carried out the study by comparing precipitation characteristics verifying evaluation indices and analyzing the heavy precipitation process the differences between imerg products in different stages and affected areas of the typhoon lekima were compared on the whole the correlation coefficient cc of imerg products was 0 51 0 56 and the imerg fr had the best probability of detection pod 0 88 followed by imerg lr pod 0 84 and imerg er pod 0 81 with an increase in release latency the precipitation retrieved by imerg products increased and gradually approached the rain gauge observations the evaluation indices result showed that imerg products tend to underestimate precipitation and failed to show good performance for high intensity precipitation the error was positively related to the precipitation intensity the performance of imerg lr was very close to that of imerg fr during the typhoon short duration heavy precipitation although imerg fr had higher latency and more processing keywords precipitation imerg evaluation typhoon lekima 1 introduction typhoon activities often produce excessive precipitation resulting in freshwater flooding maggioni and massari 2018 and landslide kirschbaum and stanley 2018 most of the precipitation is caused by typhoon events in china s eastern coastal area every year zhou and wu 2019 heavy precipitation of typhoons will cause substantial economic losses and casualties fang et al 2017 jiansheng et al 2020 it is of great practical significance to scientifically recognize the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of typhoon precipitation and mitigate its impact on coastal areas due to typhoon precipitation s complex physical process and spatial variability it is challenging to capture quickly and measure accurately besides the lack of large scale precipitation data will lead to difficulties in establishing typhoon prediction models young et al 2017 in recent years with the development of satellite remote sensing technology satellite precipitation products have become a new source of

precipitation detection performance aslami et al 2019 peng et al 2020 tan and santo 2018 with its stable performance imerg is often used for extreme precipitation analysis on the one hand imerg is used to study heavy precipitation by taking rain gauge data as precipitation observations prakash et al 2016 detected the frequency of heavy precipitation events throughout india fang et al 2019 examined the extreme precipitation events in china and found that imerg generally underestimated the extreme rainfall rate while overestimated the total annual extreme precipitation imerg products performed satisfactorily in detecting the spatial variability of precipitation with an accuracy rate of nearly 62 for reconstructed precipitation omranian et al 2018 moreover comparing the daily heavy precipitation recorded by the global rain gauge network with imerg libertino et al 2016 found that the matching rate between them was close to 60 on the other hand previous studies often evaluate heavy precipitation brought by typhoons or storms habib et al 2009 evaluated heavy precipitation during six tropical storms in louisiana usa it was found that precipitation products tracked reasonably well the temporal evolution of rainfall during the analyzed storms however precipitation products were characterized with varying degrees of bias across the different analyzed storms and tended to overestimate low rain rates and underestimate high rain rates wang et al 2017a compared the eight typhoons in china s coastal area in 2014 and 2015 and explored the applicability of imerg in different typhoon paths the tendency of satellite precipitation products to underestimate heavy precipitation in typhoon events was found zhang et al 2019 evaluated the performance of extreme storms in guangdong china and analyzed the performance differences of imerg at different precipitation rates it was found that the detection correlation of imerg was all higher than 0 7 which can capture the spatio temporal patterns of storm accumulated rainfall besides imerg underestimated the storm accumulated precipitation and the underestimation error is between 19 38 and 58 77 the studies of typhoon heavy rainfall events in southern china and taiwan island found that imerg can capture the spatial and temporal characteristics of heavy precipitation chen et al 2013 huang et al 2019 these studies indicate that satellite precipitation products can show the spatial pattern of heavy typhoon precipitation and valuable in typhoon event monitoring it should be noted that previous studies usually focused on the overall evaluation of heavy typhoon precipitation habib et al 2009 wang et al 2017a zhang et al 2019 the evaluation of precipitation variation characteristics at each moment of typhoon movement needs further discussion imerg provides three different run products early run late run and final run after this referred to as imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr the release latency and retrieved precipitation of these products are different comparative evaluations of imerg products have been conducted in several study areas including the temperate broad leaved forest climate in austria o et al 2017 the tropical desert climate in saudi arabia mahmoud et al 2018 and the subtropical monsoon climate in pearl river basin of china wang et al 2017b and the temperate monsoon climate in huaihe river basin of china su et al 2019 in these months or even the annual scale comparison imerg fr is generally verified to have high accuracy and reasonable practicability however when the study object is short duration heavy precipitation the performance of each run product is unknown using satellite precipitation products to describe the characteristics of heavy precipitation accurately and distinguish convective versus stratiform precipitation regions in tropical cyclones are particularly crucial for disaster management kaku 2019 in order to conduct a comprehensive verification it is necessary to evaluate the performance of different imerg products under the background of typhoon precipitation the powerful typhoon lekima number 1909 in 2019 was characterized by strong landfall intensity and large scale impact han et al 2021 the purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of the v06 version of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr for the lekima heavy precipitation event the rain gauge data was used as observed precipitation to compare the characteristics and differences of these imerg products in each stage and affected area of the whole typhoon event from the aspects in retrieved precipitation characteristics evaluation indices verification rainfall process changes and extreme precipitation statistics through the analysis and evaluation of different run products precipitation process of lekima was studied and the effect of imerg products on typhoon precipitation monitoring was explored this study can provide a reference for monitoring typhoon heavy precipitation and recommend more suitable satellite precipitation products to researchers and users 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and typhoon process the study area fig 1 is located in the eastern coastal region of china along the route of lekima typhoon including zhejiang province jiangsu province shandong province and shanghai municipality city except for the mountainous and hilly terrain in zhejiang average elevation is 312 54 m the rest of the provinces and city are generally plain areas average elevation is between 4 59 and 91 07 m the study area has abundant precipitation with annual mean precipitation of 800 1400 mm meanwhile the study area is susceptible to typhoons in the summer especially in zhejiang where more than 40 typhoons landed in 1949 2019 typhoons and their heavy precipitation are harmful to regional economic development this study s period selected is from august 9th to 12th in beijing time utc 8 h typhoon lekima landed in zhejiang at 1 45 a m on august 10th beijing time with a maximum wind speed scale of 16 52 m s super typhoon then it moved northward along the land crossed zhejiang and jiangsu and into the yellow sea during this process the wind speed gradually decreased it landed again in shandong at 8 50p m on august 11th when the wind speed reached scale of 9 23 m s tropical storm after that the typhoon moved to the bohai sea and gradually weakened china meteorological administration stopped monitoring it on august 13th affected by the typhoon lekima the precipitation intensity and spatial coverage in the study area increased rapidly and many floods occurred the rainfall in zhejiang gradually increased on the 9th peaked on the 10th morning and gradually weakened on the 11th and 12th the rainfall in jiangsu and shanghai peaked on the 10th afternoon after that the rainfall peaked in shandong on the 11th morning and eventually decreased 2 2 imerg precipitation product imerg precipitation product is based on the gpm constellation of passive microwave sensors low earth orbit satellites and infrared sensors geostationary satellites fused with the high spatial and temporal precipitation observation data huffman et al 2000a 2020b imerg released the version v06 in 2019 compared with version v05 it had been optimized and adjusted in data processing algorithms and verification huffman et al 2020b with the addition of gpm microwave imager gmi and dual frequency precipitation radar dpr imerg has enhanced the detection ability to trace and solid precipitation thus improving the detection accuracy effectively skofronick jackson et al 2018 three imerg products are available for download https gpm nasa gov data access downloads gpm imerg er and imerg lr are quasi real time products with release latency of 4 and 12 hours respectively imerg fr is a late stage research product with a delay of 3 5 months the spatial resolution of imerg products is 0 1 and the temporal resolution is available in many options imerg er has four types in temporal resolution 30 min 3 h 1 d and 7d and imerg lr has five types 30 min 3 h 1 d 7d and 1 month the range in the temporal resolution of imerg fr is 30 min 1 d and 1 month imerg products cover all degrees of longitude and latitude 60 n 60 s imerg er only uses forward propagation and imerg lr adds backward propagation jiang and bauer gottwein 2019 the data used by imerg fr is more abundant and corrected by monthly precipitation analysis of the global precipitation climate center gpcc it can be seen that the processing and usage data from imerg er to imerg fr are enhanced continuously while the release time is also extending 2 3 rain gauge data the hourly rain gauges were selected as the observation data these data were derived from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn all observation data were subjected to strict quality control and had high accuracy and reliability which were suitable as the reference for the evaluation of satellite precipitation products chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 some gauges have missing records at certain times due to this study s short time 96 h the missing gauges were directly removed to avoid statistical errors and 253 gauges were reserved for studying analysis 3 methods 3 1 evaluation indices and imerg comparison in this study evaluation indices were used to evaluate imerg products performance mainly including three statistical indices and three categorical indices table 1 statistical indices verify the accuracy characteristics of satellite precipitation products 1 correlation coefficient cc quantify the linear correlation between imerg products and rain gauge data 2 root mean square error rmse represents the dispersion degree of the data set reflecting the overall error level of imerg products 3 relative bias rb the average error trend reflects the phenomenon that imerg products overestimate or underestimate precipitation categorical indices evaluate the ability of satellite precipitation products to identify precipitation events 1 probability of detection pod the ratio of precipitation detected by imerg products to observed precipitation 2 false alarm ratio far the fraction of events estimated by the imerg but not detected by the rain gauge 3 critical success index csi reflects the overall performance of imerg products by integrating the features of accurate prediction false prediction and missing precipitation events in the table p represents the imerg and g represents the rain gauge h is the frequency of accurate precipitation forecast f is the frequency of false precipitation report and m is the frequency of missed precipitation report based on error percent ep and agreement index ai the precipitation change process of three imerg products was analyzed ep is the error ratio of imerg relative to the rain gauge at each time ai measures the consistency between imerg and rain gauge gebregiorgis et al 2018 huang et al 2019 the closer ai is to 1 the better the consistency between imerg products and rain gauge data 1 ep g i p i g i 100 2 ai 1 g i p i 2 p i g g i g 2 where p is imerg product and g is the rain gauge in order to analyze the spatial difference between imerg products and rain gauge data when wind speed changes it is necessary to determine the typhoon rainband it is more reasonable to select the rain gauges in the principal rainband for subsequent analysis here the maximum wind speed radius is used as the typhoon rainband the maximum wind speed radius is related to wind speed and geographic latitude willoughby and rahn 2004 3 l 51 6 exp 0 0223 v fmax 0 0281 α where v fmax is the maximum wind speed and α is the latitude 3 2 evaluation process this study focuses on evaluating and comparing the differences of imerg products first during the typhoon imerg performance and characteristics in different regions were compared then according to the selected indices the evaluation results of imerg products in time space and precipitation intensity were further analyzed finally the spatial differences of imerg products and rain gauges during changes in wind speed were explored when the typhoon made landfall this difference was defined as the rain gauge s interpolation result minus the imerg precipitation totals the rainfall variation process and extreme precipitation characteristics during the typhoon were analyzed the precipitation level scheme used in the study comes from the china meteorological administration it is divided into six levels according to the cumulative precipitation within 24 hours light rain lr 0 1 9 9 mm moderate rain mr 10 24 9 mm heavy rain hr 25 49 9 mm rainstorm rs 50 99 9 mm heavy rainstorm hrs 100 249 9 mm extra heavy rainstorm ehrs greater than 250 mm it should be noted that the ground reference data and imerg products selected in this study are different in data type and temporal scale these differences need to be reduced through operation definition and preprocessing hu et al 2020 tang et al 2016 tong et al 2014 rain gauge data are discontinuous in space and interpolation processing often brings uncertainty katiraie boroujerdy et al 2017 in order to ensure the accuracy of the rain gauge data this study compared and evaluated imerg on the point scale when displaying the difference between precipitation level and wind speed scale the rain gauge results are interpolated to the grid with spatial resolution of 0 1 for intuitive comparison imerg products have been processed as hourly products and converted to beijing time for unified time presentation in this study 4 results 4 1 overall comparison of imerg products all imerg products showed similar precipitation change trends fig 2 prior to landfall august 9th the precipitation in the study area gradually increased the mean precipitation rate was greatest from 10 to 11th and began to subside on 12th the mean hourly precipitations of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were 0 85 mm 1 07 mm and 1 38 mm respectively with the change of release latency the precipitation of different imerg products gradually increases from the perspective of precipitation level the daily difference between imerg products and rain gauge data was evaluated fig 3 imerg products could display the process of precipitation migration changes along with typhoon movement compared with the rain gauge data however in terms of the proportion of extreme precipitation rs hrs ehrs imerg products were all lower than the result of rain gauges from imerg er to imerg fr this difference gradually decreased imerg er and imerg lr quasi real time precipitation products had the overall mean differences were 20 53 and 15 71 in predicting extreme precipitation with the further processing of the products the imerg fr released with 3 5 months latency reduced this error and the overall mean difference was 7 53 as shown in fig 4 a d each region s precipitation change is closely related to typhoon activity according to the cumulative precipitation results the differences between imerg products can be seen intuitively fig 4e h precipitation results of different imerg products gradually increased with the release latency imerg er and imerg lr were always lower than those of rain gauge observations imerg fr was significantly lower than the observed data in shandong and jiangsu the difference is 10 18 and 5 79 mm day respectively however imerg fr was higher than the observed data in zhejiang with a difference of 4 58 mm day and consistent with the observed one in shanghai imerg quasi real time precipitation products underestimated cumulative precipitation imerg fr products optimized the underestimate phenomenon but the performance was different in each region overall imerg fr with 3 5 months latency was closer to the rain gauge observations but the quasi real time precipitation products performed better on some dates for example the mean daily precipitation of imerg er was closer than imerg fr in shandong on the 9th and the mean daily precipitation of imerg lr was closer than imerg fr in zhejiang on the 10th table 2 the differences between imerg products were small below 0 84 mm day when the daily precipitation accumulation was light rain with the increase in daily precipitation imerg products showed noticeable step changes in precipitation value there is a rapid short term demand to obtain precipitation when monitoring typhoons and imerg lr is a good choice for the analysis of typhoon precipitation characteristics in quasi real time 4 2 analysis of evaluation indices the performance of imerg products was evaluated based on statistical and categorical indices table 3 the statistical significance of the linear correlation between imerg products and rain gauge data had been tested and the p value was 0 01 which was statistically significant there were some slight differences between these products on cc and rmse rb showed that imerg er and imerg fr underestimate precipitation which is consistent with the previous conclusion for this typhoon event the pod of all imerg products was higher than 0 8 the far was lower than 0 3 and the mean csi was 0 65 showing good performance as shown in fig 5 the cc of imerg products was concentrated in the range of 0 5 0 7 at the threshold above 0 7 imerg lr and imerg fr had 60 and 57 counts far higher than 36 counts of imerg er the distribution of cc had no apparent regional aggregation the rmse was mainly within the range of 2 4 mm accounting for 48 62 moreover the gauges with rmse greater than 4 mm were mainly found in eastern zhejiang and central shandong the rb of imerg er and imerg lr was generally below 0 mm for 88 93 and 79 84 of the gauges indicating precipitation underestimation imerg fr was higher in counts with rb above 0 mm than that of the other two products the improvement of imerg lr was the best because from imerg er to imerg lr cc had great improvement while imerg lr to imerg fr had slight improvement the error distributions of rmse were similar for these products in the range of rb 0 5 0 5 mm the counts of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were 138 176 and 190 respectively we set different precipitation thresholds for categorical indices and observed their characteristics fig 6 with an increase in the threshold pod decreased while far increased gradually when the threshold increased to 5 mm hour csi stabilized at 0 3 it can be seen that imerg fails to show good performance in detection for high intensity precipitation judging by the categorical indices results three imerg products were roughly at the same performance level imerg fr probability of detection performed slightly better and the false alarm ratio of imerg lr was the best one of the three products it should be noted that the result in fig 6 is only based on the small sample size of this typhoon event and there is a potential problem of low robustness the correlation between imerg and rain gauge data was analyzed fig 7 the line fits are all below the y x line indicating that all three imerg products on average underestimate the gauge observed precipitation in all days from imerg er to imerg fr the slope increased obviously reflecting the gradual optimization of fitting degree the 10th was the date with the highest precipitation and intensity in the study area the intercept on this day was significantly higher than other dates with the expansion of gauge precipitation range on the horizontal coordinate in fig 7 12th 9th 11th 10th the intercepts showed an increasing trend in table 4 the result of daily evaluation indices during the study period was listed the statistical significance of correlation of imerg lr august 10th imerg er august 12th and imerg fr august 12th was between 0 01 and 0 05 level moreover the statistical significance of correlation of the remaining data was at the 0 01 level it can be seen that the daily cc of imerg lr and imerg fr was better than that of imerg er imerg lr even performed better than imerg fr on some dates in cc the rmse of three imerg products were actually on the same level and the imerg lr had a lower daily rmse and performed relatively best as the overall evaluation mentioned above the rb of imerg fr was the best with the lowest deviation however the rb results in table 4 showed that the actual rb of imerg products with shorter release latency was low it can be seen that the positive and negative rb results on different dates in the overall evaluation offset this imperceptible error imerg fr had the best pod compared with other imerg products but the far performed poorly the performance of imerg lr was close to imerg fr although imerg fr has higher latency and more processing in this typhoon event we found that imerg fr had very little advantage over imerg lr in precipitation performance despite the increased latency 4 3 imerg precipitation inspection during lekima land movement during the typhoon lekima land movement the rain gauges precipitation interpolation fig 8 a b and precipitation difference between imerg and rain gauge data fig 8e p when the wind speed scale changed was calculated after the typhoon landed at 03 h and 05 h on the 10th the wind speed changed from scale 16 to 15 and then to 12 precipitation at these moments was mainly in zhejiang as well as nearby shanghai and southern jiangsu imerg er showed an underestimation of precipitation the difference is positive accounting for 85 04 of gauges and the mean underestimation was 1 51 mm hour imerg lr overestimated precipitation in the northern region from the typhoon 2 57 mm hour while imerg fr overestimated precipitation in the central region of the typhoon 4 69 mm hour at 09 h on the 10th the wind speed changed from scale 12 to 11 at this moment the typhoon center was still located in zhejiang it can be seen that the precipitation difference around the typhoon center was complex in jiangsu and northern areas the imerg products were closer to the rain gauge observations and imerg lr and imerg fr performed relatively well at 20 h on the 10th the typhoon moved to the boundary between zhejiang and jiangsu and the wind speed changed from scale 11 to 9 the rain gauge result showed strong precipitation clusters in the northern part of the typhoon center the tendency of these clusters to underestimate precipitation was clear within the typhoon rainband imerg products overestimated precipitation at 03 h table 5 after that imerg er underestimated precipitation in the next three wind speed changes ranging from 1 55 to 2 66 mm hour imerg lr underestimated precipitation at 05 h and 20 h and overestimated precipitation at 09 h imerg fr underestimated precipitation at 20 h and overestimated precipitation at 05 h and 09 h moreover from imerg er to imerg fr there is a tendency to overestimate precipitation when typhoon wind speed changes gradually the indices of extreme precipitation during the typhoon including maximum hourly precipitation the hourly precipitation at the top 1 and 5 for comparison the overall mean precipitation was introduced were summarized as shown in table 6 the order of the maximum hourly precipitation was imerg lr imerg er rain gauge imerg fr rain gauge data had the largest value in the mean hourly precipitation at the top 1 and 5 in terms of high intensity precipitation there was always a difference between imerg products and observed precipitation the shorter the imerg release latency the larger the error combined with the indices result shown in fig 6 the performance of imerg products was not ideal under the high intensity precipitation based on ep and ai the precipitation change process of imerg products was analyzed fig 9 counts on the x axis of fig 9 indicate the number of comparisons and counts greater than 10 mm hour were counted here in the whole study period the error rate over 87 times was above 0 which represented that the imerg precipitation was lower than rain gauge observations the ep change trend of imerg fr was always lower than other imerg products showing relatively good performance imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr had 38 36 38 85 and 40 29 respectively when the agreement degree with the rain gauges was equal to 0 about half of the time imerg products consistency exceeded 0 5 indicating the consistency is good 5 discussions 5 1 the influence of rain gauge density and data overlap the rain gauges used in the study are evenly distributed in space furthermore most of the study area is in the plains 88 93 of the gauges below 100 m the impact of topography is not obvious however the density characteristics of rain gauge distribution will affect the statistical result tian et al 2017 counted the rain gauge density used in previous studies on satellite precipitation products and we made a comparison here the rain gauge density in this study was 0 067 site 100 km2 ranking sixteenth among thirty five previous studies the rain gauge density provided in this study was far from high density greater than 1 5 site 100 km2 high density gauge networks tend to provide better evaluation indices results and low density gauge networks may underestimate the performance of satellite rainfall products tang et al 2018 tian et al 2017 imerg fr combined with gpcc data to obtain monthly climatological adjustment thus these corrected sites have a data overlap effect on imerg fr gpcc does not provide these adjusted sites directly but releases a grid site number at 1 spatial resolution worldwide the percent between the number of gpcc sites and the rain gauges used in each grid was calculated fig 10 in some marginal areas the proportion reached 100 in other areas especially under the typhoon movement path the percent was between 10 and 40 it can be seen that most rain gauges used in this study were independent of gpcc the data overlap phenomenon exists but had a low impact on this study through the process of rain gauge adjustment the performance of the imerg fr product should be improved however according to the result presented in this study the quasi real time product imerg lr showed performance close to that of imerg fr the cc and csi were equal to each other in the typhoon event and the rmse difference is only 0 15 mm at certain moments imerg lr has performed even better on august 9th the cc and csi of imerg lr were 0 04 and 0 02 higher than that of imerg fr and the rmse difference was 0 23 mm besides the release delay of imerg lr 4 hours is much lower than imerg fr 3 5 months which is more suitable for quasi real time monitoring and analysis of typhoon precipitation 5 2 correction test for imerg products the difference characteristics of imerg precipitation in observation thresholds of the rain gauge data were further analyzed and the correction scheme was tested to improve the accuracy the difference between the imerg products and the rain gauge data is significantly correlated with the typhoon movement taking imerg lr as an example there were obvious differences on august 10th zhejiang and the amplitude range was 2 2 mm hour after the typhoon left zhejiang on the 11th and 12th the difference was reduced to 0 05 mm hour similarly when the typhoon landed in shandong on the 11th the mean daily difference was 47 04 mm and the difference range of other dates was only 1 44 17 04 mm fig 11 shows the hourly difference between imerg and rain gauge data within the threshold of 0 8 mm hour in four regions of the study area imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were 81 86 68 45 and 58 18 of scatter points above zero value which verified that imerg products underestimate precipitation a rule for imerg er and imerg lr was that the mean difference keeps increasing overall with hourly rain gauge precipitation the mean difference of imerg fr was around 0 mm hour showing good performance when the rain gauge precipitation was higher than 5 mm hour the difference rose sharply the difference ranges of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were 0 06 3 52 mm hour 0 05 1 98 mm hour and 0 01 1 06 mm hour respectively when trying to correct imerg products we found that the error of imerg er and imerg lr increased in the threshold of 0 1 mm hour as shown in fig 11 the difference is actually small in this threshold therefore a segmented scheme was adopted and the original values of imerg er and imerg lr were maintained in this threshold and the correction formulas were adopted for other thresholds for imerg fr the segmentation threshold is 5 mm hour we used the data on august 9th and 10th to build the correction model then evaluated the corrected imerg on august 11th and 12th after correction the mean differences of imerg er and imerg lr decreased from 0 86 and 0 64 mm hour to 0 41 and 0 27 mm hour and the correction effect was more significant for the range 2 4 mm hour the mean difference in imerg fr decreased from 0 32 to 0 19 mm hour therefore we propose this scheme to monitor typhoon short duration heavy precipitation based on the quasi real time imerg products establish the correction model through empirical methods 5 3 limitation and prospect this study evaluated the performance of imerg products during typhoon lekima and got preliminary results however it should be noted that the study was only based on extreme precipitation from a single typhoon and the observation time and data were limited although 253 rain gauges were provided the evaluation indices were obtained based on small sample size resulting in unreliable results such as the indices jumped at 20 mm hour in fig 6 in the precipitation analysis of imerg at the moment of wind speed changes the factors causing regional deviation may come from the different contributions of sensors at different observation times the evaluation in this study is a point based comparison for the case of multiple rain gauges in one imerg grid the observation errors of point each rain gauge is evaluated separately and area the rain gauges in the grid are averaged and then evaluated will be affected we compared the two schemes and believed that the error was small in this study the average errors of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr are 0 40 0 93 and 0 91 we want to emphasize the potential uncertainty caused by the evaluation of a single typhoon event this indicates that it is necessary to collect more typhoon heavy rainfall events for further study it is of great significance to quantify compare and summarize the performance of imerg products in typhoon events 6 conclusions it is challenging to forecast the short duration heavy precipitation caused by typhoon events in this study we selected the typhoon lekima in 2019 as an example and the hourly and daily precipitation performance of imerg er imerg lr and imerg fr were evaluated based on rain gauge data comparing different latency satellite precipitation products can provide application advice and recommend suitable products for users in monitoring the typhoon heavy precipitation process it should be noted that the following conclusions are based on the single typhoon event in this study and may not be representative of all typhoons 1 from the perspective of rainfall change and precipitation level the difference characteristics of three imerg products were analyzed with the release latency the precipitation of different imerg products gradually increases the quasi real time products imerg er and imerg lr have large errors for extreme precipitation imerg fr optimizes this error and is closer to the rain gauge observation 2 based on evaluation indices imerg products tend to underestimate precipitation and fail to perform well for high intensity precipitation comparing the spatial difference between imerg products and rain gauges when typhoon wind speed changes imerg lr and imerg fr perform relatively well there is a significant positive correlation between the observation error of imerg products and precipitation intensity during the typhoon 3 the overall performance of imerg lr is close to that of imerg fr although imerg fr has higher latency and more processing considering the typhoon time response and product performance accuracy imerg lr is suitable for the analysis of typhoon precipitation the accuracy of regional

4639,many coastal cities face growing flood risks due to interactions of multiple triggers related to the changing climate such as intense rainstorms rising sea level severe storm surges etc the complex urban morphology and infrastructural systems have profound effects on flow routing and need to be properly considered in flood modelling in particular the underground drainage system is a key element of urban drainage but its fine scale modelling is still an open challenge this paper aims to evaluate flood hazards in coastal cities upon combined high tide storm surge and intense rainfall by incorporating the compound weather conditions into a grid based flood analysis model an equivalent drainage method is proposed to improve the efficiency of large scale urban drainage modelling which simulates the capacity of drainage networks by enhanced infiltration the equivalent method is calibrated with a physically based drainage model considering varying rainfall intensities and sea levels the flood hazards in two coastal cities shenzhen and hong kong in the pearl river delta of south china are evaluated results show that in the combination of low intensity rainfall and high sea level stormwater is difficult to drain into the sea and significant backflows into the drainage outfalls can occur the inland inundation caused by rainfall can be amplified by high sea levels due to the reduction of drainage efficiency moreover flood hazards both along the coastline and in the inland areas can be exacerbated due to sea level rise and ground subsidence the equivalent drainage method shows a good performance and provides an easy alternative in large scale urban flood modelling the predicted hazard scenarios under various combinations of weather conditions provide essential information for re examining urban drainage designs and developing new flood prevention strategies keywords flood hazard flood modelling rainstorm storm surge stormwater drainage guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area 1 introduction many metropolitan areas face worsening flood hazards due to climate change e g ma et al 2018 the water cycle in urban areas is different from that in rural areas due to the altered landscape surface roughness and flow routing particularly engineering stormwater drainage systems provide an important means of urban drainage researchers have attempted to construct numerical models to simulate surface flow sewer flow and coupled flows in urban areas various models have been proposed for modelling the hydrological and hydraulic responses of the urban drainage system for design and analysis purposes such as the storm water management model swmm rossman et al 2005 infoworks wallingford software 2010 and mouse danish hydraulic institute 1999 two dimensional overland flow models have been coupled with one dimensional sewer flow models to consider bi directionally flow exchange between the land surface and drainage networks hsu et al 2000 seyoum et al 2011 chang et al 2015 leandro and martins 2016 sañudo et al 2020 these models differ in terms of complexity of governing equations of the overland flow model coupling methods and treatment of stormwater transfer etc however the direct modelling of urban drainage systems often requires a large amount of information and a great effort to set up the model attempt has been made to consider the underground drainage capacity indirectly by subtracting the water volume drained by a pipe system from the run off chen et al 2009b yu and coulthard 2015 yin et al 2016 or increasing the infiltration rate chen et al 2009a wang et al 2018 these indirect methods often estimate the drainage rates according to the design capacity of the drainage network ignoring variations of drainage efficiency with weather conditions such as rainfall intensity and downstream boundaries of outfalls conventional flood hazard analysis tends to focus on the impact of intense rainfall however flood scenarios can become more severe in a coastal environment under compound weather conditions high tide storm surge and intense rainfall can coincide during a synoptic scale meteorological event which will increase the flood risk in coastal cities such as shenzhen and hong kong in the pearl river delta prd of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area for example typhoon hato made landfall in prd on august 23 2017 causing severe storm surges and heavy rainfall a maximum storm surge of 2 79 m and a maximum sea level of 6 14 m were recorded at zhuhai station hko 2020a hong kong macao and zhuhai were severely affected by the combination of high sea level heavy rainfall and surface runoff takagi et al 2018 islam and takagi 2020 the correlation between multiple flooding triggers should be considered to evaluate the probability of compound flooding these kinds of correlations can be considered based on estimation of the joint probability function hawkes 2008 mazas and hamm 2017 sadegh et al 2018 or based on continuous simulations sopelana et al 2018 the correlation between rainfall and storm surge variables has been investigated previously zheng et al 2013 2014 xu et al 2014 and the estimated joint probability is used to define boundary conditions for a hydraulic model to evaluate the flood conditions of rivers and floodplains lian et al 2013 zellou and rahali 2019 however little attention has been paid to possible hazard scenarios in urban settings under the combined effect of tide storm surge and rainfall where the efficiency of drainage network could be significantly affected by rainfall intensity and sea level the flood risk in coastal cities like shenzhen and hong kong increases over time the frequent extreme weather events in the changing climate may be a major driver that accelerates this trend sea level rise is almost certain in many areas including the south china sea zhang and fang 2015 tang et al 2009 moreover according to ipcc 2013 both the frequency of intense tropical cyclones tc and the intensity of precipitation brought by landfalling tcs are likely to increase in east asia apart from the changing climate ground subsidence of newly reclaimed land is another factor that aggravates flood hazards in coastal cities such as singapore leung et al 2019 shenzhen zhao et al 2011 xu et al 2016 and hong kong sun et al 2018 therefore extreme flood hazards that did not appear in the past are expected in the future the primary objective of this paper is to evaluate flood hazards in coastal metropolitan areas upon combined high tide storm surge and rainfall the compound weather conditions are incorporated into a grid based urban flood analysis model to investigate the severity of flood hazards the performance of complex urban drainage systems in compound scenarios of the three variables is examined in particular an equivalent drainage method is proposed to extend the feasibility of urban drainage modelling for cases without adequate drainage structure information and to improve the efficiency of modelling large systems in view of the growing flood risk in the future extreme values of the three variables are considered in the flood analysis in this paper the urban flood analysis model including the equivalent drainage method is described in section 2 in sections 3 and 4 the flood hazards as well as the performance of drainage networks under the joint influence of tide storm surge and rainfall are investigated in the qianhai area shenzhen and the kowloon peninsula hong kong 2 urban flood analysis in coastal cities to model coastal metropolitan flooding upon combined rainfall high tide and storm surge a flow routing model flo 2d is adopted for overland flow simulation with the three flooding triggers properly considered the stormwater drainage system liable to affect the flooding process is modelled either with a physical based model swmm coupled with flo 2d or an equivalent drainage method proposed in this paper for different scopes of application 2 1 flood analysis in combined rainfall high tide storm surge events a grid based flow routing model flo 2d flo 2d 2018 is used for flood analysis in coastal metropolitan areas as shown in fig 1 tide storm surge and rainfall are incorporated into the model to evaluate the flood hazards in compound weather conditions the hydrological processes of stormwater simulated in the model include vegetation interception infiltration overland flow and flow in drainage pipes flow interactions at coastal boundaries as well as at underground drainage outfalls are also simulated the rainfall process is described with a hyetograph and can be regarded as uniform in space for a relatively small study scale for a large scale model spatial temporal varying rainfall input can be used e g qiang et al 2020 serinaldi 2009 the interception of stormwater by vegetation is considered with an initial abstraction after some interception the stormwater will infiltrate into the soil flow to other cells or into the drainage inlets the infiltration process is calculated using the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 as 1 f k s h f h 0 z f where f is the infiltration rate ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity hf and h0 are the hydraulic heads at the wetting front and at the surface respectively zf is the depth of wetting front the overland flow process is calculated in eight directions i e four compass directions and four diagonal directions the depth averaged flow velocity is calculated for each direction independently with the one dimensional shallow water equations 2 h t hv x i f q 3 s f s 0 h x v g v x 1 g v t where h is the flow depth t is time v is the depth averaged flow velocity along x direction i is the rainfall intensity q is the ratio of volume flow rate into drainage inlets to the area of the cell containing the inlets sf is the frictional slope s0 is the bed slope and g is the gravitational acceleration the shallow water equations are solved with a central finite difference numerical method an explicit scheme is adopted to solve the momentum equation to obtain the flow velocity across the cell boundary the discharges across the boundary are computed by multiplying the velocity by the flow area for the eight flow directions and the cell flow depth is updated with the continuity equation to capture the effect of artificial surface obstacles on the surface flow the area reduction factor arf and the width reduction factor wrf are adopted for the cells containing buildings to consider the reduction in water storage and flow width for a certain direction due to building blockage o brien et al 1993 for each cell arf is calculated as the ratio of the occupied area of buildings to the area of the cell there are eight wrfs along the eight flow directions for each cell a cell is divided into nine equivalent sub cells and the wrf along a flow direction is calculated as the ratio of the occupied area of buildings to the area of the sub cell along the flow direction for regions with adequate stormwater drainage system data the drainage system is directly modelled with a physically based model swmm developed by the us environmental protection agency rossman et al 2005 the swmm model is integrated with flo 2d on a computational time step basis bi directional flow exchanges between the ground surface and the drainage system are allowed the flow exchange is calculated by comparing the pressure head at the nodes of the drainage inlet and the surface water elevations of the cells containing the inlets the inflow discharge at the storm drain inlets is calculated using weir and orifice equations based on the geometry of the inlets technical details can be found in flo 2d 2018 many drainage outfalls are located along the coastline or tidal rivers so the efficiency of drainage network can be affected by variations of the downstream water levels in this study the variation of drainage efficiency with sea level is characterised by a tidal boundary condition for outfalls with the water head calculated from the sea level time histories the hydrological process in coastal cities can also be influenced by abnormally high sea levels caused by cyclones seawater intrusion caused by high sea level and wave overtopping is likely to happen in low lying areas a temporally varying stage boundary is adopted for the cells along the coastline which allows seawater to flow to the land areas when the sea level is higher than the water head in the coastal cells and to flow back to the sea when the sea level declines the variation process of sea level can be obtained from nearby tide gauges for a short coastline the sea level can be regarded spatially uniform the overtopping volume of waves is not considered in this paper which may underestimate the intrusion volume slightly 2 2 equivalent drainage method in spite of the availability of various sewer flow models building a physically based underground drainage model for urban flood analysis is challenging due to two issues first a large amount of data is needed to set up the drainage pipelines in models like swmm such as location diameter shape and slope of each pipe which is unavailable in many cases second the grid resolution should be fine enough to capture the densely distributed drainage pipelines the design spacing of road drainage gullies is typically 25 m to 50 m in china gb 50014 2006 2016 for a large scale system much effort and large computation costs are required to use physically based models which may not always be justifiable in previous simplified modelling of drainage networks the drainage rate to the urban drainage infrastructure is often regarded constant and estimated based on the local design drainage capacity however the drainage rate is not necessarily constant in different weather conditions when the rainfall intensity exceeds the capacity of the drainage system stormwater cannot be timely drained and ponding can happen furthermore the reduction in drainage efficiency due to the variation of outfall boundaries should also be considered to improve the feasibility of drainage network modelling an equivalent drainage method is proposed to simulate the drainage capacity by enhanced infiltration and to replace the physical based drainage model that is coupled with flo 2d an infiltration adjustment factor k is adopted to modify the hydraulic conductivity of the urban artificial surface the value of k is calibrated using a flood model with a physically based drainage network flo 2d coupled with swmm for an area with a similar drainage design standard or for a small representative part of the study area the following assumptions are made in the equivalent drainage method 1 the drainage process through the pipelines is replaced by an enhanced infiltration process the value of the infiltration adjustment factor k is related to the input rainfall intensity and sea level boundaries and is constant throughout the simulation process 2 the distributed drainage capacity is assumed spatially uniform in the study urban areas 3 the drainage capacity of the study area is regarded the same as that of the calibration area where sufficient data on the drainage network is available for setting up a physically based drainage model the hydraulic conductivity of the urban area is set as the product of the adjustment factor k and the hydraulic conductivity of the vegetated land given a weather scenario of rainfall intensity and sea level the adjustment factor is determined by minimizing the average relative difference between the simulated maximum flow depths mfd from the models with a physically based drainage and assuming equivalent drainage 4 k arg min 1 n i 1 n d e i k d i d i where de i and di are the mfd of the ith cell calculated by the equivalent drainage model and the physically based drainage model respectively and n is the number of cells the variation of k with rainfall intensity and sea level can be determined through simulations under various combinations of rainfall intensity and sea level corresponding to different return periods 3 flood analysis in the greater bay area 3 1 study areas shenzhen is located on the east side of the pearl river estuary fig 2 a and is one of the most developed cities in china this densely populated city is one of the coastal cities most vulnerable to flood risk in the world hallegatte et al 2013 the city is dominated by a humid subtropical monsoon climate tcs make landfalls in prd frequently from june to october the average annual rainfall amount 1981 2010 of shenzhen is 1935 8 mm 86 of which concentrates in the rainy season from april to september the qianhai area fig 2b including the qianhai cooperation zone bao an centre and bao an international airport is a new littoral development zone at the southwest corner of shenzhen with a land area of 117 km2 the qianhai area has a large portion of newly reclaimed land the reclamation began in the 1980s and by the mid 2010s the topography of this area had been markedly changed the evolution of land reclamations in the qianhai area since 1979 is shown in fig 3 large uncertainties in flood risk are also associated with subsidence of newly reclaimed lands and the changing climate moreover public data on the stormwater drainage networks in shenzhen is limited hence the flood hazards in the qianhai area upon compound scenarios of tide storm surge and rainfall will be investigated using the equivalent drainage method the 47 km2 kowloon peninsula fig 2c in hong kong which is only approximately 40 km away from the qianhai area is chosen to be the calibration area for the equivalent drainage method hong kong is another major coastal city in prd fig 2a the meteorological conditions of hong kong are similar to shenzhen and the average annual rainfall amount 1981 2010 in hong kong is 2398 5 mm the hong kong sar government has made the information on the urban drainage system public therefore a physically based drainage model is constructed for the kowloon peninsula with the data available and the kowloon model is subsequently used to investigate the performance of the drainage network and to calibrate the equivalent drainage model for the qianhai area 3 2 compound scenarios of tide storm surge and rainfall the flood hazard analyses are carried out upon synthetic combinations of tide storm surge and rainfall with their magnitudes estimated according to historical records frequency analysis is carried out separately for each flooding trigger with local data and the frequency curves are extrapolated to extreme cases the annual maximum series of the rolling 12 hour rainfall amount recorded at lau fau shan station fig 2a from 1985 to 2018 and the maximum storm surge level during each tc recorded at tsim bei tsui station fig 2a from 1980 to 2019 are used fig 4 a the generalised extreme value gev distribution is used to fit the annual series fig 4b the return periods for each single variable are calculated based on the fitted gev distributions as shown in table 1 there is a positive correlation between the two variables according to the analysis on historical data the correlation should be considered when estimating the joint probability of the two variables and the return periods of the compound events which are not involved in this paper the astronomical tides in shenzhen are mixed and primarily semi diurnal and can be derived from harmonic constituents the distribution of the high tide is close to the normal distribution it is likely that the peaks of storm surge meet high tides so the mean high tide level which is 2 41 m above the chart datum as recorded at tsim bei tsui station from 1994 to 2018 is assumed to coincide with the peak of storm surge to ensure that the tide component is of sufficient magnitude for flood analysis in a future scenario synthetic temporal patterns are needed because the realistic temporal patterns of rainfall and storm surge are complex and hardly known for simplicity the processes of rainfall and storm surge are assumed to be triangular and symmetrical fig 5 with the total rainfall amount and the peak surge level determined according to their return periods regarding astronomical tides a typical tide curve with the high tide to be 2 41 m is used the sea level boundaries are obtained by adding the astronomical tide and the storm surge of certain return periods the 12 hour processes of the combined rainfall and sea level are used as inputs for flood hazard analysis and regarded as spatially uniform 3 3 performance of the drainage network in compound weather events the performance of the stormwater drainage network in the compound scenarios of tide storm surge and rainfall are investigated with a flood model built for the kowloon peninsula with a physically based drainage network fig 2c established based on data from the geoinfo map 2020 the grid cell size of the kowloon model is 30 30 m with 57 741 cells in total the elevation of each grid cell is acquired from the digital terrain model of hong kong available at data gov hk building shapes are identified from satellite images fig 2c and then arfs and wrfs are automatically computed according to the intersection of building shapes and grid cells two land cover types are considered in the model the vegetated land is shown in fig 2c and the rest of the area is identified as urban area the infiltration parameters initial abstraction of rainfall and the manning s coefficient shown in table 2 are determined according to land cover type referring to flo 2d 2018 and lumb 1965 and have been calibrated in the work of he et al 2020 to verify the kowloon model a rainstorm on 7 june 2008 shown in fig 6 a recorded at rainfall station k09 fig 2c is used as the model input the mfd simulated by the model and the observed flood spots reported by the drainage services department of the hong kong sar government are shown in fig 6b the consistency of the spatial distribution of flood spots and the simulated flood extent indicates the satisfactory performance of the flood model the invert elevations of the drainage outfalls range from 1 17 m to 1 88 m referring to the chart datum to investigate the possible effect of high sea level on the efficiency of drainage facilities and flood severity it is assumed that there were no tidal control structures at the outfalls within the study area it should be noted that such structures as tidal gates and non return flap valves have been gradually installed especially after the super typhoon hato in 2017 table 3 summarises the flow volumes under four scenarios indicating excellent mass balance the floodplain inflow and outflow are the volumes exchanged at the boundary cells water depths are added to the boundary cells and the floodplain inflow increases when the sea level is higher than the elevations of the coastal cells the seawater does not necessarily flow inland if the elevations of the adjacent cells are higher the volume of floodplain inflow is large because some shoreline cells at low elevations are included in the analysis area so is the floodplain outflow volume the drainage network plays a significant role in the flow exchange the net outflow discharges through the outfalls in the two cases of the 50 year storm surge account for 40 7 and 41 5 of the rainfall volumes for the 50 year rainfall and the 2000 year rainfall cases respectively however when relatively low intensity rainfall coincides with a high sea level e g 50 year rain and 2000 year storm surge the volume of inflow through the outfalls i e backflow of seawater into the outfalls is comparable to that of the outflow through the outfalls which means the stormwater can hardly drain into the sea the volumes of outflow through the outfalls are dominated by the rainfall intensity and are much larger in the two scenarios of the 2000 year rainfall while the volumes of inflow through the outfalls are positively correlated to the sea level and negatively correlated to the rainfall intensity fig 7 shows the outflow discharges at two outfalls under four scenarios where a negative discharge indicates the backflow of seawater the locations of the two outfalls are shown in fig 2c the invert elevations of outfalls o1 and o2 are 1 17 m and 0 30 m referring to the chart datum respectively there are remarkable negative discharges at both o1 and o2 in the two scenarios of the 2000 year storm surge and the time of peak negative discharge is generally consistent with the time of peak sea level the positive discharges in the 2000 year rainfall cases are much larger than those in the 50 year rainfall cases for the same sea level boundary for both outfalls which is consistent with the flow volumes it is clear that the performance of the drainage network heavily depends on the rainfall intensity and the peak sea level of the synthetic 12 hour process 3 4 calibration of the equivalent drainage model shenzhen and hong kong are neighbouring cities with similar climate characteristics and urban drainage system design therefore the flood analysis model for the kowloon peninsula is used to calibrate the equivalent drainage model for the qianhai area considering the complexity of drainage infrastructures in hong kong and shenzhen only the major drainage pipelines are included in the physical drainage model for kowloon and the strategic stormwater storage and interception facilities in kowloon such as lai chi kok drainage tunnel and tai hang tung storage tank are not included to estimate the infiltration adjustment factor k under different combinations of rainfall intensity and sea level boundaries both the models with physical drainage facilities and using the equivalent drainage method are applied to the kowloon peninsula the optimal k is determined through a trial and error method considering the combinations of four rolling 12 hour rainfall amounts with return periods of 50 200 1000 2000 years and four storm surge levels with return periods of 50 200 1000 2000 years a series of discrete values of k ranging from 0 to 5 at an interval of 0 25 is adopted to minimise the average relative difference of mfd and the optimal value of k is chosen for each combination with the optimal values of k for the 16 scenarios a quadratic polynomial is fitted as shown in fig 8 with the coefficient of determination r2 to be 0 99 so that the infiltration adjustment factor for any other combinations in the range can be estimated as 5 k a 0 a 1 s a 2 r a 3 s 2 a 4 r 2 a 5 s r where s is the peak storm surge level m r is the maximum rolling 12 hour rainfall amount mm and a 0 a 1 a 5 2 05 1 95 5 9 10 3 4 44 10 1 1 03 10 6 3 03 10 4 within the range of return periods from 50 years to 2000 years a clear negative correlation with sea level and a positive correlation with rainfall intensity close to linear in this range are observed for the fitted adjustment factor the increase rate of k declines with the decrease of storm surge level which implies that low level storm surges have less impact on the drainage efficiency to check how realistic the equivalent drainage method is the simulated mfd in kowloon upon the synthetic processes of combined rainfall and sea level from the physically based and equivalent drainage models are compared fig 9 compares the flood maps for compounding 1000 year rainfall and 1000 year storm surge the flood extents from the two models are consistent and the differences in mfd are rather small consistent results are also obtained for other compound scenarios of rainfall and sea level therefore the drainage system efficiency is well reflected in the equivalent drainage method 4 flood hazard scenarios 4 1 flood hazards in the qianhai area in compound weather events a flood analysis model with the drainage network simulated using the equivalent drainage method is established to evaluate flood hazards in the qianhai area the grid cell size is 20 20 m with 292 469 cells in total the elevation data is acquired from remote sensing technology centre of japan the distributions of buildings and land cover types are shown in fig 2b enhanced infiltration in the urban area is used to represent the drainage network the model parameters are shown in table 2 referring to the design return periods of the urban drainage trunk system 200 years and the branch system 50 years dsd 2018 nine compound scenarios of rainfall and storm surge with return periods of 50 years 500 years and 2000 years are investigated to demonstrate the influence of seawater intrusion scenarios only with storm surges without rainfall are also investigated the flood hazard maps are shown in fig 10 and the calculated areas of inundation are shown in fig 11 the 50 year return period events are regarded as serious but quite likely when both the rainfall and the storm surge are of the 50 year return level there will be only a few inland places inundated mainly along low lying roads and river banks the mfd of most areas are lower than 0 5 m indicating that the coincidence of the 50 year rainfall and storm surge can generally be coped with for the scenarios of a relatively low storm surge 50 year return period seawater intrusion hardly occurs along the reclaimed sea shore and the severity of flood hazards is dominated by rainfall intensity in the 500 year storm surge scenarios the second runway fig 3 of the bao an airport constructed between 2000 and 2010 on the reclaimed land will be inundated due to seawater intrusion and in the 2000 year storm surge scenarios both the first and the second runways fig 3 will be inundated by seawater it is worth noting that the severity of inland flood hazard that is not directly caused by seawater intrusion can also be affected by sea level boundaries for example in the three cases of the 500 year rainfall the flood extents in areas excluding the airport region increase by 11 7 and 33 2 for the 500 year and the 2000 year storm surge scenarios respectively compared to that in the 50 year storm surge case moreover the simulated inundation areas of different water depths in the scenario of 500 year rainfall and 500 year storm surge are very similar to the scenario of 2000 year rainfall and 50 year storm surge fig 11 hence the co occurrence of extreme high sea levels could amplify the effect of rainfall by reducing the drainage efficiency when extreme rainfall and extreme storm surges occur simultaneously i e the 2000 year rain and 2000 year storm surge the flood hazard will be extremely severe with the mfd exceeding 1 m in many blocks as shown in fig 11 the proportion of area with large water depths grows with rainfall intensity and storm surge levels the percentage of area with water depths between 1 m and 2 m increases notably from 11 for the scenario of 50 year rainfall and storm surge to 28 for the scenario of 2000 year rainfall and storm surge 4 2 extreme flood hazards in reclaimed land considering sea level rise the flood risk in the qianhai area is likely to evolve over time sea level rise can aggravate the flood risk in low lying areas of coastal cities under climate change in the study area the mean sea level rose at a rate of 31 mm per decade during 1954 2019 hko 2020b in addition to sea level rise ground subsidence in reclamation areas due to soil consolidation under the action of gravity and loads from superstructures is another factor that could exacerbate the flood risk according to the coastal subsidence monitoring in shenzhen conducted by xu et al 2016 the settlement rates of target points located in the reclaimed land of the qianhai area were 10 to 25 mm year from 2007 to 2011 and remarkable ground deformation was still observed in bao an centre about 20 years after the reclamation previous investigations based on the consolidation theory show that the post construction subsidence in bao an centre could be larger than 1 m lu and huang 2017 to investigate possible future flood hazard scenarios in the qianhai area more extreme sea level boundaries are considered assuming the sea level rises 0 5 m and 1 m above that of the 2000 year storm surge scenario simulations are conducted for the scenarios with only sea level rises and the scenarios of 2000 year rainfall along with rising sea levels fig 12 shows the extents of inundation caused by seawater intrusion under the rising sea levels and the increase of mfd due to the rising sea levels compared to those in the 2000 year rainfall and 2000 year storm surge scenario the water depths in some inland areas including bao an centre are shown to increase due to further reduction of drainage efficiency the inundation in the airport area will become more extensive in both cases i e 0 5 m and 1 m sea level rise the flood extents caused by seawater intrusion may increase by 5 39 km2 and 12 92 km2 respectively when the sea level rises 0 5 m and 1 m above that of the current 2000 year storm surge scenario in such extreme cases measures for preventing seawater intrusion such as floodwalls should be taken in low lying areas along the shoreline especially in the airport area furthermore tide gates or other backflow prevention devices can be considered to improve the performance of the urban drainage network in case of high sea level boundaries 5 conclusions combined tide storm surge and rainfall are incorporated into a grid based urban flood analysis model to investigate possible metropolitan flooding scenarios under the joint effects of the above three unfavourable weather conditions the performance of the underground stormwater drainage system is evaluated in particular the major conclusions are as follows 1 an equivalent drainage method is proposed to model a complex stormwater drainage network indirectly via enhanced infiltration an infiltration adjustment factor is adopted to quantify the drainage efficiency and calibrated by a physically based drainage model the infiltration adjustment factor is found positively correlated with rainfall intensity but negatively correlated with sea level the consistency of the simulated flood maps from the physical and equivalent drainage models indicates a good performance of the equivalent drainage method 2 the performance of the drainage network in compound weather events is investigated the drainage efficiency depends on the input rainfall intensity and the sea level in the combination of low intensity rainfall and high sea level large volumes of backflow into the outfalls are observed and the stormwater is difficult to drain into the sea 3 flood hazards are evaluated in the qianhai area the 50 year storm surge can hardly cause seawater intrusion along the reclaimed sea shore while significant seawater intrusion can occur in the bao an airport area in the 500 year and 2000 year storm surge cases high sea level boundaries can amplify the effect of rainfall making the inland flood hazard more severe due to the reduction of drainage efficiency the hazard scenario under the combination of 500 year rainfall and 500 year storm surge is comparable to that under the combination of 2000 year rainfall and 50 year storm surge when considering sea level rise and ground subsidence in the reclaimed areas the flood extents caused by seawater intrusion may increase by 5 39 km2 and 12 92 km2 when the sea level rises 0 5 m and 1 m respectively above that of the current 2000 year storm surge scenario 4 the flood hazard analysis is based on synthetic compound scenarios of tide storm surge and rainfall the joint probability of flood triggering variables should be further investigated to evaluate the return periods of compound events credit authorship contribution statement yejia

4639,many coastal cities face growing flood risks due to interactions of multiple triggers related to the changing climate such as intense rainstorms rising sea level severe storm surges etc the complex urban morphology and infrastructural systems have profound effects on flow routing and need to be properly considered in flood modelling in particular the underground drainage system is a key element of urban drainage but its fine scale modelling is still an open challenge this paper aims to evaluate flood hazards in coastal cities upon combined high tide storm surge and intense rainfall by incorporating the compound weather conditions into a grid based flood analysis model an equivalent drainage method is proposed to improve the efficiency of large scale urban drainage modelling which simulates the capacity of drainage networks by enhanced infiltration the equivalent method is calibrated with a physically based drainage model considering varying rainfall intensities and sea levels the flood hazards in two coastal cities shenzhen and hong kong in the pearl river delta of south china are evaluated results show that in the combination of low intensity rainfall and high sea level stormwater is difficult to drain into the sea and significant backflows into the drainage outfalls can occur the inland inundation caused by rainfall can be amplified by high sea levels due to the reduction of drainage efficiency moreover flood hazards both along the coastline and in the inland areas can be exacerbated due to sea level rise and ground subsidence the equivalent drainage method shows a good performance and provides an easy alternative in large scale urban flood modelling the predicted hazard scenarios under various combinations of weather conditions provide essential information for re examining urban drainage designs and developing new flood prevention strategies keywords flood hazard flood modelling rainstorm storm surge stormwater drainage guangdong hong kong macau greater bay area 1 introduction many metropolitan areas face worsening flood hazards due to climate change e g ma et al 2018 the water cycle in urban areas is different from that in rural areas due to the altered landscape surface roughness and flow routing particularly engineering stormwater drainage systems provide an important means of urban drainage researchers have attempted to construct numerical models to simulate surface flow sewer flow and coupled flows in urban areas various models have been proposed for modelling the hydrological and hydraulic responses of the urban drainage system for design and analysis purposes such as the storm water management model swmm rossman et al 2005 infoworks wallingford software 2010 and mouse danish hydraulic institute 1999 two dimensional overland flow models have been coupled with one dimensional sewer flow models to consider bi directionally flow exchange between the land surface and drainage networks hsu et al 2000 seyoum et al 2011 chang et al 2015 leandro and martins 2016 sañudo et al 2020 these models differ in terms of complexity of governing equations of the overland flow model coupling methods and treatment of stormwater transfer etc however the direct modelling of urban drainage systems often requires a large amount of information and a great effort to set up the model attempt has been made to consider the underground drainage capacity indirectly by subtracting the water volume drained by a pipe system from the run off chen et al 2009b yu and coulthard 2015 yin et al 2016 or increasing the infiltration rate chen et al 2009a wang et al 2018 these indirect methods often estimate the drainage rates according to the design capacity of the drainage network ignoring variations of drainage efficiency with weather conditions such as rainfall intensity and downstream boundaries of outfalls conventional flood hazard analysis tends to focus on the impact of intense rainfall however flood scenarios can become more severe in a coastal environment under compound weather conditions high tide storm surge and intense rainfall can coincide during a synoptic scale meteorological event which will increase the flood risk in coastal cities such as shenzhen and hong kong in the pearl river delta prd of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area for example typhoon hato made landfall in prd on august 23 2017 causing severe storm surges and heavy rainfall a maximum storm surge of 2 79 m and a maximum sea level of 6 14 m were recorded at zhuhai station hko 2020a hong kong macao and zhuhai were severely affected by the combination of high sea level heavy rainfall and surface runoff takagi et al 2018 islam and takagi 2020 the correlation between multiple flooding triggers should be considered to evaluate the probability of compound flooding these kinds of correlations can be considered based on estimation of the joint probability function hawkes 2008 mazas and hamm 2017 sadegh et al 2018 or based on continuous simulations sopelana et al 2018 the correlation between rainfall and storm surge variables has been investigated previously zheng et al 2013 2014 xu et al 2014 and the estimated joint probability is used to define boundary conditions for a hydraulic model to evaluate the flood conditions of rivers and floodplains lian et al 2013 zellou and rahali 2019 however little attention has been paid to possible hazard scenarios in urban settings under the combined effect of tide storm surge and rainfall where the efficiency of drainage network could be significantly affected by rainfall intensity and sea level the flood risk in coastal cities like shenzhen and hong kong increases over time the frequent extreme weather events in the changing climate may be a major driver that accelerates this trend sea level rise is almost certain in many areas including the south china sea zhang and fang 2015 tang et al 2009 moreover according to ipcc 2013 both the frequency of intense tropical cyclones tc and the intensity of precipitation brought by landfalling tcs are likely to increase in east asia apart from the changing climate ground subsidence of newly reclaimed land is another factor that aggravates flood hazards in coastal cities such as singapore leung et al 2019 shenzhen zhao et al 2011 xu et al 2016 and hong kong sun et al 2018 therefore extreme flood hazards that did not appear in the past are expected in the future the primary objective of this paper is to evaluate flood hazards in coastal metropolitan areas upon combined high tide storm surge and rainfall the compound weather conditions are incorporated into a grid based urban flood analysis model to investigate the severity of flood hazards the performance of complex urban drainage systems in compound scenarios of the three variables is examined in particular an equivalent drainage method is proposed to extend the feasibility of urban drainage modelling for cases without adequate drainage structure information and to improve the efficiency of modelling large systems in view of the growing flood risk in the future extreme values of the three variables are considered in the flood analysis in this paper the urban flood analysis model including the equivalent drainage method is described in section 2 in sections 3 and 4 the flood hazards as well as the performance of drainage networks under the joint influence of tide storm surge and rainfall are investigated in the qianhai area shenzhen and the kowloon peninsula hong kong 2 urban flood analysis in coastal cities to model coastal metropolitan flooding upon combined rainfall high tide and storm surge a flow routing model flo 2d is adopted for overland flow simulation with the three flooding triggers properly considered the stormwater drainage system liable to affect the flooding process is modelled either with a physical based model swmm coupled with flo 2d or an equivalent drainage method proposed in this paper for different scopes of application 2 1 flood analysis in combined rainfall high tide storm surge events a grid based flow routing model flo 2d flo 2d 2018 is used for flood analysis in coastal metropolitan areas as shown in fig 1 tide storm surge and rainfall are incorporated into the model to evaluate the flood hazards in compound weather conditions the hydrological processes of stormwater simulated in the model include vegetation interception infiltration overland flow and flow in drainage pipes flow interactions at coastal boundaries as well as at underground drainage outfalls are also simulated the rainfall process is described with a hyetograph and can be regarded as uniform in space for a relatively small study scale for a large scale model spatial temporal varying rainfall input can be used e g qiang et al 2020 serinaldi 2009 the interception of stormwater by vegetation is considered with an initial abstraction after some interception the stormwater will infiltrate into the soil flow to other cells or into the drainage inlets the infiltration process is calculated using the green ampt model green and ampt 1911 as 1 f k s h f h 0 z f where f is the infiltration rate ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity hf and h0 are the hydraulic heads at the wetting front and at the surface respectively zf is the depth of wetting front the overland flow process is calculated in eight directions i e four compass directions and four diagonal directions the depth averaged flow velocity is calculated for each direction independently with the one dimensional shallow water equations 2 h t hv x i f q 3 s f s 0 h x v g v x 1 g v t where h is the flow depth t is time v is the depth averaged flow velocity along x direction i is the rainfall intensity q is the ratio of volume flow rate into drainage inlets to the area of the cell containing the inlets sf is the frictional slope s0 is the bed slope and g is the gravitational acceleration the shallow water equations are solved with a central finite difference numerical method an explicit scheme is adopted to solve the momentum equation to obtain the flow velocity across the cell boundary the discharges across the boundary are computed by multiplying the velocity by the flow area for the eight flow directions and the cell flow depth is updated with the continuity equation to capture the effect of artificial surface obstacles on the surface flow the area reduction factor arf and the width reduction factor wrf are adopted for the cells containing buildings to consider the reduction in water storage and flow width for a certain direction due to building blockage o brien et al 1993 for each cell arf is calculated as the ratio of the occupied area of buildings to the area of the cell there are eight wrfs along the eight flow directions for each cell a cell is divided into nine equivalent sub cells and the wrf along a flow direction is calculated as the ratio of the occupied area of buildings to the area of the sub cell along the flow direction for regions with adequate stormwater drainage system data the drainage system is directly modelled with a physically based model swmm developed by the us environmental protection agency rossman et al 2005 the swmm model is integrated with flo 2d on a computational time step basis bi directional flow exchanges between the ground surface and the drainage system are allowed the flow exchange is calculated by comparing the pressure head at the nodes of the drainage inlet and the surface water elevations of the cells containing the inlets the inflow discharge at the storm drain inlets is calculated using weir and orifice equations based on the geometry of the inlets technical details can be found in flo 2d 2018 many drainage outfalls are located along the coastline or tidal rivers so the efficiency of drainage network can be affected by variations of the downstream water levels in this study the variation of drainage efficiency with sea level is characterised by a tidal boundary condition for outfalls with the water head calculated from the sea level time histories the hydrological process in coastal cities can also be influenced by abnormally high sea levels caused by cyclones seawater intrusion caused by high sea level and wave overtopping is likely to happen in low lying areas a temporally varying stage boundary is adopted for the cells along the coastline which allows seawater to flow to the land areas when the sea level is higher than the water head in the coastal cells and to flow back to the sea when the sea level declines the variation process of sea level can be obtained from nearby tide gauges for a short coastline the sea level can be regarded spatially uniform the overtopping volume of waves is not considered in this paper which may underestimate the intrusion volume slightly 2 2 equivalent drainage method in spite of the availability of various sewer flow models building a physically based underground drainage model for urban flood analysis is challenging due to two issues first a large amount of data is needed to set up the drainage pipelines in models like swmm such as location diameter shape and slope of each pipe which is unavailable in many cases second the grid resolution should be fine enough to capture the densely distributed drainage pipelines the design spacing of road drainage gullies is typically 25 m to 50 m in china gb 50014 2006 2016 for a large scale system much effort and large computation costs are required to use physically based models which may not always be justifiable in previous simplified modelling of drainage networks the drainage rate to the urban drainage infrastructure is often regarded constant and estimated based on the local design drainage capacity however the drainage rate is not necessarily constant in different weather conditions when the rainfall intensity exceeds the capacity of the drainage system stormwater cannot be timely drained and ponding can happen furthermore the reduction in drainage efficiency due to the variation of outfall boundaries should also be considered to improve the feasibility of drainage network modelling an equivalent drainage method is proposed to simulate the drainage capacity by enhanced infiltration and to replace the physical based drainage model that is coupled with flo 2d an infiltration adjustment factor k is adopted to modify the hydraulic conductivity of the urban artificial surface the value of k is calibrated using a flood model with a physically based drainage network flo 2d coupled with swmm for an area with a similar drainage design standard or for a small representative part of the study area the following assumptions are made in the equivalent drainage method 1 the drainage process through the pipelines is replaced by an enhanced infiltration process the value of the infiltration adjustment factor k is related to the input rainfall intensity and sea level boundaries and is constant throughout the simulation process 2 the distributed drainage capacity is assumed spatially uniform in the study urban areas 3 the drainage capacity of the study area is regarded the same as that of the calibration area where sufficient data on the drainage network is available for setting up a physically based drainage model the hydraulic conductivity of the urban area is set as the product of the adjustment factor k and the hydraulic conductivity of the vegetated land given a weather scenario of rainfall intensity and sea level the adjustment factor is determined by minimizing the average relative difference between the simulated maximum flow depths mfd from the models with a physically based drainage and assuming equivalent drainage 4 k arg min 1 n i 1 n d e i k d i d i where de i and di are the mfd of the ith cell calculated by the equivalent drainage model and the physically based drainage model respectively and n is the number of cells the variation of k with rainfall intensity and sea level can be determined through simulations under various combinations of rainfall intensity and sea level corresponding to different return periods 3 flood analysis in the greater bay area 3 1 study areas shenzhen is located on the east side of the pearl river estuary fig 2 a and is one of the most developed cities in china this densely populated city is one of the coastal cities most vulnerable to flood risk in the world hallegatte et al 2013 the city is dominated by a humid subtropical monsoon climate tcs make landfalls in prd frequently from june to october the average annual rainfall amount 1981 2010 of shenzhen is 1935 8 mm 86 of which concentrates in the rainy season from april to september the qianhai area fig 2b including the qianhai cooperation zone bao an centre and bao an international airport is a new littoral development zone at the southwest corner of shenzhen with a land area of 117 km2 the qianhai area has a large portion of newly reclaimed land the reclamation began in the 1980s and by the mid 2010s the topography of this area had been markedly changed the evolution of land reclamations in the qianhai area since 1979 is shown in fig 3 large uncertainties in flood risk are also associated with subsidence of newly reclaimed lands and the changing climate moreover public data on the stormwater drainage networks in shenzhen is limited hence the flood hazards in the qianhai area upon compound scenarios of tide storm surge and rainfall will be investigated using the equivalent drainage method the 47 km2 kowloon peninsula fig 2c in hong kong which is only approximately 40 km away from the qianhai area is chosen to be the calibration area for the equivalent drainage method hong kong is another major coastal city in prd fig 2a the meteorological conditions of hong kong are similar to shenzhen and the average annual rainfall amount 1981 2010 in hong kong is 2398 5 mm the hong kong sar government has made the information on the urban drainage system public therefore a physically based drainage model is constructed for the kowloon peninsula with the data available and the kowloon model is subsequently used to investigate the performance of the drainage network and to calibrate the equivalent drainage model for the qianhai area 3 2 compound scenarios of tide storm surge and rainfall the flood hazard analyses are carried out upon synthetic combinations of tide storm surge and rainfall with their magnitudes estimated according to historical records frequency analysis is carried out separately for each flooding trigger with local data and the frequency curves are extrapolated to extreme cases the annual maximum series of the rolling 12 hour rainfall amount recorded at lau fau shan station fig 2a from 1985 to 2018 and the maximum storm surge level during each tc recorded at tsim bei tsui station fig 2a from 1980 to 2019 are used fig 4 a the generalised extreme value gev distribution is used to fit the annual series fig 4b the return periods for each single variable are calculated based on the fitted gev distributions as shown in table 1 there is a positive correlation between the two variables according to the analysis on historical data the correlation should be considered when estimating the joint probability of the two variables and the return periods of the compound events which are not involved in this paper the astronomical tides in shenzhen are mixed and primarily semi diurnal and can be derived from harmonic constituents the distribution of the high tide is close to the normal distribution it is likely that the peaks of storm surge meet high tides so the mean high tide level which is 2 41 m above the chart datum as recorded at tsim bei tsui station from 1994 to 2018 is assumed to coincide with the peak of storm surge to ensure that the tide component is of sufficient magnitude for flood analysis in a future scenario synthetic temporal patterns are needed because the realistic temporal patterns of rainfall and storm surge are complex and hardly known for simplicity the processes of rainfall and storm surge are assumed to be triangular and symmetrical fig 5 with the total rainfall amount and the peak surge level determined according to their return periods regarding astronomical tides a typical tide curve with the high tide to be 2 41 m is used the sea level boundaries are obtained by adding the astronomical tide and the storm surge of certain return periods the 12 hour processes of the combined rainfall and sea level are used as inputs for flood hazard analysis and regarded as spatially uniform 3 3 performance of the drainage network in compound weather events the performance of the stormwater drainage network in the compound scenarios of tide storm surge and rainfall are investigated with a flood model built for the kowloon peninsula with a physically based drainage network fig 2c established based on data from the geoinfo map 2020 the grid cell size of the kowloon model is 30 30 m with 57 741 cells in total the elevation of each grid cell is acquired from the digital terrain model of hong kong available at data gov hk building shapes are identified from satellite images fig 2c and then arfs and wrfs are automatically computed according to the intersection of building shapes and grid cells two land cover types are considered in the model the vegetated land is shown in fig 2c and the rest of the area is identified as urban area the infiltration parameters initial abstraction of rainfall and the manning s coefficient shown in table 2 are determined according to land cover type referring to flo 2d 2018 and lumb 1965 and have been calibrated in the work of he et al 2020 to verify the kowloon model a rainstorm on 7 june 2008 shown in fig 6 a recorded at rainfall station k09 fig 2c is used as the model input the mfd simulated by the model and the observed flood spots reported by the drainage services department of the hong kong sar government are shown in fig 6b the consistency of the spatial distribution of flood spots and the simulated flood extent indicates the satisfactory performance of the flood model the invert elevations of the drainage outfalls range from 1 17 m to 1 88 m referring to the chart datum to investigate the possible effect of high sea level on the efficiency of drainage facilities and flood severity it is assumed that there were no tidal control structures at the outfalls within the study area it should be noted that such structures as tidal gates and non return flap valves have been gradually installed especially after the super typhoon hato in 2017 table 3 summarises the flow volumes under four scenarios indicating excellent mass balance the floodplain inflow and outflow are the volumes exchanged at the boundary cells water depths are added to the boundary cells and the floodplain inflow increases when the sea level is higher than the elevations of the coastal cells the seawater does not necessarily flow inland if the elevations of the adjacent cells are higher the volume of floodplain inflow is large because some shoreline cells at low elevations are included in the analysis area so is the floodplain outflow volume the drainage network plays a significant role in the flow exchange the net outflow discharges through the outfalls in the two cases of the 50 year storm surge account for 40 7 and 41 5 of the rainfall volumes for the 50 year rainfall and the 2000 year rainfall cases respectively however when relatively low intensity rainfall coincides with a high sea level e g 50 year rain and 2000 year storm surge the volume of inflow through the outfalls i e backflow of seawater into the outfalls is comparable to that of the outflow through the outfalls which means the stormwater can hardly drain into the sea the volumes of outflow through the outfalls are dominated by the rainfall intensity and are much larger in the two scenarios of the 2000 year rainfall while the volumes of inflow through the outfalls are positively correlated to the sea level and negatively correlated to the rainfall intensity fig 7 shows the outflow discharges at two outfalls under four scenarios where a negative discharge indicates the backflow of seawater the locations of the two outfalls are shown in fig 2c the invert elevations of outfalls o1 and o2 are 1 17 m and 0 30 m referring to the chart datum respectively there are remarkable negative discharges at both o1 and o2 in the two scenarios of the 2000 year storm surge and the time of peak negative discharge is generally consistent with the time of peak sea level the positive discharges in the 2000 year rainfall cases are much larger than those in the 50 year rainfall cases for the same sea level boundary for both outfalls which is consistent with the flow volumes it is clear that the performance of the drainage network heavily depends on the rainfall intensity and the peak sea level of the synthetic 12 hour process 3 4 calibration of the equivalent drainage model shenzhen and hong kong are neighbouring cities with similar climate characteristics and urban drainage system design therefore the flood analysis model for the kowloon peninsula is used to calibrate the equivalent drainage model for the qianhai area considering the complexity of drainage infrastructures in hong kong and shenzhen only the major drainage pipelines are included in the physical drainage model for kowloon and the strategic stormwater storage and interception facilities in kowloon such as lai chi kok drainage tunnel and tai hang tung storage tank are not included to estimate the infiltration adjustment factor k under different combinations of rainfall intensity and sea level boundaries both the models with physical drainage facilities and using the equivalent drainage method are applied to the kowloon peninsula the optimal k is determined through a trial and error method considering the combinations of four rolling 12 hour rainfall amounts with return periods of 50 200 1000 2000 years and four storm surge levels with return periods of 50 200 1000 2000 years a series of discrete values of k ranging from 0 to 5 at an interval of 0 25 is adopted to minimise the average relative difference of mfd and the optimal value of k is chosen for each combination with the optimal values of k for the 16 scenarios a quadratic polynomial is fitted as shown in fig 8 with the coefficient of determination r2 to be 0 99 so that the infiltration adjustment factor for any other combinations in the range can be estimated as 5 k a 0 a 1 s a 2 r a 3 s 2 a 4 r 2 a 5 s r where s is the peak storm surge level m r is the maximum rolling 12 hour rainfall amount mm and a 0 a 1 a 5 2 05 1 95 5 9 10 3 4 44 10 1 1 03 10 6 3 03 10 4 within the range of return periods from 50 years to 2000 years a clear negative correlation with sea level and a positive correlation with rainfall intensity close to linear in this range are observed for the fitted adjustment factor the increase rate of k declines with the decrease of storm surge level which implies that low level storm surges have less impact on the drainage efficiency to check how realistic the equivalent drainage method is the simulated mfd in kowloon upon the synthetic processes of combined rainfall and sea level from the physically based and equivalent drainage models are compared fig 9 compares the flood maps for compounding 1000 year rainfall and 1000 year storm surge the flood extents from the two models are consistent and the differences in mfd are rather small consistent results are also obtained for other compound scenarios of rainfall and sea level therefore the drainage system efficiency is well reflected in the equivalent drainage method 4 flood hazard scenarios 4 1 flood hazards in the qianhai area in compound weather events a flood analysis model with the drainage network simulated using the equivalent drainage method is established to evaluate flood hazards in the qianhai area the grid cell size is 20 20 m with 292 469 cells in total the elevation data is acquired from remote sensing technology centre of japan the distributions of buildings and land cover types are shown in fig 2b enhanced infiltration in the urban area is used to represent the drainage network the model parameters are shown in table 2 referring to the design return periods of the urban drainage trunk system 200 years and the branch system 50 years dsd 2018 nine compound scenarios of rainfall and storm surge with return periods of 50 years 500 years and 2000 years are investigated to demonstrate the influence of seawater intrusion scenarios only with storm surges without rainfall are also investigated the flood hazard maps are shown in fig 10 and the calculated areas of inundation are shown in fig 11 the 50 year return period events are regarded as serious but quite likely when both the rainfall and the storm surge are of the 50 year return level there will be only a few inland places inundated mainly along low lying roads and river banks the mfd of most areas are lower than 0 5 m indicating that the coincidence of the 50 year rainfall and storm surge can generally be coped with for the scenarios of a relatively low storm surge 50 year return period seawater intrusion hardly occurs along the reclaimed sea shore and the severity of flood hazards is dominated by rainfall intensity in the 500 year storm surge scenarios the second runway fig 3 of the bao an airport constructed between 2000 and 2010 on the reclaimed land will be inundated due to seawater intrusion and in the 2000 year storm surge scenarios both the first and the second runways fig 3 will be inundated by seawater it is worth noting that the severity of inland flood hazard that is not directly caused by seawater intrusion can also be affected by sea level boundaries for example in the three cases of the 500 year rainfall the flood extents in areas excluding the airport region increase by 11 7 and 33 2 for the 500 year and the 2000 year storm surge scenarios respectively compared to that in the 50 year storm surge case moreover the simulated inundation areas of different water depths in the scenario of 500 year rainfall and 500 year storm surge are very similar to the scenario of 2000 year rainfall and 50 year storm surge fig 11 hence the co occurrence of extreme high sea levels could amplify the effect of rainfall by reducing the drainage efficiency when extreme rainfall and extreme storm surges occur simultaneously i e the 2000 year rain and 2000 year storm surge the flood hazard will be extremely severe with the mfd exceeding 1 m in many blocks as shown in fig 11 the proportion of area with large water depths grows with rainfall intensity and storm surge levels the percentage of area with water depths between 1 m and 2 m increases notably from 11 for the scenario of 50 year rainfall and storm surge to 28 for the scenario of 2000 year rainfall and storm surge 4 2 extreme flood hazards in reclaimed land considering sea level rise the flood risk in the qianhai area is likely to evolve over time sea level rise can aggravate the flood risk in low lying areas of coastal cities under climate change in the study area the mean sea level rose at a rate of 31 mm per decade during 1954 2019 hko 2020b in addition to sea level rise ground subsidence in reclamation areas due to soil consolidation under the action of gravity and loads from superstructures is another factor that could exacerbate the flood risk according to the coastal subsidence monitoring in shenzhen conducted by xu et al 2016 the settlement rates of target points located in the reclaimed land of the qianhai area were 10 to 25 mm year from 2007 to 2011 and remarkable ground deformation was still observed in bao an centre about 20 years after the reclamation previous investigations based on the consolidation theory show that the post construction subsidence in bao an centre could be larger than 1 m lu and huang 2017 to investigate possible future flood hazard scenarios in the qianhai area more extreme sea level boundaries are considered assuming the sea level rises 0 5 m and 1 m above that of the 2000 year storm surge scenario simulations are conducted for the scenarios with only sea level rises and the scenarios of 2000 year rainfall along with rising sea levels fig 12 shows the extents of inundation caused by seawater intrusion under the rising sea levels and the increase of mfd due to the rising sea levels compared to those in the 2000 year rainfall and 2000 year storm surge scenario the water depths in some inland areas including bao an centre are shown to increase due to further reduction of drainage efficiency the inundation in the airport area will become more extensive in both cases i e 0 5 m and 1 m sea level rise the flood extents caused by seawater intrusion may increase by 5 39 km2 and 12 92 km2 respectively when the sea level rises 0 5 m and 1 m above that of the current 2000 year storm surge scenario in such extreme cases measures for preventing seawater intrusion such as floodwalls should be taken in low lying areas along the shoreline especially in the airport area furthermore tide gates or other backflow prevention devices can be considered to improve the performance of the urban drainage network in case of high sea level boundaries 5 conclusions combined tide storm surge and rainfall are incorporated into a grid based urban flood analysis model to investigate possible metropolitan flooding scenarios under the joint effects of the above three unfavourable weather conditions the performance of the underground stormwater drainage system is evaluated in particular the major conclusions are as follows 1 an equivalent drainage method is proposed to model a complex stormwater drainage network indirectly via enhanced infiltration an infiltration adjustment factor is adopted to quantify the drainage efficiency and calibrated by a physically based drainage model the infiltration adjustment factor is found positively correlated with rainfall intensity but negatively correlated with sea level the consistency of the simulated flood maps from the physical and equivalent drainage models indicates a good performance of the equivalent drainage method 2 the performance of the drainage network in compound weather events is investigated the drainage efficiency depends on the input rainfall intensity and the sea level in the combination of low intensity rainfall and high sea level large volumes of backflow into the outfalls are observed and the stormwater is difficult to drain into the sea 3 flood hazards are evaluated in the qianhai area the 50 year storm surge can hardly cause seawater intrusion along the reclaimed sea shore while significant seawater intrusion can occur in the bao an airport area in the 500 year and 2000 year storm surge cases high sea level boundaries can amplify the effect of rainfall making the inland flood hazard more severe due to the reduction of drainage efficiency the hazard scenario under the combination of 500 year rainfall and 500 year storm surge is comparable to that under the combination of 2000 year rainfall and 50 year storm surge when considering sea level rise and ground subsidence in the reclaimed areas the flood extents caused by seawater intrusion may increase by 5 39 km2 and 12 92 km2 when the sea level rises 0 5 m and 1 m respectively above that of the current 2000 year storm surge scenario 4 the flood hazard analysis is based on synthetic compound scenarios of tide storm surge and rainfall the joint probability of flood triggering variables should be further investigated to evaluate the return periods of compound events credit authorship contribution statement yejia
