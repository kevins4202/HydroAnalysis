15880,the complexity of modeling water quality variations in water distribution systems wds studied for decades stems from multiple constraints and variables involved and the complexity of the system behavior the conventional macroscale based wds water quality models are founded on continuum mechanics in attempts to provide a broad picture of the multi species interactions these models overlook the stochasticity corresponding to the reaction mechanisms within the wds domain furthermore owing to the black box type modeling adopted in simulating the multi species interactions the existing state of the art models have limitations in representing intermediates and or by products formation accordingly they remain ineffective in describing the water chemistry stoichiometric interactions within the wds domain only a radically new modeling approach could overcome the limitations of the macroscale based approaches and enables analyzing the stochastic wds mechanisms by keeping the true nature of the system behavior stimulated by the metabolic network modeling principles in systems biology this article outlines the prospect of developing an innovative water bolic network modeling

systems biology metabolic network modeling flux balance analysis 1 introduction water distribution systems wds consisting of reservoirs pipes and hydraulic control components tanks pumps and valves are designed and operated to distribute the consumers with an adequate quantity of drinking water meeting required quality standards the propagation of water via wds alters its quality characteristics therefore the challenging task during wds management is delivering microbiologically and chemically safe and aesthetically and organoleptically pleasing drinking water recent studies identified wds as a probable cause for acute and chronic health risks to a significant segment of the population abhijith and ostfeld 2021 these findings are associated with the increased demand for water quality with upgraded human living standards incidentally understanding the origins and examining the mechanisms of the quality degradation of delivered drinking water in wds gains significance the wds monitoring assumes a key and dynamic role in this regard owing to the vulnerability of wds to contamination risks jeandron et al 2019 employing the assistance of computer based mathematical models functional to the application of risk based contamination prevention and management systems has profound applications specifically in analyzing the wds water quality variations under accidental burkhardt et al 2017 and intentional contamination events lifshitz and ostfeld 2019 although the research area of developing computer based modeling tools for wds has flourished and advanced for the last three decades concerns exist over the rightness of the conventional state of the art based on purely macroscale based approaches in mimicking the stochastic mechanisms physical chemical physicochemical and biochemical reactions concerning the quality characteristics inside wds abhijith and mohan 2020 for example concerning the bacteriological quality modeling in wds the volume and density of the bacterial cells of different species with varying characteristics metabolism structure composition disinfectant resistance usually encountered in distribution pipes ranges between 0 4 and 3 µm3 levin and angert 2015 and 1 1 1 5 g cm3 bakken and olsen 1983 respectively the conventional macroscale based approaches are founded on continuum mechanics and they attempt to provide a broad picture of the bacterial interactions thus typically to overcome the uncertainties associated primarily with the heterogeneity of the microbial ecology within distribution pipes the existing state of the art wds water quality models choose a common bacterial species typically pseudomonas aeruginosa as the surrogate species and evolve the model framework accordingly abhijith and mohan 2021 abokifa et al 2016 via these assumptions the existing state of the art overlooks the stochasticity corresponding to the reaction mechanisms within the wds domain furthermore the method of handling the multi species exchanges by the existing macroscale based approaches is analogous to black box modeling though the macroscopic representation of the reactions within the wds domain enables developing deterministic predictive tools with reasonable accuracy these tools cannot signify wds mechanisms that involve a multitude of reaction pathways and numerous intermediates and or by products formation for example the chloroform formation via reactions between hypochlorous acid and resorcinol abokifa 2018 a typical humic substance with unsaturated carbon bonds and aromatic structure could be modeled but only without accounting for the complex reaction pathway such a representation would not demonstrate the formation of intermediates and by products hence the effects of water chemistry on reaction mechanisms and the following impact change in ph due to the formation of intermediates on water chemistry might go unaccounted therefore it may be said that the interpretation of the stochastic mechanisms on a large scale takes away the true essence of the system behavior from the conventional state of the art the high number of constraints and decision variables the nonlinearity the non smoothness of the head flow water quality governing equations and the inter complexity of system behavior make the wds water quality analysis extremely complex furthermore because of the ambiguity in representing the molecular level mechanisms within the wds domain and the extra complexity in terms of formulation and computation that such a representation may generate no notable attempt has been made yet to advance the macroscale based approaches by introducing the microscale based knowledge towards this limitation this article envisions an original strategy to cross the traditional disciplinary frontiers of engineering and employ the fundamental concepts of computational systems biology csb for the first time in wds engineering to propose water bolic network modeling a novel approach for wds water quality modeling 1 1 csb principles and metabolic network modeling csb is studying biological systems through the cooperative application of advanced high data volume generating technologies and computational tools to gain more holistic knowledge of the inter dependencies of system components and fundamental system complexity nazem bokaee et al 2021 it represents a synthesis of concepts and methods from life sciences physical sciences computer science and engineering it has evolved as a combination of two distinct branches knowledge discovery and analysis kitano 2002 the first branch extracts the knowledge on the number of pathways networks of interactions and chemical environments at the molecular level d addese et al 2021 from vast amounts of experimental data forming hypotheses hypotheses formed in the knowledge branch are tested in the analysis branch via iterative cycles of wet lab based and dry simulation based experiments by which systems level data are engendered examined and then used to stimulate new perceptions about the biological system at hand nazem bokaee et al 2021 metabolic network models have emerged as a fitting choice in csb disciplines to examine the detailed microbial physiology and metabolic knowledge for a deeper understanding and analysis of microbial interactions by employing genetic knowledge of each species these models represent metabolic pathways as a chain of specific enzyme catalyzed reactions and describe them as mass and charge balanced stoichiometric biochemical reactions seif and palsson 2021 the capacity to generate experimental datasets on the nutrient utilization metabolism fluxes strain abundance and nutrient exchange within microbial communities has facilitated calibrating and validating these models o brien et al 2015 needless to say these metabolic network modeling became the go to technique in systems biology to elucidate several questions about metabolic engineering prediction of cellular phenotypes analysis of biological network properties studies of evolutionary processes and studies of interspecies interactions mccloskey et al 2013 fascinatingly much of the capabilities of metabolic network modeling tools are linked to the molecular level knowledge that got exploited into their development for simulating molecular exchanges keeping these advancements of metabolic network modeling in mind this article specifically focuses on a question relating to wds engineering an entirely unrelated disciple from csb whether a molecular level understanding of the reaction mechanisms within the wds domain enables better controlling of the delivered water quality under diverse operating conditions the first challenge in this quest is constructing a bridge between csb and wds engineering principles 1 2 water bolic network modeling wds are conceptualized as complex systems like biological systems to articulate the spatial evolution of wds water quality such an interpretation enables treating the wds components such as reservoirs pipes tanks pumps and valves as combinations of individual cells similar to the composition of biological systems the individual cells of wds components constitutes several divergent species which may or may not form reactive compartments and which cooperate selectively and nonlinearly to yield the overall quality of the delivered drinking water similar to the intricate biochemical inter and intra cellular exchanges within the biological cell physical chemical physicochemical and biochemical exchanges may occur within the individual cells of wds components for simulating the temporal evolution of water quality parameters the temporal domain is also discretized via timesteps both the top down and bottom up approaches are employed in water bolic network modeling at the beginning of every timestep the concentration a macroscale parameter of a reactive species within every cell is downscaled to individual particles atoms molecules at the end of the timestep the individual particles atoms molecules are weighed up and the water quality is represented in the most typical macroscale unit i e concentration 1 3 governing mechanisms transport processes advection and axial dispersion constitute the major physical exchanges that govern the distribution of the distinct particles of one several reactive species within the spatial domain of wds components during every time frame of interest water bolic network models handle the transport processes at the microscopic scale utilizing the random walk particle tracking method salamon et al 2006 the advection could be treated as a deterministic process at the same time the spreading of particles within the system domain resulting from molecular diffusion and dispersion could be dealt with as a probabilistic process abhijith and mohan 2020 wds are dynamic systems and the transient nature of the flow is vital in regulating the scale of these processes therefore the macroscopic parameters such as average flow velocity governs the magnitude of advection and longitudinal mixing at the microscale reactions constituted principally by physicochemical and biochemical exchanges govern the temporal evolution of the distinct particles of one several reactive species within every discrete cell during every time frame of interest in water bolic network modeling system structures and dynamics are recognized as the two fundamental characteristics that are pivotal in deriving the system level understanding of the multi species interactions within the wds domain louridas and lourida 2017 1 4 system structure the system structure comprises the molecular level network of reaction mechanisms within the wds domain a typical pipe cell employed in the water bolic network model for understanding the oxidation of as iii species to as v species under chlorinated conditions is illustrated in fig 1 to explain the concept of system structure the different reacting species considered within the pipe cell include hocl hypochlorous acid ocl hypochlorite ion as oh 3 arsenous acid as oh 2o as oh o2 and aso3 as iii species in aqueous phase aso oh 3 arsenic acid and h hydrogen ion out of these eight hocl and ocl are free available chlorine fac species and they form the fac compartment likewise as oh 3 as oh 2o as oh o2 and aso3 are different as iii species that may occur in aquatic systems and hence these four together form the as iii compartment once the different reacting species and the reactive compartments within the individual cells of wds components are specified the network of exchanges between these species needs to be ascertained and categorized the most critical footstep in this regard is skeletonizing the mass balanced stoichiometric reactions amongst the multiple dynamic reacting species within the individual cells of wds wang et al 2019 a successful interpretation of the stoichiometric associations necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the molecular level interactions apparently this is the limiting knowledge concerning the research field of interest here therefore this step constrains merging the knowledge and analysis branch through a process inspired by the fundamentals of csb nazem bokaee et al 2021 utilizing past knowledge and derived knowledge the knowledge branch would reveal new co occurrence and correlation patterns hypotheses within the complex network of molecular level interactions within the reactive compartment the analysis branch via experimental and simulation based data would support or refute the hypotheses and validate this new perspective in understanding the numerous collective and competing relationships amongst the multiple reacting species within the wds in the course of categorizing the exchanges the possible combinations of win loss and neutral outcomes for two interaction partners in a biological cell are linked with the reacting species within the individual cells of wds the exchanges are thereby categorized primarily into five types predation amenalism commensalism competition and mutualism perez garcia et al 2016 the exchange between two species within a cell could be categorized as predation if one species benefits and other harms from the exchange the exchange could be categorized as amenalism if one species is harmed while the other is unaffected on the contrary in a commensalism exchange one species is benefitted while the other is unaffected in a competition exchange both the interacting species are harmed while in a mutualism exchange both species are benefitted in this context it may be noted that benefit corresponds to the formation of new ions atoms molecules of a reacting species and harm corresponds to the destruction or consumption of prevailing ions atoms molecules for example the exchange between the hocl molecule and the h ion refer to fig 1 is a definite predation exchange because the destruction of the hocl molecule leads to the formation of a new h ion therefore hocl is harmed by this exchange while h is benefitted 1 5 system dynamics although ascertaining and categorizing the molecular level interactions within the wds domain would be a giant leap forward the uncertainties on the impressions of the internal and or external factors on their outcomes may limit the advancements of this information in wds engineering the system dynamics define the evolution of the individual molecular level interactions over time identified from the system structure exploration which eventually controls the delivered water quality in wds mathematical modeling of the system dynamics within the wds domain is expected to shift the water bolic network modeling from a purely academic exercise to one which has potential practical implications a possible way forward is to make reciprocity amid the thermodynamics and kinetics of the numerous physical chemical physicochemical and biochemical exchanges and the microscale based knowledge of their respective stoichiometry moroney et al 2015 altogether this would require adequate information regarding the molecular level knowledge of the reaction pathways and the thermodynamic constraints das et al 2018 and in turn necessitate merging the knowledge and analysis branch via extensive and iterative wet and dry experiments outstanding work in this direction was reported by abokifa 2018 this study involved quantum chemical computations employing density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics simulations in analyzing the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reactions between free chlorine and humic natural organic matter precursors leading to trihalomethanes formation in wds though the study by abokifa 2018 motivates for pursuing a deep understanding of the molecular dynamics within the wds domain the lack of experimental data and theoretical knowledge about the molecular level interactions even concerning the chlorine decay at the pipe walls grayman 2018 monteiro et al 2020 is limiting our quest in further expanding the modeling framework beyond the as iii oxidation to as v problem reported this article outlines a simple mathematical modeling method inspired by the flux balance analysis in metabolic network modeling as an auxiliary to the procedures mentioned above for entailing the molecular level randomness of the reaction mechanisms within the wds domain the mathematical modeling method proposed is differentiable into three individual steps 1 listing of the mass balanced stoichiometric reactions 2 reconstructing the exchanges in a matrix format and 3 matrix solving to estimate the system dynamics these three steps are discussed in detail refer to fig 2 in particular to the example of as iii species oxidation to as v species under chlorinated conditions illustrated in fig 1 the first step involves reconstructing the water bolic network of reactions by listing the eight mass balanced stoichiometric reactions recognized from the system structure exploration this reconstructed water bolic network is then converted into a mathematical model by forming two matrices in the second step the first matrix formulated is called the stoichiometric matrix m n matrix m number of reacting species and n number of reactions labeled s of which each row represents a reacting species and each column represents a reaction the second matrix formulated is called the flux matrix n 1 matrix labeled v of which each row corresponds to the flux of a reaction the flux represents the ratio of the number of ions atoms molecules of a specific species that is formed or consumed in a reaction within the time frame of interest to the stoichiometric coefficient of the corresponding species in the mass balanced stoichiometric expression of the reaction therefore in fig 2 the first element va of the flux matrix v signifies the number of molecules of hocl getting consumed or the number of ions of ocl or h getting formed within the simulation period considered in examining the system dynamics this value may be approximated if we have appropriate evidence on the kinetics of the reaction for instance if the rate of reaction a refer to fig 2 is known apriori the va value at any time step may be determined by multiplying the reaction rate with the simulation period considered for the analysis however substantial uncertainties exist in the values of critical kinetic parameters defining the reaction rate of reactions encountered typically in wds abhijith et al 2021 therefore by handling the kinetic macroscopic parameters as probabilistic functions defined by the system state the stochasticity would be introduced into the flux values and eventually in the v matrix the third and final step in mathematical modeling comprises multiplying the two matrices s and v formulated in the second step to obtain the dynamic matrix m 1 matrix labeled δ each row element of δ corresponds to the variation in the number of the ions atoms molecules of the reacting species within the simulation period considered for mathematical modeling once the δ matrix is generated the system state after the simulation period is obtained by adding the individual row elements of the δ matrix with the corresponding state values of the reacting species in this way the proposed water bolic network model shoulders the capability to simulate the molecular level dynamics within the wds domain and realistically describe how the reaction mechanisms control the quality characteristics in wds 2 conclusions the existing state of the art wds water quality models overlook the stochasticity corresponding to the reaction mechanisms within the wds domain radically new models conceptualizing and describing the wds mechanisms concerning water quality at the microscale could enable analyzing the wds water quality variations more effectively in this direction this article put forth a procedure to utilize the essential ideas of csb in wds engineering to develop a novel approach for wds water quality modeling named water bolic network modeling water bolic network models conceptualize wds as complex systems like biological systems and treat its components as combinations of individual cells similar to the composition of biological systems system structures and dynamics were determined as the rudimentary characteristics for modeling the molecular level exchanges corresponding to multi species reactions within the wds domain the molecular level exchanges between the reacting species within the discrete cells of wds components were correlated with the possible combinations of win loss and neutral outcomes for two interaction partners in a biological cell to develop the system structure a straightforward mathematical modeling method inspired by the flux balance analysis in csb was proposed to overcome the conceptual hurdles of interpreting thermodynamics and kinetics of the molecular level exchanges no severe practical differences may emerge in how the water bolic network models and the existing models are implemented in wds water quality studies however due to the uniqueness of the water bolic network models in merging knowledge and analysis branches to gain more holistic knowledge of the intricacy of wds water quality we foresee the prospect water bolic network modeling approach to replace the existing state of the art in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15881,global phosphorus reserves are under pressure of depletion in the near future due to increased consumption of primary phosphorus reservoirs and improper management of phosphorus at the same time a considerable portion of global marine water bodies has been suffering from eutrophication due to excessive nutrient loading the marine environment can be considered as a valuable phosphorus source due to nutrient rich eutrophic seawater and sediment which could potentially serve as phosphorus mines in the near future hence sustainable phosphorus recovery strategies should be adapted for marine systems to provide phosphorus for the growing market demand and simultaneously control eutrophication in this review possible sustainable strategies for phosphorus removal and recovery from marine environments are discussed in detail bio based strategies relying on natural phosphorus uptake release metabolism of living organisms are suggested as promising options that can provide both phosphorus removal and recovery from marine waters for achieving a sustainable marine ecosystem among them the utilization of microorganisms seems promising to develop novel strategies however the research gap for the technical applicability of these strategies is still considerably big therefore future research should focus on the technical development of the strategies through laboratory and or field studies coupling phosphorus mining with other valorisation pathways i e metal recovery energy production is also suggested to improve overall sustainability and economic viability environmental economic and societal challenges should altogether be well addressed prior to real scale applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marine phosphorus eutrophication resource recovery blue economy 1 introduction phosphorus p is a basis for life on earth and an essential raw material for human development in terms of fertilizer production as well as industrial applications such as production of food detergents and steel phosphate rocks have been exploited for these purposes since the middle of the 19th century smil 2000 and global phosphate demand has been increasing each year due to increased population growth the global phosphate consumption is expected to increase to 49 million tonnes in 2024 usgs 2020 and within the current scenario global reserves are estimated to last for 300 400 years another estimation which is based on application of the median un population projection to the current level of per capita phosphate production rate states that the current reserves last until 2315 however if un high population estimate is applied the reserves would last until 2170 daneshgar et al 2018 phosphate rock reserves are mostly found in morocco which shares 77 of the global phosphate rock reserves and also china and the united states are some of the major phosphate producers in the world cordell et al 2009 uneven distribution of phosphorus among countries and global regions is another problem that may prevent equivalent distribution of phosphorus among countries for instance european union eu is under pressure of limited availability of phosphorus and high dependency on import so phosphate rock was classified as a critical raw material in 2014 by the european commission european commission 2014 concurrently the mined phosphorus follows a one directional resource flow from ores to water bodies annually out of the 21 4 mt of phosphorus in phosphate rock is mined and 6 3 3 2 mt of phosphorus enter water bodies and oceans or in less amount non agricultural soils and landfills whereas the remaining portion is used in agriculture and industrial applications cordell and white 2014 such excessive accumulation in addition to nitrogen loads causes eutrophication algal blooms loss of habitat loss in diversity and community structure as well as hypoxia are some of the major environmental consequences of eutrophication jessen et al 2015 significant economic losses are also observed due to eutrophication for instance harmful algal blooms caused negative impacts on commercial fisheries in maine s coastal regions us as 2 5 million economic loss in soft shell clam harvest and 460 000 in mussel harvests us epa 2015 in the baltic sea region the total economic losses due to eutrophication are estimated as 3 8 4 4 billion year helcom 2021 in the marine environment primary productivity is linked to availability of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and relies on the redfield ratio 106c 16n 1p redfield 1958 p limitation n limitation and co limitation can be observed in the marine environments due to seasonality and spatiality conley 1999 for controlling eutrophication control of nitrogen should be considered together with phosphorus control howarth and marino 2006 nutrient input reduction strategies such as stricter wastewater discharge limits and preventing agricultural runoff are commonly applied to control eutrophication however this sole strategy commonly fails herein in situ or ex situ engineering approaches are essentially needed as a follow up strategy to nutrient input reduction strategies to have a strict control on eutrophication it was suggested that nutrient related eutrophication problems can be fixed by development of novel pathways for biological fixation of nitrogen and recovery of phosphorus from the oceans or sediments de lorenzo 2017 in terms of phosphorus mining from the marine systems can be a promising way to control eutrophication and supply secondary sourced phosphorus to the market and thereby promoting the blue economy this review highlights the importance of phosphorus mining for promoting blue economy current global marine eutrophication problem and deep technical investigation of bio based efforts for phosphorus mining from marine environment possible strategies for technical improvements were also suggested and other key challenges were also addressed in this paper 1 1 the role of phosphorus mining in the blue economy in recent years sustainable exploitation of marine sources the so called blue economy has arisen as one of the major concepts to protect marine environment while maximizing economic benefits the blue economy sector in europe generated almost 750 billion turnover while representing over 5 million jobs in 2018 european commission 2020 the blue growth strategy established by the european commission aims to utilize europe s marine water potential for sustainable and inclusive growth as well as creating job opportunities european commission 2017 the focus areas of this strategy are blue energy aquaculture coastal and marine tourism and blue biotechnology european commission 2012 and successful implementation of these areas is highly dependent on ecological status of the marine waters moreover marine mineral resources including phosphorite deposits can be future supply for raw materials as extracted in environmentally friendly ways european commission 2019 so it can be concluded that efforts to promote phosphorus mining recovery from marine environment and to reduce eutrophication risk could the key elements to sustain blue economy that covers all the blue growth strategies 1 2 current eutrophication status in marine environments marine eutrophication is an emerging global problem that directly threatens ecological status of marine ecosystems and raises economic health and social concerns as well the nutrients transported to the seas were doubled in the 20th century from 34 to 64 tg n year and from 5 to 9 tg p year le moal et al 2019 up to date several parts of the world are facing marine eutrophication fig 1 1 marine eutrophication will possibly expand due to climate change increased population and higher intensity of industrial and agricultural activities rabalais et al 2009 major consequences of eutrophication include change in biomass production and composition of species toxic algal blooms decrease in water quality in terms of turbidity colour odour and dissolved oxygen smith et al 1999 cosme et al 2015 decrease of the dissolved oxygen levels is one of the major concerns in the marine environment high primary productivity results in release of many materials including different forms of phosphorus from the sediment which is triggers hypoxia anoxia further corell 1998 in recent decades the number of dead zones has expanded exponentially and now over 500 coastal ecosystems are affected altieri and diaz 2019 early measures for eutrophication were related to the reduction of inputs from municipal and industrial wastewater boesch 2019 however eutrophication could not be solved as expected this could be attributed to the continued release of internal loads from sediments delays in nutrient delivery from catchment areas change in climate or changes in ecosystem in regards to the food chain and invasive species boesch 2019 internal phosphorus release from sediment is especially problematic since the phosphorus cycle does not include a significant atmospheric component as nitrogen and cannot be fixed from the atmosphere paytan and mclaughin 2007 phosphorus can be retained in the sediments as the major sink through biological uptake adsorption on particle surfaces or authigenic carbonate fluorapatite formation faul et al 2005 fig 1 2 the reducing oxidizing conditions are one of the major factors that influence phosphorus dynamics under oxic conditions ferric iron and manganese are abundant in surface sediments that can bind major portions of phosphate paytan and mclaughin 2007 under anoxic conditions phosphorus can release through dissolution of p bound iron hydroxides and decomposition of organics küster heins et al 2010 sulphate reduction occurs under anoxic conditions and forms sulphide that reacts with fe2 ions in pore waters to form fes and fes2 this interaction results in maintaining orthophosphate in pore waters rozan et al 2002 the baltic sea is an example which still suffers from eutrophication due to internal phosphorus release in hypoxic conditions helcom 2014 similar problem was also seen in other marine systems such as the gulf of mexico adhikari et al 2015 and the maowei sea in the northern beibu gulf yang et al 2019 2 current efforts to mitigate eutrophication and phosphorus mining up to date several conventions were established and directions came into force to mitigate marine eutrophication in europe several countries established conventions such as the helcom baltic sea oslo and paris convention ospar west european coastal seas and barcelona convention medpol many directives and regulations came into force in the european union such as the eu water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec and marine strategy framework directive msfd 2008 56 ec and in the united states reacted with laws such as the clean water act and coastal zone management act apart from limiting phosphorus input to the receiving water bodies in situ engineering approaches have been also applied in pilot scales such as artificial oxygenation and adsorbent application artificial oxygenation is a geoengineering technology that aims to increase oxygen concentration in the deep water to increase redox potential in the water sediment and reduce the phosphorus release however this is not a permanent solution and phosphorus recovery is not possible following this strategy as well side effects of oxygenation on physical mixing circulation salinity temperature and stratification of the water body potentially raise additional environmental concerns conley et al 2009 adsorbent applications with metal oxides hydroxides i e fe al and la based are commonly used to lock phosphorus in the sediment to reduce internal phosphorus loading the major concern for this approach is the rerelease of locked p in the sediments as hypoxic conditions occur for instance fe and al based adsorbents are effective in oxic conditions but they may be released from sediment under anoxic conditions ross et al 2008 liu et al 2016 rather than sustaining excess phosphorus in the marine environments it is important to recover it and generate value hence technological applications that have low environmental risks and are cost effective should be developed and implemented to control and reduce the eutrophication problem while potentially even valorising the marine phosphorus currently a few pilot scale efforts exist such as mussel and seaweed farming other novel bio based strategies such as use of microorganisms microalgae and plants which do not have enough lab scale pilot scale applications yet could be also outstanding to achieve non eutrophic marine ecosystems coupled with phosphorus recovery the next section focuses on the above mentioned strategies and their potential applicability on marine environments 3 bio based approaches for phosphorus mining biological nutrient removal from wastewater has been thoroughly applied to reduce nutrient inputs to water bodies and prevent eutrophication hu et al 2012 biological approaches can be also applicable and effective for bioremediation of eutrophic waters and recovery of phosphorus with engineered systems using the natural mechanisms of living organisms 3 1 microbial phosphorus mining microorganisms have been manipulated since decades for various environmental remediation purposes such as wastewater and waste treatment and bioremediation of contaminated sites in case of phosphorus microorganisms such as phosphate accumulators and phosphate solubilizers can be exploited for removal and recovery purposes from the marine environment 3 1 1 learning from wastewater phosphorus accumulating microorganisms phosphorus accumulating organisms paos are very well known microorganisms that are used to treat wastewater for phosphorus removal to achieve strict discharge limits the biological phosphorus removal process is called enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and has been widely used in treatment of various kinds of wastewater in an inexpensive and sustainable way oehmen et al 2007 this process relies on the biochemical mechanisms of paos in different oxygen conditions fig 3 1 in anaerobic conditions paos rapidly use organic carbon sources i e volatile fatty acids vfa and synthesize poly hydroxyalkanoates pha via hydrolysis of stored polyp as the energy source after hydrolysis of polyp orthophosphate is released to the environment consecutively in aerobic stage paos use oxygen as the electron acceptor and pha which was stored in the cells during the anaerobic phase are degraded for cell growth and resynthesis of poly p by assimilating orthophosphate from the environment seviour et al 2003 tarayre et al 2016 by this mechanism phosphorus could be stored in the cells the accumulated phosphorus in sludge can be used as directly as fertilizer or can be further processed to recover phosphorus such as struvite melia et al 2017 candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis is the most well studied polyphosphate accumulating organism the other common paos are β proteobacteria acinetobacter δ proteobacteria dechloromonas β proteobacteria and actinobacteria izadi et al 2020 in recent years denitrifying and or sulphur associated paos were also discovered adapting the phosphorus release removal mechanism used in wwtp operations for the phosphorus rich eutrophic marine water system could be worth investigating these technologies can include the use of active phosphate accumulating microorganisms in situ operations as well as the use of engineered ex situ reactors adding organic carbon source such as vfas externally to stimulate phosphorus capture from the marine environment there is no application for the marine environment so far focusing paos there is one study in literature considering the use of microorganisms including phosphate accumulating organisms for in situ treatment of eutrophic lake water table 3 1 chai et al 2017 applied an ecosystem activation system eas which was based pumping polluted water into the system and use of microorganisms nitrobacterium denitrifiers cod decomposers and paos through anoxic and aerobic conditions and releasing effluent water including active microorganisms for restoration of water ecosystem this system provided 53 5 of tp removal initial concentration of 0 2 0 3 mg l 77 7 cod removal and 53 2 tn removal microbial diversity also increased 2 5 fold and the dominant eutrophic microorganisms were reduced in case of phosphorus the eas system increased the relative abundances of the key phosphorus accumulating microorganisms acinetobacter arcicella and limnohabitans after 30 days of treatment this study could be important in terms of giving insight into the application of active paos in eutrophic water treatment the applicability can be also tested for eutrophic marine waters which have quite different water and ecosystem dynamics than lake waters the effect of treatment on the microbial community should be monitored in long term after treatment to ensure that the treatment is efficient and long lasting 3 1 2 learning from soil applications and mining phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms psms can be another outstanding candidate for phosphorus recovery from marine sediments psms play a vital role for phosphorus cycling especially in soil as well as intertidal waters estuaries and deep seas bacillus pseudomonas aspergillus penicillium trichoderma and rhizoctonia are some of the examples for psms prabhu et al 2019 one of the major mechanisms for phosphorus solubilization is organic acids production that can decrease ph enhance chelation of the cations ca fe al which are bounded to phosphorus compete with phosphorous for adsorption sites and can form soluble complexes with phosphorus bounded metal sharma et al 2013 some of the organic acids produced by psms are gluconic acid oxalic acid tartaric acid and lactic acid billah et al 2019 inorganic acid production proton extrusion and exopolysaccharide eps production prabhu et al 2019 as well as releasing phosphorus solubilizing enzymes i e phosphomonoesterases phytases and phosphonatases and c p lyases are the other mechanisms for phosphorus solubilization alori et al 2017 bioleaching microorganisms could be also utilized for a green recovery opportunity for the marine sediment bioleaching can be defined as the mobilization of metal cations through a biological oxidation and complexation process rohwerder et al 2003 most widely used microorganisms for bioleaching applications acidithiobacillus and leptosprillium which can oxidize iron and or sulfur these microorganisms do not also require additional carbon source since they use co2 as the carbon source the mechanisms involved in bioleaching are direct bioleaching and indirect bioleaching direct bioleaching relies on the direct contact of bacteria with metallic sulfide and oxidation of metallic sulfide into soluble metal sulfate and indirect bioleaching oxidation of the elemental sulfur reduced sulfur compounds into sulfuric acid which results in lower ph pathak et al 2009 for phosphorus solubilization the indirect mechanism are much relevant in case of psms very few researches investigated the phosphorus solubilization capacity of marine sediment microbiome john and salim 2020 investigated the sediment microbiome from arabian sea for its potential on plant growth promoting capacities including phosphate solubilization potassium solubilization and nitrogen fixation they found out that 19 strains out of 26 isolates had phosphate solubilization capacity in another study phosphate solubilizing halophilic bacteria isolated from eastern coast of china were tested for their phosphate solubilization potential for the soil applications zhu et al 2011 de et al 2012 also showed a positive relationship between phosphatase activity and phosphorus releasing bacteria in the sediment from hooghly estuary these studies highlighted the capacity of marine microbiome for the phosphorus release at this point the use of native sediment marine microbiome for the phosphorus mining from the sediment could be investigated for their phosphorus release mechanisms and capacities furthermore other psms isolated from soil can be also tested for its phosphorus release capacities from the marine sediment for instance kim et al 2005 investigated biological phosphorus removal from contaminated river sediment by soil isolated burkaholderia glathei highest phosphorus solubilization was achieved under anoxic environment as 34 5 of the total phosphorus with glucose 8 g l and sucrose 2 g l addition as the carbon source as well as addition of arginine 0 1 g l as the nitrogen source this study showed the outstanding potential of psm for phosphorus release from the river sediment and similar studies should be investigated for phosphorus rich marine sediments as well one of the main limitations for these operations could be the use of synthetic carbon source which is costly however the use of waste derived carbon sources would reduce the cost of the total process bioleaching bacteria have not been studied for phosphorus release for the marine sediment yet but there are applications for heavy metal release guven and akinci 2013 however there are various researches related to phosphorus release from sludge as a recent example pradhan et al 2021 investigated phosphorus leaching from sewage sludge with acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and 92 of the phosphorus released after a 3 stage experiment for 63 days phase 1 90 ml growing media 10 ml sewage sludge addition phase 2 10 ml sample removal 10 ml sewage sludge addition phase 3 elemental sulfur addition 10 g l they also observed trace metal release after the bioleaching treatment considering the characteristics of sewage sludge and the marine sediment it can be said that the phosphorus fractions i e inorganic and organic and phosphorus content may not be similar however similar investigations can be done to question the feasibility of bioleaching for phosphorus recovery from marine sediment moreover multirecovery strategies for phosphorus and metals with bioleaching are possible so that bioleaching can provide a holistic solution for the phosphorus and metal rich marine sediments 3 2 algal phosphorus mining algae are also capable of phosphorus uptake from water providing a sustainable option for eutrophic marine water treatment and phosphorus recovery in this respect algae based off shore phosphorus recovery systems could be developed with respect to future phosphorus scarcity another option could be harvesting algal biomass developed through blooms from eutrophic water systems to help in cutting off eutrophication loop pandhal et al 2017 algal phosphorus mining also provides valorisation of the algae biomass as a raw material in biorefinery due to its capacity to produce various ranges of products triverdi et al 2015 fuel products bioethanol biodiesel biogas and biohydrogen callegari et al 2019 high value products such as biopharmaceuticals biocosmetics bionutrients biochemicals budzianowski 2017 as well as biochar bolognesi et al 2022 can be produced through algae biomass 3 2 1 macroalgae farming for phosphorus mining macroalgae seaweed has been consumed mainly for centuries as a food source the worth of global seaweed industry is more than usd 6 billion per year with a production of more than 12 million tonnes per year fao 2018 in case of eutrophication seaweed can remove excess nutrients from the marine environment lower the effects of ocean acidification capture carbon and deoxygenate the water by increasing ph and oxygen levels duarte et al 2017 seaweed aquaculture can also contribute to lowering agricultural emissions if the harvested biomass is substituted for synthetic fertilizers duarte et al 2017 he et al 2008 investigated the bioremediation capacity of porphyra yezoensis along the lusi coast china and found out that both n and p reduction nh4 n 50 94 no2 n 42 91 no3 n 21 38 po4 p 42 67 was achieved when compared to control area 300 ha cultivation provided 14 708 5 kg n and 2373 kg p in the tissue of the macroalgae and this strategy reduced excess nutrients in the eutrophic coast in another study jiang et al 2019a the effect of saccharina japonica farming was investigated for highly eutrophicated xiangshan bay of east china between 2008 and 2015 it was observed that seaweed farming elevated oxygen levels and ph and reduced nutrient levels 297 t of n and 42 t of p annually it was also observed that suspended solids were also reduced and number of phytoplankton species increased integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta strategies are also stated as important in terms of sustainable aquaculture and bioremediation potential yang et al 2015 for instance huo et al 2012 found out that co cultivation of gracilaria verrucosa with the fish pseudosciaena crocea at xiangshan harbor in the east china sea resulted in maximum treatment efficiency for po4 p no2 n nh4 n and no3 n was achieved as 58 48 61 and 47 respectively although macroalgae farming is quite effective for treating eutrophic waters some environmental and economic concerns can be challenging it is stated that benthic communities i e seagrass meadows can be affected negatively by seaweed farms due to shading and trampling moreno et al 2021 in terms of economics hasselström et al 2020 investigated the economic potential of farming of saccharina latissimi and showed that large scale farming can provide high sequestration of annual anthropogenic nitrogen 8 and phosphorus 60 inputs however this strategy was not cost efficient for nutrient removal itself herein the valorization of macroalgae can be an outstanding strategy to perform the farming process in a cost effective way 3 2 2 microalgae exploitation for phosphorus mining phosphorus plays a key role for the growth and metabolism of microalgae as h2po4 hpo4 2 is incorporated into organic compounds through phosphorylation cai et al 2013 microalgae cyanobacteria are also able to store phosphorus in their cells as polyp fig 3 2 microalgae have been studied for treatment of various wastewaters such as municipal livestock wastes industrial wastes and agro industrial wastes abdel rouf et al 2012 there is one study found in literature that focused on treatment of eutrophic marine sediment table 3 1 kwon et al 2015 applied an in situ phytoremediation strategy for eutrophic coastal sediments in masan bay south korea with nitzschia sp and a light emitting diode red led 650 nm the results showed that chlorophyll a concentration doubled and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip was removed by 19 and 24 respectively which was attributed to enhanced aerobic bacterial activity of nutrient uptake by nitzschia sp in this study it was also stated that oxygen levels in the bottom water improved up to 8 mg l although the results of the study are promising the change in microbial community in the sediments as well as response of other living organisms should be also investigated after phytoremediation as being an in situ application the harvesting of microalgae was not considered in this study and also mining of phosphorus was not applicable 3 3 microalgae bacteria coupled approach for phosphorus mining use of microalgae and paos together microbial aggregates can also be another option for phosphorus removal and recovery xu et al 2020 in this interaction phosphorus removal can be achieved through both extracellular entrapment with exopolysaccharides and intracellular entrapment through formation of polyphosphate polyp xu et al 2020 it is stated that algal bacterial systems have more promising performance than treatment by individual algae or bacteria perera et al 2019 as a recent example for eutrophic fresh water treatment cost effective a lab scale photo microbial nutrient recovery cell pnrc was developed as a novel approach for nutrient removal from eutrophic water jiang et al 2019b table 3 1 in this study pnrc provided self generated electric field that forces nutrient ions to migrate and recovery of nutrients as microalgae biomass chlorella vulgaris high nitrate removal was found to be due to the abundant denitrifying bacteria thauera paracoccus stappia and azoarcus ammonia removal due to microalgae 69 3 and nitrification 22 5 as well as phosphorus removal 92 as mainly attributed to microalgae the net energy gain from this system amounted to 7 705 kwh m3 energy gain from conventional nitrification denitrification treatment is 0 138 7 705 kwh m3 this study looks promising for treatment of eutrophic water future research should also include eutrophic marine water treatment as well as phosphorus recovery options with this strategy 3 4 wetland systems for phosphorus mining treatment wetlands in brackish and saltwater environments could also be designed and operated to accommodate the additional goal of phosphorus mining in the context of application within maritime estuaries and lagoons treatment of wetland systems are mostly designed as free surface flow fsw wetlands furthermore floating treatment wetlands ftws are a relatively new development with a high increase in research activities and some applications over the last years in general phosphorus removal in wetland systems occurs mainly through matrix adsorption with limited adsorption sites and plant uptake whereas plants also have to be harvested to remove the plant stored phosphorus from the ecosystem yousaf et al 2021 3 4 1 free water surface flow wetlands langergraber et al 2020 distinguished saline or saltwater wetland systems treating water with salinity similar to seawater 30 and brackish systems which treat water with higher salinity than freshwater i e between 5 and 20 the authors also described the effects of the salinity which potentially depresses the organic biodegradation rates and also phosphorus sorption may decrease with increasing salinity crain 2007 found that nutrient limitation of brackish estuarine marshes in maine was dependent on the salinity gradient in the estuary whereas salt and brackish marsh vegetation was nitrogen limited and oligohaline lower salinity of 0 0 5 and the marsh vegetation showed a co limitation of both nitrogen and phosphorus plant tissue analysis in high salinity areas with high nitrogen concentration indicated that nitrogen also aids to the salinity tolerance of the occurring plants yang and chen 2012 investigated five saline fws wetland systems planted with mangrove avicennia marina mainly with a total area of 52 ha which were placed around the dapong bay brackish coastal lagoon taiwan to prevent eutrophication provide flood protection as well as provide a space for eco tourism and knowledge dissemination after pre treatment of sedimentation ponds and gravel filtration beds the five wetlands received 42 630 m3 of water per day and were operated for over 14 years showing removal rates of bod ss tn and tp in the ranges 16 68 14 76 35 82 and 10 87 respectively tp sorption naturally decreased over time due to the limited sorption sites available in the systems hence the authors suggested a periodic exchange of substrate as well as thinning of mangroves among the few reports on saline or brackish cw systems a lab scale experiment by sousa et al 2011 investigated pilot scale vertical flow vf cw systems for mariculture effluent treatment the systems were either planted with the macrophyte spartina alterniflora or unplanted and resulted in reductions of 89 and 71 for inorganic solids 82 and 96 for organic solids 51 and 63 for tn 82 and 92 for nh4 n 64 and 59 for po4 p and 81 and 89 for turbidity respectively planted systems showed a tendency for higher denitrification and unplanted systems had higher oxygen levels and ph improving the mineralization of organic matter and nitrification the reasons of higher observed orthophosphate removal in planted cw systems besides assimilation by s alterniflora could therefore be anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as denitrifying bacteria which can play an important role in the cycle of phosphorus barak et al 2003 sundareshwar et al 2003 and could have absorbed substantial amounts of orthophosphate 3 4 2 floating treatment wetlands research and applications of floating treatment wetlands ftws increased rapidly over the last decade colares et al 2020 the systems consist of emergent aquatic macrophytes growing on a floating platform possibly made from various reused materials whereas the roots are submerged in the water the suspended rhizosphere of the plants provides relatively large surface areas for biofilm growth enabling water treatment functions through filtration of suspended particles and biochemical treatment of nutrients and pollutants cross et al 2021 the majority of ftw research has been conducted in lab scale and by constructing or using existing pond or basin structures with an inlet and outlet and containing the ftws which would only allow for ex situ e g at the coast p recovery in a coastal marine context however there are also a few experiences of systems placed in situ in the environment for example in a very recent publication karstens et al 2021 presented results for ftws actually built in a lagoon of the southern baltic sea to investigate the challenges in such coastal environments from the used native macrophytes phosphorus concentrations after harvesting were highest in lythrum salicaria up to 1 g kg in the dry mass additional observations showed that birds did not use the ftws as breeding grounds but grey herons used them for foraging and a large number of endangered eels found shelter in the diverse and large root network indicating an additional positive effect in terms of habitat and biodiversity ecosystem services di luca et al 2019 investigated nitrogen and phosphorus removal in ftw systems with controls no ftw and biological control with ftw but no nutrients in inflow and found 10 4 and 8 8 times higher removal for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively in systems with ftws with removal rates were 70 80 of the inflowing phosphorus inflow of 5 mg p l the same study also found that phosphorus concentrations in the sediment were higher in the control systems without ftws and that phosphorus accumulated significantly higher in the roots and rhizomes than in the aerial parts of the used typha domingensis which would be a disadvantage for phosphorus removal through above ground harvesting of plants which depends on the translocation of the nutrients to the aerial parts and the properties of the plants 3 5 mussel farming for phosphorus mining mussel farming is another bio based strategy that is relatively simple flexible and potentially cost effective while providing an efficient recirculation of nutrients from sea to land by removing nutrients from eutrophic waters gren et al 2009 kotta et al 2020 mussels can filter seawater and trap nutrients so as they are harvested they can be further used as animal or human food biomolecules bioenergy or as a soil amendment to promote circularity of phosphorus stadmark and conley 2011 kotta et al 2020 estimated nutrient removal in three mussel farms located in the outer central and inner baltic sea nutrient removal was found as the highest at the central baltic farm sankt anna 23 3 g n m and 1 8 g p m line ant the nutrient removal costs were the lowest at the central baltic farm with 76 kg n the costs were quite higher at the two other farms due to lower nutrient accumulating capacity gren et al 2009 showed that marginal cost of mussel farming in the baltic sea to clean nutrients were found lower than other nutrient abatement options i e reducing nutrient inputs from agriculture sewage treatment plants however the costs were found as highly dependent on mussel growth sale strategy and nutrient load targets although mussel farming looks promising for removing nutrients environmental concerns are also questionable lee et al 2016 showed that organic pollutants produced from a mussel farm caused hypoxia in both sediment and bottom water in the northwest area of the gamak bay south korea it was also stated that the long term effects of mussel farming might be negative so repeated measures should be taken into account considering its frequency and extent dense or large scale blue mussel farms in the baltic sea are stated to have negative effect on the local environment such as organic matter and nutrient accumulation oxygen deficiency and plankton blooms at this point more field studies and ecosystem modelling were suggested for large scale applications hedberg et al 2018 4 key technical gaps and future strategies the current research for the above mentioned strategies for phosphorus mining from marine environments is summarized in table 3 1 the research mainly focuses on purification strategies to reduce phosphorus concentrations in the water bodies not all of them concern marine water and most of the studies achieved relatively higher purification efficiencies however neither phosphorus recovery pathways as follow up strategy nor the wholistic use of all components nor the accounting of additional long term benefits of restorative systems has been studied yet mussel farming and macroalgae farming are the more commonly applied strategies for the eutrophic marine water treatment when compared to other strategies nutrient accumulation capacities for seaweed and mussel farming were well established in the literature the main limitation for these strategies is the need for using local species regarding the characteristics of the species as well as the local environmental conditions the efficiency environmental effects and construction and operational costs can vary furthermore these strategies mainly do not consider the recovery of phosphorus from the biomass which should be investigated deeply in addition most of these studies were based on pilot scale applications and they should be tested in larger application areas to test the feasibility there is a huge research gap for the real scale applicability of microorganisms microalgae plants for phosphorus mining as most of the research is still in lab scale in regards to eutrophic water treatment applicability for exploitation of microorganisms and microalgae for phosphorus removal and recovery should be tested initially in lab scale experiments to develop novel strategies the investigations can include the design of ex situ bioreactors and optimization of operational parameters i e organic carbon temperature ph and retention time a later step can include pilot scale testing and a comprehensive environmental and economic assessment of ex situ operations wetland systems can also be tested in small scale to treat eutrophic marine waters by mimicking natural environments for selecting the most promising species that can survive local conditions i e salinity temperature sunlight and show high nutrient removal capacities moreover wholistic utilization pathways for all parts of the biomass and recovery of phosphorus in the harvested biomass can also be taken into account in future applications the following sections give some insights of novel future strategies to go beyond the status quo 4 1 possible microorganism exploitation pathways the many capabilities of microorganisms can be a key to open innovative ways in this field the use of engineered phosphate accumulators was suggested as key microbial process for the recovery of phosphorus in the marine water and sediments de lorenzo 2017 in case if paos possible strategies can both focus on eutrophic seawater as well as phosphorus rich sediment that serves as a phosphorus source under anoxic conditions ex situ bioreactor operation for eutrophic seawater treatment can be applied under anaerobic and or aerobic conditions with seawater adapted ebpr sludge or a marine sediment microbiome there are some studies concerning saline wastewater treatment with seawater adapted ebpr sludge he et al 2020 de graaf et al 2020 and current knowledge can be further developed for treatment of eutrophic waters for this strategy removal mechanisms at lower phosphorus concentrations when compared to domestic wastewaters should be well investigated the effect of operational conditions including addition of organic carbon as well as regulation of salinity level ph and temperature should be studied marine sediment microbiomes which are already adapted to the marine environment can also be tested for the phosphorus removal and recovery capacity in this strategy the microbial community and possible phosphorus removing and or accumulating strains should be well known to develop an effective strategy apart from eutrophic seawater phosphorus can be removed and recovered from the marine sediment as well internal loading of phosphorus from the anoxic marine sediments are the main key driver for boosting eutrophication and treatment of sediment can utterly solve phosphorus release from the sediments under oxygen free conditions see section 2 1 phosphorus can be released to the water column due to fes and fes2 formation that prevents formation of fe bounded phosphate and releases phosphate to the water column furthermore paos in the sediments can also release accumulated phosphate from their cells under oxygen free conditions hence anaerobic fermentation of the marine sediment in ex situ bioreactors can cause release of phosphorus from the sediment to the water column however at this point the biological phosphorus release mechanisms should be well studied with microbial community analysis for instance in case of the baltic sea the microbial community varies in estuary sediments and the open sea iron sulphur reducing bacteria were found to be common in estuary sediments which are rich in iron bound phosphorus on the other hand in the open sea sediment which is rich on labile organic phosphorus sulphate reducing bacteria were found to be common sinkko et al 2011 therefore detailed characterization of microbial community and the abundance of chemical forms of phosphorus can help to design an effective phosphorus recovery system from marine sediments apart from paos phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms can also trigger phosphorus release from the sediment bioaugmentation with the phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms would lead to improved phosphorus release efficiencies these microbial strategies should also include a recovery step to capture phosphorus from the water column via biological bio sludge chemical struvite vivianite etc or physical adsorption pathways the main limitation for focusing on the phosphorus rich sediment with ex situ applications are the environmental impacts of sediment dredging main concerns related to sediment dredging application are resuspension of particulate matter including nutrients heavy metals and emerging contaminants during dredging operations the change in seabed surface and formation of dredging plumes are further possible risks of dredging operations manap and voilvais 2015 however eco friendly dredging technologies can help to reduce negative effects of sediment dredging 4 2 coupling phosphorus mining with other valorisation pathways marine environment can also be rich in several metals and rare elements a holistic approach aiming at multi valorisation of the marine sediment and deep seawater can make the whole process more profitable for instance a bioleaching strategy can be applied for marine sediment in ex situ bioreactors to release both phosphorus and metals followed by a sequential recovery system to separate elements from each other ion exchange sequential precipitation nano filtration and a liquid liquid extraction process can be applied for separation of phosphorus from metals semerci et al 2019 selective adsorption of metals and phosphorus with modified substrates could be another notable option these approaches can also be applicable for eutrophic and metal rich seawater beneficial use of the treated sediment such as building materials as plant growing soil mymrin et al 2017 kim et al 2020 or as an alternative to soil based materials cevikbilen et al 2020 could be also considered to achieve a beneficial remediation and recovery system harvested biomass plants algae and mussels can also be used in a multi recovery strategy for a variety of products harvested biomass can be applied directly as fertilizer due to the high nutrient content or harvested biomass can firstly be valorised for conversion to commodities then as fuel products biogas biohydrogen bio jet fuels biodiesel etc and residual biomass can still be used as fertilizer the scenarios can include extraction of valuable bioproducts such as pigments polysaccharides fatty acids vitamins proteins or similar co2 sequestration for bio oil production could be also a promising method with using microalgae biomass coupled with bioelectrochemical systems bolognesi et al 2022 although harvesting biomass provides various end product options the cost of the processing is still challenging at that point low energy consuming technologies i e harvesting should be developed future studies should also include the assessment of different scenarios to find out the optimized valorisation pathways for the biomass considering economic and environmental issues 5 environmental economic and social key challanges phosphorus mining from secondary sources such as waste streams and natural polluted environments can be considered as promising sources to sustain enough phosphorus for the agricultural and industrial demand in the future the progress for phosphorus recovery from wastewater streams has accelerated in the recent years due to increasing public attention on sustainability and circularity and being in the eu s critical raw material list jupp et al 2021 however challenges such as social acceptance economic feasibility policies and regulations as well as interaction between stakeholders and institutions represent still main barriers crispim et al 2019 considering phosphorus recovery from marine environments the challenges are plentiful due to lack of technical applications as well as economic and environmental assessments societal challenges and current legislations are the other key challenges to be addressed phosphorus mining from the marine environment can be beneficial to provide phosphorus for human use and reducing eutrophication risks however both short term and long term environmental risks including emissions to air water and soil as well as the ecosystem responses should be well addressed prior to applications especially the effect of capturing phosphorus from the marine environment will obviously change existing n p ratios in the marine application areas that would lead to shifts in the marine ecosystem it is stated that n and p deficiencies have an effect on the structure and biochemical composition of the microbial communities berdalet et al 1996 change in microbial community through different nutrient concentrations and n p ratios have been studied by several authors via batch experiments hauss et al 2012 ferreira et al 2020 in order to figure out the response of marine microbial communities similar studies should be investigated thoroughly to observe the effect of in situ phosphorus mining operations furthermore the response of other members of the marine ecosystem such as fish seagrass meadows should be considered since phosphorus mining strategies have a direct impact on the marine ecosystem the understanding of the response of the marine ecosystem is a crucial step economic challenges can include the cost of the removal and recovery process low market price of the phosphorus and problems related to commercialization of the recovered phosphorus the market value of the recovered product can change depending on the final version of the phosphorus i e struvite vivianite or fertilizer as biomass hence a detailed techno economical assessment should be required to follow up a cost effective strategy societal challenges can be faced due to tentativeness of stakeholders i e farmers area developers to use recovered phosphorus in field applications and social acceptance of restoration activities in the marine environment at this point communication strategies should be well developed to increase the public awareness on the need for phosphorus recovery and restoration stakeholders should also be well informed and encouraged to collaborate and use recovered phosphorus political interest on recovered phosphorus and the blue economy adapting regulations on the phosphorus mining from natural marine environment as well as promoting and preparing guidelines could also help to spread the phosphorus recovery practices from the marine environment 6 conclusion excess phosphorus in the marine environment could be the key for future phosphorus supply the use of in situ or ex situ engineering phosphorus mining approaches via living organisms microorganisms algae plants mussels etc could provide effective strategies as soon as the mentioned research gaps are filled the microbial phosphorus recovery approach focusing on phosphorus recovery from the marine sediment could be the most favourable solution to the internal phosphorus release problem from anoxic sediments phosphorus recovery from marine water and sediment coupled with other valorisation pathways of e g harvested biomass represent a key step for future management of phosphorus rich marine environment as soon as the technical environmental economic and societal challenges are well addressed and solved the phosphorus strategy mine to fork can be adapted to marine to fork hopefully in the near future

15881,global phosphorus reserves are under pressure of depletion in the near future due to increased consumption of primary phosphorus reservoirs and improper management of phosphorus at the same time a considerable portion of global marine water bodies has been suffering from eutrophication due to excessive nutrient loading the marine environment can be considered as a valuable phosphorus source due to nutrient rich eutrophic seawater and sediment which could potentially serve as phosphorus mines in the near future hence sustainable phosphorus recovery strategies should be adapted for marine systems to provide phosphorus for the growing market demand and simultaneously control eutrophication in this review possible sustainable strategies for phosphorus removal and recovery from marine environments are discussed in detail bio based strategies relying on natural phosphorus uptake release metabolism of living organisms are suggested as promising options that can provide both phosphorus removal and recovery from marine waters for achieving a sustainable marine ecosystem among them the utilization of microorganisms seems promising to develop novel strategies however the research gap for the technical applicability of these strategies is still considerably big therefore future research should focus on the technical development of the strategies through laboratory and or field studies coupling phosphorus mining with other valorisation pathways i e metal recovery energy production is also suggested to improve overall sustainability and economic viability environmental economic and societal challenges should altogether be well addressed prior to real scale applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords marine phosphorus eutrophication resource recovery blue economy 1 introduction phosphorus p is a basis for life on earth and an essential raw material for human development in terms of fertilizer production as well as industrial applications such as production of food detergents and steel phosphate rocks have been exploited for these purposes since the middle of the 19th century smil 2000 and global phosphate demand has been increasing each year due to increased population growth the global phosphate consumption is expected to increase to 49 million tonnes in 2024 usgs 2020 and within the current scenario global reserves are estimated to last for 300 400 years another estimation which is based on application of the median un population projection to the current level of per capita phosphate production rate states that the current reserves last until 2315 however if un high population estimate is applied the reserves would last until 2170 daneshgar et al 2018 phosphate rock reserves are mostly found in morocco which shares 77 of the global phosphate rock reserves and also china and the united states are some of the major phosphate producers in the world cordell et al 2009 uneven distribution of phosphorus among countries and global regions is another problem that may prevent equivalent distribution of phosphorus among countries for instance european union eu is under pressure of limited availability of phosphorus and high dependency on import so phosphate rock was classified as a critical raw material in 2014 by the european commission european commission 2014 concurrently the mined phosphorus follows a one directional resource flow from ores to water bodies annually out of the 21 4 mt of phosphorus in phosphate rock is mined and 6 3 3 2 mt of phosphorus enter water bodies and oceans or in less amount non agricultural soils and landfills whereas the remaining portion is used in agriculture and industrial applications cordell and white 2014 such excessive accumulation in addition to nitrogen loads causes eutrophication algal blooms loss of habitat loss in diversity and community structure as well as hypoxia are some of the major environmental consequences of eutrophication jessen et al 2015 significant economic losses are also observed due to eutrophication for instance harmful algal blooms caused negative impacts on commercial fisheries in maine s coastal regions us as 2 5 million economic loss in soft shell clam harvest and 460 000 in mussel harvests us epa 2015 in the baltic sea region the total economic losses due to eutrophication are estimated as 3 8 4 4 billion year helcom 2021 in the marine environment primary productivity is linked to availability of carbon nitrogen and phosphorus and relies on the redfield ratio 106c 16n 1p redfield 1958 p limitation n limitation and co limitation can be observed in the marine environments due to seasonality and spatiality conley 1999 for controlling eutrophication control of nitrogen should be considered together with phosphorus control howarth and marino 2006 nutrient input reduction strategies such as stricter wastewater discharge limits and preventing agricultural runoff are commonly applied to control eutrophication however this sole strategy commonly fails herein in situ or ex situ engineering approaches are essentially needed as a follow up strategy to nutrient input reduction strategies to have a strict control on eutrophication it was suggested that nutrient related eutrophication problems can be fixed by development of novel pathways for biological fixation of nitrogen and recovery of phosphorus from the oceans or sediments de lorenzo 2017 in terms of phosphorus mining from the marine systems can be a promising way to control eutrophication and supply secondary sourced phosphorus to the market and thereby promoting the blue economy this review highlights the importance of phosphorus mining for promoting blue economy current global marine eutrophication problem and deep technical investigation of bio based efforts for phosphorus mining from marine environment possible strategies for technical improvements were also suggested and other key challenges were also addressed in this paper 1 1 the role of phosphorus mining in the blue economy in recent years sustainable exploitation of marine sources the so called blue economy has arisen as one of the major concepts to protect marine environment while maximizing economic benefits the blue economy sector in europe generated almost 750 billion turnover while representing over 5 million jobs in 2018 european commission 2020 the blue growth strategy established by the european commission aims to utilize europe s marine water potential for sustainable and inclusive growth as well as creating job opportunities european commission 2017 the focus areas of this strategy are blue energy aquaculture coastal and marine tourism and blue biotechnology european commission 2012 and successful implementation of these areas is highly dependent on ecological status of the marine waters moreover marine mineral resources including phosphorite deposits can be future supply for raw materials as extracted in environmentally friendly ways european commission 2019 so it can be concluded that efforts to promote phosphorus mining recovery from marine environment and to reduce eutrophication risk could the key elements to sustain blue economy that covers all the blue growth strategies 1 2 current eutrophication status in marine environments marine eutrophication is an emerging global problem that directly threatens ecological status of marine ecosystems and raises economic health and social concerns as well the nutrients transported to the seas were doubled in the 20th century from 34 to 64 tg n year and from 5 to 9 tg p year le moal et al 2019 up to date several parts of the world are facing marine eutrophication fig 1 1 marine eutrophication will possibly expand due to climate change increased population and higher intensity of industrial and agricultural activities rabalais et al 2009 major consequences of eutrophication include change in biomass production and composition of species toxic algal blooms decrease in water quality in terms of turbidity colour odour and dissolved oxygen smith et al 1999 cosme et al 2015 decrease of the dissolved oxygen levels is one of the major concerns in the marine environment high primary productivity results in release of many materials including different forms of phosphorus from the sediment which is triggers hypoxia anoxia further corell 1998 in recent decades the number of dead zones has expanded exponentially and now over 500 coastal ecosystems are affected altieri and diaz 2019 early measures for eutrophication were related to the reduction of inputs from municipal and industrial wastewater boesch 2019 however eutrophication could not be solved as expected this could be attributed to the continued release of internal loads from sediments delays in nutrient delivery from catchment areas change in climate or changes in ecosystem in regards to the food chain and invasive species boesch 2019 internal phosphorus release from sediment is especially problematic since the phosphorus cycle does not include a significant atmospheric component as nitrogen and cannot be fixed from the atmosphere paytan and mclaughin 2007 phosphorus can be retained in the sediments as the major sink through biological uptake adsorption on particle surfaces or authigenic carbonate fluorapatite formation faul et al 2005 fig 1 2 the reducing oxidizing conditions are one of the major factors that influence phosphorus dynamics under oxic conditions ferric iron and manganese are abundant in surface sediments that can bind major portions of phosphate paytan and mclaughin 2007 under anoxic conditions phosphorus can release through dissolution of p bound iron hydroxides and decomposition of organics küster heins et al 2010 sulphate reduction occurs under anoxic conditions and forms sulphide that reacts with fe2 ions in pore waters to form fes and fes2 this interaction results in maintaining orthophosphate in pore waters rozan et al 2002 the baltic sea is an example which still suffers from eutrophication due to internal phosphorus release in hypoxic conditions helcom 2014 similar problem was also seen in other marine systems such as the gulf of mexico adhikari et al 2015 and the maowei sea in the northern beibu gulf yang et al 2019 2 current efforts to mitigate eutrophication and phosphorus mining up to date several conventions were established and directions came into force to mitigate marine eutrophication in europe several countries established conventions such as the helcom baltic sea oslo and paris convention ospar west european coastal seas and barcelona convention medpol many directives and regulations came into force in the european union such as the eu water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec and marine strategy framework directive msfd 2008 56 ec and in the united states reacted with laws such as the clean water act and coastal zone management act apart from limiting phosphorus input to the receiving water bodies in situ engineering approaches have been also applied in pilot scales such as artificial oxygenation and adsorbent application artificial oxygenation is a geoengineering technology that aims to increase oxygen concentration in the deep water to increase redox potential in the water sediment and reduce the phosphorus release however this is not a permanent solution and phosphorus recovery is not possible following this strategy as well side effects of oxygenation on physical mixing circulation salinity temperature and stratification of the water body potentially raise additional environmental concerns conley et al 2009 adsorbent applications with metal oxides hydroxides i e fe al and la based are commonly used to lock phosphorus in the sediment to reduce internal phosphorus loading the major concern for this approach is the rerelease of locked p in the sediments as hypoxic conditions occur for instance fe and al based adsorbents are effective in oxic conditions but they may be released from sediment under anoxic conditions ross et al 2008 liu et al 2016 rather than sustaining excess phosphorus in the marine environments it is important to recover it and generate value hence technological applications that have low environmental risks and are cost effective should be developed and implemented to control and reduce the eutrophication problem while potentially even valorising the marine phosphorus currently a few pilot scale efforts exist such as mussel and seaweed farming other novel bio based strategies such as use of microorganisms microalgae and plants which do not have enough lab scale pilot scale applications yet could be also outstanding to achieve non eutrophic marine ecosystems coupled with phosphorus recovery the next section focuses on the above mentioned strategies and their potential applicability on marine environments 3 bio based approaches for phosphorus mining biological nutrient removal from wastewater has been thoroughly applied to reduce nutrient inputs to water bodies and prevent eutrophication hu et al 2012 biological approaches can be also applicable and effective for bioremediation of eutrophic waters and recovery of phosphorus with engineered systems using the natural mechanisms of living organisms 3 1 microbial phosphorus mining microorganisms have been manipulated since decades for various environmental remediation purposes such as wastewater and waste treatment and bioremediation of contaminated sites in case of phosphorus microorganisms such as phosphate accumulators and phosphate solubilizers can be exploited for removal and recovery purposes from the marine environment 3 1 1 learning from wastewater phosphorus accumulating microorganisms phosphorus accumulating organisms paos are very well known microorganisms that are used to treat wastewater for phosphorus removal to achieve strict discharge limits the biological phosphorus removal process is called enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and has been widely used in treatment of various kinds of wastewater in an inexpensive and sustainable way oehmen et al 2007 this process relies on the biochemical mechanisms of paos in different oxygen conditions fig 3 1 in anaerobic conditions paos rapidly use organic carbon sources i e volatile fatty acids vfa and synthesize poly hydroxyalkanoates pha via hydrolysis of stored polyp as the energy source after hydrolysis of polyp orthophosphate is released to the environment consecutively in aerobic stage paos use oxygen as the electron acceptor and pha which was stored in the cells during the anaerobic phase are degraded for cell growth and resynthesis of poly p by assimilating orthophosphate from the environment seviour et al 2003 tarayre et al 2016 by this mechanism phosphorus could be stored in the cells the accumulated phosphorus in sludge can be used as directly as fertilizer or can be further processed to recover phosphorus such as struvite melia et al 2017 candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis is the most well studied polyphosphate accumulating organism the other common paos are β proteobacteria acinetobacter δ proteobacteria dechloromonas β proteobacteria and actinobacteria izadi et al 2020 in recent years denitrifying and or sulphur associated paos were also discovered adapting the phosphorus release removal mechanism used in wwtp operations for the phosphorus rich eutrophic marine water system could be worth investigating these technologies can include the use of active phosphate accumulating microorganisms in situ operations as well as the use of engineered ex situ reactors adding organic carbon source such as vfas externally to stimulate phosphorus capture from the marine environment there is no application for the marine environment so far focusing paos there is one study in literature considering the use of microorganisms including phosphate accumulating organisms for in situ treatment of eutrophic lake water table 3 1 chai et al 2017 applied an ecosystem activation system eas which was based pumping polluted water into the system and use of microorganisms nitrobacterium denitrifiers cod decomposers and paos through anoxic and aerobic conditions and releasing effluent water including active microorganisms for restoration of water ecosystem this system provided 53 5 of tp removal initial concentration of 0 2 0 3 mg l 77 7 cod removal and 53 2 tn removal microbial diversity also increased 2 5 fold and the dominant eutrophic microorganisms were reduced in case of phosphorus the eas system increased the relative abundances of the key phosphorus accumulating microorganisms acinetobacter arcicella and limnohabitans after 30 days of treatment this study could be important in terms of giving insight into the application of active paos in eutrophic water treatment the applicability can be also tested for eutrophic marine waters which have quite different water and ecosystem dynamics than lake waters the effect of treatment on the microbial community should be monitored in long term after treatment to ensure that the treatment is efficient and long lasting 3 1 2 learning from soil applications and mining phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms psms can be another outstanding candidate for phosphorus recovery from marine sediments psms play a vital role for phosphorus cycling especially in soil as well as intertidal waters estuaries and deep seas bacillus pseudomonas aspergillus penicillium trichoderma and rhizoctonia are some of the examples for psms prabhu et al 2019 one of the major mechanisms for phosphorus solubilization is organic acids production that can decrease ph enhance chelation of the cations ca fe al which are bounded to phosphorus compete with phosphorous for adsorption sites and can form soluble complexes with phosphorus bounded metal sharma et al 2013 some of the organic acids produced by psms are gluconic acid oxalic acid tartaric acid and lactic acid billah et al 2019 inorganic acid production proton extrusion and exopolysaccharide eps production prabhu et al 2019 as well as releasing phosphorus solubilizing enzymes i e phosphomonoesterases phytases and phosphonatases and c p lyases are the other mechanisms for phosphorus solubilization alori et al 2017 bioleaching microorganisms could be also utilized for a green recovery opportunity for the marine sediment bioleaching can be defined as the mobilization of metal cations through a biological oxidation and complexation process rohwerder et al 2003 most widely used microorganisms for bioleaching applications acidithiobacillus and leptosprillium which can oxidize iron and or sulfur these microorganisms do not also require additional carbon source since they use co2 as the carbon source the mechanisms involved in bioleaching are direct bioleaching and indirect bioleaching direct bioleaching relies on the direct contact of bacteria with metallic sulfide and oxidation of metallic sulfide into soluble metal sulfate and indirect bioleaching oxidation of the elemental sulfur reduced sulfur compounds into sulfuric acid which results in lower ph pathak et al 2009 for phosphorus solubilization the indirect mechanism are much relevant in case of psms very few researches investigated the phosphorus solubilization capacity of marine sediment microbiome john and salim 2020 investigated the sediment microbiome from arabian sea for its potential on plant growth promoting capacities including phosphate solubilization potassium solubilization and nitrogen fixation they found out that 19 strains out of 26 isolates had phosphate solubilization capacity in another study phosphate solubilizing halophilic bacteria isolated from eastern coast of china were tested for their phosphate solubilization potential for the soil applications zhu et al 2011 de et al 2012 also showed a positive relationship between phosphatase activity and phosphorus releasing bacteria in the sediment from hooghly estuary these studies highlighted the capacity of marine microbiome for the phosphorus release at this point the use of native sediment marine microbiome for the phosphorus mining from the sediment could be investigated for their phosphorus release mechanisms and capacities furthermore other psms isolated from soil can be also tested for its phosphorus release capacities from the marine sediment for instance kim et al 2005 investigated biological phosphorus removal from contaminated river sediment by soil isolated burkaholderia glathei highest phosphorus solubilization was achieved under anoxic environment as 34 5 of the total phosphorus with glucose 8 g l and sucrose 2 g l addition as the carbon source as well as addition of arginine 0 1 g l as the nitrogen source this study showed the outstanding potential of psm for phosphorus release from the river sediment and similar studies should be investigated for phosphorus rich marine sediments as well one of the main limitations for these operations could be the use of synthetic carbon source which is costly however the use of waste derived carbon sources would reduce the cost of the total process bioleaching bacteria have not been studied for phosphorus release for the marine sediment yet but there are applications for heavy metal release guven and akinci 2013 however there are various researches related to phosphorus release from sludge as a recent example pradhan et al 2021 investigated phosphorus leaching from sewage sludge with acidithiobacillus thiooxidans and acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans and 92 of the phosphorus released after a 3 stage experiment for 63 days phase 1 90 ml growing media 10 ml sewage sludge addition phase 2 10 ml sample removal 10 ml sewage sludge addition phase 3 elemental sulfur addition 10 g l they also observed trace metal release after the bioleaching treatment considering the characteristics of sewage sludge and the marine sediment it can be said that the phosphorus fractions i e inorganic and organic and phosphorus content may not be similar however similar investigations can be done to question the feasibility of bioleaching for phosphorus recovery from marine sediment moreover multirecovery strategies for phosphorus and metals with bioleaching are possible so that bioleaching can provide a holistic solution for the phosphorus and metal rich marine sediments 3 2 algal phosphorus mining algae are also capable of phosphorus uptake from water providing a sustainable option for eutrophic marine water treatment and phosphorus recovery in this respect algae based off shore phosphorus recovery systems could be developed with respect to future phosphorus scarcity another option could be harvesting algal biomass developed through blooms from eutrophic water systems to help in cutting off eutrophication loop pandhal et al 2017 algal phosphorus mining also provides valorisation of the algae biomass as a raw material in biorefinery due to its capacity to produce various ranges of products triverdi et al 2015 fuel products bioethanol biodiesel biogas and biohydrogen callegari et al 2019 high value products such as biopharmaceuticals biocosmetics bionutrients biochemicals budzianowski 2017 as well as biochar bolognesi et al 2022 can be produced through algae biomass 3 2 1 macroalgae farming for phosphorus mining macroalgae seaweed has been consumed mainly for centuries as a food source the worth of global seaweed industry is more than usd 6 billion per year with a production of more than 12 million tonnes per year fao 2018 in case of eutrophication seaweed can remove excess nutrients from the marine environment lower the effects of ocean acidification capture carbon and deoxygenate the water by increasing ph and oxygen levels duarte et al 2017 seaweed aquaculture can also contribute to lowering agricultural emissions if the harvested biomass is substituted for synthetic fertilizers duarte et al 2017 he et al 2008 investigated the bioremediation capacity of porphyra yezoensis along the lusi coast china and found out that both n and p reduction nh4 n 50 94 no2 n 42 91 no3 n 21 38 po4 p 42 67 was achieved when compared to control area 300 ha cultivation provided 14 708 5 kg n and 2373 kg p in the tissue of the macroalgae and this strategy reduced excess nutrients in the eutrophic coast in another study jiang et al 2019a the effect of saccharina japonica farming was investigated for highly eutrophicated xiangshan bay of east china between 2008 and 2015 it was observed that seaweed farming elevated oxygen levels and ph and reduced nutrient levels 297 t of n and 42 t of p annually it was also observed that suspended solids were also reduced and number of phytoplankton species increased integrated multi trophic aquaculture imta strategies are also stated as important in terms of sustainable aquaculture and bioremediation potential yang et al 2015 for instance huo et al 2012 found out that co cultivation of gracilaria verrucosa with the fish pseudosciaena crocea at xiangshan harbor in the east china sea resulted in maximum treatment efficiency for po4 p no2 n nh4 n and no3 n was achieved as 58 48 61 and 47 respectively although macroalgae farming is quite effective for treating eutrophic waters some environmental and economic concerns can be challenging it is stated that benthic communities i e seagrass meadows can be affected negatively by seaweed farms due to shading and trampling moreno et al 2021 in terms of economics hasselström et al 2020 investigated the economic potential of farming of saccharina latissimi and showed that large scale farming can provide high sequestration of annual anthropogenic nitrogen 8 and phosphorus 60 inputs however this strategy was not cost efficient for nutrient removal itself herein the valorization of macroalgae can be an outstanding strategy to perform the farming process in a cost effective way 3 2 2 microalgae exploitation for phosphorus mining phosphorus plays a key role for the growth and metabolism of microalgae as h2po4 hpo4 2 is incorporated into organic compounds through phosphorylation cai et al 2013 microalgae cyanobacteria are also able to store phosphorus in their cells as polyp fig 3 2 microalgae have been studied for treatment of various wastewaters such as municipal livestock wastes industrial wastes and agro industrial wastes abdel rouf et al 2012 there is one study found in literature that focused on treatment of eutrophic marine sediment table 3 1 kwon et al 2015 applied an in situ phytoremediation strategy for eutrophic coastal sediments in masan bay south korea with nitzschia sp and a light emitting diode red led 650 nm the results showed that chlorophyll a concentration doubled and dissolved inorganic nitrogen din and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip was removed by 19 and 24 respectively which was attributed to enhanced aerobic bacterial activity of nutrient uptake by nitzschia sp in this study it was also stated that oxygen levels in the bottom water improved up to 8 mg l although the results of the study are promising the change in microbial community in the sediments as well as response of other living organisms should be also investigated after phytoremediation as being an in situ application the harvesting of microalgae was not considered in this study and also mining of phosphorus was not applicable 3 3 microalgae bacteria coupled approach for phosphorus mining use of microalgae and paos together microbial aggregates can also be another option for phosphorus removal and recovery xu et al 2020 in this interaction phosphorus removal can be achieved through both extracellular entrapment with exopolysaccharides and intracellular entrapment through formation of polyphosphate polyp xu et al 2020 it is stated that algal bacterial systems have more promising performance than treatment by individual algae or bacteria perera et al 2019 as a recent example for eutrophic fresh water treatment cost effective a lab scale photo microbial nutrient recovery cell pnrc was developed as a novel approach for nutrient removal from eutrophic water jiang et al 2019b table 3 1 in this study pnrc provided self generated electric field that forces nutrient ions to migrate and recovery of nutrients as microalgae biomass chlorella vulgaris high nitrate removal was found to be due to the abundant denitrifying bacteria thauera paracoccus stappia and azoarcus ammonia removal due to microalgae 69 3 and nitrification 22 5 as well as phosphorus removal 92 as mainly attributed to microalgae the net energy gain from this system amounted to 7 705 kwh m3 energy gain from conventional nitrification denitrification treatment is 0 138 7 705 kwh m3 this study looks promising for treatment of eutrophic water future research should also include eutrophic marine water treatment as well as phosphorus recovery options with this strategy 3 4 wetland systems for phosphorus mining treatment wetlands in brackish and saltwater environments could also be designed and operated to accommodate the additional goal of phosphorus mining in the context of application within maritime estuaries and lagoons treatment of wetland systems are mostly designed as free surface flow fsw wetlands furthermore floating treatment wetlands ftws are a relatively new development with a high increase in research activities and some applications over the last years in general phosphorus removal in wetland systems occurs mainly through matrix adsorption with limited adsorption sites and plant uptake whereas plants also have to be harvested to remove the plant stored phosphorus from the ecosystem yousaf et al 2021 3 4 1 free water surface flow wetlands langergraber et al 2020 distinguished saline or saltwater wetland systems treating water with salinity similar to seawater 30 and brackish systems which treat water with higher salinity than freshwater i e between 5 and 20 the authors also described the effects of the salinity which potentially depresses the organic biodegradation rates and also phosphorus sorption may decrease with increasing salinity crain 2007 found that nutrient limitation of brackish estuarine marshes in maine was dependent on the salinity gradient in the estuary whereas salt and brackish marsh vegetation was nitrogen limited and oligohaline lower salinity of 0 0 5 and the marsh vegetation showed a co limitation of both nitrogen and phosphorus plant tissue analysis in high salinity areas with high nitrogen concentration indicated that nitrogen also aids to the salinity tolerance of the occurring plants yang and chen 2012 investigated five saline fws wetland systems planted with mangrove avicennia marina mainly with a total area of 52 ha which were placed around the dapong bay brackish coastal lagoon taiwan to prevent eutrophication provide flood protection as well as provide a space for eco tourism and knowledge dissemination after pre treatment of sedimentation ponds and gravel filtration beds the five wetlands received 42 630 m3 of water per day and were operated for over 14 years showing removal rates of bod ss tn and tp in the ranges 16 68 14 76 35 82 and 10 87 respectively tp sorption naturally decreased over time due to the limited sorption sites available in the systems hence the authors suggested a periodic exchange of substrate as well as thinning of mangroves among the few reports on saline or brackish cw systems a lab scale experiment by sousa et al 2011 investigated pilot scale vertical flow vf cw systems for mariculture effluent treatment the systems were either planted with the macrophyte spartina alterniflora or unplanted and resulted in reductions of 89 and 71 for inorganic solids 82 and 96 for organic solids 51 and 63 for tn 82 and 92 for nh4 n 64 and 59 for po4 p and 81 and 89 for turbidity respectively planted systems showed a tendency for higher denitrification and unplanted systems had higher oxygen levels and ph improving the mineralization of organic matter and nitrification the reasons of higher observed orthophosphate removal in planted cw systems besides assimilation by s alterniflora could therefore be anaerobic heterotrophic bacteria such as denitrifying bacteria which can play an important role in the cycle of phosphorus barak et al 2003 sundareshwar et al 2003 and could have absorbed substantial amounts of orthophosphate 3 4 2 floating treatment wetlands research and applications of floating treatment wetlands ftws increased rapidly over the last decade colares et al 2020 the systems consist of emergent aquatic macrophytes growing on a floating platform possibly made from various reused materials whereas the roots are submerged in the water the suspended rhizosphere of the plants provides relatively large surface areas for biofilm growth enabling water treatment functions through filtration of suspended particles and biochemical treatment of nutrients and pollutants cross et al 2021 the majority of ftw research has been conducted in lab scale and by constructing or using existing pond or basin structures with an inlet and outlet and containing the ftws which would only allow for ex situ e g at the coast p recovery in a coastal marine context however there are also a few experiences of systems placed in situ in the environment for example in a very recent publication karstens et al 2021 presented results for ftws actually built in a lagoon of the southern baltic sea to investigate the challenges in such coastal environments from the used native macrophytes phosphorus concentrations after harvesting were highest in lythrum salicaria up to 1 g kg in the dry mass additional observations showed that birds did not use the ftws as breeding grounds but grey herons used them for foraging and a large number of endangered eels found shelter in the diverse and large root network indicating an additional positive effect in terms of habitat and biodiversity ecosystem services di luca et al 2019 investigated nitrogen and phosphorus removal in ftw systems with controls no ftw and biological control with ftw but no nutrients in inflow and found 10 4 and 8 8 times higher removal for nitrogen and phosphorus respectively in systems with ftws with removal rates were 70 80 of the inflowing phosphorus inflow of 5 mg p l the same study also found that phosphorus concentrations in the sediment were higher in the control systems without ftws and that phosphorus accumulated significantly higher in the roots and rhizomes than in the aerial parts of the used typha domingensis which would be a disadvantage for phosphorus removal through above ground harvesting of plants which depends on the translocation of the nutrients to the aerial parts and the properties of the plants 3 5 mussel farming for phosphorus mining mussel farming is another bio based strategy that is relatively simple flexible and potentially cost effective while providing an efficient recirculation of nutrients from sea to land by removing nutrients from eutrophic waters gren et al 2009 kotta et al 2020 mussels can filter seawater and trap nutrients so as they are harvested they can be further used as animal or human food biomolecules bioenergy or as a soil amendment to promote circularity of phosphorus stadmark and conley 2011 kotta et al 2020 estimated nutrient removal in three mussel farms located in the outer central and inner baltic sea nutrient removal was found as the highest at the central baltic farm sankt anna 23 3 g n m and 1 8 g p m line ant the nutrient removal costs were the lowest at the central baltic farm with 76 kg n the costs were quite higher at the two other farms due to lower nutrient accumulating capacity gren et al 2009 showed that marginal cost of mussel farming in the baltic sea to clean nutrients were found lower than other nutrient abatement options i e reducing nutrient inputs from agriculture sewage treatment plants however the costs were found as highly dependent on mussel growth sale strategy and nutrient load targets although mussel farming looks promising for removing nutrients environmental concerns are also questionable lee et al 2016 showed that organic pollutants produced from a mussel farm caused hypoxia in both sediment and bottom water in the northwest area of the gamak bay south korea it was also stated that the long term effects of mussel farming might be negative so repeated measures should be taken into account considering its frequency and extent dense or large scale blue mussel farms in the baltic sea are stated to have negative effect on the local environment such as organic matter and nutrient accumulation oxygen deficiency and plankton blooms at this point more field studies and ecosystem modelling were suggested for large scale applications hedberg et al 2018 4 key technical gaps and future strategies the current research for the above mentioned strategies for phosphorus mining from marine environments is summarized in table 3 1 the research mainly focuses on purification strategies to reduce phosphorus concentrations in the water bodies not all of them concern marine water and most of the studies achieved relatively higher purification efficiencies however neither phosphorus recovery pathways as follow up strategy nor the wholistic use of all components nor the accounting of additional long term benefits of restorative systems has been studied yet mussel farming and macroalgae farming are the more commonly applied strategies for the eutrophic marine water treatment when compared to other strategies nutrient accumulation capacities for seaweed and mussel farming were well established in the literature the main limitation for these strategies is the need for using local species regarding the characteristics of the species as well as the local environmental conditions the efficiency environmental effects and construction and operational costs can vary furthermore these strategies mainly do not consider the recovery of phosphorus from the biomass which should be investigated deeply in addition most of these studies were based on pilot scale applications and they should be tested in larger application areas to test the feasibility there is a huge research gap for the real scale applicability of microorganisms microalgae plants for phosphorus mining as most of the research is still in lab scale in regards to eutrophic water treatment applicability for exploitation of microorganisms and microalgae for phosphorus removal and recovery should be tested initially in lab scale experiments to develop novel strategies the investigations can include the design of ex situ bioreactors and optimization of operational parameters i e organic carbon temperature ph and retention time a later step can include pilot scale testing and a comprehensive environmental and economic assessment of ex situ operations wetland systems can also be tested in small scale to treat eutrophic marine waters by mimicking natural environments for selecting the most promising species that can survive local conditions i e salinity temperature sunlight and show high nutrient removal capacities moreover wholistic utilization pathways for all parts of the biomass and recovery of phosphorus in the harvested biomass can also be taken into account in future applications the following sections give some insights of novel future strategies to go beyond the status quo 4 1 possible microorganism exploitation pathways the many capabilities of microorganisms can be a key to open innovative ways in this field the use of engineered phosphate accumulators was suggested as key microbial process for the recovery of phosphorus in the marine water and sediments de lorenzo 2017 in case if paos possible strategies can both focus on eutrophic seawater as well as phosphorus rich sediment that serves as a phosphorus source under anoxic conditions ex situ bioreactor operation for eutrophic seawater treatment can be applied under anaerobic and or aerobic conditions with seawater adapted ebpr sludge or a marine sediment microbiome there are some studies concerning saline wastewater treatment with seawater adapted ebpr sludge he et al 2020 de graaf et al 2020 and current knowledge can be further developed for treatment of eutrophic waters for this strategy removal mechanisms at lower phosphorus concentrations when compared to domestic wastewaters should be well investigated the effect of operational conditions including addition of organic carbon as well as regulation of salinity level ph and temperature should be studied marine sediment microbiomes which are already adapted to the marine environment can also be tested for the phosphorus removal and recovery capacity in this strategy the microbial community and possible phosphorus removing and or accumulating strains should be well known to develop an effective strategy apart from eutrophic seawater phosphorus can be removed and recovered from the marine sediment as well internal loading of phosphorus from the anoxic marine sediments are the main key driver for boosting eutrophication and treatment of sediment can utterly solve phosphorus release from the sediments under oxygen free conditions see section 2 1 phosphorus can be released to the water column due to fes and fes2 formation that prevents formation of fe bounded phosphate and releases phosphate to the water column furthermore paos in the sediments can also release accumulated phosphate from their cells under oxygen free conditions hence anaerobic fermentation of the marine sediment in ex situ bioreactors can cause release of phosphorus from the sediment to the water column however at this point the biological phosphorus release mechanisms should be well studied with microbial community analysis for instance in case of the baltic sea the microbial community varies in estuary sediments and the open sea iron sulphur reducing bacteria were found to be common in estuary sediments which are rich in iron bound phosphorus on the other hand in the open sea sediment which is rich on labile organic phosphorus sulphate reducing bacteria were found to be common sinkko et al 2011 therefore detailed characterization of microbial community and the abundance of chemical forms of phosphorus can help to design an effective phosphorus recovery system from marine sediments apart from paos phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms can also trigger phosphorus release from the sediment bioaugmentation with the phosphorus solubilizing microorganisms would lead to improved phosphorus release efficiencies these microbial strategies should also include a recovery step to capture phosphorus from the water column via biological bio sludge chemical struvite vivianite etc or physical adsorption pathways the main limitation for focusing on the phosphorus rich sediment with ex situ applications are the environmental impacts of sediment dredging main concerns related to sediment dredging application are resuspension of particulate matter including nutrients heavy metals and emerging contaminants during dredging operations the change in seabed surface and formation of dredging plumes are further possible risks of dredging operations manap and voilvais 2015 however eco friendly dredging technologies can help to reduce negative effects of sediment dredging 4 2 coupling phosphorus mining with other valorisation pathways marine environment can also be rich in several metals and rare elements a holistic approach aiming at multi valorisation of the marine sediment and deep seawater can make the whole process more profitable for instance a bioleaching strategy can be applied for marine sediment in ex situ bioreactors to release both phosphorus and metals followed by a sequential recovery system to separate elements from each other ion exchange sequential precipitation nano filtration and a liquid liquid extraction process can be applied for separation of phosphorus from metals semerci et al 2019 selective adsorption of metals and phosphorus with modified substrates could be another notable option these approaches can also be applicable for eutrophic and metal rich seawater beneficial use of the treated sediment such as building materials as plant growing soil mymrin et al 2017 kim et al 2020 or as an alternative to soil based materials cevikbilen et al 2020 could be also considered to achieve a beneficial remediation and recovery system harvested biomass plants algae and mussels can also be used in a multi recovery strategy for a variety of products harvested biomass can be applied directly as fertilizer due to the high nutrient content or harvested biomass can firstly be valorised for conversion to commodities then as fuel products biogas biohydrogen bio jet fuels biodiesel etc and residual biomass can still be used as fertilizer the scenarios can include extraction of valuable bioproducts such as pigments polysaccharides fatty acids vitamins proteins or similar co2 sequestration for bio oil production could be also a promising method with using microalgae biomass coupled with bioelectrochemical systems bolognesi et al 2022 although harvesting biomass provides various end product options the cost of the processing is still challenging at that point low energy consuming technologies i e harvesting should be developed future studies should also include the assessment of different scenarios to find out the optimized valorisation pathways for the biomass considering economic and environmental issues 5 environmental economic and social key challanges phosphorus mining from secondary sources such as waste streams and natural polluted environments can be considered as promising sources to sustain enough phosphorus for the agricultural and industrial demand in the future the progress for phosphorus recovery from wastewater streams has accelerated in the recent years due to increasing public attention on sustainability and circularity and being in the eu s critical raw material list jupp et al 2021 however challenges such as social acceptance economic feasibility policies and regulations as well as interaction between stakeholders and institutions represent still main barriers crispim et al 2019 considering phosphorus recovery from marine environments the challenges are plentiful due to lack of technical applications as well as economic and environmental assessments societal challenges and current legislations are the other key challenges to be addressed phosphorus mining from the marine environment can be beneficial to provide phosphorus for human use and reducing eutrophication risks however both short term and long term environmental risks including emissions to air water and soil as well as the ecosystem responses should be well addressed prior to applications especially the effect of capturing phosphorus from the marine environment will obviously change existing n p ratios in the marine application areas that would lead to shifts in the marine ecosystem it is stated that n and p deficiencies have an effect on the structure and biochemical composition of the microbial communities berdalet et al 1996 change in microbial community through different nutrient concentrations and n p ratios have been studied by several authors via batch experiments hauss et al 2012 ferreira et al 2020 in order to figure out the response of marine microbial communities similar studies should be investigated thoroughly to observe the effect of in situ phosphorus mining operations furthermore the response of other members of the marine ecosystem such as fish seagrass meadows should be considered since phosphorus mining strategies have a direct impact on the marine ecosystem the understanding of the response of the marine ecosystem is a crucial step economic challenges can include the cost of the removal and recovery process low market price of the phosphorus and problems related to commercialization of the recovered phosphorus the market value of the recovered product can change depending on the final version of the phosphorus i e struvite vivianite or fertilizer as biomass hence a detailed techno economical assessment should be required to follow up a cost effective strategy societal challenges can be faced due to tentativeness of stakeholders i e farmers area developers to use recovered phosphorus in field applications and social acceptance of restoration activities in the marine environment at this point communication strategies should be well developed to increase the public awareness on the need for phosphorus recovery and restoration stakeholders should also be well informed and encouraged to collaborate and use recovered phosphorus political interest on recovered phosphorus and the blue economy adapting regulations on the phosphorus mining from natural marine environment as well as promoting and preparing guidelines could also help to spread the phosphorus recovery practices from the marine environment 6 conclusion excess phosphorus in the marine environment could be the key for future phosphorus supply the use of in situ or ex situ engineering phosphorus mining approaches via living organisms microorganisms algae plants mussels etc could provide effective strategies as soon as the mentioned research gaps are filled the microbial phosphorus recovery approach focusing on phosphorus recovery from the marine sediment could be the most favourable solution to the internal phosphorus release problem from anoxic sediments phosphorus recovery from marine water and sediment coupled with other valorisation pathways of e g harvested biomass represent a key step for future management of phosphorus rich marine environment as soon as the technical environmental economic and societal challenges are well addressed and solved the phosphorus strategy mine to fork can be adapted to marine to fork hopefully in the near future

15882,in recent years the pavement industry has been seeking sustainable development through recycling reclaimed asphalt pavement and reusing other waste materials as replacements for asphalt mixture constituents incorporating waste material into asphalt mixture and the presence of pollutants such as exhaust fumes and gasoline due to vehicle traffic may lead to contaminants leaching from asphalt pavements to underlying soil layers and groundwater aquifers posing serious risks to ecosystems and the environment to cast light on contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements this article presents a comprehensive review of the literature that is divided into four research areas evaluation of leaching measurement methods leaching from recycled asphalt materials leaching characteristics of porous asphalt pavements and waste modified asphalt mixtures moreover a critical discussion of bibliometric data literature content and knowledge gaps in this domain is provided to help highway agencies and environmental scientists address contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements finally some potential research directions are suggested for future research works graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords road runoff contaminant leaching leaching measurement tests reclaimed asphalt pavement porous asphalt pavement waste modified asphalt mixtures 1 introduction asphalt pavement although a vital infrastructure adversely affects the environment from the beginning of construction to the end of the service life the adverse impacts include but are not limited to high energy consumption excessive utilization of non renewable natural resources and relevant environmental problems caused by material extraction transportation production and paving processes asadi azadgoleh et al 2021 qiao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 wei et al 2021 one of the most important environmental issues of asphalt pavements is the leaching of contaminants to underlying soil layers and groundwater aquifers this concern always exists until the end of the service life of asphalt pavements mijic et al 2020 yang et al 2020 therefore research on the leaching from the pavements should be given more attention from different points of view to provide executive tips for pavement engineers and highway agencies asphalt pavements are generally composed of aggregates bitumen fillers and additives bitumen used in asphalt pavements is an inorganic material obtained from the distillation of crude oil containing different hydrocarbons lesueur 2009 mohammadi and modarres 2022 asphalt pavements are also exposed to various pollutants due to vehicle traffic such as exhaust fumes gasoline lubricating oils brake and tire wear wastes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah and de icing salts moreover pavements are subjected to some heavy metals such as nickel ni chromium cr copper cu cadmium cd lead pb and zinc z backstrom et al 2004 campisano et al 2017 legret et al 2005 xu and zhang 2020 vehicle exhaust is the main source of pb in pavements jeong et al 2022 nriagu 1990 z and cd are mainly deposited on the asphalt surface due to vehicle tire wear and the corrosion of traffic barriers made of galvanized steel vehicle brake wear causes cu to penetrate pavements in addition pahs result from the incomplete combustion of organic materials brandt and de groot 2001 muller et al 2022 spreadbury et al 2021 xu et al 2021 precipitation causing runoff formation on the pavement surface triggers the leaching of the pollutants to soil layers and groundwater resources linh et al 2020 mijic et al 2020 mittal et al 2022 webber et al 2022 today highway agencies reuse waste materials into asphalt pavement due to the commonality of this approach it is essential to pay attention to the leaching of contaminants from the asphalt pavements containing waste and recycled materials huang et al 2007 yang et al 2018 you et al 2021 one of the popular recycled materials replacing asphalt mixture constituents is reclaimed asphalt pavement rap abdalfattah et al 2021 rap supply and demand do not always coincide less than half of the rap is recycled into asphalt pavements but a significant proportion of it is always stockpiled in 2017 for example nearly 73 million tons of rap were used to build asphalt pavements on us streets and 91 million tons were stockpiled for later use brantley and townsend 1999 napa 2019 spreadbury et al 2021 therefore rap leaching can be investigated from two perspectives contaminant leaching from the stockpiled rap and asphalt pavement containing rap gedik 2020 huang et al 2007 norin and stromvall 2004 in recent years waste material management has become one of the most significant considerations of modern urban societies holm and simon 2017 li et al 2017 these materials can be managed in various ways namely burial incineration and recycling choudhary et al 2020 incineration of waste material causes environmental pollution by releasing pollutant gasses into the atmosphere burying or releasing these substances into the environment and then exposing them to rain may also result in ecological pollution through leaching gori et al 2011 another way to prevent the release of waste material into nature and reduce the use of virgin materials is to reuse waste materials in the construction of asphalt pavements disfani et al 2012 gautam et al 2018 jamshidi and white 2019 some of the waste materials used in asphalt pavements are municipal solid waste ash mswa wood ash wa cathode ray tube crt glass and fly ash fa dimter et al 2021 ding et al 2021 mohamad et al 2020 yinfei et al 2020 nevertheless using the waste materials in asphalt pavements may adversely affect the pavements leaching behavior which should be addressed cho et al 2020 porous asphalt pavement pap is another noteworthy field of research in environmental concerns related to the pavement formerly known as the open graded friction course ogfc and classified as a hot mix asphalt hma mixture jiang et al 2015 murphy et al 2015 the most apparent difference between this type of mixture and traditional asphalt mixtures is the air void content pap usually has a 15 20 air void compared to conventional asphalts with a 3 6 air void elizondo martã nez et al 2020 because of having a high proportion of air void pap readily transfers surface water to the lower layers preventing the hydroplaning phenomenon which improves road users safety level and comfort roseen et al 2012 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b likewise one of the environmental merits attributed to paps is their effective performance in filtering and removing runoff pollutants in this regard it is vital to evaluate how effectively paps reduce the concentration of pollutants in underlying soil layers and groundwater aquifers holleran et al 2016 liu et al 2021b razzaghmanesh and borst 2019 scholz and grabowiecki 2007 several tests have been suggested to assess the type and amount of pollutants leaching from different asphalt pavements under various environmental conditions these tests include toxicity characteristics leaching procedure tclp synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp column leaching test tank leaching test and ph dependent leaching test cabrera et al 2020b cui et al 2021a cui et al 2021b krol et al 2020 rahmad et al 2021 to choose between available tests and interpret their results it is crucial to have a deep understanding of their mechanisms and proper applications this study intends to review and analyze different aspects of leaching characteristics of asphalt pavements critically and clarify their ambiguous aspects overall this research comprehensively encompasses four fundamental domains as listed below leaching measurement tools and experiments leaching characteristics of stockpiled rap and asphalt pavements containing rap leaching characteristics of asphalt pavements containing industrial mineral and urban waste materials leaching characteristics of paps the information can potentially be used by relevant sectors such as governments highway agencies contractors and stakeholders to address the adverse impacts of leaching pollutants from asphalt pavements on the surrounding environment fig 1 illustrates the simplified flowchart of what this research presents 2 leaching measurement of asphalt pavements there are about 50 leaching tests for different materials and conditions but few of them resemble actual conditions guzman martinez et al 2020 lu et al 2019 piazza et al 2018 torras et al 2011 zampori et al 2009 generally laboratory leaching tests can be categorized into two main groups batch or static tests and column or dynamic tests in static tests the leaching solution is a single additive and is not renewed during the test however in dynamic tests the leaching solution is restored during the test imoto et al 2018 lov et al 2019 the common types of leaching tests are examined below 2 1 batch leaching tests a batch leaching test procedure starts with exposing a certain amount of solid material with a certain size to a specific volume of leachate yasutaka et al 2017 then a leachate sample is collected for analysis after separation from the solids in this test procedure important variables are the leaching solution liquid to solid ratio l s and contact time batch tests are quicker and easier to perform compared to column tests batch systems are also cheaper than column tests and produce chemical data for additional environmental analyses álvarez ayuso and murciego 2021 darama et al 2021 van der sloot and kosson 2012 two of the most common batch leaching tests are tclp epa 1992 and splp epa 1994 tclp is a leaching test method developed by the u s environmental protection agency epa to evaluate certain contaminants leaching potential from waste material in landfills the test was designed to determine the mobility of organic and inorganic compounds present in solid liquid and multiphase wastes in the test the bulk material is crushed to a grain size of 9 5 mm and added to a leaching solution and then allowed to be soaked for a specified period up to a few days this solution can either be tclp fluid or deionized water di a typical soaking time is 24 hours and is carried out in a covered 2 5 l glass jar l s of 5 10 15 and 20 are used to characterize any relationship between the l s ratio and leaching characteristics the final ph of the leachate is measured and then the liquid is separated from the material and ultimately analyzed for contaminants such as heavy metals pah and the volatile organic compound voc in the splp test the extraction fluid consists of nitric and sulfuric acid to simulate acidic rainwater a small sample of material is placed in an extraction vessel and mixed with the extraction fluid the mixture is rotated for 18 2 hours at 30 rpm rounds per minute the leachate is then filtered and analyzed for a further chemical survey chew et al 2022 cui et al 2021b epa 1992 epa 1994 rahmad et al 2021 fig 2 shows the different steps of performing tclp and splp tests 2 2 column leaching test a column test is another type of leaching test used to study the leaching process from the material this method is suitable for a wide range of granular solids such as industrial wastes soil sludge combustion residues sediments and construction wastes jaques et al 2017 this method is unsuitable for monolithic materials including cement based and stabilized materials unless the material size is reduced to the standard size required before testing furthermore it cannot be used to calculate volatile organic leaching the more homogeneous the particles in the column the more particles are likely to be exposed to the leaching solution simultaneously increasing the accuracy of the test this test is often assumed to be more representative of natural field conditions than a batch test townsend et al 2003 during the column test the leaching solution constantly flows through the material placed in a column in addition column tests can be performed under both saturated and unsaturation conditions unsaturated conditions are usually performed to simulate vadose zone placement dan et al 2021 epa 2013a naka et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the experimental method of this test is shown in fig 3 2 3 other leaching tests in addition to column and batch leaching tests tank and ph dependent leaching tests are among the common procedures to analyze the potential environmental risks of solid materials okeke et al 2020 sanger et al 2020 townsend et al 2003 2 3 1 tank leaching test the process of performing this test is shown in fig 4 the tank test method involves rinsing the monolithic or dense granular material in a tank that is full of reagent water monolithic specimens can be cylindrical or cubic while granular specimens can be compressed into cylindrical molds with the desired moisture content using modified compactor density methods soultanidis et al 2022 samples are placed in reagent water with a specified ratio of liquid to surface area l a the reagent water is then replaced with fresh reagent water after a particular time and this process is repeated nine times at the end of each iteration the sample is separated from the reagent water and the mass of the sample is recorded to control the amount of effluent absorbed in the solid matrix likewise the ph and specific conductivity are calculated and this information is recorded afterward by analyzing the obtained data the leaching parameters are computed following the last renewal of the reagent water the total time required for this test is 63 days epa 2013b facin et al 2021 rahmad et al 2021 xu and zhang 2020 2 3 2 ph dependent leaching test this test calculates the amount of contaminant leaching from the sample according to changes in the ph of the solution after a certain period the required test time is determined according to the particle size of the sample this method is suitable for assessing leaching potential in various solids namely industrial wastes combustion residues stabilized material building material and mining waste in this method a sample with a specified size is placed in 9 containers containing a mixture of reagent water and acid or base solution for a certain time the amount of acid or base solution is determined based on the titration curve the ph of the solution is then compared with the target ph defined by the standards according to material type if the ph does not match the target ph it is added to the acid or base sample after a specified time the sample and solution are separated and the solution is filtered to separate fine particles finally the solution passed through the filter is analyzed to achieve the desired results in this method the smaller the particle size the greater the amount of solution contact with the sample resulting in higher test accuracy ai et al 2019 epa 2012 he et al 2021 the procedure for performing this test is shown in fig 5 according to the studies performed on the leaching measurement tests including tclp splp column leaching tank leaching and ph dependent leaching test table 1 summarizes and compares their main attributes based on the literature reviewed in this article batch tests are the most common leaching tests used by researchers due to their convenience in terms of applicability and popularity fig 6 3 leaching characteristics of rap asphalt pavement materials are removed during resurfacing rehabilitation or reconstruction operations celauro et al 2015 huang et al 2009 the removed asphalt pavement is processed and becomes rap containing asphalt binder and aggregate copeland 2011 zaumanis and mallick 2014 rap is reused as aggregate for unbound base materials stabilized base materials pothole rut filler materials and roadway shoulder materials arulrajah et al 2013 bowden 2021 yang et al 2015 however hydrocarbons in the bitumen and pollution from tire residue or fuels in rap materials may cause the leaching of contaminants azizian et al 2003 lange et al 2021 wei et al 2015 in addition rap is temporarily stored before incorporation into new asphalt mixtures in some locations such as gravel pits and rock quarries bowden 2021 su et al 2019 in this regard contaminants may leach from rap stockpiles when exposed to rainfall thus researchers have evaluated contaminant leaching from both rap stockpiles and asphalt mixtures containing rap kriech 1991 norin and stromvall 2004 fig 7 illustrates the process of leaching from the stockpiled rap and the rap used in the different layers of asphalt pavement 3 1 leaching from rap stockpiles our literature review has indicated that contamination leaching from rap stockpiles is investigated in two ways in the first approach samples are collected directly from the rap stockpile s leachate in the field and leaching analysis is performed on the samples however in the second approach little amount of the rap stockpile is collected and then contaminant leaching from the material is evaluated by widely used laboratory leaching tests such as tclp and splp sadecki et al 1996 conducted a field study on leachate flow from a rap stockpile in minnesota usa the cone shaped stockpile with a 6 1 meter base diameter was placed on a circular pad of granular material covered with an impermeable membrane to direct the runoff to the edges and sampling was done consecutively the results illustrated that pah concentrations were below or barely higher than detection limits and did not pose any concern total solids concentration decreased with increasing storm volume the main reason for this change was the bitumen covering the aggregates in rap materials that hinders contact between acidic water and aggregates in another study norin and stromvall 2004 constructed a test site consisting of two circular stockpiles in addition to leaching analysis in the field the laboratory column test was performed on two different samples of scarified asphalt concrete one sample was taken from the road during the milling process and the other sample was taken from the stockpile two years after storage they reported significant rates of semi volatile organic pollutants in the leachate of both stockpiles also in the scarified asphalt the concentrations of pahs in both samples were higher than the swedish recommended value therefore we can infer that stockpiled rap potentially leads to environmental problems the most common organic pollutants identified in this study were naphthalene butylated hydroxytoluene bht and dibutyl phthalate dbp in addition column test results showed that the highest total organic carbon toc concentration of 33 mg kg occurred in the leachate of the sample collected during the milling process which decreased by 50 after two years of storing the samples in the stockpile licbinsky et al 2012 performed a leaching analysis on two leaching collection containers placed inside a rap stockpile to consider natural leaching conditions the leachates collected in the first and second containers were analyzed to determine metals and pah levels after 60 days and 135 days respectively results showed high concentrations of toc and dissolved organic carbon doc for both containers moreover cu molybdenum mo pb vanadium v and cd concentrations were almost equal in the vessels however in the first sample barium ba cobalt co cr and zn metals and pahs were higher than in the second sample this might be related to releasing large quantities of the materials from the rap s surface at the beginning of the precipitation test brantley and townsend 1999 conducted comprehensive laboratory research on the leaching characteristics of different rap stockpiles in florida they reported that concentrations of all studied pollutants including vocs pahs and heavy metals were below detection limits and tclp regulations except for pb whose concentration was higher than its respective groundwater standard limit concentrations of contaminants in all rap samples also diminished to levels below the regulatory limits over time except for one sample the highest concentrations of pb were found in old rap samples illustrating that the pb source was related to vehicle traffic pollution legret et al 2005 compared the results of batch and column leaching tests on rap stockpiles with the leaching data of a new conventional asphalt sampled during production at a hot mix asphalt plant and virgin aggregates as these materials have the same origin they concluded that the traffic induced pollutants in rap were generally less than the pollutants in the new conventional asphalt and virgin aggregates in addition the concentration of heavy metals in the rap remained below the values of the standard limit for drinking water ec directive 3 november 1998 however the concentrations of hydrocarbons in rap were 3 2 times higher than those in the new conventional asphalt yang et al 2020 investigated the impact of soil on possible metal retention during the leaching process they reported that the presence of soil reduced the level of manganese mn and ni thus using a soil layer between the rap and groundwater was recommended if the amount of pollutant exceeds the limit specified by u s epa furthermore a dominant parameter affecting the contaminant leaching from rap is the ph range of the leachate a study conducted by seybou insa et al 2021 in maryland on rap samples illustrated that the leaching concentration of as ba zn mg ca and b constantly decreased as ph increased in addition a geochemical analysis performed in the study to find out the nature and source of the metals leaching from the rap samples revealed that dissolution precipitation reactions controlled the leaching of some metals including al ba ca cu fe mg and zn the leaching of mg was controlled through the reaction of the element and carbonate minerals al and fe solubility was controlled by oxide and hydroxide solids and ba and ca leaching was controlled by reacting with carbonate and sulfate minerals 3 2 leaching of asphalt mixtures and pavement layers containing rap material studies generally agree that the leaching of most pollutants from asphalt pavements containing rap was below the allowable level except for pentavalent arsenic as v mn antimony sb pb cu zn chrysene and pyrene mena 2019 mijic et al 2020 shedivy et al 2012 leaching of as ba calcium ca mg and zn also depends on the ph value it was suggested that this issue can be due to the cationic behavior of the elements such that as the ph increases the concentration of these metals decreases uniformly moreover as v is separated from water in current purification processes so the presence of as more than the permitted level in leachates is not a concern insa 2017 namasivayam and ranganathan 1995 it is worth mentioning that the amount of contaminant leaching is highly dependent on the l s ratio vu 2019 reported that metal leaching increases considerably in unsaturated conditions l s from 0 1 to 10 ml g but in saturated conditions l s 10 ml g leaching is stable the performance of asphalt mixtures containing rap is typically inferior compared to hma therefore the rap containing mixtures are usually improved with some additives such as fa geopolymers kang et al 2011 observed that contaminant leaching from samples of rap fa and natural aggregates blends completely depends on fa content only inorganic chemicals whose concentrations were higher than the epa drinking water standard were cr and aluminum al an increase in the use of fa in asphalt mixtures caused a decrease in the concentration of al and a rise in the concentration of cr in the leachate in addition hoy et al 2016 showed that rap 20 fa could be safely used as a base material fa geopolymers could effectively stabilize rap and reduce the leaching level of heavy metals the amount of contaminant leaching from asphalt mixtures is also related to the physical characteristics of the mixtures as an instance vu 2019 reported that a decrease in the compaction level of asphalt mixtures increased the metal leaching so the compaction is inversely correlated with contaminant leaching a summary of research on rap leaching in the pavement is given in table 2 4 leaching characteristics of porous permeable asphalt pavement pap pap encompasses more than 20 air void content in its structure elizondo martínez et al 2020 liu and borst 2018 zhao et al 2019 zhao and zhu 2019 pap can help recharge groundwater basins more efficiently than conventional asphalt pavements which can be very useful in areas that suffer from excessive groundwater depletion due to overdraft charlesworth et al 2017 winston et al 2020 additionally using pap is a method to manage runoff and it can drain surface water quickly because of its unique structure which is very helpful in the event of a flood abdollahian et al 2018 beecham et al 2010 farooqi 2018 when surface water passes through the pap system the underground water or soil may be contaminated thus evaluating the filtration capability of paps and their effects on reducing the contaminants is essential barbis 2009 collins et al 2010 liu et al 2021b valinski and chandler 2015 fig 8 depicts the leaching characteristics of pap research on contaminant leaching from pap which is summarized in table 3 indicated that the pavement is generally more effective at removing metal contaminants hydrocarbons pahs total suspended solids tss and undissolved cationic contaminants and less effective at discarding nutrients total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp dissolved anionic contaminants and it is unsuccessful in enhancing chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod however in some cases pap could not infiltrate metal contaminants including zn and cu due to the low ph of the leachate dissolving and causing them to leach through the pavements flanagan et al 2018 murakami et al 2008 murphy et al 2015 ostrom and davis 2019 it is worth mentioning that the filtration of the pollutants may cause a severe problem the clogging of the pap s porosities the challenge should be resolved by road maintenance operations such as pressure jetting and vacuuming boving et al 2007 charlesworth et al 2017 legret et al 2007 the size of suspended solid ss particles is a key factor affecting the level of the contaminant leaching from paps which cannot trap very fine particles legret et al 1996 reported that pap could filtrate particles whose sizes were larger than 83 5 μm boving et al 2007 showed that the type and concentrations of contaminants in leachate are not identical in different seasons nutrient concentrations were higher during spring and autumn fertilizer application whereas metal and chloride concentrations were higher in late winter and early spring as road salting is maximum they also indicated that pap was more effective at removing metal contaminants than eliminating nutrients in addition paps hardly remove dissolved anionic contaminants nitrate and chloride in contrast cationic and undissolved pollutants such as tss zn and total petroleum hydrocarbons tph are almost entirely trapped by paps roseen et al 2012 some initiatives boost the efficiency of pp systems in the removal of contaminants rahman et al 2015 illustrated that the removal efficiency of pps increased as geotextiles and construction and demolition c d materials were used in the systems however among the c d materials rap showed the lowest level of contaminant removal due to its higher permeability likewise the use of bilayer geotextiles resulted in better performance than monolayer geotextiles the physical characteristics of paps mostly affect the removal efficiency of the pavements kayhanian et al 2019 showed that the temperature and aging of pavement materials do not affect the percentage of contaminants because these parameters only affect asphalt pavements chemical and mechanical attributes zhao and zhu 2019 examined the leaching characteristics of four heavy metals i e zn pb cu and cr percolated from a pa mixture containing municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash aggregate mswi baa results showed that the most critical factor affecting heavy metal leaching was mswi baa particle size using mswi baa in pa mixtures also increased cr and zn concentrations in the leachate other factors affecting concentrations of organic matter and nutrients in infiltrated leachate from paps are rainfall regime and intensity hernandez crespo et al 2019 showed that the concentrations of the contaminants in the infiltrated leachate under the mediterranean rainfall regime were higher than the measured values under the atlantic ocean regime it was also concluded that the higher the intensity of rainfall the greater the leachability of nutrients and organic matter from paps in addition they reported that the cleaning in dry conditions could significantly reduce contaminant leaching when heavy rainfalls were forecasted another approach that can be adopted to increase the removal efficiency of contaminants in the runoff by pa systems is to use some materials including activated carbon ac geopolymer gp conventional and porous zeolites diatomite slag ceramsite and vesuvianite that can absorb pollutants fig 9 hu et al 2019 kang et al 2019 rasaki et al 2019 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 acs and gps remove pollutants in two ways in the first process contaminants adhere to the surface of these absorbers by van der waals forces physisorption in the second process they reduce contaminants by creating a chemical bond between the contaminant and the surface of these absorbers chemisorption it is worth mentioning that in the physical removal method first process the higher the specific surface area of the absorbers the more the contaminants adhere to their surfaces so an important parameter in the adsorption efficiency is the porosity of the absorbers in this regard the adsorption performance is more efficient at porous acs and gps tan et al 2020 yuan et al 2022 li et al 2021 showed a significant improvement in the purification performance of pa mixture when diatomite and red mud were used as alternative fillers in the mixture the purification performance of the pa mixture without the absorbers in removing ss and other contaminants was less than 60 and 20 respectively however the absorbers increased the mixture s capability by 50 in removing heavy metals and by 40 55 in removing tp and tn it was found that the high purification performance of the mixture resulted from both physical adsorption and chemical degradation it was also reported that the contaminants were mostly removed through physical adsorption because of numerous porous structures and the large specific surface area of diatomite and red mud fig 10 represents the filtration performance of some of the absorbers studies on the adsorption performance of some gps and porous gps have shown that the materials can remove contaminants such as pb cu cr ni cd mercury hg zn mn and co in leachates milad et al 2021 rasaki et al 2019 tan et al 2020 in addition ac effectively eliminates non point source nps pollution such as toluene ethylbenzene benzene and xylene caused by vehicle traffic exhaust huang and liang 2018 huang and liang 2021 wang et al 2019 the adsorption performance of the materials varies when they are used in different percentages and applications hu et al 2019 gupta et al 2019 reported that using 8 to 16 ac in porous asphalt mixtures can be sufficient to adsorb nps vehicle contaminants the required amount of ac can be used in base and granular layers without creating any excessive stiffness for top layers leading to cracking chen 2014 a summary of research on pap systems performance in reducing contaminant leaching is presented in table 3 5 leaching of substances from asphalt mixtures and pavement layers containing waste materials after the industrial revolution the exploitation of natural resources has increased more significantly than ever before resulting in some environmental problems nowadays industries have begun to change their policies in exploiting natural resources and manipulating the environment to take steps toward sustainable development bamigboye et al 2021 among all existing industries the construction industry is recognized as one of the largest consumers of natural resources motz and geiseler 2001 zhao et al 2020 in this industry road construction and paving are sections with the most exploitation of natural resources extracting natural aggregates for use in different parts of the pavement is associated with various environmental problems these environmental challenges exist in different parts of the extraction process including extraction from nature i e explosion drilling excavation and crushing and transportation chouhan et al 2017 gautam et al 2018 therefore these environmental issues should be controlled and reduced by providing solutions one way to address the environmental issues caused by using natural resources and virgin materials in the road construction industry is to reuse waste material agrela et al 2021 do nascimento et al 2019 edil 2013 salehi et al 2021 fig 11 shows the evolutionary trend toward sustainable development leading to less hazardous materials and a green world there are three common ways to manage waste materials shown schematically in fig 12 according to fig 12 a one of the most basic methods is the disposal of waste material in landfills goutam mukherjee et al 2021 nanda and berruti 2020 salihoglu 2010 leaching various pollutants into groundwater surface water soil and vegetation around the landfill is one of the critical environmental concerns that arise from this method another common method for managing waste materials is to incinerate them in waste incinerator factories as shown in fig 12 b the high amount of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and air pollution are the main problems caused by adopting this method emek and kara 2007 marieta et al 2021 singh et al 2018 as shown in fig 12 c these materials can be reused in asphalt mixtures as another method of waste management gedik 2020 leng et al 2018 piao et al 2021 wu and montalvo 2021 this strategy can help protect the environment in two ways first waste and recycled materials in asphalt mixtures base or subbase layers lead to a reduction in the consumption of natural and mineral aggregates or fillers resulting in better natural resources conservation and environmental protection second since waste materials from different industries can cause excessive leaching of pollutants to soil and groundwater if they are dumped in nature using these materials in asphalt mixtures can effectively prevent or minimize soil and groundwater contamination debbarma et al 2020 del valle zermeno et al 2014 taha et al 1999 tian et al 2021 however the initiative does not completely eliminate the leaching of contaminants therefore more research should be done to understand the leaching behavior of using waste and recycled materials in asphalt pavements waste produced from different sources can be used as an alternative to fillers aggregates or additives in asphalt mixtures and coarse aggregates in base or sub base layers arabani et al 2017 bocci 2018 cui et al 2021a saltan et al 2015 sargın et al 2013 aggregates are considered the main components of asphalt mixtures in terms of weight volume and flexibility of pavements countries are looking for alternative materials for use in pavements as both fine and coarse aggregates nwakaire et al 2020 tahmoorian et al 2017 thives and ghisi 2017 production of waste by various industries and humans is inevitable so using these materials as aggregate in the pavement industry may reduce environmental problems and meet the requirements of sustainable development procedures and standards do nascimento et al 2019 gautam et al 2018 waste to energy wte ash municipal solid waste msw s slags crt glass and recycled concrete aggregate rca are among the waste materials of other industries used as aggregate substitutes in various types of asphalt mixtures bestgen et al 2016 chiu et al 2009 dubey and townsend 2007 hasita et al 2021 you et al 2021 since the leaching of pollutants from these materials may cause environmental problems it is important to determine the amount and type of contaminants leaching from them as an illustration three elements including al cl and total dissolved solids tds were detected to present a potential risk of leaching when wtes are reused in pavement mixtures cl and tds concentrations declined over time and reached below regulatory limits nevertheless al concentration in leachates was still more than the regulatory limit even at the final sampling event dubey and townsend 2007 roessler et al 2015 in addition when more than 15 of biomass bottom ash was used as aggregate leaching of sb cu ni cr hg as and mo was detected to be more than the allowable limit therefore how much aggregates are replaced by the waste materials directly affects the amount of contaminant leaching cabrera et al 2016 moreover a recommended solution for preventing metal leaching when steel slags are replaced by aggregates in asphalt mixtures is to place a clayey embankment soil under an asphalt layer containing steel slag which can mitigate metal leaching to some extent dayioglu and aydilek 2019 table 4 provides an overview of research on the analysis of leaching of waste materials after use in asphalt mixtures as aggregates in different layers and pavement types filler is one of the most critical components of asphalt mixtures although fillers are used to a less extent than other components they can significantly impact the properties and performance of asphalt mixtures aljassar et al 2004 grabowski and wilanowicz 2008 zulkati et al 2012 today rock dust cement and hydrated lime are commonly used as fillers in asphalt mixtures extraction of the materials directly from the earth s crust leads to vegetation loss adverse impacts on surface and groundwater lack of raw materials and ecosystem disruption lesueur et al 2012 robinson et al 2004 waste materials including c d wastes e g dust and fine aggregates from recycled bricks and concrete agriculture wastes e g rice husk ash domestic wastes e g rubber and glass waste waste incinerators and industrial wastes e g cement kiln dust ckd coal waste cw powder and cu slag cs powder can be considered as suitable alternatives to fillers in asphalt mixtures choudhary et al 2020 kalantar et al 2012 liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b zhang et al 2020a however the environmental threats caused by leaching contaminants from waste materials before and after use in asphalt mixtures should be studied in more depth the chemical and physical reactions of various components of asphalt mixtures with waste materials play key roles in reducing the leaching of contaminants from the waste materials bamigboye et al 2021 huang and liang 2018 lu et al 2020 xue et al 2009 reported that when mswifa was used as a filler contaminant concentrations were below the detection limit this reduction resulted from the stabilization and solidification of the waste materials by the bitumen in the asphalt mixture li et al 2022 classified incineration fly ash ifa as a hazardous waste containing many toxic elements such as pb cr and zn the pb concentration in the ifa leachate was much higher than the maximum allowable limit determined by the chinese standard gb 5085 3 2007 2007 however contaminant leaching significantly decreased when ifa was used in the asphalt mixture asphalt with good adhesion chemical stability and impermeability covered and fixed ifa particles the contaminants were also solidified through physical and chemical interactions between the pollutants and cement hydration products such as hydrated c s h gels and ettringite in addition to using fine waste materials as filler these materials can also be used as alternatives to bitumen modifiers and additives in asphalt mixes typically cw cw ash cwa cs and ckd have replaced additives behnood et al 2015 modarres and ayar 2014 modarres et al 2015 zarrinkamar and modarres 2020 moreover nano ceramic powder ncp polyphthalamide acid ppa crumb rubber and nano fibrous carbon nfc have been substituted with modifiers fathollahi et al 2022 hussein et al 2017 murugan et al 2020 xu and zhang 2020 this combination has not only improved the mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures but also reduced contaminant leaching from pure waste materials because of adhesion and chemical bonds formed between these materials and the components of asphalt mixtures cho et al 2020 gautam et al 2018 tan et al 2020 fig 13 a shows the reduction of pb leaching from crt glass after using the waste material in the asphalt mixture fig 13 b represents fa particles surrounded and trapped by bitumen after adding to the mixtures and fig 13 c illustrates the mechanism of preventing potential pollutions from entering leachate tables 5 and 6 overview the research that analyzed contaminant leaching after reusing waste materials in asphalt mixtures as fillers modifiers and additives 6 critical discussion bibliometric data of this review revealed significant growth in the research of contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements over the last three years the number of published articles during 2019 2021 has more than doubled the number of articles published during 2016 2018 in addition more than 80 of these articles have been published in the journals categorized as q1 in the scimago journal rank sjr indicating the interest of authoritative sources of knowledge in finding out the leaching characteristics of asphalt pavements and methods of avoiding subsequent environmental risks according to the evident signs of the importance of this issue for the scientific community and to direct the pavement industry towards eco friendly and sustainable development strategies we believe that it is necessary to create a community of practice and hold specialized conferences on the analysis of contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements to communicate and unify researchers and officials aiming to solve the environmental problem relevant journals are also recommended to assign some special issues to the topic to collect the latest findings on this subject expeditiously and increase the issue s visibility and readership quantitative evaluation of the measurement tools and experiments used to analyze the contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements showed that researchers have usually used batch tests probably regardless of the materials and structure of the considered asphalt pavement and only following the methods used in previous studies experts need to provide guidelines recommending the most appropriate leaching measurement test in different cases it is evident that one of the most efficient ways to prevent excessive leaching of contaminants from rap stockpiles is to balance rap production and demand but it is not usually practical due to the huge and unpredictable volume of rap production spreadbury et al 2021 two crucial actions are required to make this strategy feasible the first one is to create a database of the existing quantity of rap and develop models to estimate the future quantity of rap production in a specific region the second one is to find new opportunities to reuse rap which needs running some research projects with the financial support of governments and beneficial companies recently researchers have reused rap in other civil engineering applications resulting in mechanical and environmental benefits bressi et al 2022 ullah et al 2022 it seems that there are multiple opportunities to reuse rap that have not been discovered yet nevertheless balancing rap production and demand cannot prevent temporary stockpiling of rap during construction activities to prevent the leaching of contaminants from temporary rap stockpiles they should be located as far as possible from rivers and other surface water bodies waterproofing membranes should also be laid above and below the stockpiles in areas with high precipitation moreover projects should be scheduled in a way that rap and other waste materials are stockpiled during low precipitation seasons the articles that have analyzed the leaching characteristics of pap generally have shown the ability of the asphalt pavement to prevent the leaching of some contaminants including heavy metals and its inability to control the leaching of other pollutants such as nutrients brown and borst 2015 drake et al 2014 if this shortcoming is addressed to an acceptable level pap can be recommended as one of the most suitable types of asphalt pavement for industrial areas where pavements are exposed to various pollutants in this regard some researchers have tried to boost the efficiency of pap in leaching reduction by adding photocatalysts and adsorbents such as ac to pap s mix design hu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 kang et al 2019 liu et al 2021b however it seems that there is still a research gap in this area another important issue that needs special attention is the relationship between sustainable development and the leaching of contaminants from asphalt pavements reusing waste materials provides many advantages including resource and energy conservation reducing ghg emissions and diminishing the risk of global warming however it may cause serious environmental impacts especially the leaching of contaminants from the waste materials allegrini et al 2015 dierks et al 2021 to adopt a thorough strategy to reuse and recycle waste materials it is recommended to perform a life cycle assessment lca as a tool for evaluating the sustainability level of the project after assigning an inventory of the analysis to the evaluation of contaminant leaching during service life piao et al 2022 7 conclusions and future research needs this work evaluates different leaching tests of asphalt pavements and analyzes previous investigations on leaching characteristics of paps as well as asphalt pavements containing rap and waste materials the conclusions are listed below afterward future research needs are provided to contribute researchers to pursuing thorough research direction 7 1 conclusions leaching analysis laboratory tests are divided into two main groups batch or static and column or dynamic tests other common tests used to analyze leaching that cannot be incorporated into the major categories include tank and ph dependent tests in general in all tests contact time between sample and solution l s ratio and ph value of leachate are influential parameters in leaching analysis most studies have used batch tests to analyze leaching from asphalt pavements the most common batch tests are tclp and splp batch tests spanning 14 days have the shortest required time to be performed and ph test with 35 days column test with 42 days and tank test with 84 days have longer execution times another advantage of batch tests over other standard tests is that the test needs only one dissolved sample but other tests need 3 to 12 samples to be performed batch tests can simulate the condition in which a sample is exposed to acid rain or landfill over the next 100 years and they better simulate actual conditions in batch tests unlike other tests the sample and solution are thoroughly mixed and contamination contacts the solution regardless of its location in the sample additionally unlike the column test in which the column s material itself may act as a contamination filter the test sample does not work as a contamination filter in batch tests the maximum grain size of materials must be 9 5 mm for batch tests and asphalt samples cannot be tested integrated using the tests for example the batch tests are not suitable for analyzing the leaching of paps because the integrity of their structure is critical in investigating their leaching characteristic and filtration capability in batch tests crushing the pa samples and destroying the sample s structure causes the results to deviate from accurate values column tests can be used for a wide range of granular materials but they also cannot examine the leaching characteristics of materials integrated as a significant result the homogeneity of the material is directly related to the accuracy of the test results nevertheless the tank test is a suitable leaching analysis test for integrated and dense granular materials it can address the shortcoming of batch and column tests in analyzing the leaching characteristics of the materials the ph dependent test has been designed to investigate the relation between the leaching of various contaminants and the ph of the solution using this test is not also recommended to analyze the leaching characteristics of integrated materials in addition the finer the grain size of materials the more accurate the test results field tests are not common for leaching analysis due to the test s long execution time and complex implementation however these tests are required in some cases namely leaching assessment of stockpiled rap contaminants that may settle on asphalt during service life are simulated in none of the leaching analysis tests this literature review revealed that 38 of studies had used some tests apart from conventional tests for leaching analysis it can be concluded that researchers are looking for more comprehensive tests to simulate more real leaching conditions as a suggestion for future tests all environmental conditions such as humidity and wind speed should be taken into account to simulate natural leaching conditions as accurately as possible in addition contaminants affecting pavements over a long period should also be considered moreover the impact of the soil layers around the pavement and between the groundwater table and the pavement should be seen in the design of new tests in general the leaching of pollutants from rap can be examined from two perspectives leaching from the stockpiled rap and leaching from rap used in different pavement layers researchers have analyzed leaching from stockpiled rap using laboratory and field tests results of most studies that used laboratory tests indicated that the leaching of contaminants from the stockpiled rap was lower than permissible values however field tests on stockpiled raps mainly showed that the amount of contaminant leached from them was higher than the allowable limits this could indicate the inefficiency of laboratory tests to assess the environmental concerns of stockpiled rap and the lack of accurate simulation of natural leaching conditions by these tests the field tests also showed that the more time passed the more pollutants leached from the stockpiled rap studies showed that using rap either alone or mixed with fa and natural aggregates in the base and subbase layers could not pose any environmental risk leaching data represented that the use of rap on highway shoulders is not environmentally friendly and causes leaching of pollutants more than allowable limits studies also found that the best way to prevent the leaching of contaminants from stockpiled rap is to balance the production and demand of rap but it is probably not practical another suggestion is to reduce the deposit time of materials if the deposit time of rap is not manageable using a soil layer under the rap deposit can reduce the leaching of rap contaminations to groundwater investigations showed that the leaching from the rap stockpiles was mainly above the standard limit but after using the rap in different pavement layers the leaching of pollutants decreased to some extent and in some cases the leaching of contaminants became less than allowable levels nonetheless in some studies it has been observed that the use of rap in pavement layers increased the leaching of pollutants and caused environmental problems but due to the limited number of such cases they have been attributed to the rap obtained from the studied area and excessive contamination of the rap leaching analyses on pap have shown that while passing runoff through this type of pavement heavy metals e g zn pb cd cu tss and pahs are trapped in the porous structure and the pollutants are significantly removed from the runoff enhancing the quality of water passing through the porosities however paps are not successful in eliminating contaminants such as p n and dissolved anionic pollutants e g nitrate and chloride it is worth mentioning that the productivity of paps can be enhanced using geotextiles and some contaminant absorbers such as gp zeolites diatomite slag ceramsite and vesuvianite in different asphalt layers likewise the filtration performance of paps is significantly related to the ph of the leachate and the type of contaminants in terms of their anionic or cationic nature for example high ph runoff penetrating a pap causes the filtration of orthophosphate with metal cations trapping contaminants in the pores of paps or filtration process over time causes clogging of these pores and reduces filtration performance of this type of pavement another cause of the clogging is the deposition of clay and dust in the pores this problem can be addressed through preservative measures such as high pressure water jets and vacuums overall it is recommended to use pap in areas where runoff contains heavy metals and tss especially in industrial areas additionally one of the challenging issues in this area is the design of void contents in pap so that it has both admissible mechanical properties and the most optimal filtration performance given that conventional leaching tests cannot be used to analyze the leaching characteristics of pap properly it is suggested to develop a comprehensive method simulating actual leaching conditions to examine their leaching properties more accurately one way to prevent environmental risks caused by waste materials is to use them as an alternative to aggregates in pavement systems trapping and removal of contaminants existing in waste materials after using them in asphalt mixture generally result from physical stabilization and solidification of the waste materials by bitumen and chemical reaction between asphalt mixture components and the waste materials research in this field has shown that using waste materials such as msw and steel slag as a replacement for all or part of aggregates in asphalt mixtures can adequately prevent the leaching of contaminants from these waste materials although using some waste materials such as wte in asphalt mixtures may cause some contaminants such as al to leach more than the allowable values the leaching of most contaminants such as ag as cd se pb and pahs is probably less than the detection limits leaching from some waste materials may become more than allowable limits if they are exposed to water in these cases the wastes can be used as alternative materials to aggregates to construct beneath layers base and subbase layers if the above layers are low permeable furthermore waste materials are sometimes used as fillers in asphalt mixtures according to studies in this field it was concluded that using waste materials such as fa msw calcium carbide and cws as alternative fillers is completely effective in limiting the leaching of pollutants from the materials and causes no environmental hazard also in some cases waste material is used as an additive in asphalt mixtures few studies have examined this issue from an environmental point of view they showed that the use of waste materials as additives could adequately control the leaching of these materials 7 2 future research needs it is suggested that researchers can focus on the points listed below for their future works development of laboratory leaching tests considering the effects of environmental factors including wind speed humidity temperature and light intensity during the measurement process investigation of the effects of freezing thawing wetting drying and weathering on contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements capability evaluation of recently developed approaches namely biological methods in reducing leaching of some contaminants such as nutrients significantly leached from asphalt pavements especially paps lca and life cycle cost analysis lcca of recommended contaminant leaching management strategies namely pap waste and rap recycling developing a prediction model of contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements employing machine learning algorithms regarding availability of huge experimental data addressing these issues is essential for controlling the leaching of pollutants from the pavements and it can help specialists maintain the quality of groundwater and surface water resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
15882,in recent years the pavement industry has been seeking sustainable development through recycling reclaimed asphalt pavement and reusing other waste materials as replacements for asphalt mixture constituents incorporating waste material into asphalt mixture and the presence of pollutants such as exhaust fumes and gasoline due to vehicle traffic may lead to contaminants leaching from asphalt pavements to underlying soil layers and groundwater aquifers posing serious risks to ecosystems and the environment to cast light on contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements this article presents a comprehensive review of the literature that is divided into four research areas evaluation of leaching measurement methods leaching from recycled asphalt materials leaching characteristics of porous asphalt pavements and waste modified asphalt mixtures moreover a critical discussion of bibliometric data literature content and knowledge gaps in this domain is provided to help highway agencies and environmental scientists address contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements finally some potential research directions are suggested for future research works graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords road runoff contaminant leaching leaching measurement tests reclaimed asphalt pavement porous asphalt pavement waste modified asphalt mixtures 1 introduction asphalt pavement although a vital infrastructure adversely affects the environment from the beginning of construction to the end of the service life the adverse impacts include but are not limited to high energy consumption excessive utilization of non renewable natural resources and relevant environmental problems caused by material extraction transportation production and paving processes asadi azadgoleh et al 2021 qiao et al 2020 wang et al 2021 wei et al 2021 one of the most important environmental issues of asphalt pavements is the leaching of contaminants to underlying soil layers and groundwater aquifers this concern always exists until the end of the service life of asphalt pavements mijic et al 2020 yang et al 2020 therefore research on the leaching from the pavements should be given more attention from different points of view to provide executive tips for pavement engineers and highway agencies asphalt pavements are generally composed of aggregates bitumen fillers and additives bitumen used in asphalt pavements is an inorganic material obtained from the distillation of crude oil containing different hydrocarbons lesueur 2009 mohammadi and modarres 2022 asphalt pavements are also exposed to various pollutants due to vehicle traffic such as exhaust fumes gasoline lubricating oils brake and tire wear wastes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah and de icing salts moreover pavements are subjected to some heavy metals such as nickel ni chromium cr copper cu cadmium cd lead pb and zinc z backstrom et al 2004 campisano et al 2017 legret et al 2005 xu and zhang 2020 vehicle exhaust is the main source of pb in pavements jeong et al 2022 nriagu 1990 z and cd are mainly deposited on the asphalt surface due to vehicle tire wear and the corrosion of traffic barriers made of galvanized steel vehicle brake wear causes cu to penetrate pavements in addition pahs result from the incomplete combustion of organic materials brandt and de groot 2001 muller et al 2022 spreadbury et al 2021 xu et al 2021 precipitation causing runoff formation on the pavement surface triggers the leaching of the pollutants to soil layers and groundwater resources linh et al 2020 mijic et al 2020 mittal et al 2022 webber et al 2022 today highway agencies reuse waste materials into asphalt pavement due to the commonality of this approach it is essential to pay attention to the leaching of contaminants from the asphalt pavements containing waste and recycled materials huang et al 2007 yang et al 2018 you et al 2021 one of the popular recycled materials replacing asphalt mixture constituents is reclaimed asphalt pavement rap abdalfattah et al 2021 rap supply and demand do not always coincide less than half of the rap is recycled into asphalt pavements but a significant proportion of it is always stockpiled in 2017 for example nearly 73 million tons of rap were used to build asphalt pavements on us streets and 91 million tons were stockpiled for later use brantley and townsend 1999 napa 2019 spreadbury et al 2021 therefore rap leaching can be investigated from two perspectives contaminant leaching from the stockpiled rap and asphalt pavement containing rap gedik 2020 huang et al 2007 norin and stromvall 2004 in recent years waste material management has become one of the most significant considerations of modern urban societies holm and simon 2017 li et al 2017 these materials can be managed in various ways namely burial incineration and recycling choudhary et al 2020 incineration of waste material causes environmental pollution by releasing pollutant gasses into the atmosphere burying or releasing these substances into the environment and then exposing them to rain may also result in ecological pollution through leaching gori et al 2011 another way to prevent the release of waste material into nature and reduce the use of virgin materials is to reuse waste materials in the construction of asphalt pavements disfani et al 2012 gautam et al 2018 jamshidi and white 2019 some of the waste materials used in asphalt pavements are municipal solid waste ash mswa wood ash wa cathode ray tube crt glass and fly ash fa dimter et al 2021 ding et al 2021 mohamad et al 2020 yinfei et al 2020 nevertheless using the waste materials in asphalt pavements may adversely affect the pavements leaching behavior which should be addressed cho et al 2020 porous asphalt pavement pap is another noteworthy field of research in environmental concerns related to the pavement formerly known as the open graded friction course ogfc and classified as a hot mix asphalt hma mixture jiang et al 2015 murphy et al 2015 the most apparent difference between this type of mixture and traditional asphalt mixtures is the air void content pap usually has a 15 20 air void compared to conventional asphalts with a 3 6 air void elizondo martã nez et al 2020 because of having a high proportion of air void pap readily transfers surface water to the lower layers preventing the hydroplaning phenomenon which improves road users safety level and comfort roseen et al 2012 yu et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b likewise one of the environmental merits attributed to paps is their effective performance in filtering and removing runoff pollutants in this regard it is vital to evaluate how effectively paps reduce the concentration of pollutants in underlying soil layers and groundwater aquifers holleran et al 2016 liu et al 2021b razzaghmanesh and borst 2019 scholz and grabowiecki 2007 several tests have been suggested to assess the type and amount of pollutants leaching from different asphalt pavements under various environmental conditions these tests include toxicity characteristics leaching procedure tclp synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp column leaching test tank leaching test and ph dependent leaching test cabrera et al 2020b cui et al 2021a cui et al 2021b krol et al 2020 rahmad et al 2021 to choose between available tests and interpret their results it is crucial to have a deep understanding of their mechanisms and proper applications this study intends to review and analyze different aspects of leaching characteristics of asphalt pavements critically and clarify their ambiguous aspects overall this research comprehensively encompasses four fundamental domains as listed below leaching measurement tools and experiments leaching characteristics of stockpiled rap and asphalt pavements containing rap leaching characteristics of asphalt pavements containing industrial mineral and urban waste materials leaching characteristics of paps the information can potentially be used by relevant sectors such as governments highway agencies contractors and stakeholders to address the adverse impacts of leaching pollutants from asphalt pavements on the surrounding environment fig 1 illustrates the simplified flowchart of what this research presents 2 leaching measurement of asphalt pavements there are about 50 leaching tests for different materials and conditions but few of them resemble actual conditions guzman martinez et al 2020 lu et al 2019 piazza et al 2018 torras et al 2011 zampori et al 2009 generally laboratory leaching tests can be categorized into two main groups batch or static tests and column or dynamic tests in static tests the leaching solution is a single additive and is not renewed during the test however in dynamic tests the leaching solution is restored during the test imoto et al 2018 lov et al 2019 the common types of leaching tests are examined below 2 1 batch leaching tests a batch leaching test procedure starts with exposing a certain amount of solid material with a certain size to a specific volume of leachate yasutaka et al 2017 then a leachate sample is collected for analysis after separation from the solids in this test procedure important variables are the leaching solution liquid to solid ratio l s and contact time batch tests are quicker and easier to perform compared to column tests batch systems are also cheaper than column tests and produce chemical data for additional environmental analyses álvarez ayuso and murciego 2021 darama et al 2021 van der sloot and kosson 2012 two of the most common batch leaching tests are tclp epa 1992 and splp epa 1994 tclp is a leaching test method developed by the u s environmental protection agency epa to evaluate certain contaminants leaching potential from waste material in landfills the test was designed to determine the mobility of organic and inorganic compounds present in solid liquid and multiphase wastes in the test the bulk material is crushed to a grain size of 9 5 mm and added to a leaching solution and then allowed to be soaked for a specified period up to a few days this solution can either be tclp fluid or deionized water di a typical soaking time is 24 hours and is carried out in a covered 2 5 l glass jar l s of 5 10 15 and 20 are used to characterize any relationship between the l s ratio and leaching characteristics the final ph of the leachate is measured and then the liquid is separated from the material and ultimately analyzed for contaminants such as heavy metals pah and the volatile organic compound voc in the splp test the extraction fluid consists of nitric and sulfuric acid to simulate acidic rainwater a small sample of material is placed in an extraction vessel and mixed with the extraction fluid the mixture is rotated for 18 2 hours at 30 rpm rounds per minute the leachate is then filtered and analyzed for a further chemical survey chew et al 2022 cui et al 2021b epa 1992 epa 1994 rahmad et al 2021 fig 2 shows the different steps of performing tclp and splp tests 2 2 column leaching test a column test is another type of leaching test used to study the leaching process from the material this method is suitable for a wide range of granular solids such as industrial wastes soil sludge combustion residues sediments and construction wastes jaques et al 2017 this method is unsuitable for monolithic materials including cement based and stabilized materials unless the material size is reduced to the standard size required before testing furthermore it cannot be used to calculate volatile organic leaching the more homogeneous the particles in the column the more particles are likely to be exposed to the leaching solution simultaneously increasing the accuracy of the test this test is often assumed to be more representative of natural field conditions than a batch test townsend et al 2003 during the column test the leaching solution constantly flows through the material placed in a column in addition column tests can be performed under both saturated and unsaturation conditions unsaturated conditions are usually performed to simulate vadose zone placement dan et al 2021 epa 2013a naka et al 2016 yang et al 2020 the experimental method of this test is shown in fig 3 2 3 other leaching tests in addition to column and batch leaching tests tank and ph dependent leaching tests are among the common procedures to analyze the potential environmental risks of solid materials okeke et al 2020 sanger et al 2020 townsend et al 2003 2 3 1 tank leaching test the process of performing this test is shown in fig 4 the tank test method involves rinsing the monolithic or dense granular material in a tank that is full of reagent water monolithic specimens can be cylindrical or cubic while granular specimens can be compressed into cylindrical molds with the desired moisture content using modified compactor density methods soultanidis et al 2022 samples are placed in reagent water with a specified ratio of liquid to surface area l a the reagent water is then replaced with fresh reagent water after a particular time and this process is repeated nine times at the end of each iteration the sample is separated from the reagent water and the mass of the sample is recorded to control the amount of effluent absorbed in the solid matrix likewise the ph and specific conductivity are calculated and this information is recorded afterward by analyzing the obtained data the leaching parameters are computed following the last renewal of the reagent water the total time required for this test is 63 days epa 2013b facin et al 2021 rahmad et al 2021 xu and zhang 2020 2 3 2 ph dependent leaching test this test calculates the amount of contaminant leaching from the sample according to changes in the ph of the solution after a certain period the required test time is determined according to the particle size of the sample this method is suitable for assessing leaching potential in various solids namely industrial wastes combustion residues stabilized material building material and mining waste in this method a sample with a specified size is placed in 9 containers containing a mixture of reagent water and acid or base solution for a certain time the amount of acid or base solution is determined based on the titration curve the ph of the solution is then compared with the target ph defined by the standards according to material type if the ph does not match the target ph it is added to the acid or base sample after a specified time the sample and solution are separated and the solution is filtered to separate fine particles finally the solution passed through the filter is analyzed to achieve the desired results in this method the smaller the particle size the greater the amount of solution contact with the sample resulting in higher test accuracy ai et al 2019 epa 2012 he et al 2021 the procedure for performing this test is shown in fig 5 according to the studies performed on the leaching measurement tests including tclp splp column leaching tank leaching and ph dependent leaching test table 1 summarizes and compares their main attributes based on the literature reviewed in this article batch tests are the most common leaching tests used by researchers due to their convenience in terms of applicability and popularity fig 6 3 leaching characteristics of rap asphalt pavement materials are removed during resurfacing rehabilitation or reconstruction operations celauro et al 2015 huang et al 2009 the removed asphalt pavement is processed and becomes rap containing asphalt binder and aggregate copeland 2011 zaumanis and mallick 2014 rap is reused as aggregate for unbound base materials stabilized base materials pothole rut filler materials and roadway shoulder materials arulrajah et al 2013 bowden 2021 yang et al 2015 however hydrocarbons in the bitumen and pollution from tire residue or fuels in rap materials may cause the leaching of contaminants azizian et al 2003 lange et al 2021 wei et al 2015 in addition rap is temporarily stored before incorporation into new asphalt mixtures in some locations such as gravel pits and rock quarries bowden 2021 su et al 2019 in this regard contaminants may leach from rap stockpiles when exposed to rainfall thus researchers have evaluated contaminant leaching from both rap stockpiles and asphalt mixtures containing rap kriech 1991 norin and stromvall 2004 fig 7 illustrates the process of leaching from the stockpiled rap and the rap used in the different layers of asphalt pavement 3 1 leaching from rap stockpiles our literature review has indicated that contamination leaching from rap stockpiles is investigated in two ways in the first approach samples are collected directly from the rap stockpile s leachate in the field and leaching analysis is performed on the samples however in the second approach little amount of the rap stockpile is collected and then contaminant leaching from the material is evaluated by widely used laboratory leaching tests such as tclp and splp sadecki et al 1996 conducted a field study on leachate flow from a rap stockpile in minnesota usa the cone shaped stockpile with a 6 1 meter base diameter was placed on a circular pad of granular material covered with an impermeable membrane to direct the runoff to the edges and sampling was done consecutively the results illustrated that pah concentrations were below or barely higher than detection limits and did not pose any concern total solids concentration decreased with increasing storm volume the main reason for this change was the bitumen covering the aggregates in rap materials that hinders contact between acidic water and aggregates in another study norin and stromvall 2004 constructed a test site consisting of two circular stockpiles in addition to leaching analysis in the field the laboratory column test was performed on two different samples of scarified asphalt concrete one sample was taken from the road during the milling process and the other sample was taken from the stockpile two years after storage they reported significant rates of semi volatile organic pollutants in the leachate of both stockpiles also in the scarified asphalt the concentrations of pahs in both samples were higher than the swedish recommended value therefore we can infer that stockpiled rap potentially leads to environmental problems the most common organic pollutants identified in this study were naphthalene butylated hydroxytoluene bht and dibutyl phthalate dbp in addition column test results showed that the highest total organic carbon toc concentration of 33 mg kg occurred in the leachate of the sample collected during the milling process which decreased by 50 after two years of storing the samples in the stockpile licbinsky et al 2012 performed a leaching analysis on two leaching collection containers placed inside a rap stockpile to consider natural leaching conditions the leachates collected in the first and second containers were analyzed to determine metals and pah levels after 60 days and 135 days respectively results showed high concentrations of toc and dissolved organic carbon doc for both containers moreover cu molybdenum mo pb vanadium v and cd concentrations were almost equal in the vessels however in the first sample barium ba cobalt co cr and zn metals and pahs were higher than in the second sample this might be related to releasing large quantities of the materials from the rap s surface at the beginning of the precipitation test brantley and townsend 1999 conducted comprehensive laboratory research on the leaching characteristics of different rap stockpiles in florida they reported that concentrations of all studied pollutants including vocs pahs and heavy metals were below detection limits and tclp regulations except for pb whose concentration was higher than its respective groundwater standard limit concentrations of contaminants in all rap samples also diminished to levels below the regulatory limits over time except for one sample the highest concentrations of pb were found in old rap samples illustrating that the pb source was related to vehicle traffic pollution legret et al 2005 compared the results of batch and column leaching tests on rap stockpiles with the leaching data of a new conventional asphalt sampled during production at a hot mix asphalt plant and virgin aggregates as these materials have the same origin they concluded that the traffic induced pollutants in rap were generally less than the pollutants in the new conventional asphalt and virgin aggregates in addition the concentration of heavy metals in the rap remained below the values of the standard limit for drinking water ec directive 3 november 1998 however the concentrations of hydrocarbons in rap were 3 2 times higher than those in the new conventional asphalt yang et al 2020 investigated the impact of soil on possible metal retention during the leaching process they reported that the presence of soil reduced the level of manganese mn and ni thus using a soil layer between the rap and groundwater was recommended if the amount of pollutant exceeds the limit specified by u s epa furthermore a dominant parameter affecting the contaminant leaching from rap is the ph range of the leachate a study conducted by seybou insa et al 2021 in maryland on rap samples illustrated that the leaching concentration of as ba zn mg ca and b constantly decreased as ph increased in addition a geochemical analysis performed in the study to find out the nature and source of the metals leaching from the rap samples revealed that dissolution precipitation reactions controlled the leaching of some metals including al ba ca cu fe mg and zn the leaching of mg was controlled through the reaction of the element and carbonate minerals al and fe solubility was controlled by oxide and hydroxide solids and ba and ca leaching was controlled by reacting with carbonate and sulfate minerals 3 2 leaching of asphalt mixtures and pavement layers containing rap material studies generally agree that the leaching of most pollutants from asphalt pavements containing rap was below the allowable level except for pentavalent arsenic as v mn antimony sb pb cu zn chrysene and pyrene mena 2019 mijic et al 2020 shedivy et al 2012 leaching of as ba calcium ca mg and zn also depends on the ph value it was suggested that this issue can be due to the cationic behavior of the elements such that as the ph increases the concentration of these metals decreases uniformly moreover as v is separated from water in current purification processes so the presence of as more than the permitted level in leachates is not a concern insa 2017 namasivayam and ranganathan 1995 it is worth mentioning that the amount of contaminant leaching is highly dependent on the l s ratio vu 2019 reported that metal leaching increases considerably in unsaturated conditions l s from 0 1 to 10 ml g but in saturated conditions l s 10 ml g leaching is stable the performance of asphalt mixtures containing rap is typically inferior compared to hma therefore the rap containing mixtures are usually improved with some additives such as fa geopolymers kang et al 2011 observed that contaminant leaching from samples of rap fa and natural aggregates blends completely depends on fa content only inorganic chemicals whose concentrations were higher than the epa drinking water standard were cr and aluminum al an increase in the use of fa in asphalt mixtures caused a decrease in the concentration of al and a rise in the concentration of cr in the leachate in addition hoy et al 2016 showed that rap 20 fa could be safely used as a base material fa geopolymers could effectively stabilize rap and reduce the leaching level of heavy metals the amount of contaminant leaching from asphalt mixtures is also related to the physical characteristics of the mixtures as an instance vu 2019 reported that a decrease in the compaction level of asphalt mixtures increased the metal leaching so the compaction is inversely correlated with contaminant leaching a summary of research on rap leaching in the pavement is given in table 2 4 leaching characteristics of porous permeable asphalt pavement pap pap encompasses more than 20 air void content in its structure elizondo martínez et al 2020 liu and borst 2018 zhao et al 2019 zhao and zhu 2019 pap can help recharge groundwater basins more efficiently than conventional asphalt pavements which can be very useful in areas that suffer from excessive groundwater depletion due to overdraft charlesworth et al 2017 winston et al 2020 additionally using pap is a method to manage runoff and it can drain surface water quickly because of its unique structure which is very helpful in the event of a flood abdollahian et al 2018 beecham et al 2010 farooqi 2018 when surface water passes through the pap system the underground water or soil may be contaminated thus evaluating the filtration capability of paps and their effects on reducing the contaminants is essential barbis 2009 collins et al 2010 liu et al 2021b valinski and chandler 2015 fig 8 depicts the leaching characteristics of pap research on contaminant leaching from pap which is summarized in table 3 indicated that the pavement is generally more effective at removing metal contaminants hydrocarbons pahs total suspended solids tss and undissolved cationic contaminants and less effective at discarding nutrients total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp dissolved anionic contaminants and it is unsuccessful in enhancing chemical oxygen demand cod and biochemical oxygen demand bod however in some cases pap could not infiltrate metal contaminants including zn and cu due to the low ph of the leachate dissolving and causing them to leach through the pavements flanagan et al 2018 murakami et al 2008 murphy et al 2015 ostrom and davis 2019 it is worth mentioning that the filtration of the pollutants may cause a severe problem the clogging of the pap s porosities the challenge should be resolved by road maintenance operations such as pressure jetting and vacuuming boving et al 2007 charlesworth et al 2017 legret et al 2007 the size of suspended solid ss particles is a key factor affecting the level of the contaminant leaching from paps which cannot trap very fine particles legret et al 1996 reported that pap could filtrate particles whose sizes were larger than 83 5 μm boving et al 2007 showed that the type and concentrations of contaminants in leachate are not identical in different seasons nutrient concentrations were higher during spring and autumn fertilizer application whereas metal and chloride concentrations were higher in late winter and early spring as road salting is maximum they also indicated that pap was more effective at removing metal contaminants than eliminating nutrients in addition paps hardly remove dissolved anionic contaminants nitrate and chloride in contrast cationic and undissolved pollutants such as tss zn and total petroleum hydrocarbons tph are almost entirely trapped by paps roseen et al 2012 some initiatives boost the efficiency of pp systems in the removal of contaminants rahman et al 2015 illustrated that the removal efficiency of pps increased as geotextiles and construction and demolition c d materials were used in the systems however among the c d materials rap showed the lowest level of contaminant removal due to its higher permeability likewise the use of bilayer geotextiles resulted in better performance than monolayer geotextiles the physical characteristics of paps mostly affect the removal efficiency of the pavements kayhanian et al 2019 showed that the temperature and aging of pavement materials do not affect the percentage of contaminants because these parameters only affect asphalt pavements chemical and mechanical attributes zhao and zhu 2019 examined the leaching characteristics of four heavy metals i e zn pb cu and cr percolated from a pa mixture containing municipal solid waste incineration bottom ash aggregate mswi baa results showed that the most critical factor affecting heavy metal leaching was mswi baa particle size using mswi baa in pa mixtures also increased cr and zn concentrations in the leachate other factors affecting concentrations of organic matter and nutrients in infiltrated leachate from paps are rainfall regime and intensity hernandez crespo et al 2019 showed that the concentrations of the contaminants in the infiltrated leachate under the mediterranean rainfall regime were higher than the measured values under the atlantic ocean regime it was also concluded that the higher the intensity of rainfall the greater the leachability of nutrients and organic matter from paps in addition they reported that the cleaning in dry conditions could significantly reduce contaminant leaching when heavy rainfalls were forecasted another approach that can be adopted to increase the removal efficiency of contaminants in the runoff by pa systems is to use some materials including activated carbon ac geopolymer gp conventional and porous zeolites diatomite slag ceramsite and vesuvianite that can absorb pollutants fig 9 hu et al 2019 kang et al 2019 rasaki et al 2019 tan et al 2020 wang et al 2019 acs and gps remove pollutants in two ways in the first process contaminants adhere to the surface of these absorbers by van der waals forces physisorption in the second process they reduce contaminants by creating a chemical bond between the contaminant and the surface of these absorbers chemisorption it is worth mentioning that in the physical removal method first process the higher the specific surface area of the absorbers the more the contaminants adhere to their surfaces so an important parameter in the adsorption efficiency is the porosity of the absorbers in this regard the adsorption performance is more efficient at porous acs and gps tan et al 2020 yuan et al 2022 li et al 2021 showed a significant improvement in the purification performance of pa mixture when diatomite and red mud were used as alternative fillers in the mixture the purification performance of the pa mixture without the absorbers in removing ss and other contaminants was less than 60 and 20 respectively however the absorbers increased the mixture s capability by 50 in removing heavy metals and by 40 55 in removing tp and tn it was found that the high purification performance of the mixture resulted from both physical adsorption and chemical degradation it was also reported that the contaminants were mostly removed through physical adsorption because of numerous porous structures and the large specific surface area of diatomite and red mud fig 10 represents the filtration performance of some of the absorbers studies on the adsorption performance of some gps and porous gps have shown that the materials can remove contaminants such as pb cu cr ni cd mercury hg zn mn and co in leachates milad et al 2021 rasaki et al 2019 tan et al 2020 in addition ac effectively eliminates non point source nps pollution such as toluene ethylbenzene benzene and xylene caused by vehicle traffic exhaust huang and liang 2018 huang and liang 2021 wang et al 2019 the adsorption performance of the materials varies when they are used in different percentages and applications hu et al 2019 gupta et al 2019 reported that using 8 to 16 ac in porous asphalt mixtures can be sufficient to adsorb nps vehicle contaminants the required amount of ac can be used in base and granular layers without creating any excessive stiffness for top layers leading to cracking chen 2014 a summary of research on pap systems performance in reducing contaminant leaching is presented in table 3 5 leaching of substances from asphalt mixtures and pavement layers containing waste materials after the industrial revolution the exploitation of natural resources has increased more significantly than ever before resulting in some environmental problems nowadays industries have begun to change their policies in exploiting natural resources and manipulating the environment to take steps toward sustainable development bamigboye et al 2021 among all existing industries the construction industry is recognized as one of the largest consumers of natural resources motz and geiseler 2001 zhao et al 2020 in this industry road construction and paving are sections with the most exploitation of natural resources extracting natural aggregates for use in different parts of the pavement is associated with various environmental problems these environmental challenges exist in different parts of the extraction process including extraction from nature i e explosion drilling excavation and crushing and transportation chouhan et al 2017 gautam et al 2018 therefore these environmental issues should be controlled and reduced by providing solutions one way to address the environmental issues caused by using natural resources and virgin materials in the road construction industry is to reuse waste material agrela et al 2021 do nascimento et al 2019 edil 2013 salehi et al 2021 fig 11 shows the evolutionary trend toward sustainable development leading to less hazardous materials and a green world there are three common ways to manage waste materials shown schematically in fig 12 according to fig 12 a one of the most basic methods is the disposal of waste material in landfills goutam mukherjee et al 2021 nanda and berruti 2020 salihoglu 2010 leaching various pollutants into groundwater surface water soil and vegetation around the landfill is one of the critical environmental concerns that arise from this method another common method for managing waste materials is to incinerate them in waste incinerator factories as shown in fig 12 b the high amount of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and air pollution are the main problems caused by adopting this method emek and kara 2007 marieta et al 2021 singh et al 2018 as shown in fig 12 c these materials can be reused in asphalt mixtures as another method of waste management gedik 2020 leng et al 2018 piao et al 2021 wu and montalvo 2021 this strategy can help protect the environment in two ways first waste and recycled materials in asphalt mixtures base or subbase layers lead to a reduction in the consumption of natural and mineral aggregates or fillers resulting in better natural resources conservation and environmental protection second since waste materials from different industries can cause excessive leaching of pollutants to soil and groundwater if they are dumped in nature using these materials in asphalt mixtures can effectively prevent or minimize soil and groundwater contamination debbarma et al 2020 del valle zermeno et al 2014 taha et al 1999 tian et al 2021 however the initiative does not completely eliminate the leaching of contaminants therefore more research should be done to understand the leaching behavior of using waste and recycled materials in asphalt pavements waste produced from different sources can be used as an alternative to fillers aggregates or additives in asphalt mixtures and coarse aggregates in base or sub base layers arabani et al 2017 bocci 2018 cui et al 2021a saltan et al 2015 sargın et al 2013 aggregates are considered the main components of asphalt mixtures in terms of weight volume and flexibility of pavements countries are looking for alternative materials for use in pavements as both fine and coarse aggregates nwakaire et al 2020 tahmoorian et al 2017 thives and ghisi 2017 production of waste by various industries and humans is inevitable so using these materials as aggregate in the pavement industry may reduce environmental problems and meet the requirements of sustainable development procedures and standards do nascimento et al 2019 gautam et al 2018 waste to energy wte ash municipal solid waste msw s slags crt glass and recycled concrete aggregate rca are among the waste materials of other industries used as aggregate substitutes in various types of asphalt mixtures bestgen et al 2016 chiu et al 2009 dubey and townsend 2007 hasita et al 2021 you et al 2021 since the leaching of pollutants from these materials may cause environmental problems it is important to determine the amount and type of contaminants leaching from them as an illustration three elements including al cl and total dissolved solids tds were detected to present a potential risk of leaching when wtes are reused in pavement mixtures cl and tds concentrations declined over time and reached below regulatory limits nevertheless al concentration in leachates was still more than the regulatory limit even at the final sampling event dubey and townsend 2007 roessler et al 2015 in addition when more than 15 of biomass bottom ash was used as aggregate leaching of sb cu ni cr hg as and mo was detected to be more than the allowable limit therefore how much aggregates are replaced by the waste materials directly affects the amount of contaminant leaching cabrera et al 2016 moreover a recommended solution for preventing metal leaching when steel slags are replaced by aggregates in asphalt mixtures is to place a clayey embankment soil under an asphalt layer containing steel slag which can mitigate metal leaching to some extent dayioglu and aydilek 2019 table 4 provides an overview of research on the analysis of leaching of waste materials after use in asphalt mixtures as aggregates in different layers and pavement types filler is one of the most critical components of asphalt mixtures although fillers are used to a less extent than other components they can significantly impact the properties and performance of asphalt mixtures aljassar et al 2004 grabowski and wilanowicz 2008 zulkati et al 2012 today rock dust cement and hydrated lime are commonly used as fillers in asphalt mixtures extraction of the materials directly from the earth s crust leads to vegetation loss adverse impacts on surface and groundwater lack of raw materials and ecosystem disruption lesueur et al 2012 robinson et al 2004 waste materials including c d wastes e g dust and fine aggregates from recycled bricks and concrete agriculture wastes e g rice husk ash domestic wastes e g rubber and glass waste waste incinerators and industrial wastes e g cement kiln dust ckd coal waste cw powder and cu slag cs powder can be considered as suitable alternatives to fillers in asphalt mixtures choudhary et al 2020 kalantar et al 2012 liu et al 2021a liu et al 2021b zhang et al 2020a however the environmental threats caused by leaching contaminants from waste materials before and after use in asphalt mixtures should be studied in more depth the chemical and physical reactions of various components of asphalt mixtures with waste materials play key roles in reducing the leaching of contaminants from the waste materials bamigboye et al 2021 huang and liang 2018 lu et al 2020 xue et al 2009 reported that when mswifa was used as a filler contaminant concentrations were below the detection limit this reduction resulted from the stabilization and solidification of the waste materials by the bitumen in the asphalt mixture li et al 2022 classified incineration fly ash ifa as a hazardous waste containing many toxic elements such as pb cr and zn the pb concentration in the ifa leachate was much higher than the maximum allowable limit determined by the chinese standard gb 5085 3 2007 2007 however contaminant leaching significantly decreased when ifa was used in the asphalt mixture asphalt with good adhesion chemical stability and impermeability covered and fixed ifa particles the contaminants were also solidified through physical and chemical interactions between the pollutants and cement hydration products such as hydrated c s h gels and ettringite in addition to using fine waste materials as filler these materials can also be used as alternatives to bitumen modifiers and additives in asphalt mixes typically cw cw ash cwa cs and ckd have replaced additives behnood et al 2015 modarres and ayar 2014 modarres et al 2015 zarrinkamar and modarres 2020 moreover nano ceramic powder ncp polyphthalamide acid ppa crumb rubber and nano fibrous carbon nfc have been substituted with modifiers fathollahi et al 2022 hussein et al 2017 murugan et al 2020 xu and zhang 2020 this combination has not only improved the mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures but also reduced contaminant leaching from pure waste materials because of adhesion and chemical bonds formed between these materials and the components of asphalt mixtures cho et al 2020 gautam et al 2018 tan et al 2020 fig 13 a shows the reduction of pb leaching from crt glass after using the waste material in the asphalt mixture fig 13 b represents fa particles surrounded and trapped by bitumen after adding to the mixtures and fig 13 c illustrates the mechanism of preventing potential pollutions from entering leachate tables 5 and 6 overview the research that analyzed contaminant leaching after reusing waste materials in asphalt mixtures as fillers modifiers and additives 6 critical discussion bibliometric data of this review revealed significant growth in the research of contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements over the last three years the number of published articles during 2019 2021 has more than doubled the number of articles published during 2016 2018 in addition more than 80 of these articles have been published in the journals categorized as q1 in the scimago journal rank sjr indicating the interest of authoritative sources of knowledge in finding out the leaching characteristics of asphalt pavements and methods of avoiding subsequent environmental risks according to the evident signs of the importance of this issue for the scientific community and to direct the pavement industry towards eco friendly and sustainable development strategies we believe that it is necessary to create a community of practice and hold specialized conferences on the analysis of contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements to communicate and unify researchers and officials aiming to solve the environmental problem relevant journals are also recommended to assign some special issues to the topic to collect the latest findings on this subject expeditiously and increase the issue s visibility and readership quantitative evaluation of the measurement tools and experiments used to analyze the contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements showed that researchers have usually used batch tests probably regardless of the materials and structure of the considered asphalt pavement and only following the methods used in previous studies experts need to provide guidelines recommending the most appropriate leaching measurement test in different cases it is evident that one of the most efficient ways to prevent excessive leaching of contaminants from rap stockpiles is to balance rap production and demand but it is not usually practical due to the huge and unpredictable volume of rap production spreadbury et al 2021 two crucial actions are required to make this strategy feasible the first one is to create a database of the existing quantity of rap and develop models to estimate the future quantity of rap production in a specific region the second one is to find new opportunities to reuse rap which needs running some research projects with the financial support of governments and beneficial companies recently researchers have reused rap in other civil engineering applications resulting in mechanical and environmental benefits bressi et al 2022 ullah et al 2022 it seems that there are multiple opportunities to reuse rap that have not been discovered yet nevertheless balancing rap production and demand cannot prevent temporary stockpiling of rap during construction activities to prevent the leaching of contaminants from temporary rap stockpiles they should be located as far as possible from rivers and other surface water bodies waterproofing membranes should also be laid above and below the stockpiles in areas with high precipitation moreover projects should be scheduled in a way that rap and other waste materials are stockpiled during low precipitation seasons the articles that have analyzed the leaching characteristics of pap generally have shown the ability of the asphalt pavement to prevent the leaching of some contaminants including heavy metals and its inability to control the leaching of other pollutants such as nutrients brown and borst 2015 drake et al 2014 if this shortcoming is addressed to an acceptable level pap can be recommended as one of the most suitable types of asphalt pavement for industrial areas where pavements are exposed to various pollutants in this regard some researchers have tried to boost the efficiency of pap in leaching reduction by adding photocatalysts and adsorbents such as ac to pap s mix design hu et al 2019 hu et al 2021 kang et al 2019 liu et al 2021b however it seems that there is still a research gap in this area another important issue that needs special attention is the relationship between sustainable development and the leaching of contaminants from asphalt pavements reusing waste materials provides many advantages including resource and energy conservation reducing ghg emissions and diminishing the risk of global warming however it may cause serious environmental impacts especially the leaching of contaminants from the waste materials allegrini et al 2015 dierks et al 2021 to adopt a thorough strategy to reuse and recycle waste materials it is recommended to perform a life cycle assessment lca as a tool for evaluating the sustainability level of the project after assigning an inventory of the analysis to the evaluation of contaminant leaching during service life piao et al 2022 7 conclusions and future research needs this work evaluates different leaching tests of asphalt pavements and analyzes previous investigations on leaching characteristics of paps as well as asphalt pavements containing rap and waste materials the conclusions are listed below afterward future research needs are provided to contribute researchers to pursuing thorough research direction 7 1 conclusions leaching analysis laboratory tests are divided into two main groups batch or static and column or dynamic tests other common tests used to analyze leaching that cannot be incorporated into the major categories include tank and ph dependent tests in general in all tests contact time between sample and solution l s ratio and ph value of leachate are influential parameters in leaching analysis most studies have used batch tests to analyze leaching from asphalt pavements the most common batch tests are tclp and splp batch tests spanning 14 days have the shortest required time to be performed and ph test with 35 days column test with 42 days and tank test with 84 days have longer execution times another advantage of batch tests over other standard tests is that the test needs only one dissolved sample but other tests need 3 to 12 samples to be performed batch tests can simulate the condition in which a sample is exposed to acid rain or landfill over the next 100 years and they better simulate actual conditions in batch tests unlike other tests the sample and solution are thoroughly mixed and contamination contacts the solution regardless of its location in the sample additionally unlike the column test in which the column s material itself may act as a contamination filter the test sample does not work as a contamination filter in batch tests the maximum grain size of materials must be 9 5 mm for batch tests and asphalt samples cannot be tested integrated using the tests for example the batch tests are not suitable for analyzing the leaching of paps because the integrity of their structure is critical in investigating their leaching characteristic and filtration capability in batch tests crushing the pa samples and destroying the sample s structure causes the results to deviate from accurate values column tests can be used for a wide range of granular materials but they also cannot examine the leaching characteristics of materials integrated as a significant result the homogeneity of the material is directly related to the accuracy of the test results nevertheless the tank test is a suitable leaching analysis test for integrated and dense granular materials it can address the shortcoming of batch and column tests in analyzing the leaching characteristics of the materials the ph dependent test has been designed to investigate the relation between the leaching of various contaminants and the ph of the solution using this test is not also recommended to analyze the leaching characteristics of integrated materials in addition the finer the grain size of materials the more accurate the test results field tests are not common for leaching analysis due to the test s long execution time and complex implementation however these tests are required in some cases namely leaching assessment of stockpiled rap contaminants that may settle on asphalt during service life are simulated in none of the leaching analysis tests this literature review revealed that 38 of studies had used some tests apart from conventional tests for leaching analysis it can be concluded that researchers are looking for more comprehensive tests to simulate more real leaching conditions as a suggestion for future tests all environmental conditions such as humidity and wind speed should be taken into account to simulate natural leaching conditions as accurately as possible in addition contaminants affecting pavements over a long period should also be considered moreover the impact of the soil layers around the pavement and between the groundwater table and the pavement should be seen in the design of new tests in general the leaching of pollutants from rap can be examined from two perspectives leaching from the stockpiled rap and leaching from rap used in different pavement layers researchers have analyzed leaching from stockpiled rap using laboratory and field tests results of most studies that used laboratory tests indicated that the leaching of contaminants from the stockpiled rap was lower than permissible values however field tests on stockpiled raps mainly showed that the amount of contaminant leached from them was higher than the allowable limits this could indicate the inefficiency of laboratory tests to assess the environmental concerns of stockpiled rap and the lack of accurate simulation of natural leaching conditions by these tests the field tests also showed that the more time passed the more pollutants leached from the stockpiled rap studies showed that using rap either alone or mixed with fa and natural aggregates in the base and subbase layers could not pose any environmental risk leaching data represented that the use of rap on highway shoulders is not environmentally friendly and causes leaching of pollutants more than allowable limits studies also found that the best way to prevent the leaching of contaminants from stockpiled rap is to balance the production and demand of rap but it is probably not practical another suggestion is to reduce the deposit time of materials if the deposit time of rap is not manageable using a soil layer under the rap deposit can reduce the leaching of rap contaminations to groundwater investigations showed that the leaching from the rap stockpiles was mainly above the standard limit but after using the rap in different pavement layers the leaching of pollutants decreased to some extent and in some cases the leaching of contaminants became less than allowable levels nonetheless in some studies it has been observed that the use of rap in pavement layers increased the leaching of pollutants and caused environmental problems but due to the limited number of such cases they have been attributed to the rap obtained from the studied area and excessive contamination of the rap leaching analyses on pap have shown that while passing runoff through this type of pavement heavy metals e g zn pb cd cu tss and pahs are trapped in the porous structure and the pollutants are significantly removed from the runoff enhancing the quality of water passing through the porosities however paps are not successful in eliminating contaminants such as p n and dissolved anionic pollutants e g nitrate and chloride it is worth mentioning that the productivity of paps can be enhanced using geotextiles and some contaminant absorbers such as gp zeolites diatomite slag ceramsite and vesuvianite in different asphalt layers likewise the filtration performance of paps is significantly related to the ph of the leachate and the type of contaminants in terms of their anionic or cationic nature for example high ph runoff penetrating a pap causes the filtration of orthophosphate with metal cations trapping contaminants in the pores of paps or filtration process over time causes clogging of these pores and reduces filtration performance of this type of pavement another cause of the clogging is the deposition of clay and dust in the pores this problem can be addressed through preservative measures such as high pressure water jets and vacuums overall it is recommended to use pap in areas where runoff contains heavy metals and tss especially in industrial areas additionally one of the challenging issues in this area is the design of void contents in pap so that it has both admissible mechanical properties and the most optimal filtration performance given that conventional leaching tests cannot be used to analyze the leaching characteristics of pap properly it is suggested to develop a comprehensive method simulating actual leaching conditions to examine their leaching properties more accurately one way to prevent environmental risks caused by waste materials is to use them as an alternative to aggregates in pavement systems trapping and removal of contaminants existing in waste materials after using them in asphalt mixture generally result from physical stabilization and solidification of the waste materials by bitumen and chemical reaction between asphalt mixture components and the waste materials research in this field has shown that using waste materials such as msw and steel slag as a replacement for all or part of aggregates in asphalt mixtures can adequately prevent the leaching of contaminants from these waste materials although using some waste materials such as wte in asphalt mixtures may cause some contaminants such as al to leach more than the allowable values the leaching of most contaminants such as ag as cd se pb and pahs is probably less than the detection limits leaching from some waste materials may become more than allowable limits if they are exposed to water in these cases the wastes can be used as alternative materials to aggregates to construct beneath layers base and subbase layers if the above layers are low permeable furthermore waste materials are sometimes used as fillers in asphalt mixtures according to studies in this field it was concluded that using waste materials such as fa msw calcium carbide and cws as alternative fillers is completely effective in limiting the leaching of pollutants from the materials and causes no environmental hazard also in some cases waste material is used as an additive in asphalt mixtures few studies have examined this issue from an environmental point of view they showed that the use of waste materials as additives could adequately control the leaching of these materials 7 2 future research needs it is suggested that researchers can focus on the points listed below for their future works development of laboratory leaching tests considering the effects of environmental factors including wind speed humidity temperature and light intensity during the measurement process investigation of the effects of freezing thawing wetting drying and weathering on contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements capability evaluation of recently developed approaches namely biological methods in reducing leaching of some contaminants such as nutrients significantly leached from asphalt pavements especially paps lca and life cycle cost analysis lcca of recommended contaminant leaching management strategies namely pap waste and rap recycling developing a prediction model of contaminant leaching from asphalt pavements employing machine learning algorithms regarding availability of huge experimental data addressing these issues is essential for controlling the leaching of pollutants from the pavements and it can help specialists maintain the quality of groundwater and surface water resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
15883,the amount of norovirus rna ribonucleic acid in raw wastewater collected from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp can provide an indication of disease prevalence within the sampled catchment however an accurate back estimation might be impeded by the uncertainties from in sewer in sample degradation of viral rna variable shedding magnitude and difficulties in measurement within raw wastewater the current study reviewed the published literature regarding the factors of norovirus shedding viral rna decay in wastewater and the occurrence of norovirus rna in raw wastewater based on molecular detection sensitivity analysis for wbe back estimation was conducted using the reported data of the factors mentioned above considering different viral loads in wastewater samples it was found that the back estimation is more sensitive to analytical detection uncertainty than shedding variability for norovirus although seasonal temperature change can lead to variation of decay rates and may influence the sensitivity of this pathogen specific parameter decay rates of norovirus rna contribute negligibly to the variance in estimating disease prevalence based on the available data from decay experiments in bulk wastewater under different temperatures however the effects of in sewer transportation on viral rna decay and retardation by sewer biofilms on pipe surfaces are largely unknown given the highest uncertainty from analytical measurement by molecular methods and complexity of in sewer processes that norovirus experienced during the transportation to wwtp future investigations are encouraged to improve the accuracy of viral rna detection in wastewater and delineate viral retardation interactions with wastewater biofilms in real sewers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords norovirus wastewater based epidemiology sensitivity analysis viral shedding decay analytical uncertainty 1 introduction norovirus nov is a major cause of epidemic gastroenteritis among people of all ages globally with an estimated infection of 685 million cases each year jones et al 2020 norovirus has single stranded rna around 7 6 kb in length inside the non enveloped viral capsid lun et al 2018a robilotti et al 2015 based on full length amino acid capsid sequences norovirus can be divided into six genogroups with gi and gii groups being the major cause of human infections vega et al 2014 among the globally reported norovirus infections since 1995 65 80 of infections were caused by the predominant norovirus gii 4 vega et al 2014 norovirus could be spread to humans via ingestion of contaminated food or water or the inhalation of air droplets todd et al 2008 patients then excrete norovirus into domestic wastewater corpuz et al 2020 wigginton et al 2015 its high transmissibility is due to the low infectious dose about 10 100 particles continuous shedding newman et al 2016 teunis et al 2015 high resistance to heat or acid polo et al 2020 and prolonged survival in the environment lau et al 2020 lopman et al 2012 in around 40 of cases the main symptom of norovirus infection is a sudden onset of diarrhea ahmed et al 2014 other cases may also suffer from vomiting which is particularly serious for the elderly or immunocompromised patients the illness is also described as winter vomiting disease because the prevalence of outbreaks is significantly increased during colder months ahmed et al 2013 vega et al 2014 norovirus may be excreted in feces one to two days before the onset of symptoms as the incubation period is normally around 48 h robilotti et al 2015 even several months after symptoms resolve norovirus shedding could be detected in stool at relatively low concentrations domman et al 2020 teunis et al 2015 repeated infection is possible because short term immunity acquired cannot provide life long protection against the diverse norovirus genogroups miyoshi et al 2015 patel et al 2009 the excreted norovirus rna in wastewater samples can be quantified using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr and give a numerical estimation of the infections in the catchment area saththasivam et al 2021 weidhaas et al 2021 due to repeated infection norovirus usually occurs in greater abundance compared with other viral pathogens detected in wastewater samples farkas et al 2018b previous studies found a good correlation exists between peaking norovirus rna concentration in wastewater and disease outbreaks in the sampled catchments supporting wastewater screening as a useful approach to monitor norovirus circulation in the community kazama et al 2016 lun et al 2018b zhou et al 2016 by meta analysis the concentration of norovirus in raw wastewater was reported to be significantly higher in winter than in other seasons eftim et al 2017 which is consistent with the yearly fluctuation of infections in populations prevost et al 2015b the early warning of norovirus outbreak is also possible due to the pre symptomatic shedding about 2 days before the onset of symptoms robilotti et al 2015 one study reported that the peak of detected norovirus in wastewater was two to three weeks before the peak of recorded cases hellmer et al 2014 by applying such an approach of wastewater surveillance the disease prevalence at the population level in both spatial and temporal scales can be monitored systematically o brien and xagoraraki 2019 however a precise back estimation approach from pathogen concentration in wastewater to infected cases in the population has not been well established zhu et al 2021 wastewater based epidemiology wbe is not only about measuring the pathogen concentration in raw wastewater downstream but also involves addressing the shedding dynamic at upstream considering viral decay in sewers or during storage before detection and evaluating actual water usage data for prevalence estimation there are various uncertainties related to back estimation through wastewater surveillance li et al 2021 among all parameters in the wbe back estimation eq 1 li et al 2022 there are three virus related parameters including c s viral shedding per gram of feces k in sewer decay rate constant and c rna norovirus rna copies per liter of wastewater sample 1 p catchment c rn a e k t q p s q s c s 10 r c e k t q p s q s 10 r s where p catchment is the number of infected cases within the catchment boundary k is the decay rate constant d 1 t is the hydraulic retention time or in sewer travel time d c rna is the concentration of virus rna in wastewater gene copies l q is the daily wastewater generation per capita l d person p s is the shedding probability in feces from an infected person q s is the daily shedding amount of feces of an individual g d person and c s is the shedding magnitude of viral rna in the stool gene copies g r c is the logarithmic concentration of norovirus rna in wastewater log10 gene copies l and r s is the logarithmic shedding magnitude of norovirus rna in the stool log10 gene copies g inaccurate determination of these virus related parameters may contribute to propagated errors of calculating up stream viral shedding in stool and thus a false estimation of infected cases for example seasonal temperature change might alter the biological decay kinetics thus influencing the detectability of pathogens downstream hart and halden 2020 and introducing more possibilities for false estimation in addition the deviation between downstream observations and original inputs could be higher due to the increased in sewer travel time t in eq 1 the variabilities of these parameters in wbe should be taken into consideration to ensure a reliable back estimation to date there is a lack of knowledge about the relative importance and contributions of these virus related parameters to the back estimation of disease prevalence of norovirus this study aims to i summarize the current understanding about the fate of norovirus rna in urban wastewater systems from fecal excretion to influent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps with in depth review and collation of literature data for wbe back estimation of community prevalence rates ii conduct sensitivity analysis for back estimating norovirus prevalence based on literature data of norovirus shedding in wastewater decay and viral concentrations in wastewater and iii identify the knowledge gaps in achieving more accurate back estimation of norovirus infection by wbe the findings of this study will contribute to understanding the fate of norovirus in urban wastewater systems and the parameter sensitivity for wbe back estimation 2 methods 2 1 literature search and data collection a systematic literature search was conducted by the terms norovirus and sewage or wastewater or sewer and norovirus and feces or stool and shed or excretion using databases available at web of science on 15th october 2021 then the titles of the search results were screened initially to decide whether their full texts entail reading if the title does not contain sufficient information for justification the abstract would be further evaluated to find out whether the paper would provide useful information those papers that passed the screening through the title or abstract were subjected to full text review during the full text review if there were cited papers of relevance those papers from the reference list would also be downloaded and added to the full text review table 1 shows the number of papers selected at different stages norovirus related data norovirus concentration in wastewater viral decay in wastewater and the shedding magnitude in stool determined by rt qpcr were collected from the selected papers into a spreadsheet microsoft excel for the papers providing t 90 or t 99 i e time to achieve 90 or 99 reduction in concentration of norovirus persistence in wastewater the times were converted to first order decay rates using eq 2 and 3 the statistics of k values was then calculated for its mean value and standard deviation at various temperatures for the paper providing data points of fecal virus load in figures the numerical concentrations were extracted by getdata graph digitizer http www getdata graph digitizer com and recorded into the spreadsheet then the mean value and standard deviation were calculated in the spreadsheet accordingly 2 t 90 2 303 k 3 t 99 4 606 k 2 2 data analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of three virus related parameters including c s k and c rna for wbe back estimation eq 1 the number of infected cases p catchment within the catchment boundary is estimated by assuming parameters t q q s as a range of values lai et al 2011 li et al 2021 the hydraulic retention time t was assumed as 1 h 6 h and 12 h representing small medium and large urban sewer catchments respectively the wastewater generation per capita q was assumed as 150 250 and 350 l d person considering variations over time and across locations for the sensitivity analysis ahmed et al 2020a tscharke et al 2019 the daily fecal shedding amount of an individual q s was assumed to be 150 250 and 350 g d person in this study rose et al 2015 in addition the fecal shedding probability p s of an infected person was previously reported as 73 2 miura et al 2018 the log transformed values of virus concentration parameters r s r c and k values were recorded in the spreadsheet and served as inputs into wbe eq 1 by fitting distribution to the data and anderson darling test in oracle crystal ball release 11 1 2 4 600 redwood city ca both normal distribution and uniform distribution were chosen for r s in the sensitivity analysis due to the limited number of data points for decay rates k was assumed as a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation determined from published data r c was evaluated at three distinct levels i e low medium high that were extrapolated from a meta analysis by assuming it as a normal distribution with the analytical limit of detection lod as the standard deviation among different probability distributions with the same variance normal distribution has the highest uncertainty for the parameter value castrup 2007 therefore the choice of normal distribution guaranteed the least amount of prior knowledge would be added to the model given these definitions of input parameters the wbe model in different scenarios i e low medium and high level of viral concentration in wastewater fecal shedding amount wastewater generation per capita and hydraulic retention time was simulated by oracle crystal ball steps detailed in the supplimentary material the monte carlo method was applied to sample from the defined distributions of the parameters a process based on probabilistic statistical theory and law of large numbers the probability of random events would equal the frequency of their occurrence from repeated trials the program did 10 000 samplings from the defined parameters to calculate the forecast which created sensitivity charts and frequency distribution while the simulation was running the sensitivity was calculated by computing rank correlation coefficients between each assumption and corresponding forecast wbe back estimated norovirus prevalence which measures the degree of assumptions and forecasts changing together petterson et al 2021 the calculated coefficients show to what extent a given assumption affects the predicted results through both the uncertainty and model sensitivity of the parameter positive coefficients imply that the increase of parameter values is associated with the increase of the forecast whereas negative coefficients mean the opposite therefore the execution of repeated simulations provides the probability distribution of outcomes and its sensitivity to the input parameters by taking 10 000 samples from estimated input definitions 3 results and discussion 3 1 fecal viral shedding of norovirus as a pathogen causing gastrointestinal disease norovirus is excreted in stool at high concentration up to 1011 gene copies g of feces victoria et al 2014 although there are other shedding sources like saliva or vomit fecal excretion was regarded as the major route of norovirus discharge into sewers anfruns estrada et al 2020 the shedding magnitude of norovirus viral particles was investigated by clinical studies chan et al 2006 ozawa et al 2007 todd et al 2008 fecal specimens were collected within 48 h of symptom onset from patients infected by norovirus gi and gii chan et al 2006 subsequently viral rna was purified from fecal specimens and subjected to rt qpcr quantification fecal concentration of norovirus was reported ranging from 105 to 1010 gene copies g of feces obara et al 2008 sukhrie et al 2013 lee et al 2007 reported the median fecal cdna concentration of norovirus at 108 93 gene copies g of feces interquartile range 108 22 1010 24 gene copies g of feces whereas atmar et al 2008 found that the median peak of norovirus shedding amount was 9 5 1010 gene copies g of feces disregarding genotype or genogroup specificities the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection was estimated at 32 1 by miura et al 2018 while asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals might shed norovirus at similar levels the overall probability of viral shedding was estimated to be 73 2 by statistical modeling of the virological surveillance data miura et al 2018 no significant association was found for symptom onset with daily viral rna concentration in feces duration of viral shedding or cumulative shedding according to norovirus challenge studies newman et al 2016 although symptoms normally would not last beyond a fortnight and the average shedding duration was around one week wu et al 2019 some patients children or older individuals may suffer from chronic norovirus infection over 420 days with constant viral shedding for at least 100 days observed frange et al 2012 ludwig et al 2008 generally the viral rna discharge could drop below 103 gene copies g of feces by 60 days post infection teunis et al 2015 the viral load in feces which is influenced by the patient s age was reported to decrease progressively throughout the shedding period with peak load occurring during the early stage lai et al 2013 3 2 decay of norovirus rna in wastewater after shedding into a toilet norovirus rna would experience in sewer decay during the transportation to wwtps decay experiments were performed to estimate the rna decay rate constants of norovirus gi and gii in wastewater collected from wastewater treatment facilities under different temperatures kauppinen and miettinen 2017 skraber et al 2009 rt qpcr was used for quantification targeting the spiked norovirus strains or indigenous norovirus in samples which were collected during the incubation period the persistence of norovirus rna was recorded by measuring the remaining concentration in wastewater samples during the decay experiments and evaluated by k or t 90 noticeably norovirus rna was relatively stable in wastewater with a lower decay rate constant than viruses like coronavirus ebola and hepatitis a virus while the decay rate of norovirus is comparable with adenovirus and zika virus as shown in table 2 given the norovirus rna decay rate constant at 0 02 0 21 d 1 table 2 and wastewater hrt in sewers around 12 h representing a typical large sewer catchment the in sewer decay of norovirus rna would result in a correction factor ek t in eq 1 of 1 01 1 12 depending on the temperature 4 37 c norovirus decay rates increase with temperatures in wastewater of 4 to 37 c table 2 which might be caused by increased activity of extracellular enzymes protein denaturation damage to nucleic acid or capsid dissociation li et al 2021 makaya et al 2015 moreover indigenous microbial population in wastewater may also contribute to viral inactivation due to higher activity in warmer conditions korajkic et al 2013 thus seasonal temperature variation may lead to different decay rates of norovirus in wastewater during the in sewer transportation to wwtps in addition to temperature other environmental conditions like ph farkas et al 2018a grondahl rosado et al 2014 salinity inoue et al 2020 takahashi et al 2016 suspended solid particles brooks et al 2015 da silva et al 2008 ye et al 2016 sewer sediment or biofilm amarasiri and sano 2019 miura et al 2013 skraber et al 2007 and microbial community hamouda et al 2021 were shown to affect the decay of norovirus the viral decay in wastewater is also dependent on individual species and might be different among species within the same viral genus the spiked norovirus strains could not persist as long as indigenous norovirus in wastewater kauppinen and miettinen 2017 most likely due to the difference in viral structure norovirus gi and gii showed different resistance to heat and persistence during wastewater treatments dunkin et al 2017 gyawali and hewitt 2018 haramoto et al 2018 the variability of persistence within the norovirus genus might also lead to different detectability at downstream locations in some urban catchments wastewater transportation can take as long as 24 h from household to wwtps when going through the sewer network the viral particles might attach to sewer biofilms or sediments foster et al 2021 and then be released with biofilm sloughing caused by strong flow skraber et al 2009 the downstream detectability of viral rna is not only decided by upstream shedding in sewer decay and wastewater flow rates but is also subjected to dilution by stormwater inflow or infiltration guo et al 2022 weidhaas et al 2021 however these effects have not been quantitatively evaluated in most of the reported wbe studies and remain a research gap hence detailed modeling of all possible in sewer processes is still required to associate the viral rna load at sampling points to the disease prevalence within the catchment hamouda et al 2021 3 3 norovirus occurrence and concentration in wastewater the occurrence of norovirus in raw sewage collected from wwtps was reported in singapore aw and gin 2010 new zealand hewitt et al 2011 france sima et al 2011 da silva et al 2007 spain perez sautu et al 2012 santisobellon et al 2020 sweden nordgren et al 2009 the united states montazeri et al 2015 symonds et al 2009 japan miura et al 2015 kitajima et al 2011 switzerland masclaux et al 2013 finland kauppinen et al 2014 norway grondahl rosado et al 2014 ireland flannery et al 2012 italy la rosa et al 2010 iaconelli et al 2016 the united kingdom farkas et al 2018a laverick et al 2004 uruguay victoria et al 2014 brazil victoria et al 2010 fioretti et al 2017 prado et al 2019 south africa mabasa et al 2018 the netherlands lodder and de roda husman 2005 luxembourg kremer et al 2011 kenya kiulia et al 2010 egypt kamel et al 2010 china he et al 2011 south korea han et al 2014 australia lun et al 2018a and canada pouillot et al 2015 the detailed information regarding sampling strategy sampling period and the detected viral concentration for each of these studies are listed in table s1 most of these studies employed rt qpcr for quantification and sequencing methods for phylogenetic analysis many of these studies adopted grab sampling or 24 h composite sampling strategy the wastewater surveillance for norovirus was most frequently reported in annual schemes overall the concentration of norovirus rna in wastewater influent can be up to 109 gene copies l with the q pcr detection limit around 102 7 gene copies l da silva et al 2007 perez sautu et al 2012 pouillot et al 2015 usually among norovirus genus genotype gii and gi are the most abundant in raw wastewater fumian et al 2019 pouillot et al 2015 besides gi and gii genotype norovirus giv was also investigated for its prevalence and genetic diversity in wastewater fioretti et al 2017 kitajima et al 2016 although it was detected at a lower concentration than gi or gii haramoto et al 2018 more frequently norovirus density was higher in colder months katayama et al 2008 probably due to the greater prevalence of gastrointestinal illness the lack of disinfection from ultraviolet of natural sunlight and the prolonged persistence in wastewater due to low temperatures in winter grondahl rosado et al 2014 through systematically reviewing norovirus concentrations in wastewater eftim et al 2017 reported the differences in seasonal and geographical occurrences of nov gi with the overall mean density of 104 4 gene copies l and gii with the overall mean density of 104 9 gene copies l in addition rainfall is a critical factor influencing the viral concentration in wastewater which can be diluted by stormwater in sewers weidhaas et al 2021 the normalization method using fecal makers was recommended to correct the viral concentration when domestic wastewater was subjected to mixing with trade effluent or stormwater other than absolute quantification the relative quantification via qpcr is also a promising approach for the normalization by human specific biomarkers as the internal reference and the determination of the virus abundance in wastewater wu et al 2021 such a method might help improve the comparability of viral concentration in wastewater samples across different catchments and estimate the infection ratio in corresponding communities after normalizing viral concentration by internal control pmmov pepper mild mottle virus wu et al 2020 found that sars cov 2 rna copy numbers in wastewater are less noisy and match the trend of clinical covid 19 cases better however feng et al 2021 reported the reduced correlations when normalizing viral concentration to a spiked recovery control bovine coronavirus or a fecal marker pmmov or hf183 in wastewater thus there are still some debates on whether the internal reference is useful to reduce sample variances and counter the impact of dilution by stormwater runoff and trade effluent 3 4 sensitivity analysis for wbe back estimation of norovirus infections the literature data of rna shedding concentrations in fecal samples 4 34 10 88 log10 gene copies g were extracted and computed for the mean value together with the standard deviation i e 7 96 1 74 log10 gene copies g for the sensitivity analysis table 3 decay rate constants k of norovirus rna generated from the reported t 90 or t 99 values were determined as 0 074 0 065 d 1 through systematic data collection from literature eftim et al 2017 developed the density distribution of norovirus in raw wastewater applying a non parametric bootstrap statistical model three levels of the viral load in wastewater log10 gene copies l were extrapolated from their reported concentrations for different locations and seasons as presented in table 3 limit of detection lod is the lowest detectable concentration whereas limit of quantification loq is the lowest concentration that can be quantitatively measured with suitable accuracy and precision usually the ratio of signal to noise can be used to determine lod 3 1 and loq 10 1 which are matrix specific and highly dependent on analytical methods mohamad 2018 pouillot et al 2015 performed a meta analysis and reported the lod of 2 7 log10 gene copies l for norovirus rna measurement by rt qpcr in wastewater influent samples with the assumption of 100 efficiency during sample concentration rna extraction and rt reaction compared to loq the limit of detection can better represent the analytical error therefore the lod of 2 7 log10 gene copies l was used in this sensitivity analysis as the standard deviation of measured virus concentration in raw wastewater the above mentioned distributions of the parameters normal distributions for the three virus related parameters and a uniform distribution for r s were adopted to evaluate the contribution of different factors k r c and r s to the overall uncertainty of the wbe back estimation table 4 and table s2 it shows that norovirus rna concentration in wastewater contributed around 65 or 71 variance to the wbe back estimation when shedding magnitude was assumed as uniform or normal distribution respectively norovirus fecal shedding concentration r s contributed around 34 when assumed as uniform distribution or 28 when assumed as normal distribution while the relative contribution of the decay was nil according to eq 1 higher viral rna concentration in wastewater corresponds to higher prevalence rate positive correlation whereas shedding concentration in opposite has a negative correlation with the wbe back estimation in addition the level of viral rna load in wastewater i e low medium and high did not make any significant changes to the sensitivity of wbe back estimation the sensitivity analysis based on 10 000 samplings showed that r c has a higher absolute value of pearson correlation coefficient 0 79 0 83 with the predicted infection p catchment thus greater contribution to its variance 65 71 than viral shedding correlation coefficient 0 53 to 0 57 and contribution to variance around 28 34 table 4 and table s2 this implies that the uncertainty from analytical measurement of norovirus rna in wastewater samples has a more significant impact on the wbe back estimation in other words the wbe model is more sensitive to analytical uncertainties under all defined scenarios rna decay rates almost contributed nil to the variance of norovirus prevalence therefore the in sewer decay of norovirus rna was not an influential factor for wbe back estimation based on the available decay rates while the analytical determination of wastewater samples was the dominant source of uncertainty in addition to the two possible data distributions of fecal shedding magnitude the sensitivity analysis for three virus related parameters was also carried out under different conditions with various assumed values the results showed that the changes in t q and q s values only caused very limited changes 5 in the sensitivity of virus related parameters table s3 5 this is because these back estimation parameters are independent to the virus related parameters which are the focus of the sensitivity analysis it should be noted that the sensitivity was evaluated using data obtained on both norovirus gi and gii genotype the analytical sensitivity and detection limit of rt qpcr assays for norovirus gi and gii may be different and contribute differently to the overall uncertainty in wbe back estimation anfruns estrada et al 2020 apart from the biological variation between genotypes in terms of amplification the sampling strategy storage enrichment and extraction processes may also introduce technical variation haramoto et al 2018 when people have diarrhea the frequency of their excreting virus increases but when people are producing normal stools they may only have 1 or 2 flushes a day in which there is an excretion event poor sampling design may overwhelm analytical uncertainty ort et al 2010 but the sampling uncertainty is commonly overlooked in the literature while the obvious solution is to use continuous flow proportional sampling of the wastewater such sampling strategy rarely occurred in these published studies for wastewater monitoring moreover the detection efficiency might be related to the viral rna concentration in stool or wastewater gyawali and hewitt 2018 reporting the recovery efficiency and improving the repeatability of the assay by spiking internal controls has been recommended for various wbe studies francy et al 2012 li et al 2021 the establishment of such quality control procedures will improve the interpretation of viral data and further enhance the accuracy of quantitative wbe back estimation the detection limit of rt qpcr method for norovirus in wastewater 5 0 102 gene copies l is equivalent to 1 25 107 gene copies per 1000 serviced populations within a sewer catchment if the daily wastewater discharge was supposed to be 250 l d person hence norovirus could be detectable if there are more than one shedder in 1000 residents discharging 5 106 gene copies g feces of norovirus in 250 g feces per day the resulted detectable incidence rate is lower than that estimated by hata and honda 2020 such an excretion load is within the reported range 105 to 1010 gene copies g although individual shedding of norovirus can be highly variable if there are only a few shedders in the catchment the variation of shedding could be relatively large as the number of shedders n increases the relative variation of the shedding load decreases by n lai et al 2011 li et al 2021 meanwhile sampling uncertainty also becomes lower with more shedders it should also be noted that the decay of norovirus rna in sewer systems was estimated based on the experimental results from bulk wastewater due to the lack of in sewer studies for the fate of norovirus our reactor based study of viral decay showed the in sewer infectivity decay rates of two surrogate coronaviruses were much higher than those reported in bulk wastewater shi et al 2021 in addition to the decay of viable virus our recent decay experiment of sars cov 2 rna in sewer reactors also showed that the viral rna decays faster in sewers than in bulk wastewater to be published the observed higher decay is likely due to the absorption of viral particles onto suspended solids sediments or sewer biofilms skraber et al 2009 ye et al 2016 likely the actual decay of norovirus rna in sewers could be much higher than in bulk wastewater its sensitivity in wbe back estimation is thus likely underestimated in this study 3 5 future perspectives to enhance wbe for norovirus other than providing quantity information for disease prevalence norovirus in raw wastewater was analyzed by sequencing to reveal the different circulating genotypes as another angle of wbe research fumian et al 2019 mccall et al 2021 prevost et al 2015a for the past two decades norovirus pandemic variants have emerged and replaced the previous dominant strain every two to five years so continuous surveillance of circulating norovirus strains at the population level is crucial for early identification of novel viruses with pandemic potential cheng et al 2021 fukuda et al 2010 kazama et al 2017 since the emergence of new viral strains in wastewater could be detected ahead of clinical reports kazama et al 2017 the dynamic evolution of pre epidemic variants observed by wastewater surveillance can improve our understanding of viral origin the close association between captured new variants in wastewater and norovirus outbreak risk in the population also supports the early warning of possible pandemics lu et al 2021 to assess the changing dynamic of emergent norovirus variants which arose from recombination and antigenic variation lun et al 2018b compared the norovirus gii genotype distribution between wastewater and clinical samples they found that gii p16 gii 4 sydney 2012 strain accounted for 75 0 of total cases in may 2017 rising to 84 2 by august according to the local clinical samples in new south wales australia this strain was increasingly dominant in wastewater along with the increase of reported gastroenteritis outbreaks there were also similar reports in japan kazama et al 2016 and eastern china zhou et al 2016 where the prevalence of gii 4 mainly the gii 4 sydney 2012 strain showed a consistent temporal trend between wastewater and clinical samples in the local catchment areas as shifts in strain dominance were observed both in wastewater and clinical samples the reliability of wastewater as a molecular surveillance tool was substantiated moreover knowledge of such molecular epidemiology is useful for effective vaccine design or testing the outcome of vaccination o ryan et al 2012 overall wastewater monitoring could provide detailed clues on genomic dynamics of noroviruses in community scale and is a useful supplementation for virological surveillance of gastroenteritis given the limited understanding about effects of in sewer processes on viral decay its removal from the water phase further research should be undertaken to understand its fate and transportation in wastewater in sewer degradation may depend on hydro chemical and biological processes in different sewers e g rising main gravity sewer or sewer line closest to the wwtp where there are potentially less available nutrients o brien et al 2017 the dynamic of viral rna attachment and detachment to suspended solids biofilms and sediments would change with wastewater properties like ph and temperature the actual contribution of in sewer decay to overall variance in wbe back estimation remains unclear the sewer biofilms and sediments particularly in gravity sewers may shelter the associated pathogenic genomes from degradation and prolong its presence in wastewater brooks et al 2015 skraber et al 2007 this contributes to the extended preservation in sewers and possible dispersal of pathogen particles outside of epidemic periods to reduce such uncertainties in wbe application future study is required to address the unknown role of in sewer transportation in conjunction with decay rates viral residence time in sewers averagely about 4 h could be another variable influencing the result of back estimation whose uncertainty is difficult to determine o brien et al 2017 ort et al 2014 large variations in per capita flow 90 to 900 l d person between wwtp catchments may also introduce much uncertainty into wbe back estimation tscharke et al 2019 however in this study uncertainties from de facto population in sewer catchments and wastewater flowrates or daily wastewater discharge per capita stormwater dilution dynamic in sewer travel time were not incorporated into the sensitivity analysis as part of a stochastic system the temporal change in fecal excretion during the shedding period was not considered in the current wbe model either due to the limited availability of clinical data in the literature these challenges are currently restricting wbe as a semi quantitative approach for disease surveillance a more elaborated wbe model involving hydraulic consideration in sewers and shedding dynamic is recommended to be developed to achieve reliable and accurate back estimation of norovirus infections 4 conclusions this study systematically reviewed literature data about norovirus rna fecal shedding decay in wastewater and occurrence concentration in wastewater influent samples and based on the collected data a sensitivity analysis was carried out for the three parameters in wbe back estimation for norovirus infections the fecal rna concentration and decay rate constant of norovirus were found to be 7 96 1 74 log10 gene copies g and 0 074 0 065 d 1 respectively the occurrence of norovirus rna in wastewater has been extensively studied and its concentration can reach 109 gene copies l the back estimation is more sensitive to analytical uncertainty of wastewater measurement 65 71 of contribution to variance than norovirus fecal shedding 28 34 the results shed light on the importance to improve accuracy in molecular detection of viral rna concentration in wastewater also more clinical data about norovirus shedding magnitude duration and dynamics can further enhance the accuracy of wbe back estimation on the other hand the wbe back estimation is not sensitive to the norovirus decay in wastewater this may be caused by the significantly underestimated viral decay in real sewers because norovirus rna decay was only measured in bulk wastewater although the norovirus fecal shedding and occurrence in wastewater have been more extensively researched and reported future research is still needed to delineate the fate of norovirus in sewers and the effect of in sewer

15883,the amount of norovirus rna ribonucleic acid in raw wastewater collected from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp can provide an indication of disease prevalence within the sampled catchment however an accurate back estimation might be impeded by the uncertainties from in sewer in sample degradation of viral rna variable shedding magnitude and difficulties in measurement within raw wastewater the current study reviewed the published literature regarding the factors of norovirus shedding viral rna decay in wastewater and the occurrence of norovirus rna in raw wastewater based on molecular detection sensitivity analysis for wbe back estimation was conducted using the reported data of the factors mentioned above considering different viral loads in wastewater samples it was found that the back estimation is more sensitive to analytical detection uncertainty than shedding variability for norovirus although seasonal temperature change can lead to variation of decay rates and may influence the sensitivity of this pathogen specific parameter decay rates of norovirus rna contribute negligibly to the variance in estimating disease prevalence based on the available data from decay experiments in bulk wastewater under different temperatures however the effects of in sewer transportation on viral rna decay and retardation by sewer biofilms on pipe surfaces are largely unknown given the highest uncertainty from analytical measurement by molecular methods and complexity of in sewer processes that norovirus experienced during the transportation to wwtp future investigations are encouraged to improve the accuracy of viral rna detection in wastewater and delineate viral retardation interactions with wastewater biofilms in real sewers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords norovirus wastewater based epidemiology sensitivity analysis viral shedding decay analytical uncertainty 1 introduction norovirus nov is a major cause of epidemic gastroenteritis among people of all ages globally with an estimated infection of 685 million cases each year jones et al 2020 norovirus has single stranded rna around 7 6 kb in length inside the non enveloped viral capsid lun et al 2018a robilotti et al 2015 based on full length amino acid capsid sequences norovirus can be divided into six genogroups with gi and gii groups being the major cause of human infections vega et al 2014 among the globally reported norovirus infections since 1995 65 80 of infections were caused by the predominant norovirus gii 4 vega et al 2014 norovirus could be spread to humans via ingestion of contaminated food or water or the inhalation of air droplets todd et al 2008 patients then excrete norovirus into domestic wastewater corpuz et al 2020 wigginton et al 2015 its high transmissibility is due to the low infectious dose about 10 100 particles continuous shedding newman et al 2016 teunis et al 2015 high resistance to heat or acid polo et al 2020 and prolonged survival in the environment lau et al 2020 lopman et al 2012 in around 40 of cases the main symptom of norovirus infection is a sudden onset of diarrhea ahmed et al 2014 other cases may also suffer from vomiting which is particularly serious for the elderly or immunocompromised patients the illness is also described as winter vomiting disease because the prevalence of outbreaks is significantly increased during colder months ahmed et al 2013 vega et al 2014 norovirus may be excreted in feces one to two days before the onset of symptoms as the incubation period is normally around 48 h robilotti et al 2015 even several months after symptoms resolve norovirus shedding could be detected in stool at relatively low concentrations domman et al 2020 teunis et al 2015 repeated infection is possible because short term immunity acquired cannot provide life long protection against the diverse norovirus genogroups miyoshi et al 2015 patel et al 2009 the excreted norovirus rna in wastewater samples can be quantified using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction rt qpcr and give a numerical estimation of the infections in the catchment area saththasivam et al 2021 weidhaas et al 2021 due to repeated infection norovirus usually occurs in greater abundance compared with other viral pathogens detected in wastewater samples farkas et al 2018b previous studies found a good correlation exists between peaking norovirus rna concentration in wastewater and disease outbreaks in the sampled catchments supporting wastewater screening as a useful approach to monitor norovirus circulation in the community kazama et al 2016 lun et al 2018b zhou et al 2016 by meta analysis the concentration of norovirus in raw wastewater was reported to be significantly higher in winter than in other seasons eftim et al 2017 which is consistent with the yearly fluctuation of infections in populations prevost et al 2015b the early warning of norovirus outbreak is also possible due to the pre symptomatic shedding about 2 days before the onset of symptoms robilotti et al 2015 one study reported that the peak of detected norovirus in wastewater was two to three weeks before the peak of recorded cases hellmer et al 2014 by applying such an approach of wastewater surveillance the disease prevalence at the population level in both spatial and temporal scales can be monitored systematically o brien and xagoraraki 2019 however a precise back estimation approach from pathogen concentration in wastewater to infected cases in the population has not been well established zhu et al 2021 wastewater based epidemiology wbe is not only about measuring the pathogen concentration in raw wastewater downstream but also involves addressing the shedding dynamic at upstream considering viral decay in sewers or during storage before detection and evaluating actual water usage data for prevalence estimation there are various uncertainties related to back estimation through wastewater surveillance li et al 2021 among all parameters in the wbe back estimation eq 1 li et al 2022 there are three virus related parameters including c s viral shedding per gram of feces k in sewer decay rate constant and c rna norovirus rna copies per liter of wastewater sample 1 p catchment c rn a e k t q p s q s c s 10 r c e k t q p s q s 10 r s where p catchment is the number of infected cases within the catchment boundary k is the decay rate constant d 1 t is the hydraulic retention time or in sewer travel time d c rna is the concentration of virus rna in wastewater gene copies l q is the daily wastewater generation per capita l d person p s is the shedding probability in feces from an infected person q s is the daily shedding amount of feces of an individual g d person and c s is the shedding magnitude of viral rna in the stool gene copies g r c is the logarithmic concentration of norovirus rna in wastewater log10 gene copies l and r s is the logarithmic shedding magnitude of norovirus rna in the stool log10 gene copies g inaccurate determination of these virus related parameters may contribute to propagated errors of calculating up stream viral shedding in stool and thus a false estimation of infected cases for example seasonal temperature change might alter the biological decay kinetics thus influencing the detectability of pathogens downstream hart and halden 2020 and introducing more possibilities for false estimation in addition the deviation between downstream observations and original inputs could be higher due to the increased in sewer travel time t in eq 1 the variabilities of these parameters in wbe should be taken into consideration to ensure a reliable back estimation to date there is a lack of knowledge about the relative importance and contributions of these virus related parameters to the back estimation of disease prevalence of norovirus this study aims to i summarize the current understanding about the fate of norovirus rna in urban wastewater systems from fecal excretion to influent of wastewater treatment plants wwtps with in depth review and collation of literature data for wbe back estimation of community prevalence rates ii conduct sensitivity analysis for back estimating norovirus prevalence based on literature data of norovirus shedding in wastewater decay and viral concentrations in wastewater and iii identify the knowledge gaps in achieving more accurate back estimation of norovirus infection by wbe the findings of this study will contribute to understanding the fate of norovirus in urban wastewater systems and the parameter sensitivity for wbe back estimation 2 methods 2 1 literature search and data collection a systematic literature search was conducted by the terms norovirus and sewage or wastewater or sewer and norovirus and feces or stool and shed or excretion using databases available at web of science on 15th october 2021 then the titles of the search results were screened initially to decide whether their full texts entail reading if the title does not contain sufficient information for justification the abstract would be further evaluated to find out whether the paper would provide useful information those papers that passed the screening through the title or abstract were subjected to full text review during the full text review if there were cited papers of relevance those papers from the reference list would also be downloaded and added to the full text review table 1 shows the number of papers selected at different stages norovirus related data norovirus concentration in wastewater viral decay in wastewater and the shedding magnitude in stool determined by rt qpcr were collected from the selected papers into a spreadsheet microsoft excel for the papers providing t 90 or t 99 i e time to achieve 90 or 99 reduction in concentration of norovirus persistence in wastewater the times were converted to first order decay rates using eq 2 and 3 the statistics of k values was then calculated for its mean value and standard deviation at various temperatures for the paper providing data points of fecal virus load in figures the numerical concentrations were extracted by getdata graph digitizer http www getdata graph digitizer com and recorded into the spreadsheet then the mean value and standard deviation were calculated in the spreadsheet accordingly 2 t 90 2 303 k 3 t 99 4 606 k 2 2 data analysis to evaluate the sensitivity of three virus related parameters including c s k and c rna for wbe back estimation eq 1 the number of infected cases p catchment within the catchment boundary is estimated by assuming parameters t q q s as a range of values lai et al 2011 li et al 2021 the hydraulic retention time t was assumed as 1 h 6 h and 12 h representing small medium and large urban sewer catchments respectively the wastewater generation per capita q was assumed as 150 250 and 350 l d person considering variations over time and across locations for the sensitivity analysis ahmed et al 2020a tscharke et al 2019 the daily fecal shedding amount of an individual q s was assumed to be 150 250 and 350 g d person in this study rose et al 2015 in addition the fecal shedding probability p s of an infected person was previously reported as 73 2 miura et al 2018 the log transformed values of virus concentration parameters r s r c and k values were recorded in the spreadsheet and served as inputs into wbe eq 1 by fitting distribution to the data and anderson darling test in oracle crystal ball release 11 1 2 4 600 redwood city ca both normal distribution and uniform distribution were chosen for r s in the sensitivity analysis due to the limited number of data points for decay rates k was assumed as a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation determined from published data r c was evaluated at three distinct levels i e low medium high that were extrapolated from a meta analysis by assuming it as a normal distribution with the analytical limit of detection lod as the standard deviation among different probability distributions with the same variance normal distribution has the highest uncertainty for the parameter value castrup 2007 therefore the choice of normal distribution guaranteed the least amount of prior knowledge would be added to the model given these definitions of input parameters the wbe model in different scenarios i e low medium and high level of viral concentration in wastewater fecal shedding amount wastewater generation per capita and hydraulic retention time was simulated by oracle crystal ball steps detailed in the supplimentary material the monte carlo method was applied to sample from the defined distributions of the parameters a process based on probabilistic statistical theory and law of large numbers the probability of random events would equal the frequency of their occurrence from repeated trials the program did 10 000 samplings from the defined parameters to calculate the forecast which created sensitivity charts and frequency distribution while the simulation was running the sensitivity was calculated by computing rank correlation coefficients between each assumption and corresponding forecast wbe back estimated norovirus prevalence which measures the degree of assumptions and forecasts changing together petterson et al 2021 the calculated coefficients show to what extent a given assumption affects the predicted results through both the uncertainty and model sensitivity of the parameter positive coefficients imply that the increase of parameter values is associated with the increase of the forecast whereas negative coefficients mean the opposite therefore the execution of repeated simulations provides the probability distribution of outcomes and its sensitivity to the input parameters by taking 10 000 samples from estimated input definitions 3 results and discussion 3 1 fecal viral shedding of norovirus as a pathogen causing gastrointestinal disease norovirus is excreted in stool at high concentration up to 1011 gene copies g of feces victoria et al 2014 although there are other shedding sources like saliva or vomit fecal excretion was regarded as the major route of norovirus discharge into sewers anfruns estrada et al 2020 the shedding magnitude of norovirus viral particles was investigated by clinical studies chan et al 2006 ozawa et al 2007 todd et al 2008 fecal specimens were collected within 48 h of symptom onset from patients infected by norovirus gi and gii chan et al 2006 subsequently viral rna was purified from fecal specimens and subjected to rt qpcr quantification fecal concentration of norovirus was reported ranging from 105 to 1010 gene copies g of feces obara et al 2008 sukhrie et al 2013 lee et al 2007 reported the median fecal cdna concentration of norovirus at 108 93 gene copies g of feces interquartile range 108 22 1010 24 gene copies g of feces whereas atmar et al 2008 found that the median peak of norovirus shedding amount was 9 5 1010 gene copies g of feces disregarding genotype or genogroup specificities the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection was estimated at 32 1 by miura et al 2018 while asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals might shed norovirus at similar levels the overall probability of viral shedding was estimated to be 73 2 by statistical modeling of the virological surveillance data miura et al 2018 no significant association was found for symptom onset with daily viral rna concentration in feces duration of viral shedding or cumulative shedding according to norovirus challenge studies newman et al 2016 although symptoms normally would not last beyond a fortnight and the average shedding duration was around one week wu et al 2019 some patients children or older individuals may suffer from chronic norovirus infection over 420 days with constant viral shedding for at least 100 days observed frange et al 2012 ludwig et al 2008 generally the viral rna discharge could drop below 103 gene copies g of feces by 60 days post infection teunis et al 2015 the viral load in feces which is influenced by the patient s age was reported to decrease progressively throughout the shedding period with peak load occurring during the early stage lai et al 2013 3 2 decay of norovirus rna in wastewater after shedding into a toilet norovirus rna would experience in sewer decay during the transportation to wwtps decay experiments were performed to estimate the rna decay rate constants of norovirus gi and gii in wastewater collected from wastewater treatment facilities under different temperatures kauppinen and miettinen 2017 skraber et al 2009 rt qpcr was used for quantification targeting the spiked norovirus strains or indigenous norovirus in samples which were collected during the incubation period the persistence of norovirus rna was recorded by measuring the remaining concentration in wastewater samples during the decay experiments and evaluated by k or t 90 noticeably norovirus rna was relatively stable in wastewater with a lower decay rate constant than viruses like coronavirus ebola and hepatitis a virus while the decay rate of norovirus is comparable with adenovirus and zika virus as shown in table 2 given the norovirus rna decay rate constant at 0 02 0 21 d 1 table 2 and wastewater hrt in sewers around 12 h representing a typical large sewer catchment the in sewer decay of norovirus rna would result in a correction factor ek t in eq 1 of 1 01 1 12 depending on the temperature 4 37 c norovirus decay rates increase with temperatures in wastewater of 4 to 37 c table 2 which might be caused by increased activity of extracellular enzymes protein denaturation damage to nucleic acid or capsid dissociation li et al 2021 makaya et al 2015 moreover indigenous microbial population in wastewater may also contribute to viral inactivation due to higher activity in warmer conditions korajkic et al 2013 thus seasonal temperature variation may lead to different decay rates of norovirus in wastewater during the in sewer transportation to wwtps in addition to temperature other environmental conditions like ph farkas et al 2018a grondahl rosado et al 2014 salinity inoue et al 2020 takahashi et al 2016 suspended solid particles brooks et al 2015 da silva et al 2008 ye et al 2016 sewer sediment or biofilm amarasiri and sano 2019 miura et al 2013 skraber et al 2007 and microbial community hamouda et al 2021 were shown to affect the decay of norovirus the viral decay in wastewater is also dependent on individual species and might be different among species within the same viral genus the spiked norovirus strains could not persist as long as indigenous norovirus in wastewater kauppinen and miettinen 2017 most likely due to the difference in viral structure norovirus gi and gii showed different resistance to heat and persistence during wastewater treatments dunkin et al 2017 gyawali and hewitt 2018 haramoto et al 2018 the variability of persistence within the norovirus genus might also lead to different detectability at downstream locations in some urban catchments wastewater transportation can take as long as 24 h from household to wwtps when going through the sewer network the viral particles might attach to sewer biofilms or sediments foster et al 2021 and then be released with biofilm sloughing caused by strong flow skraber et al 2009 the downstream detectability of viral rna is not only decided by upstream shedding in sewer decay and wastewater flow rates but is also subjected to dilution by stormwater inflow or infiltration guo et al 2022 weidhaas et al 2021 however these effects have not been quantitatively evaluated in most of the reported wbe studies and remain a research gap hence detailed modeling of all possible in sewer processes is still required to associate the viral rna load at sampling points to the disease prevalence within the catchment hamouda et al 2021 3 3 norovirus occurrence and concentration in wastewater the occurrence of norovirus in raw sewage collected from wwtps was reported in singapore aw and gin 2010 new zealand hewitt et al 2011 france sima et al 2011 da silva et al 2007 spain perez sautu et al 2012 santisobellon et al 2020 sweden nordgren et al 2009 the united states montazeri et al 2015 symonds et al 2009 japan miura et al 2015 kitajima et al 2011 switzerland masclaux et al 2013 finland kauppinen et al 2014 norway grondahl rosado et al 2014 ireland flannery et al 2012 italy la rosa et al 2010 iaconelli et al 2016 the united kingdom farkas et al 2018a laverick et al 2004 uruguay victoria et al 2014 brazil victoria et al 2010 fioretti et al 2017 prado et al 2019 south africa mabasa et al 2018 the netherlands lodder and de roda husman 2005 luxembourg kremer et al 2011 kenya kiulia et al 2010 egypt kamel et al 2010 china he et al 2011 south korea han et al 2014 australia lun et al 2018a and canada pouillot et al 2015 the detailed information regarding sampling strategy sampling period and the detected viral concentration for each of these studies are listed in table s1 most of these studies employed rt qpcr for quantification and sequencing methods for phylogenetic analysis many of these studies adopted grab sampling or 24 h composite sampling strategy the wastewater surveillance for norovirus was most frequently reported in annual schemes overall the concentration of norovirus rna in wastewater influent can be up to 109 gene copies l with the q pcr detection limit around 102 7 gene copies l da silva et al 2007 perez sautu et al 2012 pouillot et al 2015 usually among norovirus genus genotype gii and gi are the most abundant in raw wastewater fumian et al 2019 pouillot et al 2015 besides gi and gii genotype norovirus giv was also investigated for its prevalence and genetic diversity in wastewater fioretti et al 2017 kitajima et al 2016 although it was detected at a lower concentration than gi or gii haramoto et al 2018 more frequently norovirus density was higher in colder months katayama et al 2008 probably due to the greater prevalence of gastrointestinal illness the lack of disinfection from ultraviolet of natural sunlight and the prolonged persistence in wastewater due to low temperatures in winter grondahl rosado et al 2014 through systematically reviewing norovirus concentrations in wastewater eftim et al 2017 reported the differences in seasonal and geographical occurrences of nov gi with the overall mean density of 104 4 gene copies l and gii with the overall mean density of 104 9 gene copies l in addition rainfall is a critical factor influencing the viral concentration in wastewater which can be diluted by stormwater in sewers weidhaas et al 2021 the normalization method using fecal makers was recommended to correct the viral concentration when domestic wastewater was subjected to mixing with trade effluent or stormwater other than absolute quantification the relative quantification via qpcr is also a promising approach for the normalization by human specific biomarkers as the internal reference and the determination of the virus abundance in wastewater wu et al 2021 such a method might help improve the comparability of viral concentration in wastewater samples across different catchments and estimate the infection ratio in corresponding communities after normalizing viral concentration by internal control pmmov pepper mild mottle virus wu et al 2020 found that sars cov 2 rna copy numbers in wastewater are less noisy and match the trend of clinical covid 19 cases better however feng et al 2021 reported the reduced correlations when normalizing viral concentration to a spiked recovery control bovine coronavirus or a fecal marker pmmov or hf183 in wastewater thus there are still some debates on whether the internal reference is useful to reduce sample variances and counter the impact of dilution by stormwater runoff and trade effluent 3 4 sensitivity analysis for wbe back estimation of norovirus infections the literature data of rna shedding concentrations in fecal samples 4 34 10 88 log10 gene copies g were extracted and computed for the mean value together with the standard deviation i e 7 96 1 74 log10 gene copies g for the sensitivity analysis table 3 decay rate constants k of norovirus rna generated from the reported t 90 or t 99 values were determined as 0 074 0 065 d 1 through systematic data collection from literature eftim et al 2017 developed the density distribution of norovirus in raw wastewater applying a non parametric bootstrap statistical model three levels of the viral load in wastewater log10 gene copies l were extrapolated from their reported concentrations for different locations and seasons as presented in table 3 limit of detection lod is the lowest detectable concentration whereas limit of quantification loq is the lowest concentration that can be quantitatively measured with suitable accuracy and precision usually the ratio of signal to noise can be used to determine lod 3 1 and loq 10 1 which are matrix specific and highly dependent on analytical methods mohamad 2018 pouillot et al 2015 performed a meta analysis and reported the lod of 2 7 log10 gene copies l for norovirus rna measurement by rt qpcr in wastewater influent samples with the assumption of 100 efficiency during sample concentration rna extraction and rt reaction compared to loq the limit of detection can better represent the analytical error therefore the lod of 2 7 log10 gene copies l was used in this sensitivity analysis as the standard deviation of measured virus concentration in raw wastewater the above mentioned distributions of the parameters normal distributions for the three virus related parameters and a uniform distribution for r s were adopted to evaluate the contribution of different factors k r c and r s to the overall uncertainty of the wbe back estimation table 4 and table s2 it shows that norovirus rna concentration in wastewater contributed around 65 or 71 variance to the wbe back estimation when shedding magnitude was assumed as uniform or normal distribution respectively norovirus fecal shedding concentration r s contributed around 34 when assumed as uniform distribution or 28 when assumed as normal distribution while the relative contribution of the decay was nil according to eq 1 higher viral rna concentration in wastewater corresponds to higher prevalence rate positive correlation whereas shedding concentration in opposite has a negative correlation with the wbe back estimation in addition the level of viral rna load in wastewater i e low medium and high did not make any significant changes to the sensitivity of wbe back estimation the sensitivity analysis based on 10 000 samplings showed that r c has a higher absolute value of pearson correlation coefficient 0 79 0 83 with the predicted infection p catchment thus greater contribution to its variance 65 71 than viral shedding correlation coefficient 0 53 to 0 57 and contribution to variance around 28 34 table 4 and table s2 this implies that the uncertainty from analytical measurement of norovirus rna in wastewater samples has a more significant impact on the wbe back estimation in other words the wbe model is more sensitive to analytical uncertainties under all defined scenarios rna decay rates almost contributed nil to the variance of norovirus prevalence therefore the in sewer decay of norovirus rna was not an influential factor for wbe back estimation based on the available decay rates while the analytical determination of wastewater samples was the dominant source of uncertainty in addition to the two possible data distributions of fecal shedding magnitude the sensitivity analysis for three virus related parameters was also carried out under different conditions with various assumed values the results showed that the changes in t q and q s values only caused very limited changes 5 in the sensitivity of virus related parameters table s3 5 this is because these back estimation parameters are independent to the virus related parameters which are the focus of the sensitivity analysis it should be noted that the sensitivity was evaluated using data obtained on both norovirus gi and gii genotype the analytical sensitivity and detection limit of rt qpcr assays for norovirus gi and gii may be different and contribute differently to the overall uncertainty in wbe back estimation anfruns estrada et al 2020 apart from the biological variation between genotypes in terms of amplification the sampling strategy storage enrichment and extraction processes may also introduce technical variation haramoto et al 2018 when people have diarrhea the frequency of their excreting virus increases but when people are producing normal stools they may only have 1 or 2 flushes a day in which there is an excretion event poor sampling design may overwhelm analytical uncertainty ort et al 2010 but the sampling uncertainty is commonly overlooked in the literature while the obvious solution is to use continuous flow proportional sampling of the wastewater such sampling strategy rarely occurred in these published studies for wastewater monitoring moreover the detection efficiency might be related to the viral rna concentration in stool or wastewater gyawali and hewitt 2018 reporting the recovery efficiency and improving the repeatability of the assay by spiking internal controls has been recommended for various wbe studies francy et al 2012 li et al 2021 the establishment of such quality control procedures will improve the interpretation of viral data and further enhance the accuracy of quantitative wbe back estimation the detection limit of rt qpcr method for norovirus in wastewater 5 0 102 gene copies l is equivalent to 1 25 107 gene copies per 1000 serviced populations within a sewer catchment if the daily wastewater discharge was supposed to be 250 l d person hence norovirus could be detectable if there are more than one shedder in 1000 residents discharging 5 106 gene copies g feces of norovirus in 250 g feces per day the resulted detectable incidence rate is lower than that estimated by hata and honda 2020 such an excretion load is within the reported range 105 to 1010 gene copies g although individual shedding of norovirus can be highly variable if there are only a few shedders in the catchment the variation of shedding could be relatively large as the number of shedders n increases the relative variation of the shedding load decreases by n lai et al 2011 li et al 2021 meanwhile sampling uncertainty also becomes lower with more shedders it should also be noted that the decay of norovirus rna in sewer systems was estimated based on the experimental results from bulk wastewater due to the lack of in sewer studies for the fate of norovirus our reactor based study of viral decay showed the in sewer infectivity decay rates of two surrogate coronaviruses were much higher than those reported in bulk wastewater shi et al 2021 in addition to the decay of viable virus our recent decay experiment of sars cov 2 rna in sewer reactors also showed that the viral rna decays faster in sewers than in bulk wastewater to be published the observed higher decay is likely due to the absorption of viral particles onto suspended solids sediments or sewer biofilms skraber et al 2009 ye et al 2016 likely the actual decay of norovirus rna in sewers could be much higher than in bulk wastewater its sensitivity in wbe back estimation is thus likely underestimated in this study 3 5 future perspectives to enhance wbe for norovirus other than providing quantity information for disease prevalence norovirus in raw wastewater was analyzed by sequencing to reveal the different circulating genotypes as another angle of wbe research fumian et al 2019 mccall et al 2021 prevost et al 2015a for the past two decades norovirus pandemic variants have emerged and replaced the previous dominant strain every two to five years so continuous surveillance of circulating norovirus strains at the population level is crucial for early identification of novel viruses with pandemic potential cheng et al 2021 fukuda et al 2010 kazama et al 2017 since the emergence of new viral strains in wastewater could be detected ahead of clinical reports kazama et al 2017 the dynamic evolution of pre epidemic variants observed by wastewater surveillance can improve our understanding of viral origin the close association between captured new variants in wastewater and norovirus outbreak risk in the population also supports the early warning of possible pandemics lu et al 2021 to assess the changing dynamic of emergent norovirus variants which arose from recombination and antigenic variation lun et al 2018b compared the norovirus gii genotype distribution between wastewater and clinical samples they found that gii p16 gii 4 sydney 2012 strain accounted for 75 0 of total cases in may 2017 rising to 84 2 by august according to the local clinical samples in new south wales australia this strain was increasingly dominant in wastewater along with the increase of reported gastroenteritis outbreaks there were also similar reports in japan kazama et al 2016 and eastern china zhou et al 2016 where the prevalence of gii 4 mainly the gii 4 sydney 2012 strain showed a consistent temporal trend between wastewater and clinical samples in the local catchment areas as shifts in strain dominance were observed both in wastewater and clinical samples the reliability of wastewater as a molecular surveillance tool was substantiated moreover knowledge of such molecular epidemiology is useful for effective vaccine design or testing the outcome of vaccination o ryan et al 2012 overall wastewater monitoring could provide detailed clues on genomic dynamics of noroviruses in community scale and is a useful supplementation for virological surveillance of gastroenteritis given the limited understanding about effects of in sewer processes on viral decay its removal from the water phase further research should be undertaken to understand its fate and transportation in wastewater in sewer degradation may depend on hydro chemical and biological processes in different sewers e g rising main gravity sewer or sewer line closest to the wwtp where there are potentially less available nutrients o brien et al 2017 the dynamic of viral rna attachment and detachment to suspended solids biofilms and sediments would change with wastewater properties like ph and temperature the actual contribution of in sewer decay to overall variance in wbe back estimation remains unclear the sewer biofilms and sediments particularly in gravity sewers may shelter the associated pathogenic genomes from degradation and prolong its presence in wastewater brooks et al 2015 skraber et al 2007 this contributes to the extended preservation in sewers and possible dispersal of pathogen particles outside of epidemic periods to reduce such uncertainties in wbe application future study is required to address the unknown role of in sewer transportation in conjunction with decay rates viral residence time in sewers averagely about 4 h could be another variable influencing the result of back estimation whose uncertainty is difficult to determine o brien et al 2017 ort et al 2014 large variations in per capita flow 90 to 900 l d person between wwtp catchments may also introduce much uncertainty into wbe back estimation tscharke et al 2019 however in this study uncertainties from de facto population in sewer catchments and wastewater flowrates or daily wastewater discharge per capita stormwater dilution dynamic in sewer travel time were not incorporated into the sensitivity analysis as part of a stochastic system the temporal change in fecal excretion during the shedding period was not considered in the current wbe model either due to the limited availability of clinical data in the literature these challenges are currently restricting wbe as a semi quantitative approach for disease surveillance a more elaborated wbe model involving hydraulic consideration in sewers and shedding dynamic is recommended to be developed to achieve reliable and accurate back estimation of norovirus infections 4 conclusions this study systematically reviewed literature data about norovirus rna fecal shedding decay in wastewater and occurrence concentration in wastewater influent samples and based on the collected data a sensitivity analysis was carried out for the three parameters in wbe back estimation for norovirus infections the fecal rna concentration and decay rate constant of norovirus were found to be 7 96 1 74 log10 gene copies g and 0 074 0 065 d 1 respectively the occurrence of norovirus rna in wastewater has been extensively studied and its concentration can reach 109 gene copies l the back estimation is more sensitive to analytical uncertainty of wastewater measurement 65 71 of contribution to variance than norovirus fecal shedding 28 34 the results shed light on the importance to improve accuracy in molecular detection of viral rna concentration in wastewater also more clinical data about norovirus shedding magnitude duration and dynamics can further enhance the accuracy of wbe back estimation on the other hand the wbe back estimation is not sensitive to the norovirus decay in wastewater this may be caused by the significantly underestimated viral decay in real sewers because norovirus rna decay was only measured in bulk wastewater although the norovirus fecal shedding and occurrence in wastewater have been more extensively researched and reported future research is still needed to delineate the fate of norovirus in sewers and the effect of in sewer

15884,carbon nitrogen and phosphorus are critical macroelements in freshwater systems historically researchers and managers have focused on inorganic forms based on the premise that the organic pool was not available for direct uptake by phytoplankton we now know that phytoplankton can tap the organic nutrient pool through a number of mechanisms including direct uptake enzymatic hydrolysis mixotrophy and through symbiotic relationships with microbial communities in this review we explore these mechanisms considering current and projected future anthropogenically driven changes to freshwater systems in particular we focus on how naturally and anthropogenically derived organic nutrients can influence phytoplankton community structure we also synthesize knowledge gaps regarding phytoplankton physiology and the potential challenges of nutrient management in an organically dynamic and anthropogenically modified world our review provides a basis for exploring these topics and suggests several avenues for future work on the relation between organic nutrients and eutrophication and their ecological implications in freshwater systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic nutrients c n p phytoplankton cyanobacteria 1 introduction macronutrients carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p are critical for the growth and maintenance of phytoplankton paerl and barnard 2020 schindler et al 2016 it is generally accepted that inorganic forms are the primary nutrient source available for phytoplankton growth and development yet we currently do not have a comprehensive understanding of how different nutrient forms are utilized by different phytoplankton groups particularly organic forms berman and bronk 2003 the role of organic nutrients in phytoplankton growth and development remains relatively unexplored research is often focused on dissolved organic matter dom as a whole limited to solely one nutrient or focused on marine systems e g baldwin 2013 berman and bronk 2003 cembella et al 1982 glibert et al 2006 furthermore these reviews do not consider the implications of managing aquatic resources with substantial natural and anthropogenic organic nutrient inputs or how future conditions e g storms floods or droughts may affect the inputs of organic nutrient loading on aquatic ecosystems and their phytoplankton communities this knowledge is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of phytoplankton community structure and thus for management of freshwater systems especially where nutrient control measures are being implemented the organic nutrient pool is typically much larger than its inorganic complement baldwin 2013 fitzsimons et al 2020 seitzinger et al 2002 organic nutrients are derived from autochthonous and allochthonous sources some of which are influenced by anthropogenic activities anthropogenic inputs delivered through runoff or groundwater are often mixed with naturally derived organic inputs creating a chemically diverse mixture of nutrients fig 1 hence it is difficult to characterize constituents of the organic nutrient pool and differentiate whether inorganic or organic nutrients or both are being utilized by phytoplankton for growth further nutrient pools are dynamic and are frequently converted to and from organic and inorganic forms the organic nutrient pool has largely been ignored because it was previously thought that phytoplankton did not possess the biophysical characteristics to access organic forms and that organic nutrients were first accessed by microbes i e bacteria archaea fungi protozoa before being transformed into inorganic forms and being taken up by phytoplankton fitzsimons et al 2020 jansson et al 1988 lewis et al 2011 it is now widely recognized that many phytoplankton taxa in particular cyanobacteria can use organic nutrient forms directly although some organic forms can be energetically expensive given that specific enzymes are needed to uptake certain organic nutrient forms gómez pereira et al 2013 mackay et al 2020 markou et al 2014 zubkov et al 2003 this may occur directly through osmotic uptake of dissolved organic c n or p or in mixotrophic phytoplankton through phagocytosis cell eating of organic particles and bacteria however the conditions that lead to organic nutrient uptake the energetic costs of uptake and how specific organic nutrient forms are used are still not well known this conceptual paper synthesizes current knowledge of phytoplankton growth from organic macronutrients with current and future anthropogenic changes in freshwater ecosystems and probes how this may shape phytoplankton community structure now and in the future while some experimental work has begun exploring sources of organic nutrients and mechanisms by which they can be utilized the impact of the diversity and composition of the organic nutrient pool on phytoplankton dynamics and related ecological consequences in combination with global changes e g rising temperatures changing precipitation patterns altered land use remain unclear we highlight how ecological processes and anthropogenic derived persistent organic pollutants contribute to the organic nutrient pool and their effects on freshwater phytoplankton community structure finally we discuss knowledge gaps trajectories of organic nutrient loads and future directions for research that would advance our understanding of the impact of organic nutrients on phytoplankton ecology and allow for efficient mitigation measures in freshwater systems 2 characterizing organic nutrient forms organic nutrients constitute a diverse group of compounds and are derived from autochthonous and allochthonous inputs table 1 autochthonous inputs of particulate and dissolved organic c n and p are sourced from die off exudation excretion and transformation processes within the system that release substrates such as amino acids nucleic acids phospholipids and phosphonates carlson and hansell 2015 allochthonous inputs of organic nutrients are primarily derived from the degradation of upland vegetation organic soil horizons lacustrine wetlands and anthropogenic sources which are delivered by riverine systems and through direct runoff from watersheds to lakes e g humic and fulvic acids biocides berman and bronk 2003 harris and smith 2016 both autochthonous and allochthonous processes are key in shaping the characteristics of organic nutrient forms and their subsequent fate in aquatic ecosystems organic matter om is present as both particulate and dissolved fractions in freshwater systems and includes c n and p om is a heterogeneous group of compounds of both biological and chemical origin om is a primary source of dissolved doc and particulate organic c poc but it also contains particulate and dissolved forms of n pon don and organic p pop dop recently organic nutrients have received increased attention regarding their bioavailability to phytoplankton and subsequent risk of eutrophication glibert 2020 glibert et al 2006 haque et al 2019 the wide variety of natural and anthropogenic sources of organic n and p often contribute to a large percentage of total n tn and total p tp concentrations in freshwater systems including being present as biomass depending on the season and catchment mackay et al 2020 this also often affects the ratio between different bioavailable nutrients stoichiometry with elemental imbalances leading to trophic transfer constraints for higher trophic levels and subsequent top down effects on primary producers tao et al 2018 doc can be further broken down into humic humic acid fulvic acid and humin and non humic material sugars amino acids and lipids fellman et al 2011 pagano et al 2014 doc is often divided into low molecular weight lmw 1000 da and high molecular weight hmw 1000 da components as these groups differ in bioavailability and reactivity amon and benner 1996 thingstad et al 2008 in addition to acting as a c source for organisms doc can modify and influence the behavior of other biogeochemical processes in lakes thingstad et al 2008 tranvik et al 2009 these processes include altering light and temperature regimes by absorbing solar radiation affecting the transport and bioavailability of other compounds forming complexes with trace metals and controlling ph in low alkalinity freshwaters bernhardt and likens 2002 stanley et al 2012 tranvik et al 2009 there are many natural forms of organic n found in freshwater systems and they can be classified based on their bioavailability bronk et al 2007 the least bioavailable highly persistent don fraction includes refractory components that are often large molecules created during the breakdown of organic material like lignin humic acids fulvic acids and amides intermediately bioavailable don compounds in the environment include proteins amino polysaccharides amino sugars chitins peptidoglycans and dissolved combined amino acids the most highly labile fraction consists of relatively small molecules with a low molecular weight like dissolved free amino acids glutamate glycine etc nucleic acids guanine adenine cytosine thymine uracil and excretion products like urea and methylamines bronk et al 2007 highly bioavailable don compounds have a quick turnover time of minutes to days and can often be taken up by phytoplankton directly moreover intermediately bioavailable don compounds may be partially taken up by phytoplankton even though the turnover time can be on annual timescales mackay et al 2020 organic p can be present in om and can also be excreted by living organisms as dop or become available through decomposition of pop auer et al 2014 most of our current knowledge regarding dop arises from marine systems young and ingall 2010 classified marine dop in three different groups based on the type of p bond p esters 80 p anhydrides 10 and phosphonates 10 where percentages indicate contribution to total marine dop the group of dop compounds with p esters include p monoesters like nucleotides and phosphosugars and p diesters such as phospholipids and nucleic acids dop compounds that contain p anhydride bonds include nucleoside di and tri phosphates adp atp inorganic pyrophosphate and polyphosphates naturally occurring dop compounds with phosphonate bonds include phospholipids and low molecular weight metabolites diaz et al 2008 these dop compounds are present in freshwater systems as well but their relative contribution needs validation the bioavailability of different forms of dop depends on the speed at which hydrolysis and remineralization can occur which can vary seasonally auer et al 2014 and spatially including vertical gradients from redox sensitive processes anthropogenic pollution has increased the relative contribution quality and bioavailability of organic c n and p compounds to freshwater ecosystems mainly due to direct release of wastewater into rivers and lakes e g hosen et al 2014 tao et al 2018 and intensification of agriculture thereby shifting stoichiometric ratios e g diego mcglone et al 2000 anthropogenic inputs are derived from point sources namely wastewater treatment effluent and sewage overflows and non point sources including runoff containing fertilizer biocides herbicides pesticides and fungicides animal feed animal waste atmospheric deposition polluted groundwater and surface runoff from impervious surfaces fig 1 e g mrdjen et al 2018 a prominent example of non point source loading is urea which is increasingly being used as an n fertilizer in agricultural landscapes glibert 2020 runoff containing urea has been shown to have impacts on phytoplankton community structure glibert 2017 glibert et al 2006 freshwater systems also receive substantial amounts of biocides from point and non point sources table 1 for example glyphosate currently the most commonly used herbicide in the world hébert et al 2019 contains organic n and p the types of biocides found in surface waters differ by land use type nowell et al 2018 van metre et al 2017 as well as country specific regulatory standards and thus so does the input of organic c and nutrients from biocides organic macronutrients found in freshwater systems also include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps brausch and rand 2011 ferguson et al 2013 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and pah derivatives harris and smith 2016 krzyszczak and czech 2021 van metre and mahler 2010 lab and mesocosm studies indicate that pcpps and pah derivatives can substantially affect aquatic ecosystems yet surprisingly little is known about how or if anthropogenically derived organic nutrient forms like biocides pcpps and pahs and their derivatives ultimately stimulate or inhibit phytoplankton biomass production and or if they affect phytoplankton community composition and functionality 2 1 stoichiometry based on measurements of the elemental balance in plankton and the no3 and po4 3 content of atlantic seawater redfield et al 1963 derived the redfield ratio which is equivalent to a c n p ratio of 41 7 1 by mass 106 16 1 molar ratio although in nature this ratio can vary among individual organisms it refers to the average n p ratio in the biomass of different aquatic plankton communities klausmeier et al 2004 in the past decades this ratio has been confirmed by numerous independent measures in different aquatic environments extending from the deep sea to small ponds see review by sardans et al 2012 this ability of organisms to maintain a relatively stable elemental composition is also referred to as stoichiometric homeostasis aside from biochemical causes biological processes such as n2 fixation and denitrification may also play an important role for the observed homeostasis of aquatic organisms sardans et al 2012 and references therein yet the organismic homeostatic capacity can be limited e g in response to substantial changes in p availability and phytoplankton tend to change their c p and n p ratios e g elser et al 2005 there is abundant experimental evidence that water and organismic c n p ratios are related depending on essential ecological traits these relationships became central for ecological research and form the basis of the ecological stoichiometry concept sterner and elser 2002 which allows calculation of nutrient demands and potential nutrient limitations of plankton organisms in relationship to their ecological traits at present there are numerous studies on the direct and indirect effects of eutrophication via organic nutrients on nutrient stoichiometry bogard et al 2020 2012 finlay et al 2010 glibert 2017 anthropogenic nutrient inputs including organic nutrients have substantially altered c n p ratios in aquatic ecosystems e g koelmans et al 2001 additionally relative proportions of inorganic and organic nutrients have been shifted by anthropogenic pressures organic fertilizer use selective wastewater treatment land management practices etc on freshwater systems whereby organic nutrient loading is increasing even when total nutrient loads have remained constant carver et al 2022 duncan et al 2019 glibert 2020 jarvie et al 2017 for example since 1989 in the united states of america usa the use of urea fertilizers has grown twice as fast as the use of all n based fertilizers fig 2 a trend that has been observed globally glibert et al 2006 stoichiometric changes in c n p ratios and nutrient form have driven systems toward increasing n and or p limited conditions these changes in stoichiometric balance are not consistent between systems and are dependent on factors such as changes in anthropogenic land use climate change and atmospheric deposition elser et al 2011 geng et al 2014 lewis et al 2020 3 phytoplankton organic nutrient uptake mechanisms 3 1 carbon numerous studies have shown that phytoplankton utilize inorganic and organic carbon forms for growth simple doc compounds such as glucose can be used as alternative c sources kamjunke and tittel 2008 mulholland and lee 2009 utilization of doc can supply the same material for biosynthesis or metabolic energy for phytoplankton growth through facultative mixotrophy znachor and nedoma 2010 this may occur through phagotrophy or osmotrophy uptake of dissolved organic nutrients through extracellular digestion and provides a competitive advantage when light or inorganic c forms are limiting laybourn parry and marshall 2003 the chrysophyte dinobryon for example may graze bacteria cells at rates between 0 063 to 1 12 pg c cell day in oligotrophic arctic lakes representing the removal of 1 of bacterial biomass per day laybourn parry and marshall 2003 in grazing experiments the mixotrophic chrysophyte ochromonas efficiently grazed cyanobacteria cells microcystis sp and pseudanabaena sp resulting in substantial cyanobacterial growth reductions and a 91 98 decrease in microcystin concentration van donk et al 2009 doc assimilation has been observed both in light and in dark with the uptake rate varying between different phytoplankton as well as doc species some studies observed higher uptake rates in the dark than in the light glucose uptake kamjunke et al 2008 leucine uptake kamjunke and tittel 2008 attributed to the potential mechanism that heterotrophic doc uptake is suppressed when autotrophic c fixation is dominant doc utilization enables phytoplankton to survive in a permanently ice covered lake in antarctica mcknight et al 2000 this has also been documented for cryptophytes in antarctic dry valley lakes where a combination of mixotrophy and phagotrophy allowed for persistence under extreme environmental conditions roberts and laybourn parry 1999 haptophyte phytoplankton such as chrysochromulina sp decrease their chlorophyll a content and increase prey ingestion rates under low light utilizing mixotrophy as an alternative c source under light limitation jones et al 1995 similarly in northern temperate lakes experiencing browning doc concentrations between 8 12 mg l 1 result in shifts to mixotroph dominated phytoplankton communities hansson et al 2019 senar et al 2021 in tropical and temperate lakes the relative proportion of mixotrophic phytoplankton utilizing organic c for metabolism increases with light limitation and as such mixotrophic phytoplankton are abundant in dystrophic humic lakes pålsson and granéli 2004 other studies observed light stimulated doc uptake leucine by microcystis sp kamjunke and jähnichen 2000 and amino acid by marine picoplankton paerl 1991 which was attributed to the photoheterotrophic incorporation mechanism mixotrophy in cyanobacteria occurs through osmotrophy and has been documented across many genera gaudana et al 2013 modiri et al 2015 vonshak et al 2000 yu et al 2011 in culture spirulina platensis has higher photosynthetic and dark respiration rates grown under mixotrophic conditions than in photoautotrophic cultures vonshak et al 2000 cyanobacteria isolated from iranian lakes including synechococcus sp and pseudanabaena spp showed maximum biomass and lipid production with glucose additions to growth media utilizing mixotrophic metabolism modiri et al 2015 similarly the heterocystous cyanobacterium dolichospermum formerly anabaena pc 7120 increased its growth rates 1 6 times under mixotrophic conditions relative to photoautotrophic growth yu et al 2011 and cyanothece sp has increased growth rates in culture with the addition of simple organic c compounds gaudana et al 2013 while we acknowledge that heterocystous and non heterocystous cyanobacteria strains can utilize alternative c metabolism for continued growth on doc forms the role of mixotrophy in supporting blooms in lake ecosystems under inorganic c depletion and light limitation remains largely understudied 3 2 nitrogen it was previously thought that the don pool was unavailable for phytoplankton uptake but experimental work has confirmed that phytoplankton can utilize this dynamic n pool berman and bronk 2003 lewis et al 2011 seitzinger et al 2002 ammonium nh4 is typically the preferred source of inorganic n for most species of phytoplankton because ammonium uptake is energetically more advantageous but is often present in low concentrations relative to nitrate no3 dortch 1990 flores and herrero 2005 glibert et al 2016 harris et al 2016 muro pastor et al 2005 experimental evidence suggests that while nh4 may be the n form most readily taken up by phytoplankton don may be utilized before the no3 pool is utilized chaffin and bridgeman 2014 this may be due to fe limitation or co limitation with other macro or micro nutrients as fe is needed for no3 assimilation havens et al 2012 north et al 2007 the don pool can be accessed using phytoplankton enzymes as well as through osmotrophy using osmosis or pinocytosis cell drinking and the pon pool can be accessed through phagocytosis bronk et al 2007 lewis et al 2011 palenik et al 1989 phagotrophy is typically limited to cryptophytes and chrysophytes in freshwater systems granéli et al 1999 and can be an important source of nutrients when resources such as light and nutrients are limiting jansson et al 1996 roberts and laybourn parry 1999 but is less common than osmostrophy some species have cell surface enzymes allowing them to oxidize amino acids to nh4 before transportation into the cell lewis et al 2011 palenik et al 1989 another strategy employed by phytoplankton is targeted proteome adaptation and reorganization designed to scavenge organic nutrients increases in proteins needed for organic n and p uptake e g urea and amino acid transporters c n hydrolases and alkaline phosphatase have been observed in lab cultures of emiliania huxleyi mckew et al 2015 3 3 phosphorus it is widely accepted that phosphorus often limits or co limits the growth of phytoplankton in freshwater systems schindler 1977 the focus is typically on dissolved inorganic p dip however dop has also been shown to contribute to phytoplankton growth halemejko and chrost 1984 lin et al 2018 mackay et al 2020 phytoplankton can access pop through phagocytosis and dop using enzymes phagotrophy is limited to certain taxa and typically occurs when dissolved nutrients are highly limited or photosynthesis is light limited granéli et al 1999 jansson et al 1996 organic p is more commonly utilized in the dissolved form via osmotrophy many phytoplankton possess internal and external phosphatases enabling them to release orthophosphate po4 3 from organic p compounds jansson et al 1988 solovchenko et al 2020 whitney and lomas 2019 previously it was thought that bacteria found on or near phytoplankton cells were responsible for metabolizing organic p however observations of coherence between phytoplankton biomass and phosphatase activity coupled with low bacterial biomass has led researchers to conclude that some species of phytoplankton can produce phosphatase enzymes cembella et al 1982 jansson et al 1988 pettersson 1980 there are two primary types of phosphatases acid and alkaline acid phosphatases seem to primarily be used within the cell while alkaline phosphatases are found both internally and externally jansson et al 1988 alkaline phosphatase activity apa is energetically expensive to produce and has often been used as an indicator of p deficiency in phytoplankton communities prentice et al 2019 optimal ph conditions for phosphatase activity are variable among lakes olsson 1990 for example a lower ph optimum was observed in an oligotrophic lake ph 6 whereas a higher ph produced greater enzyme activity in eutrophic lakes ph 7 5 8 5 olsson 1990 further the ph for optimal enzyme activity can be different from ambient lake ph a study of florida usa lakes found a strong inverse relationship between acidity and p and acidity and chlorophyll a concentration havens 1999 a trend that was also observed in danish lakes vestergaard and sand jensen 2000 this indicates that some low nutrient systems may be more acidic and thus may be more likely to foster an environment for acid phosphatases in contrast apa and dissolved inorganic p concentrations are inversely related in meso eutrophic lakes gage and gorham 1985 indicating that alkaline phosphatases may be product inhibited while acid phosphatases can continuously synthesize phosphate regardless of ambient nutrient concentrations jansson et al 1988 but the effects of substrate type have not been fully explored therefore in low nutrient systems acid phosphatase activity may be continuous providing a nutrient source to phytoplankton regardless of dip concentrations these findings are particularly relevant for the management of phytoplankton blooms in acidic water bodies as nutrient reduction strategies may be complicated by these biochemical processes 3 4 microbial facilitation heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton are closely linked in aquatic ecosystems grossart 1999 rooney varga et al 2005 roth rosenberg et al 2020 as previously mentioned early paradigms suggested that organic nutrients were only accessible to phytoplankton through microbial facilitation recent studies have discovered that many species of phytoplankton can however take up organic nutrients directly e g zoccarato et al 2022 nevertheless interactions between heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton that facilitate phytoplankton nutrient uptake have been frequently observed and the underlying mechanisms have been comprehensively reviewed amin et al 2012 cole 1982 zoccarato and grossart 2019 there are three primary bacterial nutrient uptake and regeneration mechanisms in association with phytoplankton first cyanobacteria can stimulate heterotrophic bacteria frischkorn et al 2017 orchard et al 2010 or green algae bar yosef et al 2010 raven 2010 to produce phosphatases which transform organic p into inorganic p second heterotrophic bacteria utilize dom that is released when phytoplankton decompose which frees up c n and p for subsequent blooms azam et al 1983 grossart 1999 patriarca et al 2021 last is a mutualistic symbiotic relationship where the type of heterotrophic bacterial community composition microbiome surrounding the phytoplankton depends on the presence of specific traits for example cyanobacterial n2 fixation or not klawonn et al 2020 louati et al 2015 bloom size nutrient status jackrel et al 2019 or the excretion and exudation of organic matter by phytoplankton cells grossart 1999 the majority of bacteria phytoplankton interactions take place in the close vicinity of the phytoplankton s cell surface i e the phycosphere amin et al 2012 a zone which is characterized by steep chemical gradients such as ph redox and organic matter the increased availability of organic matter and nutrients in the phycosphere that phytoplankton exude and excrete buchan et al 2014 grossart 1999 seymour et al 2017 creates a habitat for microbes where the growth of heterotrophic bacteria is promoted thus a phytoplankton microbiome the symbiotic relationship between heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton has been clearly demonstrated using axenic phytoplankton cultures grossart et al 2006 2005 more recent studies using transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics have resolved specific heterotrophic bacteria phytoplankton interaction mechanisms in great detail landa et al 2017 roth rosenberg et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the biomass of microcystis and planktothrix blooms in harsha lake ohio usa showed a significant association with microbial genes related to organic substrate processing by heterotrophic bacteria wang et al 2021 a recent study showed that cyanobacteria prochlorococcus in oligotrophic waters cannot survive prolonged periods of nutrient starvation in axenic conditions and instead are reliant upon co occurring heterotrophic bacteria to survive extended phases of nutrient and light starvation roth rosenberg et al 2020 thus heterotrophic bacteria play a crucial role in increasing nutrient availability for phytoplankton under nutrient deficient conditions lidbury et al 2022 nutrient mineralization by heterotrophic bacteria however also takes place under nutrient rich conditions especially in organic matter polluted waters boosting toxic cyanobacterial blooms markou et al 2014 tao et al 2018 there is a trade off between bacteria and phytoplankton when competing for macronutrients phytoplankton growth which is often limited by n and or p paerl and barnard 2020 depends inversely on bacterial p utilization and growth bacteria are unlikely to be limited by p in situ godwin and cotner 2015 instead they are often limited by c supply currie and kalff 1984 thingstad et al 2008 heterotrophic bacteria growth and abundance are positively related to phytoplankton abundance and photosynthetic activity highlighting the critical role of bacteria phytoplankton interactions in the phycosphere organic matter mineralization by heterotrophic bacteria increases p availability in aquatic systems which potentially leads to increased phytoplankton growth grossart 1999 for microcystis there is a global microbiome that has multiple beneficial functions e g n sulfur and vitamin cycling hmw carbon degradation for the cyanobacterium cook et al 2019 hoke et al 2021 pal et al 2021 phytoplankton and their microbiome have complementary functional processes which enable a symbiotic relationship between the heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton 4 organic nutrient effects on phytoplankton community structure numerous studies have been conducted regarding how inorganic forms of nutrients shape phytoplankton communities but little attention has been given to their organic counterparts as discussed above there are many mechanisms by which phytoplankton can take up organic nutrients thus their effects on structuring phytoplankton communities in freshwater systems is an important component of phytoplankton ecology 4 1 carbon owing to the various mixotrophic capacities of different species of phytoplankton it is evident that doc availability and uptake play roles in determining phytoplankton community composition and succession cyanobacteria can dominate in oligotrophic systems low inorganic nutrients reinl et al 2021 which may be facilitated in part by facultative mixotrophy allowing them to compensate for c and energy requirements through the utilization of doc quesada et al 2002 zubkov et al 2003 found in oligotrophic oceanic waters prochlorococcus cyanobacteria can remain dominant through the utilization of doc demonstrating that ambient doc concentration can influence phytoplankton community composition a study of 45 different water bodies in new zealand showed that doc plays an important role in shaping phytoplankton and ciliate communities in a wide range of waterbody types galbraith and burns 2010 out of 39 genera that were identified in the study doc was associated with a greater abundance of gyrosigma nitzschia stauroneis and navicula and decreased abundance of cosmarium peridinium ankistrodesmus and coelastrum a mesocosm study demonstrated the positive effects of labile and non labile doc additions on phytoplankton community richness but only labile doc additions resulted in increased chlorophyll a and mixotrophic phytoplankton fonseca et al 2022 doc also affects the light environment which is another important driver of community structure jia et al 2020 4 2 nitrogen there is also variability in affinity for don among species which shapes phytoplankton community characteristics in a review by granéli et al 1999 the authors note that both marine and freshwater diatom and dinoflagellate species can utilize don however agriculturally sourced don is more likely to promote diatom growth while don from forested areas promotes dinoflagellates granéli and moreira 1990 bioassay experiments were used to evaluate the effects of inorganic and organic nutrients on phytoplankton community structure in the new river estuary north carolina usa altman and paerl 2012 additions of inorganic n yielded the highest primary productivity rate increase 50 followed by urea 38 and organic n filtrate from the river 25 biomass responded similarly however the urea and organic n filtrate treatments yielded higher biomass than the inorganic n treatment species specific responses evaluated using photopigments that were calibrated using pigments from pure cultures showed that organic n filtrate promoted dinoflagellates chlorophytes and cyanobacteria more than inorganic n additions in contrast diatoms responded similarly to all nutrient treatments a mesocosm study showed that urea additions caused a shift in n2 fixing cyanobacteria to non n2 fixing cyanobacteria and chlorophytes as well as an increase in chlorophyll a finlay et al 2010 the study also showed that urea additions stimulated microcystin production forms of organic and inorganic n can also have a differential effect on the growth of different cyanobacterial species which is an increasingly important ecological and public health issue a study which evaluated the response of cyanobacteria to inorganic and organic n sources found that growth rate stimulation varied between species chaffin and bridgeman 2014 microcystis had the strongest response to ammonium followed by urea and alanine organic forms and the weakest response to nitrate while planktothrix responded similarly to all n sources except for alanine which did not elicit any growth rate response belisle et al 2016 also observed a positive relationship between urea uptake and cyanobacterial biomass and erratt et al 2020 found that cyanobacteria have significantly faster n uptake rates compared to chlorophytes when urea is supplied in combination with inorganic n sources these responses to nutrient sources however are influenced by other factors such as temperature peng et al 2018 and the timing and duration of nitrogen inputs chaffin et al 2018 although some work has found that cyanobacteria readily assimilate organic n sources particularly urea other work has found that there are concentration thresholds for organic nutrients at which cyanobacteria exhibit a negative response for example bogard et al 2020 found that high concentrations 18 mg n l of urban and agriculturally sourced organic n resulted in a shift toward chlorophyte dominance and decreased microcystin production the authors however note that this result may be specific to hyper eutrophic shallow lakes with direct exposure to anthropogenically sourced n inputs erratt et al 2018 found that urea additions did not result in increased cyanobacterial biomass for 3 different species microcystis dolichospermum and synechococcus relative to nitrate but the urea substrate yielded cells with higher pigment concentrations increasing the photosynthetic capacity of the cyanobacteria under low light conditions as evidenced above and elsewhere glibert 2020 tao et al 2020 yan et al 2015 there is still uncertainty in how increasing organic n loads may affect phytoplankton community composition and n rich metabolite synthesis particularly cyanobacteria 4 3 phosphorus as is the case with organic n studies have found taxa specific differences in dop uptake affinity a study of phytoplankton nutrient uptake in a shallow bay showed greater correspondence between areas with high cyanobacterial biomass and high concentrations of dissolved organic p and n while diatoms and microflagellate algae were dominant in areas of high inorganic nutrient concentrations glibert et al 2004 a recent study evaluated the occurrence of apa during p depleted conditions and found that high activity was associated with high cyanobacterial biomass particularly bloom forming and toxin producing species prentice et al 2019 these results agree with the findings of peacock and kudela 2013 who observed a high rate of phytoplankton dop uptake under p replete conditions and that the highest apa was coincident with dominance of bloom forming cyanobacteria species other studies have also shown that the release of cylindrospermopsin by aphanizomenon sp a cyanobacterium which is not known to produce alkaline phosphatases itself can induce apa in other phytoplankton triggering the release of inorganic p for uptake by the cyanobacterium bar yosef et al 2010 raven 2010 a study employing the enzyme labeled fluorescence elf technique to identify changes in apa showed that the species that were expressing phosphatase activity changed over time among the bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae and dinophyceae phytoplankton groups nedoma et al 2003 rengefors et al 2001 willis et al 2019 have shown variability in apa among individual cells or genetic strains within a given species while these studies demonstrate the variable responses of phytoplankton communities to organic p there are relatively few studies that show how organic p availability shapes phytoplankton communities experimental work that targets these questions is needed as well as work that identifies physiological differences within and among taxa that drive temporal and spatial differences in phosphatase activity the rise in the use of fertilizers and pesticides table 1 containing organic p montiel león et al 2019 smedbol et al 2018 opens the door to questions regarding how anthropogenically derived organic p compounds will affect phytoplankton communities in freshwater systems for instance cyanobacteria can utilize glyphosate an organic compound commonly found in weed killers such as round up hove jensen et al 2014 glyphosate is a phosphonate that can be broken down by microbes but cyanobacteria species including dolichospermum sp formerly anabaena sp leptolyngbya boryana microcystis aeruginosa and nostoc punctiforme have been shown to utilize phosphonates as an organic p source hove jensen et al 2014 although saxton et al 2011 suggested that specific microbial communities are needed for phosphonate mineralization some cyanobacterial taxa possess phosphonate lyase genes that would allow for direct utilization dyhrman et al 2006 schoffelen et al 2018 su et al 2007 saxton et al 2011 evaluated the effects of glyphosate additions ranging from 0 0104 to 1 04 μg l on phytoplankton community abundance and structure and observed a significant increase in abundance of planktothrix with increasing concentration at the same time the abundance of microcystis decreased thereby demonstrating that there are differences among species in affinity for glyphosate utilization in freshwater streams phytoplankton community structure was variable in response to a glyphosate concentration gradient smedbol et al 2018 low glyphosate concentrations 5 10 ug l reduced diversity and at higher glyphosate concentrations 50 1000 ug l the community composition changed significantly and phytoplankton physiology was affected vera et al 2010 found that glyphosate additions led to a decline in diatoms and an increase in cyanobacterial biomass providing further evidence that dop inputs from fertilizer do not elicit an identical response among phytoplankton species strain specific differences in phosphonate lyase genes and localized environmental conditions likely underpin glyphosate degradation huntscha et al 2018 and possibly its effects on phytoplankton community structure in freshwater systems 4 4 hypothesized combined effects of organic c n and p on phytoplankton community structure most studies on phytoplankton and organic nutrients are focused on a single nutrient c n or p and do not consider the synergistic effects of different organic nutrients or indeed their interactions with other environmental conditions here we hypothesize how the phytoplankton community structure will change as dissolved organic c n or p increase individually and in combination fig 3 increases in doc have been shown to favor taxa that are capable of mixotrophy or low light which include taxa from cryptophytes cryptomonas sp chrysophytes dinobryon sp haptophytes chrysochromulina sp diatoms navicula sp and cyanobacteria dolichospermum sp kamjunke and jähnichen 2000 hansson et al 2019 yu et al 2011 senar et al 2021 increases in don have been shown to favor cyanobacteria microcystis sp chaffin and bridgeman 2014 and in some cases chlorophytes or dinoflagellates altman and paerl 2012 whereas increases in dop have been shown to favor summer blooming cyanobacteria taxa such as dolichospermum sp microcystis sp and planktothrix sp hove jensen et al 2014 peacock and kudela 2013 in a scenario where organic c n and p concurrently increase we hypothesize that cyanobacteria taxa are poised to dominate the phytoplankton community given they have been found to be favored by increases in each individual organic nutrient this statement aligns with previous research that has shown inorganic c n and p eutrophication of aquatic systems favors cyanobacteria over other eukaryotic competitors downing et al 2001 however differences in organic c n and p loading will likely change stoichiometric organic nutrient loading in turn influencing what phytoplankton groups individual taxonomic strains are favored even with the cyanobacterial phytoplankton group e g n2 fixing vs non n2 fixing cyanobacteria chaffin and bridgeman 2014 additionally other environmental factors discussed below will interact with organic nutrient loading to alter phytoplankton community structure 5 combined effects of organic nutrients and anthropogenic influences on phytoplankton communities there is a wide range of ecological impacts stemming from altered climate regimes and human activities on the landscape including increased temperature flooding droughts acidification forest fires deforestation altered hydrology connectivity and many others many of these changes will interact with the effects of organic nutrients on phytoplankton community structure as described above in this section we explore the combined effects of anthropogenically driven changes in environmental factors and organic nutrients on phytoplankton communities 5 1 temperature increasing water temperatures directly favor cyanobacteria and chlorophytes with cyanobacteria having a sharper growth rate curve at temperatures greater than 25⁰c lürling et al 2013 paerl and huisman 2008 additionally higher water temperature will increase mineralization rates and thus the sediment organic nutrient pool as temperature has a strong positive relationship with bacterial organic c gudasz et al 2010 n and p de neve et al 2003 mineralization rates the conversion from organic nutrients in the sediment to inorganic nutrients will also likely be accelerated higher air temperatures also accelerate processing of soil carbon on land which is among the factors thought to contribute to increased doc browning and eutrophication in many northern temperate lakes brothers et al 2013 winterdahl et al 2014 at the same time phytoplankton nutrient uptake rates are expected to increase with increasing temperatures aksnes and egge 1991 the combined effects of increased mineralization and uptake rates could thus fuel rapid phytoplankton bloom development further in lakes experiencing browning the combined effects of warming temperatures may increase cyanobacterial abundance due to their ability to grow rapidly under low light and high temperature conditions rising temperatures will also lead to a higher frequency and intensity of lake heatwaves defined as a period of extremely warm surface water temperature woolway et al 2021 which have been shown to favor cyanobacteria over other phytoplankton jöhnk et al 2008 a mesocosm experiment implemented in a hypertrophic urban canal zhan et al 2022 suggests that heatwaves through its accelerating impacts on biogeochemical processes may lock p pools in organic forms and consequently hamper p reduction efficacy by chemical adsorbents targeting only inorganic p forms 5 2 precipitation climate driven increases in precipitation and the frequency of high intensity storm events may increase nutrient inputs carpenter et al 2018 but these changes may not be the same for organic and inorganic constituents for example sadro and melack 2012 found that an extreme rain event resulted in no increase in dip loading to an oligotrophic lake but dop increased by half and don increased by more than double this increase in don and dop was not associated with an increase in chlorophyll a but the post flood samples were collected 10 days after the event which may not have been sufficient time to detect any biological response dual increases in don and dop are likely to favor increases in cyanobacteria but may also increase the abundance of chlorophytes or dinoflagellates altman and paerl 2012 depending on the baseline composition of the phytoplankton community in agricultural areas with tile drainage or drainage ditches extreme precipitation events may lead to mobilization of labile doc and don dalzell et al 2007 kaushal et al 2014 bhattacharya and osburn 2020 whereas in wetland and forest dominant watersheds studies have shown that increased precipitation may lead to transport of 70 80 of the annual dom load to the downstream receiving waterbody raymond and saiers 2010 bhattacharya and osburn 2021 in urbanized areas increased precipitation leads to sewage overflows to surrounding areas increasing the loading of doc relative to don and dop teurlincx et al 2019 increased coverage of impervious substrate through urbanization in conjunction with more extreme storm events may also lead to increased organic nutrient loading hosen et al 2014 bhattacharya and osburn 2020 high doc loading associated with storm events will lead to intermittent or sustained periods of low light depending on the waterbody thus taxa that can tolerate low light conditions will be favored see section 4 4 nutrient loading during a discharge event is also strongly linked to antecedent conditions musolff et al 2021 showed that a higher doc and nh4 loading was linked to low antecedent discharge 30 days before the discharge event and higher water temperatures this was also supported by the results of loecke et al 2017 where droughts followed by high intensity rain events resulted in substantially increased nutrient loading compared to when there were no antecedent droughts other studies have reported altered quantity and quality of doc inputs from the landscape to receiving water bodies resulting from droughts as well as forest fires and acidification donahue et al 1998 schindler et al 1997 despite the numerous reports on the substantial organic nutrient inputs associated with precipitation events their permanent effects on phytoplankton community structure remains largely unexplored these hydrologic changes not only affect nutrients in the water column but also the sediments organic material that is not taken up from the water column is ultimately deposited in the sediments and is used later or remineralized into inorganic forms a process that may be exacerbated during droughts nürnberg 2009 this organic nutrient stock can contribute significantly to internal loading even in oligotrophic systems where inorganic p exists mostly as fractions sorbed or complexed with compounds having low bioavailability e g fe or aluminum hydroxides whereas organic p is more bioavailable ni et al 2019a a study evaluating the role of sediment organic p in six lakes across a trophic gradient found that sediment organic p was more strongly related to lake trophic state than water column tp ni et al 2019b given that increases in dop have been related to cyanobacterial dominance hove jensen et al 2014 cyanobacteria may be favored over other phytoplankton taxa during dop rich loading events from intensive rain or internal loading sources see section 4 4 above 5 3 land use changes future changes in land use kayler et al 2019 will likely affect the composition of the dom relative contribution of organic c n and p fractions and its metabolism in freshwater systems yates et al 2019a 2019b and others bhattacharya and osburn 2020 heinz et al 2015 have shown that the composition of dom especially the c n and doc don ratios as well as the doc dop ratio were largely influenced by dominant land cover in the catchment and thus land use changes may have significant implications for the stoichiometry of receiving waters nutrient enrichment due to anthropogenic inputs of inorganic n and a greater proportion of agricultural land in the catchment resulted in a dom composition with a lower doc don ratio and subsequently enriched in n mattsson et al 2009 wymore et al 2021 similar relationships have been found for dop brailsford et al 2021 carver et al 2022 however a combination of organic c n and p loading likely causes undesirable cyanobacterial dominance of the phytoplankton community see section 4 4 above 5 4 other factors although most studies focus on the anthropogenic effects as outlined in the sections above there are many other factors that may interact with organic nutrients to influence the structure of phytoplankton communities for example light conductivity and ph and their interaction with nutrients can also play a key role in determining the distribution of phytoplankton species in freshwater systems jia et al 2020 jia et al 2020 sampled 15 locations in the poyang lake basin and 15 sites in upstream watersheds to develop models to identify environmental factors affecting phytoplankton communities their analysis showed that light ph and nutrient ratios are better predictors of phytoplankton community structure than nutrients alone and that light in particular was a key driver in this turbid system the community was dominated by the chlorophyta phylum 48 12 followed by bacillariophyta 24 06 and cyanophyta 15 04 but species richness was highest for cyanophyta however this study only considered doc and inorganic forms of n and p therefore the effects of organic n and p in combination with light may be different dissolved oxygen concentrations are expected to decrease as lake temperatures increase due to longer and more stable periods of stratification woolway and merchant 2019 and reduced capacity to hold oxygen at higher temperatures decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations near the sediment water interface will likely lead to longer periods of anoxia which in turn causes inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen release from the sediments i e internal nutrient loading however organic nutrient release from the sediments does not seem to be confined to periods of anoxia laboratory experiments showed that changes in nutrient and dissolved oxygen concentration have little effect on organic phosphorus release from estuary sediments kang et al 2018 however another recent experimental study from humic lakes in finland revealed that humic dom may form complexes with fe bound p and in turn limit the sedimentary p release rates tammeorg et al 2022 thus diminished internal loading in lakes undergoing browning may have additional implications for phytoplankton communities and lake productivity in general another study of sediments from lake taihu china showed that organic p in the sediments were not important contributors of sediment p to the water column bai et al 2009 however another experimental study found that organic p transformation was increased in anaerobic dissolved oxygen conditions at high temperatures 20 c meaning that under future conditions with warmer water temperatures and lower dissolved oxygen concentrations we may observe a greater proportion of organic p release from sediments bai et al 2009 which in turn may increase dop loading and thus favor cyanobacteria dominance of the phytoplankton community acidification and recovery are other important processes that affect phytoplankton community structure both through direct and indirect effects on organic nutrients boström 1984 found that organic p in the sediments were depleted at higher ph values ph 8 9 but not as high as fe and al bound p ph 9 10 doc reactivity is also affected by ph anesio and granéli 2003 conducted experiments showing that acidification resulted in increased photochemical mineralization of doc and a subsequent decrease in doc concentrations this has important implications for phytoplankton communities both through the availability of c sources and alterations in the light environment schindler et al 1996 for example a decrease in doc may increase light availability resulting a in a more diverse phytoplankton community rather than one dominated by taxa with a tolerance for low light conditions these effects combined with the factors outlined above and others resulti in complex chemical biological and physical interactions that structure phytoplankton communities 6 challenges perspectives and future directions our understanding of the effects of organic nutrients on phytoplankton communities is still lacking despite the substantial naturally and anthropogenically derived pools of organic nutrients delivered to freshwater systems the few studies that have been conducted demonstrate a wide range in phytoplankton responses to organic nutrients and highlight a need for continued research on how organic nutrients shape phytoplankton communities in this section we discuss current knowledge gaps management challenges and offer recommendations for future research regarding organic nutrients in freshwater systems there are many methodological and experimental knowledge gaps in organic nutrient research fig 4 although several tools and approaches have been developed for characterizing doc species in freshwater ecosystems reviewed in mccallister et al 2018 cost effective tools and approaches for evaluating don and dop species are relatively lacking compared to doc karl and björkman 2015 zheng et al 2021 this lack of analytical tools and approaches prevents a full account of when and where specific organic nutrients are present in concentrations that may impact phytoplankton community composition and abundance fig 4 c and d further the physiological response of phytoplankton to organic nutrients is a major knowledge gap with a better understanding needed for both the scientific community and natural resource managers physiological knowledge gaps include information on which specific mechanism s phytoplankton species use to assimilate organic nutrients and to what extent this is context dependent especially for anthropogenically derived organic compounds fig 4e additionally the role of mixotrophy in supporting blooms in lake ecosystems under inorganic c depletion and light limitation remains understudied and prevents a complete understanding of when and where organic c metabolism strategies are used by phytoplankton fig 4f experimental work that targets these questions specifically is needed as well as work that identifies physiological differences within and among taxa that drive temporal and spatial differences in phosphatase activity fig 4g further insights on microbial mechanisms used to mineralize organic c n and p from sediments are lacking in particular under oxic conditions fig 4h orihel et al 2017 changes in abiotic factors due to climate change and other anthropogenic pressures will also affect organic nutrient composition and stoichiometry increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns resulting from climate change will likely influence biochemical and physical processes in lakes and thus organic nutrient cycling and subsequent effects on phytoplankton fig 4a woolway et al 2020 changes in land use will also affect the delivery of organic nutrients to freshwater systems fig 4b there has been a shift from inorganic to organic forms of n based fertilizers with urea usage on the rise globally glibert 2017 urea fertilizers account for more than 50 of the n based fertilizers used globally and is the preferred agricultural fertilizer due to its increased water solubility leading to greater distribution in the soil glibert et al 2006 low cost and minimal damage to crops belisle et al 2016 between 1989 and 2015 usa consumption of urea based fertilizers increased 108 compared to all n based fertilizers which increased by only 47 addressing the separate and concomitant effects of climate change and land use change on phytoplankton communities and organic nutrients is another important avenue for future research organic nutrients present significant challenges for natural resource management management strategies to combat eutrophication typically focus on p control strategies however n also plays an important role in eutrophication lewis et al 2011 furthermore research on n inputs has targeted inorganic forms despite rising inputs of organic n from various sources fig 2 glibert et al 2006 leaving our knowledge of how organic forms shape phytoplankton communities and what that means for ecosystem health and management of freshwater resources lacking yates et al 2019b studied effluent from four different types of wastewater treatment plants in the uk and found that don and dop contributed to 3 10 and 6 14 of total n and p concentrations respectively the majority of these don and dop compounds in wastewater have yet to be characterized zheng et al 2021 and some components of don and dop in wastewater effluent have been found to be highly bioavailable qin et al 2015 qin et al 2015 estimated the bioavailability of these don and dop fractions to range between 27 9 60 5 and 73 7 75 4 respectively further wastewater monitoring is typically focused on the monitoring and removal of inorganic forms which not only creates the potential to miss the amount and forms of organic nutrients entering freshwater systems but may also alter the ratio of inorganic to organic nutrients in receiving waterbodies additionally organic nutrients within wild and domestic animal fecal matter are also understudied compared to inorganic forms for example waterfowl can be a substantial source of terrestrial nutrient transport to aquatic systems hahn et al 2008 maliaka et al 2020 lastly the majority of the most used herbicides and pesticides in the usa contain organic n and p and or other macronutrients such as sulfur table 1 future research should consider how individual e g n containing atrazine or multiple macronutrients e g n and p containing glyphosate contained in organic pollutants affect phytoplankton biomass and community structure 7 conclusions an increasing amount of diverse organic nutrients are being discharged into surface waters globally fig 1 the characterization and bioavailability of these organic nutrients to phytoplankton growth are relatively understudied compared to inorganic nutrient forms here we explored forms of organic nutrients entering these systems and potential implications for phytoplankton community restructuring further we identified several knowledge gaps and highlighted management issues arising from the delivery of organic nutrients to freshwater systems fig 4 and hypothesized how increases in organic nutrient loading may change phytoplankton community structure fig 3 this work provides a foundation for future research efforts regarding organic nutrients and their role in the eutrophication of freshwater

15884,carbon nitrogen and phosphorus are critical macroelements in freshwater systems historically researchers and managers have focused on inorganic forms based on the premise that the organic pool was not available for direct uptake by phytoplankton we now know that phytoplankton can tap the organic nutrient pool through a number of mechanisms including direct uptake enzymatic hydrolysis mixotrophy and through symbiotic relationships with microbial communities in this review we explore these mechanisms considering current and projected future anthropogenically driven changes to freshwater systems in particular we focus on how naturally and anthropogenically derived organic nutrients can influence phytoplankton community structure we also synthesize knowledge gaps regarding phytoplankton physiology and the potential challenges of nutrient management in an organically dynamic and anthropogenically modified world our review provides a basis for exploring these topics and suggests several avenues for future work on the relation between organic nutrients and eutrophication and their ecological implications in freshwater systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic nutrients c n p phytoplankton cyanobacteria 1 introduction macronutrients carbon c nitrogen n and phosphorus p are critical for the growth and maintenance of phytoplankton paerl and barnard 2020 schindler et al 2016 it is generally accepted that inorganic forms are the primary nutrient source available for phytoplankton growth and development yet we currently do not have a comprehensive understanding of how different nutrient forms are utilized by different phytoplankton groups particularly organic forms berman and bronk 2003 the role of organic nutrients in phytoplankton growth and development remains relatively unexplored research is often focused on dissolved organic matter dom as a whole limited to solely one nutrient or focused on marine systems e g baldwin 2013 berman and bronk 2003 cembella et al 1982 glibert et al 2006 furthermore these reviews do not consider the implications of managing aquatic resources with substantial natural and anthropogenic organic nutrient inputs or how future conditions e g storms floods or droughts may affect the inputs of organic nutrient loading on aquatic ecosystems and their phytoplankton communities this knowledge is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of phytoplankton community structure and thus for management of freshwater systems especially where nutrient control measures are being implemented the organic nutrient pool is typically much larger than its inorganic complement baldwin 2013 fitzsimons et al 2020 seitzinger et al 2002 organic nutrients are derived from autochthonous and allochthonous sources some of which are influenced by anthropogenic activities anthropogenic inputs delivered through runoff or groundwater are often mixed with naturally derived organic inputs creating a chemically diverse mixture of nutrients fig 1 hence it is difficult to characterize constituents of the organic nutrient pool and differentiate whether inorganic or organic nutrients or both are being utilized by phytoplankton for growth further nutrient pools are dynamic and are frequently converted to and from organic and inorganic forms the organic nutrient pool has largely been ignored because it was previously thought that phytoplankton did not possess the biophysical characteristics to access organic forms and that organic nutrients were first accessed by microbes i e bacteria archaea fungi protozoa before being transformed into inorganic forms and being taken up by phytoplankton fitzsimons et al 2020 jansson et al 1988 lewis et al 2011 it is now widely recognized that many phytoplankton taxa in particular cyanobacteria can use organic nutrient forms directly although some organic forms can be energetically expensive given that specific enzymes are needed to uptake certain organic nutrient forms gómez pereira et al 2013 mackay et al 2020 markou et al 2014 zubkov et al 2003 this may occur directly through osmotic uptake of dissolved organic c n or p or in mixotrophic phytoplankton through phagocytosis cell eating of organic particles and bacteria however the conditions that lead to organic nutrient uptake the energetic costs of uptake and how specific organic nutrient forms are used are still not well known this conceptual paper synthesizes current knowledge of phytoplankton growth from organic macronutrients with current and future anthropogenic changes in freshwater ecosystems and probes how this may shape phytoplankton community structure now and in the future while some experimental work has begun exploring sources of organic nutrients and mechanisms by which they can be utilized the impact of the diversity and composition of the organic nutrient pool on phytoplankton dynamics and related ecological consequences in combination with global changes e g rising temperatures changing precipitation patterns altered land use remain unclear we highlight how ecological processes and anthropogenic derived persistent organic pollutants contribute to the organic nutrient pool and their effects on freshwater phytoplankton community structure finally we discuss knowledge gaps trajectories of organic nutrient loads and future directions for research that would advance our understanding of the impact of organic nutrients on phytoplankton ecology and allow for efficient mitigation measures in freshwater systems 2

and dissolved organic c n and p are sourced from die off exudation excretion and transformation processes within the system that release substrates such as amino acids nucleic acids phospholipids and phosphonates carlson and hansell 2015 allochthonous inputs of organic nutrients are primarily derived from the degradation of upland vegetation organic soil horizons lacustrine wetlands and anthropogenic sources which are delivered by riverine systems and through direct runoff from watersheds to lakes e g humic and fulvic acids biocides berman and bronk 2003 harris and smith 2016 both autochthonous and allochthonous processes are key in shaping the characteristics of organic nutrient forms and their subsequent fate in aquatic ecosystems organic matter om is present as both particulate and dissolved fractions in freshwater systems and includes c n and p om is a heterogeneous group of compounds of both biological and chemical origin om is a primary source of dissolved doc and particulate organic c poc but it also contains particulate and dissolved forms of n pon don and organic p pop dop recently organic nutrients have received increased attention regarding their bioavailability to phytoplankton and subsequent risk of eutrophication glibert 2020 glibert et al 2006 haque et al 2019 the wide variety of natural and anthropogenic sources of organic n and p often contribute to a large percentage of total n tn and total p tp concentrations in freshwater systems including being present as biomass depending on the season and catchment mackay et al 2020 this also often affects the ratio between different bioavailable nutrients stoichiometry with elemental imbalances leading to trophic transfer constraints for higher trophic levels and subsequent top down effects on primary producers tao et al 2018 doc can be further broken down into humic humic acid fulvic acid and humin and non humic material sugars amino acids and lipids fellman et al 2011 pagano et al 2014 doc is often divided into low molecular weight lmw 1000 da and high molecular weight hmw 1000 da components as these groups differ in bioavailability and reactivity amon and benner 1996 thingstad et al 2008 in addition to acting as a c source for organisms doc can modify and influence the behavior of other biogeochemical processes in lakes thingstad et al 2008 tranvik et al 2009 these processes include altering light and temperature regimes by absorbing solar radiation affecting the transport and bioavailability of other compounds forming complexes with trace metals and controlling ph in low alkalinity freshwaters bernhardt and likens 2002 stanley et al 2012 tranvik et al 2009 there are many natural forms of organic n found in freshwater systems and they can be classified based on their bioavailability bronk et al 2007 the least bioavailable highly persistent don fraction includes refractory components that are often large molecules created during the breakdown of organic material like lignin humic acids fulvic acids and amides intermediately bioavailable don compounds in the environment include proteins amino polysaccharides amino sugars chitins peptidoglycans and dissolved combined amino acids the most highly labile fraction consists of relatively small molecules with a low molecular weight like dissolved free amino acids glutamate glycine etc nucleic acids guanine adenine cytosine thymine uracil and excretion products like urea and methylamines bronk et al 2007 highly bioavailable don compounds have a quick turnover time of minutes to days and can often be taken up by phytoplankton directly moreover intermediately bioavailable don compounds may be partially taken up by phytoplankton even though the turnover time can be on annual timescales mackay et al 2020 organic p can be present in om and can also be excreted by living organisms as dop or become available through decomposition of pop auer et al 2014 most of our current knowledge regarding dop arises from marine systems young and ingall 2010 classified marine dop in three different groups based on the type of p bond p esters 80 p anhydrides 10 and phosphonates 10 where percentages indicate contribution to total marine dop the group of dop compounds with p esters include p monoesters like nucleotides and phosphosugars and p diesters such as phospholipids and nucleic acids dop compounds that contain p anhydride bonds include nucleoside di and tri phosphates adp atp inorganic pyrophosphate and polyphosphates naturally occurring dop compounds with phosphonate bonds include phospholipids and low molecular weight metabolites diaz et al 2008 these dop compounds are present in freshwater systems as well but their relative contribution needs validation the bioavailability of different forms of dop depends on the speed at which hydrolysis and remineralization can occur which can vary seasonally auer et al 2014 and spatially including vertical gradients from redox sensitive processes anthropogenic pollution has increased the relative contribution quality and bioavailability of organic c n and p compounds to freshwater ecosystems mainly due to direct release of wastewater into rivers and lakes e g hosen et al 2014 tao et al 2018 and intensification of agriculture thereby shifting stoichiometric ratios e g diego mcglone et al 2000 anthropogenic inputs are derived from point sources namely wastewater treatment effluent and sewage overflows and non point sources including runoff containing fertilizer biocides herbicides pesticides and fungicides animal feed animal waste atmospheric deposition polluted groundwater and surface runoff from impervious surfaces fig 1 e g mrdjen et al 2018 a prominent example of non point source loading is urea which is increasingly being used as an n fertilizer in agricultural landscapes glibert 2020 runoff containing urea has been shown to have impacts on phytoplankton community structure glibert 2017 glibert et al 2006 freshwater systems also receive substantial amounts of biocides from point and non point sources table 1 for example glyphosate currently the most commonly used herbicide in the world hébert et al 2019 contains organic n and p the types of biocides found in surface waters differ by land use type nowell et al 2018 van metre et al 2017 as well as country specific regulatory standards and thus so does the input of organic c and nutrients from biocides organic macronutrients found in freshwater systems also include pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps brausch and rand 2011 ferguson et al 2013 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and pah derivatives harris and smith 2016 krzyszczak and czech 2021 van metre and mahler 2010 lab and mesocosm studies indicate that pcpps and pah derivatives can substantially affect aquatic ecosystems yet surprisingly little is known about how or if anthropogenically derived organic nutrient forms like biocides pcpps and pahs and their derivatives ultimately stimulate or inhibit phytoplankton biomass production and or if they affect phytoplankton community composition and functionality 2 1 stoichiometry based on measurements of the elemental balance in plankton and the no3 and po4 3 content of atlantic seawater redfield et al 1963 derived the redfield ratio which is equivalent to a c n p ratio of 41 7 1 by mass 106 16 1 molar ratio although in nature this ratio can vary among individual organisms it refers to the average n p ratio in the biomass of different aquatic plankton communities klausmeier et al 2004 in the past decades this ratio has been confirmed by numerous independent measures in different aquatic environments extending from the deep sea to small ponds see review by sardans et al 2012 this ability of organisms to maintain a relatively stable elemental composition is also referred to as stoichiometric homeostasis aside from biochemical causes biological processes such as n2 fixation and denitrification may also play an important role for the observed homeostasis of aquatic organisms sardans et al 2012 and references therein yet the organismic homeostatic capacity can be limited e g in response to substantial changes in p availability and phytoplankton tend to change their c p and n p ratios e g elser et al 2005 there is abundant experimental evidence that water and organismic c n p ratios are related depending on essential ecological traits these relationships became central for ecological research and form the basis of the ecological stoichiometry concept sterner and elser 2002 which allows calculation of nutrient demands and potential nutrient limitations of plankton organisms in relationship to their ecological traits at present there are numerous studies on the direct and indirect effects of eutrophication via organic nutrients on nutrient stoichiometry bogard et al 2020 2012 finlay et al 2010 glibert 2017 anthropogenic nutrient inputs including organic nutrients have substantially altered c n p ratios in aquatic ecosystems e g koelmans et al 2001 additionally relative proportions of inorganic and organic nutrients have been shifted by anthropogenic pressures organic fertilizer use selective wastewater treatment land management practices etc on freshwater systems whereby organic nutrient loading is increasing even when total nutrient loads have remained constant carver et al 2022 duncan et al 2019 glibert 2020 jarvie et al 2017 for example since 1989 in the united states of america usa the use of urea fertilizers has grown twice as fast as the use of all n based fertilizers fig 2 a trend that has been observed globally glibert et al 2006 stoichiometric changes in c n p ratios and nutrient form have driven systems toward increasing n and or p limited conditions these changes in stoichiometric balance are not consistent between systems and are dependent on factors such as changes in anthropogenic land use climate change and atmospheric deposition elser et al 2011 geng et al 2014 lewis et al 2020 3 phytoplankton organic nutrient uptake mechanisms 3 1 carbon numerous studies have shown that phytoplankton utilize inorganic and organic carbon forms for growth simple doc compounds such as glucose can be used as alternative c sources kamjunke and tittel 2008 mulholland and lee 2009 utilization of doc can supply the same material for biosynthesis or metabolic energy for phytoplankton growth through facultative mixotrophy znachor and nedoma 2010 this may occur through phagotrophy or osmotrophy uptake of dissolved organic nutrients through extracellular digestion and provides a competitive advantage when light or inorganic c forms are limiting laybourn parry and marshall 2003 the chrysophyte dinobryon for example may graze bacteria cells at rates between 0 063 to 1 12 pg c cell day in oligotrophic arctic lakes representing the removal of 1 of bacterial biomass per day laybourn parry and marshall 2003 in grazing experiments the mixotrophic chrysophyte ochromonas efficiently grazed cyanobacteria cells microcystis sp and pseudanabaena sp resulting in substantial cyanobacterial growth reductions and a 91 98 decrease in microcystin concentration van donk et al 2009 doc assimilation has been observed both in light and in dark with the uptake rate varying between different phytoplankton as well as doc species some studies observed higher uptake rates in the dark than in the light glucose uptake kamjunke et al 2008 leucine uptake kamjunke and tittel 2008 attributed to the potential mechanism that heterotrophic doc uptake is suppressed when autotrophic c fixation is dominant doc utilization enables phytoplankton to survive in a permanently ice covered lake in antarctica mcknight et al 2000 this has also been documented for cryptophytes in antarctic dry valley lakes where a combination of mixotrophy and phagotrophy allowed for persistence under extreme environmental conditions roberts and laybourn parry 1999 haptophyte phytoplankton such as chrysochromulina sp decrease their chlorophyll a content and increase prey ingestion rates under low light utilizing mixotrophy as an alternative c source under light limitation jones et al 1995 similarly in northern temperate lakes experiencing browning doc concentrations between 8 12 mg l 1 result in shifts to mixotroph dominated phytoplankton communities hansson et al 2019 senar et al 2021 in tropical and temperate lakes the relative proportion of mixotrophic phytoplankton utilizing organic c for metabolism increases with light limitation and as such mixotrophic phytoplankton are abundant in dystrophic humic lakes pålsson and granéli 2004 other studies observed light stimulated doc uptake leucine by microcystis sp kamjunke and jähnichen 2000 and amino acid by marine picoplankton paerl 1991 which was attributed to the photoheterotrophic incorporation mechanism mixotrophy in cyanobacteria occurs through osmotrophy and has been documented across many genera gaudana et al 2013 modiri et al 2015 vonshak et al 2000 yu et al 2011 in culture spirulina platensis has higher photosynthetic and dark respiration rates grown under mixotrophic conditions than in photoautotrophic cultures vonshak et al 2000 cyanobacteria isolated from iranian lakes including synechococcus sp and pseudanabaena spp showed maximum biomass and lipid production with glucose additions to growth media utilizing mixotrophic metabolism modiri et al 2015 similarly the heterocystous cyanobacterium dolichospermum formerly anabaena pc 7120 increased its growth rates 1 6 times under mixotrophic conditions relative to photoautotrophic growth yu et al 2011 and cyanothece sp has increased growth rates in culture with the addition of simple organic c compounds gaudana et al 2013 while we acknowledge that heterocystous and non heterocystous cyanobacteria strains can utilize alternative c metabolism for continued growth on doc forms the role of mixotrophy in supporting blooms in lake ecosystems under inorganic c depletion and light limitation remains largely understudied 3 2 nitrogen it was previously thought that the don pool was unavailable for phytoplankton uptake but experimental work has confirmed that phytoplankton can utilize this dynamic n pool berman and bronk 2003 lewis et al 2011 seitzinger et al 2002 ammonium nh4 is typically the preferred source of inorganic n for most species of phytoplankton because ammonium uptake is energetically more advantageous but is often present in low concentrations relative to nitrate no3 dortch 1990 flores and herrero 2005 glibert et al 2016 harris et al 2016 muro pastor et al 2005 experimental evidence suggests that while nh4 may be the n form most readily taken up by phytoplankton don may be utilized before the no3 pool is utilized chaffin and bridgeman 2014 this may be due to fe limitation or co limitation with other macro or micro nutrients as fe is needed for no3 assimilation havens et al 2012 north et al 2007 the don pool can be accessed using phytoplankton enzymes as well as through osmotrophy using osmosis or pinocytosis cell drinking and the pon pool can be accessed through phagocytosis bronk et al 2007 lewis et al 2011 palenik et al 1989 phagotrophy is typically limited to cryptophytes and chrysophytes in freshwater systems granéli et al 1999 and can be an important source of nutrients when resources such as light and nutrients are limiting jansson et al 1996 roberts and laybourn parry 1999 but is less common than osmostrophy some species have cell surface enzymes allowing them to oxidize amino acids to nh4 before transportation into the cell lewis et al 2011 palenik et al 1989 another strategy employed by phytoplankton is targeted proteome adaptation and reorganization designed to scavenge organic nutrients increases in proteins needed for organic n and p uptake e g urea and amino acid transporters c n hydrolases and alkaline phosphatase have been observed in lab cultures of emiliania huxleyi mckew et al 2015 3 3 phosphorus it is widely accepted that phosphorus often limits or co limits the growth of phytoplankton in freshwater systems schindler 1977 the focus is typically on dissolved inorganic p dip however dop has also been shown to contribute to phytoplankton growth halemejko and chrost 1984 lin et al 2018 mackay et al 2020 phytoplankton can access pop through phagocytosis and dop using enzymes phagotrophy is limited to certain taxa and typically occurs when dissolved nutrients are highly limited or photosynthesis is light limited granéli et al 1999 jansson et al 1996 organic p is more commonly utilized in the dissolved form via osmotrophy many phytoplankton possess internal and external phosphatases enabling them to release orthophosphate po4 3 from organic p compounds jansson et al 1988 solovchenko et al 2020 whitney and lomas 2019 previously it was thought that bacteria found on or near phytoplankton cells were responsible for metabolizing organic p however observations of coherence between phytoplankton biomass and phosphatase activity coupled with low bacterial biomass has led researchers to conclude that some species of phytoplankton can produce phosphatase enzymes cembella et al 1982 jansson et al 1988 pettersson 1980 there are two primary types of phosphatases acid and alkaline acid phosphatases seem to primarily be used within the cell while alkaline phosphatases are found both internally and externally jansson et al 1988 alkaline phosphatase activity apa is energetically expensive to produce and has often been used as an indicator of p deficiency in phytoplankton communities prentice et al 2019 optimal ph conditions for phosphatase activity are variable among lakes olsson 1990 for example a lower ph optimum was observed in an oligotrophic lake ph 6 whereas a higher ph produced greater enzyme activity in eutrophic lakes ph 7 5 8 5 olsson 1990 further the ph for optimal enzyme activity can be different from ambient lake ph a study of florida usa lakes found a strong inverse relationship between acidity and p and acidity and chlorophyll a concentration havens 1999 a trend that was also observed in danish lakes vestergaard and sand jensen 2000 this indicates that some low nutrient systems may be more acidic and thus may be more likely to foster an environment for acid phosphatases in contrast apa and dissolved inorganic p concentrations are inversely related in meso eutrophic lakes gage and gorham 1985 indicating that alkaline phosphatases may be product inhibited while acid phosphatases can continuously synthesize phosphate regardless of ambient nutrient concentrations jansson et al 1988 but the effects of substrate type have not been fully explored therefore in low nutrient systems acid phosphatase activity may be continuous providing a nutrient source to phytoplankton regardless of dip concentrations these findings are particularly relevant for the management of phytoplankton blooms in acidic water bodies as nutrient reduction strategies may be complicated by these biochemical processes 3 4 microbial facilitation heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton are closely linked in aquatic ecosystems grossart 1999 rooney varga et al 2005 roth rosenberg et al 2020 as previously mentioned early paradigms suggested that organic nutrients were only accessible to phytoplankton through microbial facilitation recent studies have discovered that many species of phytoplankton can however take up organic nutrients directly e g zoccarato et al 2022 nevertheless interactions between heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton that facilitate phytoplankton nutrient uptake have been frequently observed and the underlying mechanisms have been comprehensively reviewed amin et al 2012 cole 1982 zoccarato and grossart 2019 there are three primary bacterial nutrient uptake and regeneration mechanisms in association with phytoplankton first cyanobacteria can stimulate heterotrophic bacteria frischkorn et al 2017 orchard et al 2010 or green algae bar yosef et al 2010 raven 2010 to produce phosphatases which transform organic p into inorganic p second heterotrophic bacteria utilize dom that is released when phytoplankton decompose which frees up c n and p for subsequent blooms azam et al 1983 grossart 1999 patriarca et al 2021 last is a mutualistic symbiotic relationship where the type of heterotrophic bacterial community composition microbiome surrounding the phytoplankton depends on the presence of specific traits for example cyanobacterial n2 fixation or not klawonn et al 2020 louati et al 2015 bloom size nutrient status jackrel et al 2019 or the excretion and exudation of organic matter by phytoplankton cells grossart 1999 the majority of bacteria phytoplankton interactions take place in the close vicinity of the phytoplankton s cell surface i e the phycosphere amin et al 2012 a zone which is characterized by steep chemical gradients such as ph redox and organic matter the increased availability of organic matter and nutrients in the phycosphere that phytoplankton exude and excrete buchan et al 2014 grossart 1999 seymour et al 2017 creates a habitat for microbes where the growth of heterotrophic bacteria is promoted thus a phytoplankton microbiome the symbiotic relationship between heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton has been clearly demonstrated using axenic phytoplankton cultures grossart et al 2006 2005 more recent studies using transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics have resolved specific heterotrophic bacteria phytoplankton interaction mechanisms in great detail landa et al 2017 roth rosenberg et al 2020 wang et al 2021 the biomass of microcystis and planktothrix blooms in harsha lake ohio usa showed a significant association with microbial genes related to organic substrate processing by heterotrophic bacteria wang et al 2021 a recent study showed that cyanobacteria prochlorococcus in oligotrophic waters cannot survive prolonged periods of nutrient starvation in axenic conditions and instead are reliant upon co occurring heterotrophic bacteria to survive extended phases of nutrient and light starvation roth rosenberg et al 2020 thus heterotrophic bacteria play a crucial role in increasing nutrient availability for phytoplankton under nutrient deficient conditions lidbury et al 2022 nutrient mineralization by heterotrophic bacteria however also takes place under nutrient rich conditions especially in organic matter polluted waters boosting toxic cyanobacterial blooms markou et al 2014 tao et al 2018 there is a trade off between bacteria and phytoplankton when competing for macronutrients phytoplankton growth which is often limited by n and or p paerl and barnard 2020 depends inversely on bacterial p utilization and growth bacteria are unlikely to be limited by p in situ godwin and cotner 2015 instead they are often limited by c supply currie and kalff 1984 thingstad et al 2008 heterotrophic bacteria growth and abundance are positively related to phytoplankton abundance and photosynthetic activity highlighting the critical role of bacteria phytoplankton interactions in the phycosphere organic matter mineralization by heterotrophic bacteria increases p availability in aquatic systems which potentially leads to increased phytoplankton growth grossart 1999 for microcystis there is a global microbiome that has multiple beneficial functions e g n sulfur and vitamin cycling hmw carbon degradation for the cyanobacterium cook et al 2019 hoke et al 2021 pal et al 2021 phytoplankton and their microbiome have complementary functional processes which enable a symbiotic relationship between the heterotrophic bacteria and phytoplankton 4 organic nutrient effects on phytoplankton community structure numerous studies have been conducted regarding how inorganic forms of nutrients shape phytoplankton communities but little attention has been given to their organic counterparts as discussed above there are many mechanisms by which phytoplankton can take up organic nutrients thus their effects on structuring phytoplankton communities in freshwater systems is an important component of phytoplankton ecology 4 1 carbon owing to the various mixotrophic capacities of different species of phytoplankton it is evident that doc availability and uptake play roles in determining phytoplankton community composition and succession cyanobacteria can dominate in oligotrophic systems low inorganic nutrients reinl et al 2021 which may be facilitated in part by facultative mixotrophy allowing them to compensate for c and energy requirements through the utilization of doc quesada et al 2002 zubkov et al 2003 found in oligotrophic oceanic waters prochlorococcus cyanobacteria can remain dominant through the utilization of doc demonstrating that ambient doc concentration can influence phytoplankton community composition a study of 45 different water bodies in new zealand showed that doc plays an important role in shaping phytoplankton and ciliate communities in a wide range of waterbody types galbraith and burns 2010 out of 39 genera that were identified in the study doc was associated with a greater abundance of gyrosigma nitzschia stauroneis and navicula and decreased abundance of cosmarium peridinium ankistrodesmus and coelastrum a mesocosm study demonstrated the positive effects of labile and non labile doc additions on phytoplankton community richness but only labile doc additions resulted in increased chlorophyll a and mixotrophic phytoplankton fonseca et al 2022 doc also affects the light environment which is another important driver of community structure jia et al 2020 4 2 nitrogen there is also variability in affinity for don among species which shapes phytoplankton community characteristics in a review by granéli et al 1999 the authors note that both marine and freshwater diatom and dinoflagellate species can utilize don however agriculturally sourced don is more likely to promote diatom growth while don from forested areas promotes dinoflagellates granéli and moreira 1990 bioassay experiments were used to evaluate the effects of inorganic and organic nutrients on phytoplankton community structure in the new river estuary north carolina usa altman and paerl 2012 additions of inorganic n yielded the highest primary productivity rate increase 50 followed by urea 38 and organic n filtrate from the river 25 biomass responded similarly however the urea and organic n filtrate treatments yielded higher biomass than the inorganic n treatment species specific responses evaluated using photopigments that were calibrated using pigments from pure cultures showed that organic n filtrate promoted dinoflagellates chlorophytes and cyanobacteria more than inorganic n additions in contrast diatoms responded similarly to all nutrient treatments a mesocosm study showed that urea additions caused a shift in n2 fixing cyanobacteria to non n2 fixing cyanobacteria and chlorophytes as well as an increase in chlorophyll a finlay et al 2010 the study also showed that urea additions stimulated microcystin production forms of organic and inorganic n can also have a differential effect on the growth of different cyanobacterial species which is an increasingly important ecological and public health issue a study which evaluated the response of cyanobacteria to inorganic and organic n sources found that growth rate stimulation varied between species chaffin and bridgeman 2014 microcystis had the strongest response to ammonium followed by urea and alanine organic forms and the weakest response to nitrate while planktothrix responded similarly to all n sources except for alanine which did not elicit any growth rate response belisle et al 2016 also observed a positive relationship between urea uptake and cyanobacterial biomass and erratt et al 2020 found that cyanobacteria have significantly faster n uptake rates compared to chlorophytes when urea is supplied in combination with inorganic n sources these responses to nutrient sources however are influenced by other factors such as temperature peng et al 2018 and the timing and duration of nitrogen inputs chaffin et al 2018 although some work has found that cyanobacteria readily assimilate organic n sources particularly urea other work has found that there are concentration thresholds for organic nutrients at which cyanobacteria exhibit a negative response for example bogard et al 2020 found that high concentrations 18 mg n l of urban and agriculturally sourced organic n resulted in a shift toward chlorophyte dominance and decreased microcystin production the authors however note that this result may be specific to hyper eutrophic shallow lakes with direct exposure to anthropogenically sourced n inputs erratt et al 2018 found that urea additions did not result in increased cyanobacterial biomass for 3 different species microcystis dolichospermum and synechococcus relative to nitrate but the urea substrate yielded cells with higher pigment concentrations increasing the photosynthetic capacity of the cyanobacteria under low light conditions as evidenced above and elsewhere glibert 2020 tao et al 2020 yan et al 2015 there is still uncertainty in how increasing organic n loads may affect phytoplankton community composition and n rich metabolite synthesis particularly cyanobacteria 4 3 phosphorus as is the case with organic n studies have found taxa specific differences in dop uptake affinity a study of phytoplankton nutrient uptake in a shallow bay showed greater correspondence between areas with high cyanobacterial biomass and high concentrations of dissolved organic p and n while diatoms and microflagellate algae were dominant in areas of high inorganic nutrient concentrations glibert et al 2004 a recent study evaluated the occurrence of apa during p depleted conditions and found that high activity was associated with high cyanobacterial biomass particularly bloom forming and toxin producing species prentice et al 2019 these results agree with the findings of peacock and kudela 2013 who observed a high rate of phytoplankton dop uptake under p replete conditions and that the highest apa was coincident with dominance of bloom forming cyanobacteria species other studies have also shown that the release of cylindrospermopsin by aphanizomenon sp a cyanobacterium which is not known to produce alkaline phosphatases itself can induce apa in other phytoplankton triggering the release of inorganic p for uptake by the cyanobacterium bar yosef et al 2010 raven 2010 a study employing the enzyme labeled fluorescence elf technique to identify changes in apa showed that the species that were expressing phosphatase activity changed over time among the bacillariophyceae chlorophyceae and dinophyceae phytoplankton groups nedoma et al 2003 rengefors et al 2001 willis et al 2019 have shown variability in apa among individual cells or genetic strains within a given species while these studies demonstrate the variable responses of phytoplankton communities to organic p there are relatively few studies that show how organic p availability shapes phytoplankton communities experimental work that targets these questions is needed as well as work that identifies physiological differences within and among taxa that drive temporal and spatial differences in phosphatase activity the rise in the use of fertilizers and pesticides table 1 containing organic p montiel león et al 2019 smedbol et al 2018 opens the door to questions regarding how anthropogenically derived organic p compounds will affect phytoplankton communities in freshwater systems for instance cyanobacteria can utilize glyphosate an organic compound commonly found in weed killers such as round up hove jensen et al 2014 glyphosate is a phosphonate that can be broken down by microbes but cyanobacteria species including dolichospermum sp formerly anabaena sp leptolyngbya boryana microcystis aeruginosa and nostoc punctiforme have been shown to utilize phosphonates as an organic p source hove jensen et al 2014 although saxton et al 2011 suggested that specific microbial communities are needed for phosphonate mineralization some cyanobacterial taxa possess phosphonate lyase genes that would allow for direct utilization dyhrman et al 2006 schoffelen et al 2018 su et al 2007 saxton et al 2011 evaluated the effects of glyphosate additions ranging from 0 0104 to 1 04 μg l on phytoplankton community abundance and structure and observed a significant increase in abundance of planktothrix with increasing concentration at the same time the abundance of microcystis decreased thereby demonstrating that there are differences among species in affinity for glyphosate utilization in freshwater streams phytoplankton community structure was variable in response to a glyphosate concentration gradient smedbol et al 2018 low glyphosate concentrations 5 10 ug l reduced diversity and at higher glyphosate concentrations 50 1000 ug l the community composition changed significantly and phytoplankton physiology was affected vera et al 2010 found that glyphosate additions led to a decline in diatoms and an increase in cyanobacterial biomass providing further evidence that dop inputs from fertilizer do not elicit an identical response among phytoplankton species strain specific differences in phosphonate lyase genes and localized environmental conditions likely underpin glyphosate degradation huntscha et al 2018 and possibly its effects on phytoplankton community structure in freshwater systems 4 4 hypothesized combined effects of organic c n and p on phytoplankton community structure most studies on phytoplankton and organic nutrients are focused on a single nutrient c n or p and do not consider the synergistic effects of different organic nutrients or indeed their interactions with other environmental conditions here we hypothesize how the phytoplankton community structure will change as dissolved organic c n or p increase individually and in combination fig 3 increases in doc have been shown to favor taxa that are capable of mixotrophy or low light which include taxa from cryptophytes cryptomonas sp chrysophytes dinobryon sp haptophytes chrysochromulina sp diatoms navicula sp and cyanobacteria dolichospermum sp kamjunke and jähnichen 2000 hansson et al 2019 yu et al 2011 senar et al 2021 increases in don have been shown to favor cyanobacteria microcystis sp chaffin and bridgeman 2014 and in some cases chlorophytes or dinoflagellates altman and paerl 2012 whereas increases in dop have been shown to favor summer blooming cyanobacteria taxa such as dolichospermum sp microcystis sp and planktothrix sp hove jensen et al 2014 peacock and kudela 2013 in a scenario where organic c n and p concurrently increase we hypothesize that cyanobacteria taxa are poised to dominate the phytoplankton community given they have been found to be favored by increases in each individual organic nutrient this statement aligns with previous research that has shown inorganic c n and p eutrophication of aquatic systems favors cyanobacteria over other eukaryotic competitors downing et al 2001 however differences in organic c n and p loading will likely change stoichiometric organic nutrient loading in turn influencing what phytoplankton groups individual taxonomic strains are favored even with the cyanobacterial phytoplankton group e g n2 fixing vs non n2 fixing cyanobacteria chaffin and bridgeman 2014 additionally other environmental factors discussed below will interact with organic nutrient loading to alter phytoplankton community structure 5 combined effects of organic nutrients and anthropogenic influences on phytoplankton communities there is a wide range of ecological impacts stemming from altered climate regimes and human activities on the landscape including increased temperature flooding droughts acidification forest fires deforestation altered hydrology connectivity and many others many of these changes will interact with the effects of organic nutrients on phytoplankton community structure as described above in this section we explore the combined effects of anthropogenically driven changes in environmental factors and organic nutrients on phytoplankton communities 5 1 temperature increasing water temperatures directly favor cyanobacteria and chlorophytes with cyanobacteria having a sharper growth rate curve at temperatures greater than 25⁰c lürling et al 2013 paerl and huisman 2008 additionally higher water temperature will increase mineralization rates and thus the sediment organic nutrient pool as temperature has a strong positive relationship with bacterial organic c gudasz et al 2010 n and p de neve et al 2003 mineralization rates the conversion from organic nutrients in the sediment to inorganic nutrients will also likely be accelerated higher air temperatures also accelerate processing of soil carbon on land which is among the factors thought to contribute to increased doc browning and eutrophication in many northern temperate lakes brothers et al 2013 winterdahl et al 2014 at the same time phytoplankton nutrient uptake rates are expected to increase with increasing temperatures aksnes and egge 1991 the combined effects of increased mineralization and uptake rates could thus fuel rapid phytoplankton bloom development further in lakes experiencing browning the combined effects of warming temperatures may increase cyanobacterial abundance due to their ability to grow rapidly under low light and high temperature conditions rising temperatures will also lead to a higher frequency and intensity of lake heatwaves defined as a period of extremely warm surface water temperature woolway et al 2021 which have been shown to favor cyanobacteria over other phytoplankton jöhnk et al 2008 a mesocosm experiment implemented in a hypertrophic urban canal zhan et al 2022 suggests that heatwaves through its accelerating impacts on biogeochemical processes may lock p pools in organic forms and consequently hamper p reduction efficacy by chemical adsorbents targeting only inorganic p forms 5 2 precipitation climate driven increases in precipitation and the frequency of high intensity storm events may increase nutrient inputs carpenter et al 2018 but these changes may not be the same for organic and inorganic constituents for example sadro and melack 2012 found that an extreme rain event resulted in no increase in dip loading to an oligotrophic lake but dop increased by half and don increased by more than double this increase in don and dop was not associated with an increase in chlorophyll a but the post flood samples were collected 10 days after the event which may not have been sufficient time to detect any biological response dual increases in don and dop are likely to favor increases in cyanobacteria but may also increase the abundance of chlorophytes or dinoflagellates altman and paerl 2012 depending on the baseline composition of the phytoplankton community in agricultural areas with tile drainage or drainage ditches extreme precipitation events may lead to mobilization of labile doc and don dalzell et al 2007 kaushal et al 2014 bhattacharya and osburn 2020 whereas in wetland and forest dominant watersheds studies have shown that increased precipitation may lead to transport of 70 80 of the annual dom load to the downstream receiving waterbody raymond and saiers 2010 bhattacharya and osburn 2021 in urbanized areas increased precipitation leads to sewage overflows to surrounding areas increasing the loading of doc relative to don and dop teurlincx et al 2019 increased coverage of impervious substrate through urbanization in conjunction with more extreme storm events may also lead to increased organic nutrient loading hosen et al 2014 bhattacharya and osburn 2020 high doc loading associated with storm events will lead to intermittent or sustained periods of low light depending on the waterbody thus taxa that can tolerate low light conditions will be favored see section 4 4 nutrient loading during a discharge event is also strongly linked to antecedent conditions musolff et al 2021 showed that a higher doc and nh4 loading was linked to low antecedent discharge 30 days before the discharge event and higher water temperatures this was also supported by the results of loecke et al 2017 where droughts followed by high intensity rain events resulted in substantially increased nutrient loading compared to when there were no antecedent droughts other studies have reported altered quantity and quality of doc inputs from the landscape to receiving water bodies resulting from droughts as well as forest fires and acidification donahue et al 1998 schindler et al 1997 despite the numerous reports on the substantial organic nutrient inputs associated with precipitation events their permanent effects on phytoplankton community structure remains largely unexplored these hydrologic changes not only affect nutrients in the water column but also the sediments organic material that is not taken up from the water column is ultimately deposited in the sediments and is used later or remineralized into inorganic forms a process that may be exacerbated during droughts nürnberg 2009 this organic nutrient stock can contribute significantly to internal loading even in oligotrophic systems where inorganic p exists mostly as fractions sorbed or complexed with compounds having low bioavailability e g fe or aluminum hydroxides whereas organic p is more bioavailable ni et al 2019a a study evaluating the role of sediment organic p in six lakes across a trophic gradient found that sediment organic p was more strongly related to lake trophic state than water column tp ni et al 2019b given that increases in dop have been related to cyanobacterial dominance hove jensen et al 2014 cyanobacteria may be favored over other phytoplankton taxa during dop rich loading events from intensive rain or internal loading sources see section 4 4 above 5 3 land use changes future changes in land use kayler et al 2019 will likely affect the composition of the dom relative contribution of organic c n and p fractions and its metabolism in freshwater systems yates et al 2019a 2019b and others bhattacharya and osburn 2020 heinz et al 2015 have shown that the composition of dom especially the c n and doc don ratios as well as the doc dop ratio were largely influenced by dominant land cover in the catchment and thus land use changes may have significant implications for the stoichiometry of receiving waters nutrient enrichment due to anthropogenic inputs of inorganic n and a greater proportion of agricultural land in the catchment resulted in a dom composition with a lower doc don ratio and subsequently enriched in n mattsson et al 2009 wymore et al 2021 similar relationships have been found for dop brailsford et al 2021 carver et al 2022 however a combination of organic c n and p loading likely causes undesirable cyanobacterial dominance of the phytoplankton community see section 4 4 above 5 4 other factors although most studies focus on the anthropogenic effects as outlined in the sections above there are many other factors that may interact with organic nutrients to influence the structure of phytoplankton communities for example light conductivity and ph and their interaction with nutrients can also play a key role in determining the distribution of phytoplankton species in freshwater systems jia et al 2020 jia et al 2020 sampled 15 locations in the poyang lake basin and 15 sites in upstream watersheds to develop models to identify environmental factors affecting phytoplankton communities their analysis showed that light ph and nutrient ratios are better predictors of phytoplankton community structure than nutrients alone and that light in particular was a key driver in this turbid system the community was dominated by the chlorophyta phylum 48 12 followed by bacillariophyta 24 06 and cyanophyta 15 04 but species richness was highest for cyanophyta however this study only considered doc and inorganic forms of n and p therefore the effects of organic n and p in combination with light may be different dissolved oxygen concentrations are expected to decrease as lake temperatures increase due to longer and more stable periods of stratification woolway and merchant 2019 and reduced capacity to hold oxygen at higher temperatures decreasing dissolved oxygen concentrations near the sediment water interface will likely lead to longer periods of anoxia which in turn causes inorganic phosphorus and nitrogen release from the sediments i e internal nutrient loading however organic nutrient release from the sediments does not seem to be confined to periods of anoxia laboratory experiments showed that changes in nutrient and dissolved oxygen concentration have little effect on organic phosphorus release from estuary sediments kang et al 2018 however another recent experimental study from humic lakes in finland revealed that humic dom may form complexes with fe bound p and in turn limit the sedimentary p release rates tammeorg et al 2022 thus diminished internal loading in lakes undergoing browning may have additional implications for phytoplankton communities and lake productivity in general another study of sediments from lake taihu china showed that organic p in the sediments were not important contributors of sediment p to the water column bai et al 2009 however another experimental study found that organic p transformation was increased in anaerobic dissolved oxygen conditions at high temperatures 20 c meaning that under future conditions with warmer water temperatures and lower dissolved oxygen concentrations we may observe a greater proportion of organic p release from sediments bai et al 2009 which in turn may increase dop loading and thus favor cyanobacteria dominance of the phytoplankton community acidification and recovery are other important processes that affect phytoplankton community structure both through direct and indirect effects on organic nutrients boström 1984 found that organic p in the sediments were depleted at higher ph values ph 8 9 but not as high as fe and al bound p ph 9 10 doc reactivity is also affected by ph anesio and granéli 2003 conducted experiments showing that acidification resulted in increased photochemical mineralization of doc and a subsequent decrease in doc concentrations this has important implications for phytoplankton communities both through the availability of c sources and alterations in the light environment schindler et al 1996 for example a decrease in doc may increase light availability resulting a in a more diverse phytoplankton community rather than one dominated by taxa with a tolerance for low light conditions these effects combined with the factors outlined above and others resulti in complex chemical biological and physical interactions that structure phytoplankton communities 6 challenges perspectives and future directions our understanding of the effects of organic nutrients on phytoplankton communities is still lacking despite the substantial naturally and anthropogenically derived pools of organic nutrients delivered to freshwater systems the few studies that have been conducted demonstrate a wide range in phytoplankton responses to organic nutrients and highlight a need for continued research on how organic nutrients shape phytoplankton communities in this section we discuss current knowledge gaps management challenges and offer recommendations for future research regarding organic nutrients in freshwater systems there are many methodological and experimental knowledge gaps in organic nutrient research fig 4 although several tools and approaches have been developed for characterizing doc species in freshwater ecosystems reviewed in mccallister et al 2018 cost effective tools and approaches for evaluating don and dop species are relatively lacking compared to doc karl and björkman 2015 zheng et al 2021 this lack of analytical tools and approaches prevents a full account of when and where specific organic nutrients are present in concentrations that may impact phytoplankton community composition and abundance fig 4 c and d further the physiological response of phytoplankton to organic nutrients is a major knowledge gap with a better understanding needed for both the scientific community and natural resource managers physiological knowledge gaps include information on which specific mechanism s phytoplankton species use to assimilate organic nutrients and to what extent this is context dependent especially for anthropogenically derived organic compounds fig 4e additionally the role of mixotrophy in supporting blooms in lake ecosystems under inorganic c depletion and light limitation remains understudied and prevents a complete understanding of when and where organic c metabolism strategies are used by phytoplankton fig 4f experimental work that targets these questions specifically is needed as well as work that identifies physiological differences within and among taxa that drive temporal and spatial differences in phosphatase activity fig 4g further insights on microbial mechanisms used to mineralize organic c n and p from sediments are lacking in particular under oxic conditions fig 4h orihel et al 2017 changes in abiotic factors due to climate change and other anthropogenic pressures will also affect organic nutrient composition and stoichiometry increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns resulting from climate change will likely influence biochemical and physical processes in lakes and thus organic nutrient cycling and subsequent effects on phytoplankton fig 4a woolway et al 2020 changes in land use will also affect the delivery of organic nutrients to freshwater systems fig 4b there has been a shift from inorganic to organic forms of n based fertilizers with urea usage on the rise globally glibert 2017 urea fertilizers account for more than 50 of the n based fertilizers used globally and is the preferred agricultural fertilizer due to its increased water solubility leading to greater distribution in the soil glibert et al 2006 low cost and minimal damage to crops belisle et al 2016 between 1989 and 2015 usa consumption of urea based fertilizers increased 108 compared to all n based fertilizers which increased by only 47 addressing the separate and concomitant effects of climate change and land use change on phytoplankton communities and organic nutrients is another important avenue for future research organic nutrients present significant challenges for natural resource management management strategies to combat eutrophication typically focus on p control strategies however n also plays an important role in eutrophication lewis et al 2011 furthermore research on n inputs has targeted inorganic forms despite rising inputs of organic n from various sources fig 2 glibert et al 2006 leaving our knowledge of how organic forms shape phytoplankton communities and what that means for ecosystem health and management of freshwater resources lacking yates et al 2019b studied effluent from four different types of wastewater treatment plants in the uk and found that don and dop contributed to 3 10 and 6 14 of total n and p concentrations respectively the majority of these don and dop compounds in wastewater have yet to be characterized zheng et al 2021 and some components of don and dop in wastewater effluent have been found to be highly bioavailable qin et al 2015 qin et al 2015 estimated the bioavailability of these don and dop fractions to range between 27 9 60 5 and 73 7 75 4 respectively further wastewater monitoring is typically focused on the monitoring and removal of inorganic forms which not only creates the potential to miss the amount and forms of organic nutrients entering freshwater systems but may also alter the ratio of inorganic to organic nutrients in receiving waterbodies additionally organic nutrients within wild and domestic animal fecal matter are also understudied compared to inorganic forms for example waterfowl can be a substantial source of terrestrial nutrient transport to aquatic systems hahn et al 2008 maliaka et al 2020 lastly the majority of the most used herbicides and pesticides in the usa contain organic n and p and or other macronutrients such as sulfur table 1 future research should consider how individual e g n containing atrazine or multiple macronutrients e g n and p containing glyphosate contained in organic pollutants affect phytoplankton biomass and community structure 7 conclusions an increasing amount of diverse organic nutrients are being discharged into surface waters globally fig 1 the characterization and bioavailability of these organic nutrients to phytoplankton growth are relatively understudied compared to inorganic nutrient forms here we explored forms of organic nutrients entering these systems and potential implications for phytoplankton community restructuring further we identified several knowledge gaps and highlighted management issues arising from the delivery of organic nutrients to freshwater systems fig 4 and hypothesized how increases in organic nutrient loading may change phytoplankton community structure fig 3 this work provides a foundation for future research efforts regarding organic nutrients and their role in the eutrophication of freshwater
