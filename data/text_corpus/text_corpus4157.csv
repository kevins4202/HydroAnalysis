20785,hydrodynamic analysis of high speed craft is a complex problem naval architects have been improving the efficiency of high speed hulls by introducing hard chines warping adding spray rails and steps or forcing air ventilation spray deflectors is a novel spray redirection technology inspired by spray rails it has shown potential for further improving the performance of high speed craft spray deflectors run parallel to the stagnation line from the keel to the chine through the spray area previous numerical and experimental studies focusing on spray deflectors have been unable to draw definite conclusions regarding the efficiency and optimal design of the deflectors this paper aims to experimentally investigate through towing tank testing the effect on the total resistance using spray deflectors to redirect the spray three spray deflectors were designed for different design speeds tested and compared in terms of the resulting bare hull for resistance trim and heave response the new deflector designs did not affect the running position of the hull allowing for an unequivocal resistance comparison deflectors reduced resistance by up to 5 with the highest reduction achieved

diverse range of applications from search rescue and pleasure boating to law enforcement and racing as such academic research into the performance and flow phenomena of hsc began to increase greatly in the 1960 s when many of the empirical formulas still in use today were contrived recent years have seen a further growth in research as seen in fig 1 this is likely due to increased access to high speed computers and more towing tanks being operable at planing speeds despite this recent rise in research findings many phenomena associated with planing craft are still not fully understood planing is a state where the vessel rides on the surface of the water and relies on pressure forces to maintain lift rather than the buoyancy forces used by displacement hulls savitsky 1964 this lift reduces the displacement of the vessel allowing the vessel to move much faster than a displacement vessel using the same propelling force for prismatic hull forms hulls that have a constant cross section along their length the forces and operating characteristics can accurately be determined using the semi empirical savitsky method the savitsky method savitsky 1964 uses the shape of the hull and the speed to determine the moment acting around the center of gravity this allows for the determination of trim and drag more recently the method has been further refined with the inclusion of whisker spray savitsky et al 2007 whisker spray develops along the hull as the craft moves through the water and can account for 15 to 20 of total high speed craft resistance savitsky et al 2007 larsson and raven 2010 the stagnation line is located directly aft of the spray area is the forward boundary of the wetted surface area and is the location with the highest amount of water pressure acting on the hull in fig 2 the spray area wetted area and stagnation line are shown also noted are the keel and chine lengths showing the boundaries of the stagnation line at the keel and the chine accurate determination of the location of the stagnation spray root line is important for the determination of the wetted area since to numerically determine the calm water resistance the pressure over the wetted area is integrated to correctly understand the steady state loads the spray root must be determined correctly fu et al 2014 furthermore as accelerations are higher at the stagnation line a correct determination of the location is of importance for seakeeping analysis kim et al 2008 predicting the start and extent of the spray area is currently difficult to do numerically fu et al 2014 mousaviraad et al 2015 even savitsky et al 2007 wrongly predicts the location of the stagnation line placing it too far aft molchanov 2018 a common technique to reduce resistance is to detach water flow reducing either the spray or the wetted area the wetted area and the associated resistance can be decreased by using transverse steps taunton et al 2010 a step works by separating the pressure area onto different sections of the hull at varying depths each step forces air into the cavity and reduces total resistance by having a lower frictional resistance as the aerated pressure area supports the hull de marco et al 2017 the spray area can also be reduced by placing spray rails along the stagnation line parallel to the keel and chines spray rails have been investigated by clement 1964 who showed that spray rails are most effective on lower less than 20 degrees deadrise hulls more recently seo et al 2016 conducted seakeeping performance tests on spray rails and further refined their design noting an improved seakeeping performance with spray rails and a lower trim while not having a significant change in resistance clement 1964 also concluded that if any portion of the strips were extending behind the stagnation line they would contribute to an increase in resistance due to the addition of an appendage below the water marcos 2013 seo et al 2016 and lakatos et al 2019 have all shown a similar trend of increasing resistance at low speeds where a greater portion of the spray rails were submerged a newer technique is the spray deflector a spray deflector uses the pressure accumulated along the stagnation line to force spray downward and aftward rather than out to the side as in the case of spray rails redirecting the spray downward and aftward is much more advantageous as it should provide additional lift and forward thrust reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models have indicated a possible resistance reduction of 30 with spray deflectors and towing tank testing has shown a 15 20 reduction of the calm water resistance olin et al 2016 molchanov et al 2019 this paper aims to develop a better understanding of how spray deflectors near the stagnation line may function to decrease calm water resistance the performance of a hull appended with spray deflectors is compared with that of an unappended hull and analyzed across a range of speeds to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the angle of spray relative to the spray deflector impacts the drag reduction 2 experimental setup to investigate the effect of redirecting spray a purpose built model hull was designed molchanov et al 2019 it should be noted that the used model has a high length to beam ratio to facilitate a higher total resistance spray resistance accounts for 15 to 20 savitsky et al 2007 larsson and raven 2010 and if the total resistance is higher reductions in the spray resistance are easier to measure wielgosz et al 2018 the model s prismatic geometry allows for direct comparison with savitsky s semi empirical method savitsky 1964 table 1 shows the main particulars of the model molchanov et al 2019 the towing tank testing was conducted in the davidson laboratory towing tank at stevens institute of technology the towing tank is purpose built to facilitate high speeds the maximum testing speed is 30 48 m s though due to safety reasons speed rarely exceeds 11 m s the tank is 95 40 m long 5 m wide and 2 29 m deep at the time of testing the actual water depth was around 2 m the facility is also equipped with an overwater and underwater camera international towing tank conference ittc recommended guidelines and procedures for high speed marine vehicle resistance tests ittc 2017 were used to guide testing and analysis moreover the use of the savitsky method was developed at the same facility with similar water depth finite water depth can have a significant influence on calm water hull resistance for a wide range of operating speeds radojčić and bowles 2010 relate the running speeds to the water depth by using the depth froude number f n h v g h while depth effects are not negligible faltinsen 2005 they are not considered in this experiment since shallow water effects occur when the vessels runs at critical and super critical speeds in water depths less than 0 80 of l o a blount and hankley 1976 and for this research the ratio between the towing tank water depth and the model overall length h l o a is 1 11 this is further emphasized by the ittc which does not recommend considering depth effects ittc 2017 and the work by prini et al 2021 who determined comparisons at the same speeds and depth are not dependent on depth effects 2 1 deflector design three different deflector configurations were designed in order to investigate performance at low medium and high speeds the design was based on previous work by wielgosz 2018 who used hull integrated deflectors wielgosz et al 2018 where deflectors were designed as strips and molchanov et al 2019 where deflectors were designed as plates mounted on the bottom of the hull initially in this project deflectors were designed as strips with a constant thickness along their length these proved to be inefficient as the deflectors got submerged at the keel when run in the towing tank thus all deflectors were tapered in two directions first tapering was done along the length of the deflectors to ensure minimum thickness at the keel in order to avoid potential submergence of the deflectors at that position thus the deflectors were tapered from 0 25 cm at the keel to 1 3 cm at the chine with a constant tapering angle second tapering was made with respect to the leading and trailing edges of the deflectors when they are mounted on the bottom of the hull see fig 3 the reason for tapering in this direction is to ensure steady flow from the smooth surface of the bottom of the hull to the deflectors the trailing edge of the deflectors had a thickness of 1 3 cm while the leading edge was 0 25 cm thick ideally the tapering would have been done from 0 cm to 1 3 cm but this was impossible to achieve from a manufacturing perspective instead this transition from the bottom of the hull to the deflectors was further helped by the insertion of red clay fig 3 into the gap produced by the 0 25 cm deflectors thickness at its leading edge the low speed deflector with a design speed of f n 3 65 can be seen mounted onto the hull in fig 3 the deflectors were manufactured from pvc plates and taped onto the hull to make it easy to shift the deflectors longitudinally the edges were secured with clay to ensure no water would pass between the hull and the deflectors the location of the stagnation line was determined using underwater photos of the bare hull tests since the savitsky method does not accurately predict the trim and thus the location of the stagnation line molchanov 2018 l k l c and α which determine the position of the stagnation line are shown in table 2 for the three design speeds see fig 4 for design purposes l k and l c have been approximated to the nearest 1 3 cm half inch each deflector was designed to be parallel to the design speed stagnation line and offset by 5 cm in the forward direction measured at the keel chine this resulted in a parallel normal distance of 1 55 2 16 cm depending on α see fig 2 forward of the stagnation line however the location of the deflector was changed throughout the testing campaign when it was discovered that the deflector touched the water surface 2 2 design speed the general length froude number is of little use when evaluating the performance of hsc since the waterline length can significantly change due to frequent changes in trim therefore a volumetric froude number f n as seen in eq 1 is preferred savitsky and morabito 2010 larsson and raven 2010 taunton et al 2010 garland 2011 morabito and pavkov 2014 avci and barlas 2016 lakatos et al 2019 1 f n v g 1 3 the minimum speed required for full planing mode occurs when the speed to length ratio slr is greater than 3 savitsky 1985 this corresponds to f n 2 1 for the current model as this model is towards the larger end of models suitable for the davidson laboratory towing tank a maximum speed of f n 6 37 was selected the higher the percentage of spray resistance the easier it is to record a resistance difference when the total resistance is measured and spray resistance increases with speed molchanov 2018 therefore a possible reduction of the spray resistance will be more significant and detectable at higher speeds however a range of speeds was evaluated to better determine the performance of the deflectors across the speed range three different deflectors were made with one having a design speed corresponding to the highest attainable speed for the model this is referred to as high speed two other deflectors configurations were designed for low and medium speeds while ensuring that the lowest design speed was still well above the planing limit the testing speed range is shown in fig 4 it can be noted that the selected speeds are increased with a constant step except for the low speed deflector where the adjacent speeds are somewhat closer to the design speed only one deflector configuration is mounted at a time in fig 4 design speeds are marked in bold among their respective ranges of speeds for the three deflector pairs tests were performed using an ascending descending and finally a second ascending speed matrix to ensure repeatability the averages for these three repetitions are shown throughout the paper and an error analysis can be found in appendix a the model was fitted with an inclinometer which measures trim a drag balance which measures resistance and a potentiometer mounted on the heave post to measure heave during experiments the carriage towed the model in the surge direction while the model was free to heave and pitch the model was locked in roll yaw and sway the measurement instruments are further explained in appendix b 3 results 3 1 bare hull results the results from the bare hull have been compared with the savitsky semi empirical method savitsky 1964 one of the leading methods for practical determination of the performance of hsc even though the method was first presented over 50 years ago it is still widely used in the industry the method provides good accuracy overall however the method slightly underestimates the resistance at all speeds and overestimates the trim at lower speeds as shown in fig 5 the underestimation of the resistance is consistent with the findings of molchanov et al 2019 using the same parent hull however their model was equipped with pvc plates resulting in a different running position likely due to lower friction and a sharper transom furthermore the experimental results have been compared and show good agreement with the experimental results by fridsma 1969 which used a model with similar parameters and loading conditions the same length beam ratio l b 5 deadrise β 2 0 and l c g 30 from the stern though the comparison of the total resistance shows similar magnitudes it has not been included in fig 5 since data was hard to extract with adequate precision from the figure by fridsma 1969 the stagnation line angle α between the stagnation line and the keel was obtained by determining the length at the keel l k and the length at the chine l c from underwater photos as expected α is inversely proportional to the running speed because it is linked to the trim angle as the speed increases the consequent increase in lift forces a greater part of the model out of the water thus to gain a new equilibrium position the trim decreases and the stagnation line approaches the keel α and l c decrease a graphical representation of the stagnation line along the bottom of the model for all tested speeds is shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the reduction in α as the running speed increases a comparison between the experimentally obtained stagnation line and the theoretical line calculated using the method by savitsky 1964 is shown in fig 7 a 7 b and 7 c the method by savitsky 1964 accurately predicts the location of the stagnation line on the chine but over predicts the distance along the keel leading to an under prediction of α a vertical center of gravity vcg of 15 24 cm was assumed for the theoretical prediction however this assumption had little effect on the location of the stagnation line and can therefore not be the reason for the over prediction 3 2 spray deflector results to test the efficiency of the deflectors a direct comparison between the bare hull resistance and the resistance of the model equipped with the deflectors was performed at the same running conditions for the three deflector configurations low medium and high speed fig 8 shows the percentage resistance reduction for the hull mounted with the low speed deflectors with a design speed of f n 3 65 compared to the bare hull the deflectors were placed 5 0 cm forward of the stagnation line measured along the keel or chine this resulted in a parallel normal distance of 2 1 cm between the deflectors and the stagnation line fig 8 shows a total resistance reduction of about 2 0 at the design speed of f n 3 65 with the highest reduction of 5 0 at f n 3 20 experiments at moderate speeds were carried out with deflectors designed for f n 4 56 at first the deflectors were placed 5 0 cm forward of the stagnation line measured at the chine or at the keel to match the placement used for the low speed configuration however this led to a lower parallel normal distance of 1 7 cm since the medium speed deflector is designed for a smaller angle α and a lower trim these tests showed worse overall performances than the previous set of deflectors with a resistance reduction of approximately 1 0 at the design speed and slight resistance increases at higher speeds see red curve marked with diamonds in fig 9 after investigating the underwater photos and videos and recreating the running condition in a 3d modeling software it became clear that the deflectors were slightly touching the water at the keel and in doing so increasing the resistance considerably thus they were moved further forward initially 6 4 cm and then 10 2 cm from the stagnation line at the chine or keel resulting in a parallel normal distance of 2 2 cm and 3 5 cm respectively from the stagnation line fig 9 shows the total resistance reduction for the middle speed configuration the 3 5 cm position enhanced the performance at every speed with a peak resistance reduction of about 4 3 at f n 3 65 experiments at higher speeds were carried out with deflectors designed for a speed of f n 5 48 initial experiments were performed with the deflectors placed 5 0 cm forward of the stagnation line measured at keel or chine to emulate the placement of the slow configuration this resulted in a parallel normal distance of 1 5 cm significantly lower than the normal parallel distance of 2 2 cm for the lowest design speed and slightly lower than 1 7 cm observed at the middle design speed the higher the running speed the lower the trim which directly impacts α and consequently lower parallel normal distance the latter is an index of the deflector s proximity to the stagnation line the placement is efficient at the design speed when the deflector is close enough to ensure spray detachment but far enough to avoid the water surface in order to ensure the parallel normal distances of 2 2 cm obtained at lower speed for higher design speeds it was necessary to provide greater distances between the stagnation line and the deflector measured along the keel or along the chine the l c distance was increased to 7 6 cm from the stagnation line which resulted in a parallel normal distance of 2 3 cm fig 10 shows the total resistance reduction for both these deflector locations at high speeds at design speed the reduction is about 1 5 at speeds lower than the design speed there is a dramatic improvement of efficiency up to 4 5 at f n 4 56 for the higher parallel normal distance black line the lower parallel normal distance caused an increase in resistance of 0 61 at the design speed of f n 5 48 one of the most important parameters in terms of the running position of the vessel is the trim the trim is produced by the combination of the moments from propulsion water pressure resistance and lift savitsky 1964 the trim is essential as it not only directly affects the total resistance it also defines the location of the stagnation line on the hull savitsky 1964 previous experiments investigating the effect of spray deflectors showed that the deflectors changed the running trim causing the overall resistance reduction to be due in part to the change in running position molchanov et al 2019 therefore a key objective of this investigation was to design spray deflectors that did not affect the running position so that the effect of only spray deflection could be assessed fig 11 shows a consistent trim between the bare hull and the deflector configurations this is likely due to the slimmer design of the present deflectors as a larger change in hull geometry would be expected to have larger effect on the running position especially when the deflectors extend into the wetted area heave comparison between bare hull and deflector hull configurations is shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the heave is unaffected by the deflectors at medium speeds but increases consistently at lower and higher speeds a rise in heave indicates that there might be an increase in total lift caused by the spray deflection it was expected that deflectors would increase lift as spray rails lakatos et al 2019 and spray deflectors molchanov et al 2019 have been found to increase the heave lakatos et al 2019 concluded that the experienced increase in lift occurred due to the sharp bottom edges of the spray rails 3 3 discussion to link the resistance reduction to the flow features experienced by the hull an analysis of underwater photographs was performed photos from all runs were investigated to compare the spray generated by the bare hull and the spray redirected by the deflectors at the same running speed the behavior was consistent across the three deflector configurations low medium and high speed with four different phenomena being identified 3 3 1 deflectors at the design speed the deflectors were designed to be parallel to the stagnation line at their respective design speed fig 13 shows how the deflectors follow the stagnation line from the keel to the chine as can be seen from the underwater photograph the stagnation line remains relatively parallel to the deflectors the area between the stagnation line and the deflectors is the spray area it is the resistance contribution from this area that the deflectors aim to minimize the parallel condition redirects a reasonable amount of spray which effectively reduces resistance overall the deflectors performed well showing 2 in total resistance reduction at their design speed 3 3 2 deflectors at a higher than design speed when the model was tested at speeds higher than the design speed a gradual deterioration of the efficiency was observed as the speed increases the stagnation line tends to move away from the deflectors at the chine and α decreases as seen in fig 14 as the speed increases α decreases the distance at the keel l k is constant while the distance at the chine l c decreases significantly see fig 6 this causes an increase in the total spray area between the stagnation line and the deflectors causing an increase in resistance compared to the hull at design speed 3 3 3 deflectors at slightly lower than design speed when the running speed of the model is lower than the design speed of the deflectors the angle α increases and the distance at the chine l c decreases accordingly as seen in fig 15 hence the overall spray area decreases and the deflectors performance improves accordingly as the model speed decreases the trim and angle α increases the stagnation line gets closer to the deflectors at the chine leading to a shorter parallel normal distance and a higher possibility that the rear parts of the deflectors touch the water surface and increase the total resistance the minimum parallel normal distance from the stagnation line is therefore a key factor for deflection performance the low and high speed deflectors both experience a slight drop in resistance reduction before increasing again as shown in figs 8 and 10 the reason for the similarities between the low and high speed deflectors likely comes from the fact that the low and high speed configurations have similar normal distances between the stagnation line and the deflectors 2 1 and 2 3 cm respectively whereas the middle speed deflectors were placed at 3 5 cm further from the stagnation line the middle speed deflectors were evaluated at a parallel normal distance of 2 2 cm as well however not at sufficiently low speeds to evaluate if this trend holds true for the middle speed deflectors as well see fig 9 3 3 4 deflectors at the lowest operating speed by studying the deflectors at speeds under the design speeds a resistance reduction of up to 5 was observed the deflectors performed best under this condition fig 16 shows the stagnation line crossing the deflectors at the middle which leads to a ventilation phenomenon in the wetted area close to the chine air bubbles originating from the intersection of the stagnation line and deflectors can be observed the air trapped between the deflectors and the water surface decreases the submerged wetted area moreover due to the stagnation line inclination the amount of spray area remaining between the deflectors and the stagnation line sees a very dramatic decrease the reduction of the total resistance is substantial when the positive effects of the trapped air and decreased spray area outweigh the increased resistance due to the submerged part of the deflectors fig 9 shows how the positive effects gradually become more significant at lower f n as the speed decreases the trim and α increase and the crossing point between the stagnation line and the deflectors shifts from the chine towards the keel the highest resistance reduction for the medium speed deflector configuration of 4 3 is reached at f n 3 65 when the stagnation line crosses the deflector half way between the keel and the chine below this speed the crossing point is too close to the keel causing less air to be trapped and the positive effects of ventilation to fade away moreover a significant part of the stagnation line is behind the deflector and only a small portion of the spray is detached at the lowest speed of f n 3 20 only the negative effects of the submerged deflectors remain and deflectors increased the resistance with 0 2 the peak in resistance reduction is also eminent at f n 3 20 for the low speed deflector fig 8 however for this configuration an increase in heave is also seen fig 12 an increase in heave means a reduction of the wetted area and thus a reduction in the resistance this is likely partially linked to very high resistance reduction at this speed clement 1964 marcos 2013 and lakatos et al 2019 suggest that for spray rails if part of the rail is behind the stagnation line the resistance should increase due to added appendages in the wetted area however it is possible that the submerged part of the deflector is small enough that the benefits from a reduction in spray area combined with the ventilation phenomena outweigh the increased resistance 4 conclusion the effects of the spray deflection the resulting reduction of the spray and in some cases the wetted hull area were studied across a wide range of planing speeds from f n 2 97 to f n 5 93 more than 300 runs were performed in the davidson laboratory towing tank to assess the total resistance the four prismatic hull configurations three deflector configurations and one bare hull were studied separately and then compared at the same running speeds the retrofitted deflectors were angled from the keel to the chine and from the bow to the stern see fig 3 in this study the application of three different sets of deflectors has resulted in reductions between 1 5 and 2 5 at their design speeds with peaks of about 5 at certain running conditions the distance between the deflectors and the stagnation line is a key factor in the efficiency of the spray deflection increasing this distance proved beneficial it has thus been concluded that increasing the normal distance even further could be a gainful effort however pushing the deflectors too far away from the stagnation line could also lower the magnitude of spray deflection as less spray is being captured by the deflectors the best performance was obtained when testing was conducted below the design speed of the deflectors at these speeds underwater photos showed an air ventilation phenomena originating from the point of intersection between the stagnation line and the deflectors the presence of air cavities is known to reduce the frictional resistance by decreasing the wetted surface area latorre 1997 ceccio 2010 matveev and miller 2011 the higher resistance reduction at these speeds is likely due to a combination of detaching the spray as well as creating air cavities in the wetted area close to the chine and stagnation line furthermore the experimental results for the bare hull configuration were compared with the semi empirical savitsky method savitsky 1964 savitsky and brown 1976 fig 5 highlights how the savitsky method under predicted the total resistance up to 8 0 at the highest speed and over predicted the trim up to 5 6 at the lowest speed but overall the savitsky mean error agrees with prior research conducted by bertorello and oliviero 2007 khazaee et al 2019 such error would be expected to increase when moving from prismatic to realistic hullforms 5 future work more experimentation and testing is required to further improve the general knowledge of spray deflection technologies and to assess the full potential of spray deflectors in the present investigation the highest resistance reduction occurred when the stagnation line intersected the strip approximately at its midpoint fig 16 additional experimentation is needed to understand the magnitude of the ventilation phenomena and more work has to be performed to establish the most efficient intersection point on the deflectors this investigation can be coupled with free running experimental tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd investigations to provide a broader understanding of the performance of spray deflectors furthermore as performance in waves is of the utmost importance to hsc the effect of deflectors on accelerations in waves should also be studied this paper did not consider depth effects in line with blount and hankley 1976 radojčić and bowles 2010 morabito 2013 dand 2002 yang et al 2001 toro 1969 reyling 1976 who suggest different non dimensional parameters relating to the shallow water depth however these criteria are not uniform therefore further investigations into shallow water effects

then added to the aft ballast until the inclinometer indicated that the model was balanced total weight of the model was kept constant throughout the testing at 27 73 kg additional weight of the deflectors compared to bare hull testing was compensated for by removing their weight from the ballast ensuring equal weight and lcg for all configurations this process was repeated every time that

diverse range of applications from search rescue and pleasure boating to law enforcement and racing as such academic research into the performance and flow phenomena of hsc began to increase greatly in the 1960 s when many of the empirical formulas still in use today were contrived recent years have seen a further growth in research as seen in fig 1 this is likely due to increased access to high speed computers and more towing tanks being operable at planing speeds despite this recent rise in research findings many phenomena associated with planing craft are still not fully understood planing is a state where the vessel rides on the surface of the water and relies on pressure forces to maintain lift rather than the buoyancy forces used by displacement hulls savitsky 1964 this lift reduces the displacement of the vessel allowing the vessel to move much faster than a displacement vessel using the same propelling force for prismatic hull forms hulls that have a constant cross section along their length the forces and operating characteristics can accurately be determined using the semi empirical savitsky method the savitsky method savitsky 1964 uses the shape of the hull and the speed to determine the moment acting around the center of gravity this allows for the determination of trim and drag more recently the method has been further refined with the inclusion of whisker spray savitsky et al 2007 whisker spray develops along the hull as the craft moves through the water and can account for 15 to 20 of total high speed craft resistance savitsky et al 2007 larsson and raven 2010 the stagnation line is located directly aft of the spray area is the forward boundary of the wetted surface area and is the location with the highest amount of water pressure acting on the hull in fig 2 the spray area wetted area and stagnation line are shown also noted are the keel and chine lengths showing the boundaries of the stagnation line at the keel and the chine accurate determination of the location of the stagnation spray root line is important for the determination of the wetted area since to numerically determine the calm water resistance the pressure over the wetted area is integrated to correctly understand the steady state loads the spray root must be determined correctly fu et al 2014 furthermore as accelerations are higher at the stagnation line a correct determination of the location is of importance for seakeeping analysis kim et al 2008 predicting the start and extent of the spray area is currently difficult to do numerically fu et al 2014 mousaviraad et al 2015 even savitsky et al 2007 wrongly predicts the location of the stagnation line placing it too far aft molchanov 2018 a common technique to reduce resistance is to detach water flow reducing either the spray or the wetted area the wetted area and the associated resistance can be decreased by using transverse steps taunton et al 2010 a step works by separating the pressure area onto different sections of the hull at varying depths each step forces air into the cavity and reduces total resistance by having a lower frictional resistance as the aerated pressure area supports the hull de marco et al 2017 the spray area can also be reduced by placing spray rails along the stagnation line parallel to the keel and chines spray rails have been investigated by clement 1964 who showed that spray rails are most effective on lower less than 20 degrees deadrise hulls more recently seo et al 2016 conducted seakeeping performance tests on spray rails and further refined their design noting an improved seakeeping performance with spray rails and a lower trim while not having a significant change in resistance clement 1964 also concluded that if any portion of the strips were extending behind the stagnation line they would contribute to an increase in resistance due to the addition of an appendage below the water marcos 2013 seo et al 2016 and lakatos et al 2019 have all shown a similar trend of increasing resistance at low speeds where a greater portion of the spray rails were submerged a newer technique is the spray deflector a spray deflector uses the pressure accumulated along the stagnation line to force spray downward and aftward rather than out to the side as in the case of spray rails redirecting the spray downward and aftward is much more advantageous as it should provide additional lift and forward thrust reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models have indicated a possible resistance reduction of 30 with spray deflectors and towing tank testing has shown a 15 20 reduction of the calm water resistance olin et al 2016 molchanov et al 2019 this paper aims to develop a better understanding of how spray deflectors near the stagnation line may function to decrease calm water resistance the performance of a hull appended with spray deflectors is compared with that of an unappended hull and analyzed across a range of speeds to provide a comprehensive understanding of how the angle of spray relative to the spray deflector impacts the drag reduction 2 experimental setup to investigate the effect of redirecting spray a purpose built model hull was designed molchanov et al 2019 it should be noted that the used model has a high length to beam ratio to facilitate a higher total resistance spray resistance accounts for 15 to 20 savitsky et al 2007 larsson and raven 2010 and if the total resistance is higher reductions in the spray resistance are easier to measure wielgosz et al 2018 the model s prismatic geometry allows for direct comparison with savitsky s semi empirical method savitsky 1964 table 1 shows the main particulars of the model molchanov et al 2019 the towing tank testing was conducted in the davidson laboratory towing tank at stevens institute of technology the towing tank is purpose built to facilitate high speeds the maximum testing speed is 30 48 m s though due to safety reasons speed rarely exceeds 11 m s the tank is 95 40 m long 5 m wide and 2 29 m deep at the time of testing the actual water depth was around 2 m the facility is also equipped with an overwater and underwater camera international towing tank conference ittc recommended guidelines and procedures for high speed marine vehicle resistance tests ittc 2017 were used to guide testing and analysis moreover the use of the savitsky method was developed at the same facility with similar water depth finite water depth can have a significant influence on calm water hull resistance for a wide range of operating speeds radojčić and bowles 2010 relate the running speeds to the water depth by using the depth froude number f n h v g h while depth effects are not negligible faltinsen 2005 they are not considered in this experiment since shallow water effects occur when the vessels runs at critical and super critical speeds in water depths less than 0 80 of l o a blount and hankley 1976 and for this research the ratio between the towing tank water depth and the model overall length h l o a is 1 11 this is further emphasized by the ittc which does not recommend considering depth effects ittc 2017 and the work by prini et al 2021 who determined comparisons at the same speeds and depth are not dependent on depth effects 2 1 deflector design three different deflector configurations were designed in order to investigate performance at low medium and high speeds the design was based on previous work by wielgosz 2018 who used hull integrated deflectors wielgosz et al 2018 where deflectors were designed as strips and molchanov et al 2019 where deflectors were designed as plates mounted on the bottom of the hull initially in this project deflectors were designed as strips with a constant thickness along their length these proved to be inefficient as the deflectors got submerged at the keel when run in the towing tank thus all deflectors were tapered in two directions first tapering was done along the length of the deflectors to ensure minimum thickness at the keel in order to avoid potential submergence of the deflectors at that position thus the deflectors were tapered from 0 25 cm at the keel to 1 3 cm at the chine with a constant tapering angle second tapering was made with respect to the leading and trailing edges of the deflectors when they are mounted on the bottom of the hull see fig 3 the reason for tapering in this direction is to ensure steady flow from the smooth surface of the bottom of the hull to the deflectors the trailing edge of the deflectors had a thickness of 1 3 cm while the leading edge was 0 25 cm thick ideally the tapering would have been done from 0 cm to 1 3 cm but this was impossible to achieve from a manufacturing perspective instead this transition from the bottom of the hull to the deflectors was further helped by the insertion of red clay fig 3 into the gap produced by the 0 25 cm deflectors thickness at its leading edge the low speed deflector with a design speed of f n 3 65 can be seen mounted onto the hull in fig 3 the deflectors were manufactured from pvc plates and taped onto the hull to make it easy to shift the deflectors longitudinally the edges were secured with clay to ensure no water would pass between the hull and the deflectors the location of the stagnation line was determined using underwater photos of the bare hull tests since the savitsky method does not accurately predict the trim and thus the location of the stagnation line molchanov 2018 l k l c and α which determine the position of the stagnation line are shown in table 2 for the three design speeds see fig 4 for design purposes l k and l c have been approximated to the nearest 1 3 cm half inch each deflector was designed to be parallel to the design speed stagnation line and offset by 5 cm in the forward direction measured at the keel chine this resulted in a parallel normal distance of 1 55 2 16 cm depending on α see fig 2 forward of the stagnation line however the location of the deflector was changed throughout the testing campaign when it was discovered that the deflector touched the water surface 2 2 design speed the general length froude number is of little use when evaluating the performance of hsc since the waterline length can significantly change due to frequent changes in trim therefore a volumetric froude number f n as seen in eq 1 is preferred savitsky and morabito 2010 larsson and raven 2010 taunton et al 2010 garland 2011 morabito and pavkov 2014 avci and barlas 2016 lakatos et al 2019 1 f n v g 1 3 the minimum speed required for full planing mode occurs when the speed to length ratio slr is greater than 3 savitsky 1985 this corresponds to f n 2 1 for the current model as this model is towards the larger end of models suitable for the davidson laboratory towing tank a maximum speed of f n 6 37 was selected the higher the percentage of spray resistance the easier it is to record a resistance difference when the total resistance is measured and spray resistance increases with speed molchanov 2018 therefore a possible reduction of the spray resistance will be more significant and detectable at higher speeds however a range of speeds was evaluated to better determine the performance of the deflectors across the speed range three different deflectors were made with one having a design speed corresponding to the highest attainable speed for the model this is referred to as high speed two other deflectors configurations were designed for low and medium speeds while ensuring that the lowest design speed was still well above the planing limit the testing speed range is shown in fig 4 it can be noted that the selected speeds are increased with a constant step except for the low speed deflector where the adjacent speeds are somewhat closer to the design speed only one deflector configuration is mounted at a time in fig 4 design speeds are marked in bold among their respective ranges of speeds for the three deflector pairs tests were performed using an ascending descending and finally a second ascending speed matrix to ensure repeatability the averages for these three repetitions are shown throughout the paper and an error analysis can be found in appendix a the model was fitted with an inclinometer which measures trim a drag balance which measures resistance and a potentiometer mounted on the heave post to measure heave during experiments the carriage towed the model in the surge direction while the model was free to heave and pitch the model was locked in roll yaw and sway the measurement instruments are further explained in appendix b 3 results 3 1 bare hull results the results from the bare hull have been compared with the savitsky semi empirical method savitsky 1964 one of the leading methods for practical determination of the performance of hsc even though the method was first presented over 50 years ago it is still widely used in the industry the method provides good accuracy overall however the method slightly underestimates the resistance at all speeds and overestimates the trim at lower speeds as shown in fig 5 the underestimation of the resistance is consistent with the findings of molchanov et al 2019 using the same parent hull however their model was equipped with pvc plates resulting in a different running position likely due to lower friction and a sharper transom furthermore the experimental results have been compared and show good agreement with the experimental results by fridsma 1969 which used a model with similar parameters and loading conditions the same length beam ratio l b 5 deadrise β 2 0 and l c g 30 from the stern though the comparison of the total resistance shows similar magnitudes it has not been included in fig 5 since data was hard to extract with adequate precision from the figure by fridsma 1969 the stagnation line angle α between the stagnation line and the keel was obtained by determining the length at the keel l k and the length at the chine l c from underwater photos as expected α is inversely proportional to the running speed because it is linked to the trim angle as the speed increases the consequent increase in lift forces a greater part of the model out of the water thus to gain a new equilibrium position the trim decreases and the stagnation line approaches the keel α and l c decrease a graphical representation of the stagnation line along the bottom of the model for all tested speeds is shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the reduction in α as the running speed increases a comparison between the experimentally obtained stagnation line and the theoretical line calculated using the method by savitsky 1964 is shown in fig 7 a 7 b and 7 c the method by savitsky 1964 accurately predicts the location of the stagnation line on the chine but over predicts the distance along the keel leading to an under prediction of α a vertical center of gravity vcg of 15 24 cm was assumed for the theoretical prediction however this assumption had little effect on the location of the stagnation line and can therefore not be the reason for the over prediction 3 2 spray deflector results to test the efficiency of the deflectors a direct comparison between the bare hull resistance and the resistance of the model equipped with the deflectors was performed at the same running conditions for the three deflector configurations low medium and high speed fig 8 shows the percentage resistance reduction for the hull mounted with the low speed deflectors with a design speed of f n 3 65 compared to the bare hull the deflectors were placed 5 0 cm forward of the stagnation line measured along the keel or chine this resulted in a parallel normal distance of 2 1 cm between the deflectors and the stagnation line fig 8 shows a total resistance reduction of about 2 0 at the design speed of f n 3 65 with the highest reduction of 5 0 at f n 3 20 experiments at moderate speeds were carried out with deflectors designed for f n 4 56 at first the deflectors were placed 5 0 cm forward of the stagnation line measured at the chine or at the keel to match the placement used for the low speed configuration however this led to a lower parallel normal distance of 1 7 cm since the medium speed deflector is designed for a smaller angle α and a lower trim these tests showed worse overall performances than the previous set of deflectors with a resistance reduction of approximately 1 0 at the design speed and slight resistance increases at higher speeds see red curve marked with diamonds in fig 9 after investigating the underwater photos and videos and recreating the running condition in a 3d modeling software it became clear that the deflectors were slightly touching the water at the keel and in doing so increasing the resistance considerably thus they were moved further forward initially 6 4 cm and then 10 2 cm from the stagnation line at the chine or keel resulting in a parallel normal distance of 2 2 cm and 3 5 cm respectively from the stagnation line fig 9 shows the total resistance reduction for the middle speed configuration the 3 5 cm position enhanced the performance at every speed with a peak resistance reduction of about 4 3 at f n 3 65 experiments at higher speeds were carried out with deflectors designed for a speed of f n 5 48 initial experiments were performed with the deflectors placed 5 0 cm forward of the stagnation line measured at keel or chine to emulate the placement of the slow configuration this resulted in a parallel normal distance of 1 5 cm significantly lower than the normal parallel distance of 2 2 cm for the lowest design speed and slightly lower than 1 7 cm observed at the middle design speed the higher the running speed the lower the trim which directly impacts α and consequently lower parallel normal distance the latter is an index of the deflector s proximity to the stagnation line the placement is efficient at the design speed when the deflector is close enough to ensure spray detachment but far enough to avoid the water surface in order to ensure the parallel normal distances of 2 2 cm obtained at lower speed for higher design speeds it was necessary to provide greater distances between the stagnation line and the deflector measured along the keel or along the chine the l c distance was increased to 7 6 cm from the stagnation line which resulted in a parallel normal distance of 2 3 cm fig 10 shows the total resistance reduction for both these deflector locations at high speeds at design speed the reduction is about 1 5 at speeds lower than the design speed there is a dramatic improvement of efficiency up to 4 5 at f n 4 56 for the higher parallel normal distance black line the lower parallel normal distance caused an increase in resistance of 0 61 at the design speed of f n 5 48 one of the most important parameters in terms of the running position of the vessel is the trim the trim is produced by the combination of the moments from propulsion water pressure resistance and lift savitsky 1964 the trim is essential as it not only directly affects the total resistance it also defines the location of the stagnation line on the hull savitsky 1964 previous experiments investigating the effect of spray deflectors showed that the deflectors changed the running trim causing the overall resistance reduction to be due in part to the change in running position molchanov et al 2019 therefore a key objective of this investigation was to design spray deflectors that did not affect the running position so that the effect of only spray deflection could be assessed fig 11 shows a consistent trim between the bare hull and the deflector configurations this is likely due to the slimmer design of the present deflectors as a larger change in hull geometry would be expected to have larger effect on the running position especially when the deflectors extend into the wetted area heave comparison between bare hull and deflector hull configurations is shown in fig 12 it can be seen that the heave is unaffected by the deflectors at medium speeds but increases consistently at lower and higher speeds a rise in heave indicates that there might be an increase in total lift caused by the spray deflection it was expected that deflectors would increase lift as spray rails lakatos et al 2019 and spray deflectors molchanov et al 2019 have been found to increase the heave lakatos et al 2019 concluded that the experienced increase in lift occurred due to the sharp bottom edges of the spray rails 3 3 discussion to link the resistance reduction to the flow features experienced by the hull an analysis of underwater photographs was performed photos from all runs were investigated to compare the spray generated by the bare hull and the spray redirected by the deflectors at the same running speed the behavior was consistent across the three deflector configurations low medium and high speed with four different phenomena being identified 3 3 1 deflectors at the design speed the deflectors were designed to be parallel to the stagnation line at their respective design speed fig 13 shows how the deflectors follow the stagnation line from the keel to the chine as can be seen from the underwater photograph the stagnation line remains relatively parallel to the deflectors the area between the stagnation line and the deflectors is the spray area it is the resistance contribution from this area that the deflectors aim to minimize the parallel condition redirects a reasonable amount of spray which effectively reduces resistance overall the deflectors performed well showing 2 in total resistance reduction at their design speed 3 3 2 deflectors at a higher than design speed when the model was tested at speeds higher than the design speed a gradual deterioration of the efficiency was observed as the speed increases the stagnation line tends to move away from the deflectors at the chine and α decreases as seen in fig 14 as the speed increases α decreases the distance at the keel l k is constant while the distance at the chine l c decreases significantly see fig 6 this causes an increase in the total spray area between the stagnation line and the deflectors causing an increase in resistance compared to the hull at design speed 3 3 3 deflectors at slightly lower than design speed when the running speed of the model is lower than the design speed of the deflectors the angle α increases and the distance at the chine l c decreases accordingly as seen in fig 15 hence the overall spray area decreases and the deflectors performance improves accordingly as the model speed decreases the trim and angle α increases the stagnation line gets closer to the deflectors at the chine leading to a shorter parallel normal distance and a higher possibility that the rear parts of the deflectors touch the water surface and increase the total resistance the minimum parallel normal distance from the stagnation line is therefore a key factor for deflection performance the low and high speed deflectors both experience a slight drop in resistance reduction before increasing again as shown in figs 8 and 10 the reason for the similarities between the low and high speed deflectors likely comes from the fact that the low and high speed configurations have similar normal distances between the stagnation line and the deflectors 2 1 and 2 3 cm respectively whereas the middle speed deflectors were placed at 3 5 cm further from the stagnation line the middle speed deflectors were evaluated at a parallel normal distance of 2 2 cm as well however not at sufficiently low speeds to evaluate if this trend holds true for the middle speed deflectors as well see fig 9 3 3 4 deflectors at the lowest operating speed by studying the deflectors at speeds under the design speeds a resistance reduction of up to 5 was observed the deflectors performed best under this condition fig 16 shows the stagnation line crossing the deflectors at the middle which leads to a ventilation phenomenon in the wetted area close to the chine air bubbles originating from the intersection of the stagnation line and deflectors can be observed the air trapped between the deflectors and the water surface decreases the submerged wetted area moreover due to the stagnation line inclination the amount of spray area remaining between the deflectors and the stagnation line sees a very dramatic decrease the reduction of the total resistance is substantial when the positive effects of the trapped air and decreased spray area outweigh the increased resistance due to the submerged part of the deflectors fig 9 shows how the positive effects gradually become more significant at lower f n as the speed decreases the trim and α increase and the crossing point between the stagnation line and the deflectors shifts from the chine towards the keel the highest resistance reduction for the medium speed deflector configuration of 4 3 is reached at f n 3 65 when the stagnation line crosses the deflector half way between the keel and the chine below this speed the crossing point is too close to the keel causing less air to be trapped and the positive effects of ventilation to fade away moreover a significant part of the stagnation line is behind the deflector and only a small portion of the spray is detached at the lowest speed of f n 3 20 only the negative effects of the submerged deflectors remain and deflectors increased the resistance with 0 2 the peak in resistance reduction is also eminent at f n 3 20 for the low speed deflector fig 8 however for this configuration an increase in heave is also seen fig 12 an increase in heave means a reduction of the wetted area and thus a reduction in the resistance this is likely partially linked to very high resistance reduction at this speed clement 1964 marcos 2013 and lakatos et al 2019 suggest that for spray rails if part of the rail is behind the stagnation line the resistance should increase due to added appendages in the wetted area however it is possible that the submerged part of the deflector is small enough that the benefits from a reduction in spray area combined with the ventilation phenomena outweigh the increased resistance 4 conclusion the effects of the spray deflection the resulting reduction of the spray and in some cases the wetted hull area were studied across a wide range of planing speeds from f n 2 97 to f n 5 93 more than 300 runs were performed in the davidson laboratory towing tank to assess the total resistance the four prismatic hull configurations three deflector configurations and one bare hull were studied separately and then compared at the same running speeds the retrofitted deflectors were angled from the keel to the chine and from the bow to the stern see fig 3 in this study the application of three different sets of deflectors has resulted in reductions between 1 5 and 2 5 at their design speeds with peaks of about 5 at certain running conditions the distance between the deflectors and the stagnation line is a key factor in the efficiency of the spray deflection increasing this distance proved beneficial it has thus been concluded that increasing the normal distance even further could be a gainful effort however pushing the deflectors too far away from the stagnation line could also lower the magnitude of spray deflection as less spray is being captured by the deflectors the best performance was obtained when testing was conducted below the design speed of the deflectors at these speeds underwater photos showed an air ventilation phenomena originating from the point of intersection between the stagnation line and the deflectors the presence of air cavities is known to reduce the frictional resistance by decreasing the wetted surface area latorre 1997 ceccio 2010 matveev and miller 2011 the higher resistance reduction at these speeds is likely due to a combination of detaching the spray as well as creating air cavities in the wetted area close to the chine and stagnation line furthermore the experimental results for the bare hull configuration were compared with the semi empirical savitsky method savitsky 1964 savitsky and brown 1976 fig 5 highlights how the savitsky method under predicted the total resistance up to 8 0 at the highest speed and over predicted the trim up to 5 6 at the lowest speed but overall the savitsky mean error agrees with prior research conducted by bertorello and oliviero 2007 khazaee et al 2019 such error would be expected to increase when moving from prismatic to realistic hullforms 5 future work more experimentation and testing is required to further improve the general knowledge of spray deflection technologies and to assess the full potential of spray deflectors in the present investigation the highest resistance reduction occurred when the stagnation line intersected the strip approximately at its midpoint fig 16 additional experimentation is needed to understand the magnitude of the ventilation phenomena and more work has to be performed to establish the most efficient intersection point on the deflectors this investigation can be coupled with free running experimental tests and computational fluid dynamics cfd investigations to provide a broader understanding of the performance of spray deflectors furthermore as performance in waves is of the utmost importance to hsc the effect of deflectors on accelerations in waves should also be studied this paper did not consider depth effects in line with blount and hankley 1976 radojčić and bowles 2010 morabito 2013 dand 2002 yang et al 2001 toro 1969 reyling 1976 who suggest different non dimensional parameters relating to the shallow water depth however these criteria are not uniform therefore further investigations into shallow water effects

our model to ensure that the model s longitudinal center of gravity remained at the heave post the model was raised out of the water so that it was free to rotate about the heave post weights were then added to the aft ballast until the inclinometer indicated that the model was balanced total weight of the model was kept constant throughout the testing at 27 73 kg additional weight of the deflectors compared to bare hull testing was compensated for by removing their weight from the ballast ensuring equal weight and lcg for all configurations this process was repeated every time that

20786,fairings have been used to suppress the vortex induced vibrations viv of deep water cylinders in the offshore and marine engineering applications when properly functioning they can reduce both the cylinder oscillation amplitude in the cross flow direction and the fluid drag force in the in line direction plenty research reports can be found on the rigid cylinder viv suppression performances of fairings while very few research work discuss their viv suppression performances on flexible cylinders in the present work a self developed high resolution fluid structure interaction code based on the computational fluid dynamics is used to simulate the flexible cylinder responses attached with differently covered fixed short fairings the reynolds number based on the incoming velocity and the bluff body diameter is 1 68 1 0 4 the short fairings are found not to induce strong galloping oscillations in the flexible cylinders while the galloping is prominent in the rigid cylinder cases at large reduced velocities the different short fairing setups are found to influence the local fluid structure energy transport distributions and the travelling wave directions in the flexible cylinder responses which eventually influences the flexible cylinder oscillation amplitude distributions response frequencies and mode orders keywords vortex induced vibration flexible cylinder fairing computational fluid dynamic 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a common phenomenon in the offshore and marine engineering applications when cylinders are exposed to incoming sea flows the viv responses in the flexible cylinders usually exhibit large amplitudes in the cross flow cf direction combined with high structural responding modes and result in fatigue damage and reduced life span for the structure another aspect of the viv is the increased hydrodynamic drag force in the in line il direction due to the large cf oscillation amplitude the increased drag force results in large mean deflections of the cylinder and increased risk for clashing and contact plenty efforts have been put into suppressing viv and maintain the fatigue life of the marine structures within acceptable range in the offshore industry helical strakes and fairings are by far the most popular viv suppression devices since the helical strakes can effectively suppress the cylinder oscillation in the cf direction regardless of the orientation of the current to the marine elements they have drawn more attention of the scholars and the industry as can be seen in the work of trim et al 2005 korkischko and meneghini 2010 huang 2011 zhou et al 2011 huang and sworn 2013 quen et al 2014 constantinides et al 2016 and wang et al 2020 however the helical strakes may greatly increase the fluid drag force on the cylindrical structures which may cause severe consequences in the engineering applications and makes them unfit for the viv suppression under certain circumstances in contrast the fairings can reduce both the cf vibration severity and the il drag forces while their viv suppression performances are heavily influenced by the attack angle of the incoming current the fairings should be permitted to rotate around the cylindrical structures as would a weathervane in order to maintain parallel to the incoming flow direction however even if the fairing is aligned with the current orientation the instability of the fairing system may still induce strong vibrations by a type of flutter mechanism or galloping as suggested by assi et al 2009 2014 a minimum rotational resistance is needed for rotatable fairings to avoid the oscillation of fairings themselves which may under certain conditions increase the cylinder oscillation amplitude above the bare cylinder viv amplitude it is also deserve noting that if the rotational resistance is larger than a certain level or if the fairings are non rotatable severe galloping response would emerge which exhibits much larger oscillation amplitude than plain cylinder viv in some recent research work of zheng and wang 2017 2018b and liang et al 2018a b the galloping oscillation of circular cylinders combined with fairings or splitter plates are numerically and experimentally discussed the galloping oscillation can be excited within a wide range of incoming current velocities unlike the self restraint viv the maximum galloping oscillation amplitudes are decided by the characteristic length of the fairing tail or the splitter plate and their values can be much larger than the circular cylinder diameter plenty experimental or 2 dimensional numerical studies have been performed on the viv suppression of flexibly supported rigid cylinders using fairings while very few report can be found on the viv suppression performance of fairings on long flexible cylinders unlike the flexibly supported rigid cylinders that have single natural frequencies when the supporting stiffness and the mass ratio of the cylinder is decided the long flexible cylinders have theoretically infinite natural frequencies because of this difference as the incoming current velocity increases and the vortex shedding frequency increase to the values much larger than the rigid cylinder natural frequency the synchronization between the vortex shedding and the rigid cylinder oscillation would not happen and the viv stops in contrast in the flexible cylinder cases the synchronization would happen at higher cylinder vibration modes and the viv would still be prominent in the cases where the rigid cylinders are attached with fixed fairings the viv may be suppressed while severe galloping oscillations happen at large reduced velocities yet very few research reports can be found on the galloping oscillations in the flexible cylinders allen and liu 2017 and slocum et al 2004 performed experimental tests on flexible cylinders fitted with free to rotate fairings overall the fairings performed well in reducing the viv of the flexible cylinders while under specific fairing geometric parameters and incoming flow conditions flutter would emerge and amplify the transverse oscillation amplitude of the cylinders huera huarte 2014 experimentally studied the viv suppression performances of splitter plates elastically hinged to the surface of flexible cylinders the author found that by covering the flexible cylinders with splitter plates over less than half of the cylinder length the viv amplitudes over the span of the flexible cylinders can be effectively reduced the drag coefficient can also be reduced along with the transverse oscillation amplitude as suggested by allen and liu 2017 experimental investigation of flexible cylinders can be expensive and difficult to perform other than the simultaneous collection of displacement and strain data along the cylinder small details of the suppression device geometry and the connector configurations also need to be carefully designed to produce accurate testing results also the cylinder diameters usually have to be minimized in the flexible cylinder experiments which results in much lower reynolds number when compared with the practical engineering applications therefore the numerical method may be more efficient in studying this problem plenty numerical work has been performed on the viv of flexible cylinders and many numerical models are based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd to better predict the flow field around the vibrating cylinders the navier stokes equations are commonly used as the governing equations of the fluid flow while some meshless models like the discrete vortex method dvm are also used the dvm simulates the movement of vortex cores in the flow field it consumes less calculation work than n s equations and can provide reasonably accurate flow field simulations while some turbulence characters are omitted some researchers choose to use this model to perform relatively fast viv simulations lin and wang 2019 yamamoto et al 2004 and achieved reasonably precise simulation results the computation cost of cfd models based on n s equations are relatively high while more detailed flow field information can be predicted many works used a quasi three dimensional strip cfd method to simulate the long flexible pipe viv newman and karniadakis 1996 willden and graham 2001 2004 bao et al 2016 the fluid forces within each strip plane are calculated from the corresponding 2d flow field data and then applied to the 3d structural response model to simulate the riser responses the strips are independent from each other and the three dimensionality of the flow fields in some cases may not be properly captured there are also some fully 3d works holmes et al 2006 used a fully 3d cfd method to simulate the viv of a plain riser and straked risers the model was solved with a finite element method fem while sparse meshes and large element aspect ratios were used to reduce the computational cost wang et al 2012 2013 used the ansys mfx solver to simulate the viv of a real flexible riser in the uniform and linearly sheared flows the 3d unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans governing equations are coupled with the sst k ω turbulence model to simulate the flow field around the vibrating riser while the riser structural response model is discretized with the finite element method and coupled with the fluid flow governing equations to form the viv numerical model chen and kim 2014 used the ansys mfx solver to simulate the multi assembled riser systems huang et al 2007 2010 used a fully 3d cfd method to simulate the long riser viv responses in uniform and shear flows constantinides and zhang 2014 used a 3d rans model to simulate the full scale viv response of a steel lazy wave riser covered with staggered buoyancy modules and helical strakes wang and xiao 2016 used the large eddy simulation les in the ansys mfx multi field solver to simulate the cases in the riser viv experimental work by lehn 2003 and discussed the importance of the in line il fatigue damage in low velocity flows newman and karniadakis 1997 used a 3d direct numerical simulation dns method to study the long cable response waves and the corresponding wake responses bourguet et al 2011 2013a b also used the 3d dns method to study the basic viv characters of long flexible cylinders in the sheared flow and discussed the lock in phenomenon of the cylinder the mono and multi frequency vibration mechanisms and the standing travelling wave phenomenon in the present work the flow induced vibrations on flexible cylinders covered with fixed fairing devices are numerically studied the flow induced vibrations of the combined structures are firstly tested with 2d fluid structure interaction fsi simulations in the 2d cases the flexibly supported rigid structures have the natural frequencies of the flexible cylinders that are possible to be excited by the incoming current the 2d tests provide preliminary predictions on whether severe galloping oscillations will be excited on the flexible cylinders then 3d fsi simulations are performed on flexible cylinders covered with fixed fairings the cylinder oscillation modes amplitudes and frequencies are discussed under different fairing setup and further studies on fatigue damage and energy transfer characters are performed 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations of the fluid flow in the present 3d cfd fsi model the governing equations of the incompressible fluid flow are the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations closed with the sheared stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 the conventional continuity equation is modified with the pseudo compressibility method as is used in the work of wang 2009 the equations are modified with the arbitrary lagrange euler ale method in order to simulate the flow fields in the fsi problems zheng and wang 2017 the model is built in a cartesian coordinate system and can be expressed as 1 p τ β u j x j 0 2 u i τ u i t u j u ˆ j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i τ i j x j where u i u i 1 v i 2 w i 3 is the flow velocity components in the x i directions x i 1 y i 2 z i 3 u ˆ i u ˆ i 1 v ˆ i 2 w ˆ i 3 is the mesh grid node velocity p is the pressure and ν is the kinetic viscosity the turbulence shear stress τ i j defined by menter 1994 is used in the present work it is deserve noting that the model contains a duel time stepping process since a pseudo compressibility method is used to deal with the coupling between the velocity field and the pressure field τ is the virtual time t is the real time and β is the pseudo compressibility coefficient detailed model description can be found in appendix a 1 and in the work of zheng and wang 2017 2018b the governing equations are solved with a self developed total variation diminishing tvd finite volume method fvm the detail of the numerical method can be found in appendix a and in the work of wang et al 2015 2 2 governing equations of the structural responses in the present work as in many related research work huang et al 2010 bourguet et al 2011 bao et al 2016 zheng and wang 2021 the slender cylinder is simplified as a tensioned beam with its both ends fixed with hinges the cylinder responses in the lateral directions are defined by the following equation 3 2 z 2 e i 2 v i z 2 z t v i t 2 m 2 v i t 2 c v i t f i e is the young s modulus i is the moment of inertia v i is the cylinder displacement in the x i 1 or y i 2 direction in the cartesian coordinate t is the top tension m is the cylinder mass per unit length c is the structural damping and f i is the hydrodynamic force in the il i 1 or cf i 2 direction the model is dispersed with the finite element method fem and solved with the newmark β method the details of the fem model construction and solving are introduced in appendix b 2 3 fluid structure interaction strategy in the present work a loose coupling strategy is used for the data transfer between the flow field solver and the structural response solver within each fluid structure coupling time step the flow field solver first reads the structural response data from the previous time step and update the mesh grid information accordingly the mesh deformation is controlled with a laplace s equation 4 γ u ˆ i 0 γ 1 e l n here u ˆ j is the mesh grid node velocity in the fluid flow governing equations and l n is the distance from the node to the moving boundary surface with known moving boundary velocities the mesh grid node velocities within the flow field region can be solved with this equation and then used for updating the mesh grid and for the time advancing of the fluid flow governing equations afterwards the fluid forces exerted on the structural surface are calculated and used by the structural response solver to solve for the cylinder response within the current time step the simulation can then move onto the next time step 3 case description 3 1 3 dimensional flexible cylinder model description the flexible cylinder model comes from the experimental tests at marintek by exxonmobil lehn 2003 the geometric and physical parameters of the experimental model are summarized in table 1 l is the length of the cylinder d is the diameter e i is the bending stiffness t is the top tension and m l is the mass of the riser per unit length the eigenfrequencies for a vertical flexible cylinder can be estimated by simplifying the model as a tensioned beam with zero bending moment at both ends for a tensioned beam the n th eigenfrequency can be approximated using the eigenfrequencies of a tensioned string with no bending stiffness and a non tensioned beam as follows 5 f n s b f n s t r i n g 2 f n b e a m 2 f n s t r i n g n 2 t m l l 2 f n b e a m n 2 π 2 e i m l l 4 n is the mode order f n s b is the theoretically predicted natural frequency value calculated with the corresponding values of a tensioned string f n s t r i n g and a non tensioned beam f n b e a m the first eight eigenfrequency values of the flexible cylinder from modal analysis and from eq 5 are compared in table 2 the eigenfrequencies of the cylinder from modal analysis f n b a r e agree well with the corresponding theoretical values f n s b the details of the flexible cylinder modal analysis are presented in appendix b 1 in the present work the flow induced vibrations of flexible cylinders covered with fixed fairings are studied as is shown in fig 1 three cases covering with fairings are considered and the fairings cover different regions of the flexible cylinder in case fair1 continuous fixed fairing covers the lower half of the flexible cylinder while in case fair2 the upper half of the cylinder is covered it is deserve noting that case fair1 and fair2 are not symmetrical because the tension is not evenly distributed along the flexible cylinder span in case fair1 the short fairing covers the lower region where the tension is smaller while in case fair2 the upper region where the tension is larger is covered with the fairing the whole span of the flexible cylinder is covered with continuous fairing in case fair3 the present work focuses on studying the influence of the fairings on the hydrodynamic characters of the flexible cylinder the fairings are set with no mass and the natural frequencies of the fairing covered cylinders are the same as that of the bare flexible circular cylinder therefore it is safe to say that under the same incoming flow conditions any discrepancies between the fsi responses of the bare cylinder and the fairing covered cylinders are purely due to the geometric shape alteration caused by the fairing devices 3 2 flow field domain and boundary conditions fig 2 presents the overview of the 3d numerical simulation setup and the incoming velocity profile of the benchmark case the experimental data 1108 lehn 2003 in which the flexible cylinder model is subject to an uniform incoming velocity of 0 84 m s is used as the benchmark in the present work the reynolds number is 1 68 1 0 4 based on the incoming velocity and the bare circular cylinder diameter the flow field simulation domain is presented in fig 3 the flexible cylinder model is placed 20 d downstream of the inlet boundary where an uniform incoming flow velocity is applied along the span of the cylinder the width of the simulated flow field in the cross flow direction y direction is 40 d the flow field length in the incoming flow direction x direction is 80 d and the span wise z direction length is 481 5 d at the wall boundary neumann condition is applied for pressure p n 0 and non slip wall boundary condition is used for the velocity u i i 1 3 the boundary conditions for k and ω at the structural surface are defined as k 0 ω 10 6 ν β 1 δ y 1 2 where β 1 0 075 and δ y 1 represents the distance to the next point away from the wall the cylinder surface is also defined as the fluid structure interaction surface where the fluid force and structural response data are transferred between the flow field solver and the structural dynamic response solver the inlet boundary conditions are defined as p 0 u 1 u u 2 u 3 0 ω ω u l d o m a i n k 1 0 3 ν ω u represents the inlet free stream velocity and l d o m a i n is the approximate length of the computational domain the neumann boundary condition is applied at the outlet boundary where the flow field physical parameter outward normal gradients are set to zero φ n 0 φ p u i k ω at the top bottom and bilateral boundaries the velocity in the outward normal direction is zero in the normal direction of the structural surface the minimum grid size is set with the value that satisfies y 1 as y is defined as y u τ δ y 1 ν where u τ is the friction velocity and ν is the kinetic viscosity of the fluid fig 3 c and d show the details of the mesh grids in the vicinity of the structure surface with the cross section of the circular cylinder and that of the fairing device 3 3 2 dimensional test cases a series of 2d fsi simulation cases are also performed to provide preliminary predictions on the flow induced vibration performances especially the galloping performances of the fairing covered flexible cylinders the 2d cases include flexibly supported rigid circular cylinders and fairing covered rigid cylinders fig 4 presents the 2d rigid cylinder model and the rigid cylinder model covered with fixed fairing the fairing parameter comes from a registered patent by allen and henning 2001 claimed by the authors as ultrashort fairing which has a chord to thickness ratio of c t 1 15 here the chord stands for the distance from the nose of the combined structure to the tail of the fairing while the thickness is the circular cylinder diameter the rigid circular cylinder shares the diameter of the flexible cylinder and the flexibly supported rigid bodies are exposed to the same incoming current velocity as the flexible cylinder to be later addressed the models have two degrees of freedom that is the structures can vibrate in both the il and cf directions the structural response is controlled with the following governing equation 6 x i c ζ x i c k x i c i 2 c μ x i 0 0 x i 0 0 c μ m ρ d 2 c k 4 π 2 u r 2 c ζ 4 π ζ u r u r u f n d here x i is the structural displacement and c i is the fluid force in the i t h direction i 1 x direction i 2 y direction the mass ratio c μ is set at the same value as the flexible cylinder while no structural damping c ζ is considered in the 2d cases same as in the flexible cases u r is the reduced velocity which is an important parameter in the following discussions and f n is the natural frequency of the flexibly supported structures in vacuum the natural frequencies of the flexibly supported systems in the cf direction are set with the values of the possibly excited flexible cylinder natural frequencies in the 3d cases the il and cf structural natural frequencies are set with the same values which is different from what may happen in the 3d flexible cylinder cases where the so called dual resonance can be prominent the reasons for the present settings are as follows in the flexible circular cylinder cases the il oscillation frequencies are usually twice as large as the cf oscillation frequencies and the excited il modes and resonance natural frequencies can be observed directly however due to the added mass effect in water the cf oscillation frequencies are not locked to the natural frequencies of the flexible cylinders in vacuum that have been presented in table 2 therefore with only available information on the cf structural natural frequency it is difficult to decide the actual corresponding il oscillation frequencies and then the il resonance natural frequencies of the 3d flexible cylinders that should be used in the 2d cases in the cases of cylinders covered with fairings the il oscillation frequencies are not twice as large as that in the cf direction which makes it even more difficult to decide the structural il resonance natural frequencies to be used in the 2d cases also it is easier for data comparison when the control parameters are the same according to the benchmark experimental data and the 3d numerical predictions that will be addressed later the 4th order response mode will be excited in the 3d flexible cylinder in the cf direction under the incoming flow condition in case 1108 the 2d test cases discuss the flow induced vibrations of the flexibly supported structures with specific natural frequencies ranging from the 1st to the 5th order mode natural frequencies of the flexible cylinder shown in table 2 by doing so the possibly excited natural frequencies in the flexible cylinder cases are covered in the 2d cases 4 results and discussions 4 1 mesh dependence study a mesh dependence study is performed first to ensure that the simulation results are not heavily influenced by the mesh size the initial 3d flow fields are discretized by uniform mesh grids in the x y plane within the span wise regions that have the same structural cross sections relatively coarse mesh grids are used in the span wise direction when compared with the grids in the x y plane as in the numerical work of huang et al 2010 and wang and xiao 2016 in which correct viv predictions were performed for the flexible cylinder models since only up to 7th order modes are prominent in the present simulation cases the span wise mesh grid resolution can be much lower than in the x y plane while still able to correctly predict the flexible cylinder viv responses although a l d 481 5 cylinder is considered in the circular cylinder regions the mesh grids in the x y plane have a resolution of 200 201 in the near wall flow field region 200 mesh nodes are evenly distributed along the circumference of the cylinder surface and y 1 is used to decide the mesh size at the wall boundary the radial spacing increasing ratio is set as 1 03 which has been examined by the 2d test cases three span wise mesh grid resolutions are tested and the results are presented in fig 5 and table 3 the experimental data 1108 lehn 2003 is used as the benchmark for the mesh dependence test n z is the mesh node number in the span wise direction and n x y represents the mesh grid nodes in the x y plane fig 5 shows that as n z increases from 41 in mesh 1 to 61 in mesh 3 the oscillation amplitudes and il mean deflection do not show large discrepancies especially when comparing the simulation results from mesh 2 and mesh 3 table 3 shows that the simulation results with the three meshes predict identical mode number and nearly the same oscillation frequencies in both the il and the cf directions although the present numerical simulations over predict the oscillation frequencies the 4th order cf oscillation mode and the larger oscillation amplitudes in the upper half of the flexible cylinder can be correctly captured since the experimental displacement information is only provided at 8 locations it is difficult to discuss the high order response modes and the oscillation amplitude distributions in the il direction with the experimental data only that the il oscillation amplitudes are much smaller than the cf oscillation amplitudes and the present simulations can correctly predict the il vibration amplitude levels the reason for the frequency over prediction may be that the euler bernoulli beam fem model omits some geometric non linearity in the flexible cylinder as the maximum il mean deflection reaches around 10d in the cases where the incoming velocities are smaller the il mean deflection and non linearity are less prominent and the present code can better predict the oscillation frequency zheng and wang 2021 in our future work the present fsi code will be further upgraded with the non linear model of the flexible cylinder to better predict the cylinder oscillation characters at larger incoming velocities generally the data shows that as the mesh node numbers increases the simulation results gradually converge to constant values despite some over prediction on the cylinder oscillation frequencies the present simulations can correctly reflect the flexible cylinder response modes and the oscillation amplitude distribution characters along the span therefore it is safe to say that with sufficient nodes involved in the fluid mesh grids the flow induced vibration predictions are mesh grid independent from the mesh grid resolution the simulation results with mesh 2 is close to the benchmark experimental data and no obvious improvement in the simulation results can be observed by increasing the mesh nodes to the level of mesh 3 considering both the simulation precision and efficiency the y the spacing between nodes on the wall boundary the mesh spacing increasing ratio in x y plane mesh and the n z of mesh 2 are used in the following simulations 4 2 2 dimensional test results the 2d simulation results are plotted in fig 6 to show the possible oscillation characters of the 3d flexible cylinders the incoming velocity is 0 84 m s which is the same as in the experimental case 1108 lehn 2003 although the incoming velocity stays the same the reduced velocity u r ranges from 3 98 to 23 73 under the corresponding structural natural frequencies the mesh grids in the 2d test cases are identical with the 3d meshes in the corresponding x y planes for the circular cylinder cases the mesh node resolution is 200 201 within the near wall flow field region 20 d x 20 d 20 d y 20 d as has been previously stated 200 mesh nodes are evenly distributed along the circumference of the cylinder surface y 1 is used to define the mesh size next to the wall surface and a radial mesh size increasing ratio of 1 03 is used for the short fairing cases the mesh node resolution in the near wall region is 300 201 and the 300 nodes are not evenly distributed along the structural surface considering the y 1 constraint on the fairing tail besides that 201 nodes are still distributed in the radial direction and the mesh size increasing ratio is kept at 1 03 fig 6 a presents the il mean deflections of the bare cylinder and the fairing covered cylinder generally as the reduced velocity increases the il mean deflection of both the structures will gradually increase under all of the reduced velocities the cylinder covered with fairing have smaller il mean deflection when compared with the bare circular cylinder this suggests that the fairing device may reduce the fluid drag force exerted on the structure which may help reducing the il deflection of the flexible cylinders fig 6 b plots the cf oscillation amplitudes of the structures the bare cylinder has the largest value of cf vibration amplitude a y d 1 0 at u r 3 98 as the reduced velocity increases to u r 5 28 and u r 7 40 the cf oscillation amplitude reduces to a y d 0 7 when the reduced velocity reaches u r 11 56 and u r 23 73 the bare cylinder ceases to oscillate severely and the oscillation amplitude is small a y d 0 1 this conforms with the free vibration circular cylinder experimental data khalak and williamson 1999 in the upper branch lower branch and the out of synchronization velocity regions which is also plotted in fig 6 b the simulation results of the bare cylinder viv using the same fsi code zheng and wang 2017 as in the present work are also plotted for reference although the structural mass ratio natural frequency and incoming velocities in the simulation cases of zheng and wang 2017 are different from the present parameters the cylinder cf oscillation amplitudes are similar at the same u r values in contrast the cf oscillation amplitude of the cylinder covered with fairing increases along with the reduced velocity from a y d 0 4 at u r 3 98 to a y d 1 3 at u r 11 56 and reduces to a y d 0 1 at u r 0 1 previous experimental assi et al 2014 and numerical zheng and wang 2017 2018b studies suggest that the galloping oscillation instead of viv is prominent in the fairing cases since no experimental data can be found on the cylinder combined with c t 1 15 short fairing the experimental data of a cylinder combined with c t 1 34 and c t 1 44 short fairings stappenbelt 2010 are plotted to show the similar oscillation amplitude variations as can be seen from the experimental data as the fairing length increases the maximum galloping oscillation amplitude of the structure becomes larger and the large amplitude oscillation would occur at higher reduced velocity regions the present simulation results with the c t 1 15 fairing is in accordance with this trend fig 6 c shows that the bare circular cylinder oscillation frequency is locked to the level of the structural natural frequency f n at u r 5 28 and u r 7 40 that lies within the lock in region as the reduced velocity increases to u r 11 56 and u r 23 73 the cylinder cf oscillation frequency returns to the strouhal frequency marked by the line s t 0 2 the simulation results at u r 3 98 u r 5 28 and u r 7 40 are in agreement with the circular cylinder experimental data of khalak and williamson 1999 the cylinder vibration frequencies in the experimental data and in the similar simulation cases zheng and wang 2017 return to s t 0 2 at u r 10 similar as predicted in the present simulations fig 6 c also plots the structural oscillation frequencies in the c t 1 15 fairing simulation results and compared them with the experimental data of c t 1 34 and c t 1 44 fairing cases the structural vibration frequency in the fairing cases are generally smaller than in the circular cylinder cases within the low velocity region u r 10 it is also deserve noting that structures with larger c t have lower vibration frequencies as the reduced velocity increases beyond a threshold value the structural frequency quickly increases towards the level of s t 0 2 the present simulation results show similar trend with the experimental data as the structural vibration frequencies of the fairing c t 1 15 are larger than those in the c t 1 34 and c t 1 44 fairing cases while smaller than the frequencies in the bare cylinder cases within the velocity region of u r 10 as the reduced velocity increases to u r 23 73 the cf oscillation frequency also returns to the level of s t 0 2 in fig 6 d the phase difference θ of the bare circular cylinder is around 0 at u r 3 98 and jumps to the level of π when the reduced velocity increases into the lock in region and beyond the bare circular cylinder viv characters in the present simulation results conform with the experimental observation khalak and williamson 1999 the structural cf displacement of the fairing case is generally in phase with the cf fluid force exerted on the structure within the velocity range of 3 98 u r 11 56 and jumps to the level of π at u r 23 73 the discrepancies between the vibration performances of the bare circular cylinder and the fairing covered cylinder are due to the different underlying mechanism of viv and galloping oscillation as has been discussed in the experimental work of assi et al 2014 and in the numerical work of zheng and wang 2017 2018b the driving force of viv comes from the synchronization between the vortex shedding in the wake of the bluff body and the structure vibration in contrast in galloping oscillation the structure displacement controls the vortex structure evolution in the wake and the resulting fluid force brings strong instability to the structure vibration fig 7 depict the vorticity contour field of the bare cylinder and the fairing covered cylinder cases at u r 5 28 the instantaneous vorticity fields are taken when the structure is moving from the upper region y d 0 to the lower region y d 0 past the position of y d 0 obvious discrepancies can be observed in the flow fields in the bare cylinder case typical 2p vortex shedding mode is prominent as two pairs of reversely rotated vortex structures shed from the rear of the cylinder during one structural vibration period the vortex shedding is then in resonance with the cylinder vibration and the cf fluid force is out of phase with the structural vibration which has been shown in fig 6 d as for the fairing covered cylinder case fig 7 b shows that when the cylinder moves downwards the detached shear flow at the lower side of the structure reattach to the fairing tail and the shedding vortex structures is not in the typical 2p mode the reattached vortex structure then brings the cf fluid force that is in phase with the structural movement fig 6 d and the fluid force is dominated by the component at the cylinder oscillation frequency another phenomenon that is deserve noting is the third order component that is prominent in the cf fluid forces as is shown in fig 8 in both the bare cylinder case and the fairing covered case a higher order frequency component in c l is also prominent besides of the first order component at the frequency near the structural natural frequency it is deserve noting that the higher order cf fluid force frequency value 26 33 hz in the bare cylinder case and 19 52 hz in the fairing covered case approximately equals the sum of the 1st order frequencies of the cf fluid force and the il fluid force 8 67 hz and 17 33 hz in the bare cylinder case 6 67 hz and 12 86 hz in the fairing covered case this is in accordance with the experimental observations jauvitis and williamson 2004 dahl et al 2007 the third order harmonic component may be attributed to the interaction of the cylinder motion trajectory and the vortices in the wake and wu et al 2012 provided a possible explanation for the higher order harmonic frequency components in the fluid forces using a simplified fluid force model of wang et al 2003 and a viv force displacement model by jauvitis and williamson 2004 the higher order harmonic components are then found to be prominent when the phase angle between il and cf vibrations is within proper range although the third order harmonic cf fluid force component is prominent it is not reflected in the cf oscillation frequency spectrum this has also been observed in the experimental data while jauvitis and williamson 2004 claims that a transfer function between force and displacement filters out the third order frequency component in the force 4 3 3 dimensional simulation results with flexible cylinders now that we have studied the 2d cases that cover the possibly excited flexible cylinder natural frequencies in the cf direction 3d simulations are performed to show the oscillation characters of the flexible cylinders covered with short fairings specifically the influence of galloping oscillation on the flexible cylinder vibration characters is discussed 4 3 1 mean deflection and oscillation amplitude the root mean squared rms values of the structural oscillation displacement minus the mean deflection along the flexible cylinder span in the il and cf directions are plotted in fig 9 a i l r m s a c f r m s the mean deflections are the time averaged values of the il and cf displacements over 20 stable cycles over the cylinder span the flexible cylinders oscillate around the mean deflection positions and the il mean deflection values a i l m e a n at different locations are also plotted in fig 9 while the cf mean deflection values are nearly 0 the envelope of the oscillating flexible cylinder shape over several vibration periods in the 4 simulation cases are plotted to show more clearly the oscillation amplitude characters over the cylinder span and the excited cylinder modes in the il and cf directions fig 9 shows that by covering the flexible circular cylinder with short fairing devices the mean deflection of the cylinder in the il direction can be reduced over the whole cylinder span this is in agreement with the simulation results in the 2d test cases as is shown in fig 6 a although the 6th and the 7th mode are excited in the il direction in the flexible cylinder cases and they are not covered in the 2d cases in fig 6 a the 6th and the 7th natural frequencies of the flexible cylinder are 13 62 hz and 16 96 hz while the corresponding reduced velocities are u r 3 08 and u r 2 48 which are not far from the smallest reduced velocity u r 3 98 that we studied in the 2d simulations therefore both the 2d and 3d simulations predict reduced il mean deflections when the cylinder is covered with short fairing the 3d simulation results in fig 9 further suggest that by covering either the upper or the lower half of the flexible cylinder with the short fairing the il mean deflection can be reduced to the level where the whole span of the cylinder is covered with the fairing device the oscillation amplitudes of the flexible cylinder is small in the il direction when compared with that in the cf direction in all of the simulation cases the il oscillation amplitudes along the span of the cylinder are below the level of 0 2 d while the cf vibration amplitudes varies between approximately 0 1 d 0 8 d figs 9 and 10 show that within each case no obvious discrepancies can be observed in the il oscillation amplitudes along the cylinder while the differences among the cf vibration amplitudes are prominent in case 1108 and fair1 the 7th order response is excited in the il direction and the 4th order response is prominent in the cf direction in case 1108 the cf oscillation amplitude is larger in the upper region of the cylinder z l 0 5 and the present simulation predicts similar oscillation amplitude characters as the experimental data in this case the simulation predicts the largest cf oscillation amplitude occurs at about z l 0 86 in case fair1 larger cf oscillation amplitude can also be observed in the upper half of the cylinder while the largest value of a c f r m s can be observed at around z l 0 65 in case fair2 and fair3 the 6th order and the 4th order responses are prominent in the il and cf direction respectively larger cf oscillation amplitude can be found near the bottom of the cylinder and in the upper half of the cylinder in case fair2 while in case fair3 the a c f r m s value is larger in the upper half of the cylinder similar with the cf oscillation behaviour in case 1108 4 3 2 oscillation frequency fast fourier transform fft is performed on the simulation results of il and cf oscillation displacements in the 4 cases fig 11 plots the fft results and table 4 summarizes the il and cf oscillation frequency in the four cases in case 1108 and fair1 fig 11 shows that the dominating oscillation modes in the il and cf directions are the 7th order and the 4th order respectively the il and cf oscillation frequencies are also similar in these two cases as is shown in table 4 in contrast in case fair2 and fair3 the 6th order response dominates the cylinder vibration in the il direction and so does the 4th order response in the cf direction the il and cf oscillation frequencies in the fair2 and fair3 cases are also close from the aspect of dominating response modes and oscillating frequencies the four studied cases can be separated into two groups one group contains 1108 and fair1 while the other contains fair2 and fair3 we begin the analysis of this phenomenon by comparing the cf oscillation frequencies in case 1108 and fair3 with the corresponding values in the 2d test cases shown in fig 6 c the cf vibration frequency in the bare circular cylinder case 1108 is supposed to show similar characters with the bare 2d circular cylinder test case in contrast in case fair3 where the flexible cylinder is fully covered with the short fairing the cf oscillation frequency should be similar with the value in the 2d fairing covered cylinder case since the 4th order response is excited in the flexible cylinders in the cf direction it is reasonable to check the test results of the 2d cases that utilizes the corresponding natural frequency namely at f n 7 96 and u r 5 28 fig 6 c shows that the 2d prediction of the bare cylinder cf oscillation frequency at u r 5 28 is slightly larger than the value of 7 96 hz while in the fairing covered case the value is smaller than the natural frequency around 5 97 hz although these values are different from the corresponding cf oscillation frequencies in the flexible cylinder cases 7 58 hz in case 1108 and 6 18 hz in case fair3 the 2d and 3d simulation results reach an agreement that by covering the bare cylinder with short fairing the cf oscillation amplitude will be reduced although it is not yet safe to say that the underlying mechanism of the cylinder oscillation in case fair3 is the galloping oscillation the short fairing do have prominent influence on the hydrodynamic character of the flexible cylinder then we move on to case fair1 and fair2 in which the short fairing covers half of the cylinder span it is deserve concern that despite the same coverage ratio of the fairing device in the two cases the excited response mode orders and the oscillation frequency show obvious discrepancy in case fair1 where the lower half of the cylinder is covered with the short fairing the il and cf responses have similar characters as those of the bare cylinder in contrast in case fair2 where the fairing covers the upper half of the cylinder the structural responses show the oscillation characters of the fairing fully covered cylinder we will later discuss the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon 4 3 3 travelling wave in cylinder response and energy transfer the time history data of the cylinder il and cf displacements along the cylinder span in the four cases are plotted in fig 12 since the experiment only provided the displacement data at eight locations on the flexible cylinder the high order response in the il direction cannot be properly captured however the 4th order cf oscillation can be clearly observed from the experimental data as well as the travelling wave character in the cf response the cf response in case 1108 shows a mixed travelling wave and standing wave character as is shown in fig 12 the travelling wave in the cf direction originates from the bottom of the cylinder z l 0 and propagates towards the cylinder top z l 1 0 fig 12 also shows that the present simulation predicts the same oscillation mode and the travelling wave direction only that less standing wave component in the cf response is predicted than in the experimental data as for the fairing covered cases although the 4th order cf response is prominent in all of these cases the travelling wave directions shows large discrepancies in order to study the travelling wave characters of the cylinder cf response in a clearer manner the cf oscillation phase angles θ y at the excited dominant frequencies over the span of the flexible cylinders are plotted in fig 13 a the θ y values come from the fourier transform analysis results of the corresponding cylinder displacement time history data the phase angles at z l 1 are set to be zero and the θ y at other locations are adjusted accordingly the travelling wave propagates from the regions with larger values of θ y towards the regions with smaller θ y as suggested by lucor et al 2006 in fourier transform analyse results constant phase angle along the cylinder span stands for standing wave response while strictly linear phase variation stands for pure travelling wave response therefore the θ y values of case 1108 in fig 13 a suggests strong travelling wave response combined with standing wave components this is in agreement with our observation in fig 12 in case fair1 the cf travelling wave originates from both the top and the bottom of the cylinder and propagates towards the region of 0 45 z l 0 75 in case fair2 the cf travelling wave originates from the region of 0 25 z l 0 5 and travel towards both the bottom and the top of the cylinder in case fair3 the wave travels from the bottom towards the top similar with the cf response in 1108 while the response in fair3 shows more standing wave characters the discussions on fluid structure energy transfer are based on the force coefficient in phase with the structure velocity which has been used in the work of bourguet et al 2011 dahl et al 2010 and hover et al 1998 in the cross flow direction the time averaged value of the force coefficient component in phase with the structural velocity is defined as 7 c l v z 1 t s t s c l z t v y z t d t 1 t s t s v y 2 z t d t when it is positive the energy is transferred from the flow to the structure while negative value suggests inverse energy transfer the values of c l v in the four cases are plotted over the cylinder span in fig 13 b the energy transfer directions in these cases show large discrepancies within different regions since the 4th order response is prominent in the four cases in the cf direction we divide the cylinder into four regions and use a span averaged value of c l v to represent the energy transfer direction within each region the span averaged c l v within each region is defined as 8 c l v i r i c l v z d z l i here r i stands for the i t h cylinder region along the span r 1 0 z l 0 25 r 2 0 25 z l 0 5 r 3 0 5 z l 0 75 r 4 0 75 z l 1 and l i is the corresponding region length the c l v i values in each case are summarized in table 5 by comparing the data in this table with the cf oscillation phase angle in fig 13 a one can find that within the regions where the travelling wave moves towards the other regions the c l v i values are usually positive in contrast in the regions that only receive the travelling wave from the other regions the corresponding c l v i values are negative this suggests that the travelling wave propagates from the regions where the flexible cylinder receives the flow field energy towards the regions where the energy in the cylinder is damped by the surrounding fluid we may explain the variations in the cf oscillation amplitudes using the following theory since the driving force of the flexible cylinder oscillation comes from the flow field the local vibration severity can be explained by tracing the energy transport direction as the structural response travelling wave propagates from the energy input region towards the energy output region it is reasonable to assume that the energy is transported along with the wave we also notice that within each case the absolute value of the total positive c l v i is 2 5 times larger than that of the total negative c l v i which suggests that the flow field energy input is larger than the structural energy damped by the fluid thus the received energy within the negative c l v i regions may exceed the local energy damping by the fluid and results in large oscillation amplitude similar as the relation between the structural oscillation amplitude and the positive excitation suggested by khalak and williamson 1999 the cf oscillation amplitude distribution along the span in the studied cases can be correctly explained with this theory in case 1108 the travelling wave propagates from the bottom region r 1 towards the top region r 4 the c l v i values in r 1 r 2 and r 3 are positive while it is negative in r 4 according to our assumption the structural oscillation energy is transported from r 1 r 3 to r 4 and the oscillation amplitude in r 4 should be large this is in agreement with the data plotted in figs 9 and 10 where the cylinder cf oscillation amplitude is larger in region r 4 when compared with r 1 r 3 using the same method we can explain the larger cf oscillation amplitudes within region r 3 in case fair1 region r 1 and r 4 in case fair2 and region r 3 and r 4 in case fair3 the discrepancies between the cylinder oscillation frequencies may also be explained with this theory in the earlier analysis we have found that in case 1108 where the flexible circular cylinder is not covered with short fairing and in case fair3 where the flexible cylinder is fully covered with short fairing the structural responses are dominated by the hydrodynamic characters of the bare circular cylinder cross section and the fairing covered cylinder cross section respectively because of the different dominating cross sections the structural vibration frequencies and the dominating oscillation modes in the two cases show large discrepancies in the other two cases fair1 and fair2 only half of the cylinder span is covered with the short fairing the cross section that dominates the structural hydrodynamic character in each case is different due to the discrepancies in the travelling wave direction and energy transfer characters according to our assumption on energy transport in case fair1 the structural energy is transported towards region r 3 from the other regions by the travelling wave the accumulated energy and the resulting large oscillation amplitude within this region then dominates the whole cylinder oscillation characters that is the oscillation frequencies and the excited vibration modes are decided by the cross section of the flexible cylinder within region r 3 since the cylinder cross section in r 3 in case fair1 is the bare circular cylinder the oscillation frequencies and therefore the dominating vibration modes in the il and cf directions resemble those in the bare flexible cylinder case 1108 in contrast in case fair2 the structural energy is transported from region r 2 towards both the bottom and the top of the cylinder while it is also transported from region r 3 towards the top region r 4 the accumulated energy and general oscillation amplitude in region r 3 and r 4 is therefore larger than in r 1 and r 2 since the cross section in r 3 and r 4 is the fairing covered circular cylinder the oscillation frequency and excited vibration modes of the flexible cylinder dominated by this cross section resembles those in case fair3 where the whole cylinder span is covered with the short fairing 4 3 4 fatigue damage the fatigue damage along the cylinder span is evaluated using a damage index which has been used in the work of many researchers jhingran et al 2012 wang and xiao 2016 it takes into account the influence of response amplitudes frequencies and modal curvatures the damage index is written as 9 i d f z σ r m s 3 where f z is the zero crossing frequency of the local cylinder strain and σ r m s is the strain rms value the power of three in the equation assumes a slope of three in the s n curve this index is an effective fatigue damage quantifier that is independent of stress concentration factor material young s module or s n curve intercept the experimental data contains the cylinder surface strain time series signal while in the present numerical simulation the flexible cylinder is simplified as a tensioned beam and the surface strain is calculated from curvatures as suggested by vandiver and peoples 2003 10 σ d 2 2 v i z 2 as previously stated d is the cylinder diameter v i is the cylinder displacement in the i th direction x or y and z is the cylinder span wise direction the damage indexes along the cylinder span from the experimental data of case 1108 and the present simulation results of the four cases are plotted in fig 14 the simulation predicted fatigue damage indexes in case 1108 are generally in good agreement with the experimental data according to eqs 9 and 10 the damage index is influenced by the response frequency oscillation amplitude and vibration mode the present simulations predict different oscillation frequencies and vibration modes in the fairing covered cases and the corresponding fatigue damage in each case show different characters in case fair1 the oscillation frequency and vibration modes are similar with those in case 1108 and the resulting fatigue damage are at the same level due to the different cf oscillation amplitude distribution between the two cases the i d behaviours in the cf direction also shows some discrepancies since the oscillation frequencies in case fair2 and fair3 are smaller than the corresponding values in case 1108 and fair1 the fatigue damage over the cylinder span is generally smaller as well as is shown in fig 14 the discrepancies between the il oscillation frequencies is larger than that in the cf direction and more obvious gap can be observed in the il fatigue damage between the two group of cases thus by attaching the flexible cylinder with rigid short fairing device the cylinder fatigue damage may be reduced as the fairing devices are installed with proper arrangements 4 3 5 vorticity field characters the overview of the vorticity fields in the simulation cases are presented in fig 15 unlike in the 2d test cases it is difficult to identify certain vortex shedding modes while irregular transitional vortex shedding patterns are prominent in most span wise flexible cylinder regions however typical vortex shedding modes still can be observed at certain bare cylinder locations where the local travelling wave is not prominent and obvious vortex reattachment onto the short fairing tail can also be observed in the fairing covered regions the complex vortex structures in the wake of the cylinder may also suggest the existence of the dual resonance fft analysis is performed on the lift force coefficient data along the span of the flexible cylinders in the four cases and the results are plotted in fig 16 in the four cases the power spectral density psd values of c l at the cf oscillation frequencies are prominent in most span wise regions it is also obvious that besides the cf oscillation frequency component higher frequency components can also be observed and the frequency value equals the sum of the cf and il oscillation frequencies in each case the higher order frequency component in the lift force suggests that the dual resonance phenomenon can also be found in the flexible cylinder cases just as predicted by the 2d test cases although the dual resonance may lead to complex vortex structures as is shown in the 2d snapshots in fig 7 it still cannot explain the span wise variation in the vortex shedding modes in the flexible cylinder cases in flexible cylinder cases even when single mode oscillations are excited in both the il and cf directions the local cylinder oscillation amplitudes and trajectory shapes are different over the cylinder span when travelling wave becomes prominent in the responses the phase difference between the il and cf displacement over the cylinder span show more discrepancies resulting in a variety of oscillation trajectories along the cylinder this may be the reason for the intermittent and transitional vortex shedding patterns that can be observed in the present flexible cylinder cases we notice from fig 13 a that although the cf responses in the four cases are in mixed travelling standing wave form strong standing wave character can be found within each r i i 1 4 region which may lead to identifiable vortex shedding patterns in fig 17 we plot the relatively stable vortex structures within each r i region in the four cases it is deserve noting that all of the flow field snapshots are taken where the cf oscillation amplitude is relatively large within each r i region the c l v at these locations are found to have the same signs of the corresponding c l v i values which suggests that these snapshots can reflect the general vortex shedding characters related with the local fluid structure energy transfer in the region in contrast at locations where the cf oscillation amplitudes approximates 0 the vortex shedding patterns are in the 2s mode 2 single vortices off the back rear of the bluff body per cycle of body motion as can be observed in the flow around a fixed circular cylinder since the 2s vortex shedding pattern provides little insights into the fluid structure interaction characters in the flexible cylinders they are not plotted in fig 17 in case 1108 two types of vortex shedding patterns can be observed in the four regions in region r 1 and r 2 the cf oscillation amplitudes at the selected locations are relatively small when compared with those in r 3 and r 4 a y d 0 3 in r 1 and r 2 while the c l v values are positive same as c l v 1 and c l v 2 a p s vortex shedding mode is prominent in which 1 vortex pair and 1 single vortex are formed during one cylinder oscillation cycle as can be seen in the mark in the vorticity contour in fig 17 1108 r 2 in region r 3 the cf vibration amplitude at the presented location reaches a y d 0 7 and the c l v value is also positive same as c l v 3 the vortex shedding is in 2p mode in which two pairs of vortices are formed during one body motion cycle as is marked in fig 17 1108 r 4 in region r 4 the cf oscillation amplitude at the presented location further increases to a y d 1 0 and the local c l v is negative same as c l v 4 the 2p mode is still prominent while the distance between the vortex pairs are larger than in r 3 the 2p vortex shedding modes in region r 3 and r 4 are similar with the 2p mode in the 2d test case in fig 7 a while the p s mode in region r 1 and r 2 cannot be predicted by the 2d test simulations according to the summarize of the forced vibration experiment data by williamson and govardhan 2004 the p s mode can only be excited by forced circular cylinder vibration in free vibration cases the p s mode if it ever occurs will quickly evolve into other vortex shedding patterns since the p s mode results in strong fluid structure energy transfer while in free vibration cases the fluid excitation is approximately zero as for the 2p modes in r 3 and r 4 the vortex shedding modes and the corresponding body motion amplitudes as well as the c l v values are also in good agreement with the forced vibration experimental data on the rigid circular cylinder williamson and govardhan 2004 at the present reduced velocity u r 5 28 calculated based on the excited 4th order natural frequency with cf oscillation amplitude a y d 0 7 the 2p mode is prominent in the forced vibration experiment and the measured fluid excitation c l v is positive when the cf motion amplitude increases to a y d 1 0 the 2p mode still can be observed while the fluid excitation c l v is negative these phenomenon are in agreement with our observation in the r 3 and r 4 regions in the present simulation results therefore it is safe to say that in flexible cylinder cases where the fluid structure energy transfer is prominent the local structural motion the vortex shedding mode and the energy transfer characters are in agreement with the corresponding forced vibration data rather than the free vibration data on rigid cylinders in the fairing covered flexible cylinder cases similar vortex shedding characters can also be observed in the bare cylinder regions in r 3 and r 4 regions in case fair1 the cross section of the structure is the bare circular cylinder at the presented location in r 4 the local c l v and the c l v 4 are both positive the local cf oscillation amplitude is small a y d 0 3 and the p s mode is prominent in the wake at the selected location in r 3 the local c l v and the c l v 4 are both negative the local cf oscillation amplitude is large a y d 1 05 and the 2p mode is prominent the vortex shedding modes in the fairing covered region r 1 and r 2 are quite different from those in the bare cylinder regions in the two fairing covered regions the local c l v values at the presented locations are positive same as the corresponding c l v 1 and c l v 2 and the cf oscillation amplitudes are a y d 0 53 and a y d 0 75 respectively the vortex shedding structures at the two locations are in a 2c mode in which two corotating vortices are formed every half structure vibration cycle as is marked in fig 17 fair1 r 1 in case fair2 the vortex shedding mode in the bare cylinder region show similar characters as in the previous two cases at the presented location in region r 1 the c l v value is negative same as c l v 1 the cf oscillation amplitude is a y d 1 04 and the vortex shedding is in 2p mode in region r 2 the c l v value at the selected location and the c l v 2 are both negative the cf oscillation amplitude is a y d 0 27 and the p s vortex shedding mode is prominent in the fairing covered region r 3 and r 4 the vortex shedding modes cf oscillation amplitudes and the fluid excitation parameters are different the c l v value at the presented location in region r 3 is positive and the cf oscillation amplitude is a y d 0 85 while the 2c vortex shedding mode is prominent this is the same as the vortex shedding mode at the positive c l v locations in the fairing covered regions in case fair1 in region r 4 the c l v value at the presented location is negative and the cf oscillation amplitude is a y d 0 97 the vortices in the wake shows a 2p pattern although the distance between the vortex pairs are smaller than that in the bare cylinder regions this discrepancy may reflect the influence of the short fairing tail on the flow field structures in case fair3 where the flexible cylinder is fully covered with the short fairing similar vortex shedding pattern characters can be observed as in the fairing covered regions in case fair1 and fair2 in region r 1 and r 2 where the cf oscillation amplitude is relatively small and the span averaged c l v values are positive the 2c mode is prominent in region r 3 and r 4 where the cf oscillation amplitudes are larger and the c l v i values are negative the 2p vortex shedding mode can be captured at the selected locations the 2d test simulation with the short fairing covered cylinder still cannot predict the vortex shedding patterns in the flexible cylinder cases this is also because in the 2d free vibration rigid cylinder cases the fluid structural energy transfer is approximately 0 while in the flexible cylinder cases the energy transfer can be prominent 4 4 conclusion 1 by covering the flexible cylinder with fixed short fairings the il mean deflection values can be reduced over the whole cylinder span by either covering the upper or the lower half of the flexible cylinder the il mean deflection can be reduced to the level where the whole span of the cylinder is covered with the short fairing 2 the span averaged cf oscillation amplitude is slightly increased by covering the flexible cylinder with the fixed short fairing however the increment in the averaged oscillation amplitude in the flexible cylinder cases are not as large as the discrepancy in the cf oscillation amplitudes of the 2d free vibration viv and galloping therefore from the aspect of oscillation amplitude the fixed short fairing does not induce much stronger galloping oscillation in the flexible cylinder the cf oscillation amplitude distribution along the cylinder span however are heavily influenced by the location and coverage ratio of the fairing device 3 attaching the flexible cylinder with fixed short fairing would reduce the il and cf oscillation frequencies and therefore influence the excited response modes we find that by covering the upper half of the cylinder with the fixed short fairing the structural oscillation frequencies resemble those in the case where the cylinder is fully covered with fairing in contrast by covering the lower half of the cylinder with fairing the oscillation frequencies resemble those in the bare cylinder case this discrepancy can be explained with the travelling wave and energy transfer characters in different cases 4 the travelling waves in the cylinder cf responses are found to propagate from the regions where the flow energy transfers into the structure towards regions where the structural energy is damped by the fluid based on this observation we assume the structural kinetic energy is transported along with the travelling wave then we can explain the larger oscillation amplitudes in the structural energy damping regions and the smaller oscillation amplitudes in the structural energy input regions we can also explain the discrepancies in the oscillation frequencies in the studied cases with this theory in the case where the lower half of the cylinder is covered with fairing the accumulated energy and general oscillation amplitude in the bare cylinder region is larger than in the fairing covered region the bare cylinder cross section then dominates the hydrodynamic characters of the flexible cylinder and the oscillation frequencies as well as the excited vibration modes resemble those in the bare cylinder case in contrast in the case where the upper half of the cylinder is covered with fairing the accumulated energy and general oscillation amplitude in the fairing covered region is larger than in the bare cylinder region then the fairing covered cross section dominates the hydrodynamic characters of the flexible cylinder and the oscillation frequencies as well as the excited vibration modes resemble those in the fully fairing covered case 5 when the fixed short fairings are properly attaching onto the flexible cylinder the structural fatigue damage can be reduced due to the smaller oscillation frequencies and lower response modes which result in smaller curvature 6 intermittent and transitional vortex shedding structures are common in the wake of the flexible cylinder however at locations where the standing wave character is prominent identifiable vortex shedding modes can be found the typical vortex shedding modes the oscillation amplitudes and the energy transfer characters within each standing wave regions are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding forced vibration rigid cylinder experimental data this suggests that instead of the free vibration rigid cylinder data in which the fluid structure energy transfer is approximately 0 the forced vibration rigid cylinder data can better reflect the local oscillation characters of the flexible cylinder cases where the energy transfer is prominent the p s and 2p vortex shedding modes are found to be related with the fluid structure energy transfer in the bare cylinder region in contrast the 2c and 2p modes are in relation with the energy transfer in the fairing covered region 7 in the present work some new findings are based on the numerical studies on flexible cylinders and cannot be achieved by only studying the rigid cylinder cases first although the galloping oscillation is prominent in the rigid cylinder cases at large reduced velocities the short fairings do not induce strong galloping oscillations in the flexible cylinders the 4th order cf responses are excited in the flexible cylinder cases and the reduced velocities calculated using the corresponding natural frequencies are smaller than the values at which strong galloping is prominent in the rigid cylinder cases second the different short fairing setups on the flexible cylinders influence the travelling wave directions and the corresponding local fluid structure energy transport distributions which eventually lead to the differences in the flexible cylinder oscillation amplitude distributions the response frequencies and mode orders credit authorship contribution

20786,fairings have been used to suppress the vortex induced vibrations viv of deep water cylinders in the offshore and marine engineering applications when properly functioning they can reduce both the cylinder oscillation amplitude in the cross flow direction and the fluid drag force in the in line direction plenty research reports can be found on the rigid cylinder viv suppression performances of fairings while very few research work discuss their viv suppression performances on flexible cylinders in the present work a self developed high resolution fluid structure interaction code based on the computational fluid dynamics is used to simulate the flexible cylinder responses attached with differently covered fixed short fairings the reynolds number based on the incoming velocity and the bluff body diameter is 1 68 1 0 4 the short fairings are found not to induce strong galloping oscillations in the flexible cylinders while the galloping is prominent in the rigid cylinder cases at large reduced velocities the different short fairing setups are found to influence the local fluid structure energy transport distributions and the travelling wave directions in the flexible cylinder responses which eventually influences the flexible cylinder oscillation amplitude distributions response frequencies and mode orders keywords vortex induced vibration flexible cylinder fairing computational fluid dynamic 1 introduction vortex induced vibration viv is a common phenomenon in the offshore and marine engineering applications when cylinders are exposed to incoming sea flows the viv responses in the flexible cylinders usually exhibit large amplitudes in the cross flow cf direction combined with high structural responding modes and result in fatigue damage and reduced life span for the structure another aspect of the viv is the increased hydrodynamic drag force in the in line il direction due to the large cf oscillation amplitude the increased drag force results in large mean deflections of the cylinder and increased risk for clashing and contact plenty efforts have been put into suppressing viv and maintain the fatigue life of the marine structures within acceptable range in the offshore industry helical strakes and fairings are by far the most popular viv suppression devices since the helical strakes can effectively suppress the cylinder oscillation in the cf direction regardless of the orientation of the current to the marine elements they have drawn more attention of the scholars and the industry as can be seen in the work of trim et al 2005 korkischko and meneghini 2010 huang 2011 zhou et al 2011 huang and sworn 2013 quen et al 2014 constantinides et al 2016 and wang et al 2020 however the helical strakes may greatly increase the fluid drag force on the cylindrical structures which may cause severe consequences in the engineering applications and makes them unfit for the viv suppression under certain circumstances in contrast the fairings can reduce both the cf vibration severity and the il drag forces while their viv suppression performances are heavily influenced by the attack angle of the incoming current the fairings should be permitted to rotate around the cylindrical structures as would a weathervane in order to maintain parallel to the incoming flow direction however even if the fairing is aligned with the current orientation the instability of the fairing system may still induce strong vibrations by a type of flutter mechanism or galloping as suggested by assi et al 2009 2014 a minimum rotational resistance is needed for rotatable fairings to avoid the oscillation of fairings themselves which may under certain conditions increase the cylinder oscillation amplitude above the bare cylinder viv amplitude it is also deserve noting that if the rotational resistance is larger than a certain level or if the fairings are non rotatable severe galloping response would emerge which exhibits much larger oscillation amplitude than plain cylinder viv in some recent research work of zheng and wang 2017 2018b and liang et al 2018a b the galloping oscillation of circular cylinders combined with fairings or splitter plates are numerically and experimentally discussed the galloping oscillation can be excited within a wide range of incoming current velocities unlike the self restraint viv the maximum galloping oscillation amplitudes are decided by the characteristic length of the fairing tail or the splitter plate and their values can be much larger than the circular cylinder diameter plenty experimental or 2 dimensional numerical studies have been performed on the viv suppression of flexibly supported rigid cylinders using fairings while very few report can be found on the viv suppression performance of fairings on long flexible cylinders unlike the flexibly supported rigid cylinders that have single natural frequencies when the supporting stiffness and the mass ratio of the cylinder is decided the long flexible cylinders have theoretically infinite natural frequencies because of this difference as the incoming current velocity increases and the vortex shedding frequency increase to the values much larger than the rigid cylinder natural frequency the synchronization between the vortex shedding and the rigid cylinder oscillation would not happen and the viv stops in contrast in the flexible cylinder cases the synchronization would happen at higher cylinder vibration modes and the viv would still be prominent in the cases where the rigid cylinders are attached with fixed fairings the viv may be suppressed while severe galloping oscillations happen at large reduced velocities yet very few research reports can be found on the galloping oscillations in the flexible cylinders allen and liu 2017 and slocum et al 2004 performed experimental tests on flexible cylinders fitted with free to rotate fairings overall the fairings performed well in reducing the viv of the flexible cylinders while under specific fairing geometric parameters and incoming flow conditions flutter would emerge and amplify the transverse oscillation amplitude of the cylinders huera huarte 2014 experimentally studied the viv suppression performances of splitter plates elastically hinged to the surface of flexible cylinders the author found that by covering the flexible cylinders with splitter plates over less than half of the cylinder length the viv amplitudes over the span of the flexible cylinders can be effectively reduced the drag coefficient can also be reduced along with the transverse oscillation amplitude as suggested by allen and liu 2017 experimental investigation of flexible cylinders can be expensive and difficult to perform other than the simultaneous collection of displacement and strain data along the cylinder small details of the suppression device geometry and the connector configurations also need to be carefully designed to produce accurate testing results also the cylinder diameters usually have to be minimized in the flexible cylinder experiments which results in much lower reynolds number when compared with the practical engineering applications therefore the numerical method may be more efficient in studying this problem plenty numerical work has been performed on the viv of flexible cylinders and many numerical models are based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd to better predict the flow field around the vibrating cylinders the navier stokes equations are commonly used as the governing equations of the fluid flow while some meshless models like the discrete vortex method dvm are also used the dvm simulates the movement of vortex cores in the flow field it consumes less calculation work than n s equations and can provide reasonably accurate flow field simulations while some turbulence characters are omitted some researchers choose to use this model to perform relatively fast viv simulations lin and wang 2019 yamamoto et al 2004 and achieved reasonably precise simulation results the computation cost of cfd models based on n s equations are relatively high while more detailed flow field information can be predicted many works used a quasi three dimensional strip cfd method to simulate the long flexible pipe viv newman and karniadakis 1996 willden and graham 2001 2004 bao et al 2016 the fluid forces within each strip plane are calculated from the corresponding 2d flow field data and then applied to the 3d structural response model to simulate the riser responses the strips are independent from each other and the three dimensionality of the flow fields in some cases may not be properly captured there are also some fully 3d works holmes et al 2006 used a fully 3d cfd method to simulate the viv of a plain riser and straked risers the model was solved with a finite element method fem while sparse meshes and large element aspect ratios were used to reduce the computational cost wang et al 2012 2013 used the ansys mfx solver to simulate the viv of a real flexible riser in the uniform and linearly sheared flows the 3d unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans governing equations are coupled with the sst k ω turbulence model to simulate the flow field around the vibrating riser while the riser structural response model is discretized with the finite element method and coupled with the fluid flow governing equations to form the viv numerical model chen and kim 2014 used the ansys mfx solver to simulate the multi assembled riser systems huang et al 2007 2010 used a fully 3d cfd method to simulate the long riser viv responses in uniform and shear flows constantinides and zhang 2014 used a 3d rans model to simulate the full scale viv response of a steel lazy wave riser covered with staggered buoyancy modules and helical strakes wang and xiao 2016 used the large eddy simulation les in the ansys mfx multi field solver to simulate the cases in the riser viv experimental work by lehn 2003 and discussed the importance of the in line il fatigue damage in low velocity flows newman and karniadakis 1997 used a 3d direct numerical simulation dns method to study the long cable response waves and the corresponding wake responses bourguet et al 2011 2013a b also used the 3d dns method to study the basic viv characters of long flexible cylinders in the sheared flow and discussed the lock in phenomenon of the cylinder the mono and multi frequency vibration mechanisms and the standing travelling wave phenomenon in the present work the flow induced vibrations on flexible cylinders covered with fixed fairing devices are numerically studied the flow induced vibrations of the combined structures are firstly tested with 2d fluid structure interaction fsi simulations in the 2d cases the flexibly supported rigid structures have the natural frequencies of the flexible cylinders that are possible to be excited by the incoming current the 2d tests provide preliminary predictions on whether severe galloping oscillations will be excited on the flexible cylinders then 3d fsi simulations are performed on flexible cylinders covered with fixed fairings the cylinder oscillation modes amplitudes and frequencies are discussed under different fairing setup and further studies on fatigue damage and energy transfer characters are performed 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations of the fluid flow in the present 3d cfd fsi model the governing equations of the incompressible fluid flow are the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations closed with the sheared stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter 1994 the conventional continuity equation is modified with the pseudo compressibility method as is used in the work of wang 2009 the equations are modified with the arbitrary lagrange euler ale method in order to simulate the flow fields in the fsi problems zheng and wang 2017 the model is built in a cartesian coordinate system and can be expressed as 1 p τ β u j x j 0 2 u i τ u i t u j u ˆ j u i x j 1 ρ p x i x j ν u i x j u j x i τ i j x j where u i u i 1 v i 2 w i 3 is the flow velocity components in the x i directions x i 1 y i 2 z i 3 u ˆ i u ˆ i 1 v ˆ i 2 w ˆ i 3 is the mesh grid node velocity p is the pressure and ν is the kinetic viscosity the turbulence shear stress τ i j defined by menter 1994 is used in the present work it is deserve noting that the model contains a duel time stepping process since a pseudo compressibility method is used to deal with the coupling between the velocity field and the pressure field τ is the virtual time t is the real time and β is the pseudo compressibility coefficient detailed model description can be found in appendix a 1 and in the work of zheng and wang 2017 2018b the governing equations are solved with a self developed total variation diminishing tvd finite volume method fvm the detail of the numerical method can be found in appendix a and in the work of wang et al 2015 2 2 governing equations of the structural responses in the present work as in many related research work huang et al 2010 bourguet et al 2011 bao et al 2016 zheng and wang 2021 the slender cylinder is simplified as a tensioned beam with its both ends fixed with hinges the cylinder responses in the lateral directions are defined by the following equation 3 2 z 2 e i 2 v i z 2 z t v i t 2 m 2 v i t 2 c v i t f i e is the young s modulus i is the moment of inertia v i is the cylinder displacement in the x i 1 or y i 2 direction in the cartesian coordinate t is the top tension m is the cylinder mass per unit length c is the structural damping and f i is the hydrodynamic force in the il i 1 or cf i 2 direction the model is dispersed with the finite element method fem and solved with the newmark β method the details of the fem model construction and solving are introduced in appendix b 2 3 fluid structure interaction strategy in the present work a loose coupling strategy is used for the data transfer between the flow field solver and the structural response solver within each fluid structure coupling time step the flow field solver first reads the structural response data from the previous time step and update the mesh grid information accordingly the mesh deformation is controlled with a laplace s equation 4 γ u ˆ i 0 γ 1 e l n here u ˆ j is the mesh grid node velocity in the fluid flow governing equations and l n is the distance from the node to the moving boundary surface with known moving boundary velocities the mesh grid node velocities within the flow field region can be solved with this equation and then used for updating the mesh grid and for the time advancing of the fluid flow governing equations afterwards the fluid forces exerted on the structural surface are calculated and used by the structural response solver to solve for the cylinder response within the current time step the simulation can then move onto the next time step 3 case description 3 1 3 dimensional flexible cylinder model description the flexible cylinder model comes from the experimental tests at marintek by exxonmobil lehn 2003 the geometric and physical parameters of the experimental model are summarized in table 1 l is the length of the cylinder d is the diameter e i is the bending stiffness t is the top tension and m l is the mass of the riser per unit length the eigenfrequencies for a vertical flexible cylinder can be estimated by simplifying the model as a tensioned beam with zero bending moment at both ends for a tensioned beam the n th eigenfrequency can be approximated using the eigenfrequencies of a tensioned string with no bending stiffness and a non tensioned beam as follows 5 f n s b f n s t r i n g 2 f n b e a m 2 f n s t r i n g n 2 t m l l 2 f n b e a m n 2 π 2 e i m l l 4 n is the mode order f n s b is the theoretically predicted natural frequency value calculated with the corresponding values of a tensioned string f n s t r i n g and a non tensioned beam f n b e a m the first eight eigenfrequency values of the flexible cylinder from modal analysis and from eq 5 are compared in table 2 the eigenfrequencies of the cylinder from modal analysis f n b a r e agree well with the corresponding theoretical values f n s b the details of the flexible cylinder modal analysis are presented in appendix b 1 in the present work the flow induced vibrations of flexible cylinders covered with fixed fairings are studied as is shown in fig 1 three cases covering with fairings are considered and the fairings cover different regions of the flexible cylinder in case fair1 continuous fixed fairing covers the lower half of the flexible cylinder while in case fair2 the upper half of the cylinder is covered it is deserve noting that case fair1 and fair2 are not symmetrical because the tension is not evenly distributed along the flexible cylinder span in case fair1 the short fairing covers the lower region where the tension is smaller while in case fair2 the upper region where the tension is larger is covered with the fairing the whole span of the flexible cylinder is covered with continuous fairing in case fair3 the present work focuses on studying the influence of the fairings on the hydrodynamic characters of the flexible cylinder the fairings are set with no mass and the natural frequencies of the fairing covered cylinders are the same as that of the bare flexible circular cylinder therefore it is safe to say that under the same incoming flow conditions any discrepancies between the fsi responses of the bare cylinder and the fairing covered cylinders are purely due to the geometric shape alteration caused by the fairing devices 3 2 flow field domain and boundary conditions fig 2 presents the overview of the 3d numerical simulation setup and the incoming velocity profile of the benchmark case the experimental data 1108 lehn 2003 in which the flexible cylinder model is subject to an uniform incoming velocity of 0 84 m s is used as the benchmark in the present work the reynolds number is 1 68 1 0 4 based on the incoming velocity and the bare circular cylinder diameter the flow field simulation domain is presented in fig 3 the flexible cylinder model is placed 20 d downstream of the inlet boundary where an uniform incoming flow velocity is applied along the span of the cylinder the width of the simulated flow field in the cross flow direction y direction is 40 d the flow field length in the incoming flow direction x direction is 80 d and the span wise z direction length is 481 5 d at the wall boundary neumann condition is applied for pressure p n 0 and non slip wall boundary condition is used for the velocity u i i 1 3 the boundary conditions for k and ω at the structural surface are defined as k 0 ω 10 6 ν β 1 δ y 1 2 where β 1 0 075 and δ y 1 represents the distance to the next point away from the wall the cylinder surface is also defined as the fluid structure interaction surface where the fluid force and structural response data are transferred between the flow field solver and the structural dynamic response solver the inlet boundary conditions are defined as p 0 u 1 u u 2 u 3 0 ω ω u l d o m a i n k 1 0 3 ν ω u represents the inlet free stream velocity and l d o m a i n is the approximate length of the computational domain the neumann boundary condition is applied at the outlet boundary where the flow field physical parameter outward normal gradients are set to zero φ n 0 φ p u i k ω at the top bottom and bilateral boundaries the velocity in the outward normal direction is zero in the normal direction of the structural surface the minimum grid size is set with the value that satisfies y 1 as y is defined as y u τ δ y 1 ν where u τ is the friction velocity and ν is the kinetic viscosity of the fluid fig 3 c and d show the details of the mesh grids in the vicinity of the structure surface with the cross section of the circular cylinder and that of the fairing device 3 3 2 dimensional test cases a series of 2d fsi simulation cases are also performed to provide preliminary predictions on the flow induced vibration performances especially the galloping performances of the fairing covered flexible cylinders the 2d cases include flexibly supported rigid circular cylinders and fairing covered rigid cylinders fig 4 presents the 2d rigid cylinder model and the rigid cylinder model covered with fixed fairing the fairing parameter comes from a registered patent by allen and henning 2001 claimed by the authors as ultrashort fairing which has a chord to thickness ratio of c t 1 15 here the chord stands for the distance from the nose of the combined structure to the tail of the fairing while the thickness is the circular cylinder diameter the rigid circular cylinder shares the diameter of the flexible cylinder and the flexibly supported rigid bodies are exposed to the same incoming current velocity as the flexible cylinder to be later addressed the models have two degrees of freedom that is the structures can vibrate in both the il and cf directions the structural response is controlled with the following governing equation 6 x i c ζ x i c k x i c i 2 c μ x i 0 0 x i 0 0 c μ m ρ d 2 c k 4 π 2 u r 2 c ζ 4 π ζ u r u r u f n d here x i is the structural displacement and c i is the fluid force in the i t h direction i 1 x direction i 2 y direction the mass ratio c μ is set at the same value as the flexible cylinder while no structural damping c ζ is considered in the 2d cases same as in the flexible cases u r is the reduced velocity which is an important parameter in the following discussions and f n is the natural frequency of the flexibly supported structures in vacuum the natural frequencies of the flexibly supported systems in the cf direction are set with the values of the possibly excited flexible cylinder natural frequencies in the 3d cases the il and cf structural natural frequencies are set with the same values which is different from what may happen in the 3d flexible cylinder cases where the so called dual resonance can be prominent the reasons for the present settings are as follows in the flexible circular cylinder cases the il oscillation frequencies are usually twice as large as the cf oscillation frequencies and the excited il modes and resonance natural frequencies can be observed directly however due to the added mass effect in water the cf oscillation frequencies are not locked to the natural frequencies of the flexible cylinders in vacuum that have been presented in table 2 therefore with only available information on the cf structural natural frequency it is difficult to decide the actual corresponding il oscillation frequencies and then the il resonance natural frequencies of the 3d flexible cylinders that should be used in the 2d cases in the cases of cylinders covered with fairings the il oscillation frequencies are not twice as large as that in the cf direction which makes it even more difficult to decide the structural il resonance natural frequencies to be used in the 2d cases also it is easier for data comparison when the control parameters are the same according to the benchmark experimental data and the 3d numerical predictions that will be addressed later the 4th order response mode will be excited in the 3d flexible cylinder in the cf direction under the incoming flow condition in case 1108 the 2d test cases discuss the flow induced vibrations of the flexibly supported structures with specific natural frequencies ranging from the 1st to the 5th order mode natural frequencies of the flexible cylinder shown in table 2 by doing so the possibly excited natural frequencies in the flexible cylinder cases are covered in the 2d cases 4 results and discussions 4 1 mesh dependence study a mesh dependence study is performed first to ensure that the simulation results are not heavily influenced by the mesh size the initial 3d flow fields are discretized by uniform mesh grids in the x y plane within the span wise regions that have the same structural cross sections relatively coarse mesh grids are used in the span wise direction when compared with the grids in the x y plane as in the numerical work of huang et al 2010 and wang and xiao 2016 in which correct viv predictions were performed for the flexible cylinder models since only up to 7th order modes are prominent in the present simulation cases the span wise mesh grid resolution can be much lower than in the x y plane while still able to correctly predict the flexible cylinder viv responses although a l d 481 5 cylinder is considered in the circular cylinder regions the mesh grids in the x y plane have a resolution of 200 201 in the near wall flow field region 200 mesh nodes are evenly distributed along the circumference of the cylinder surface and y 1 is used to decide the mesh size at the wall boundary the radial spacing increasing ratio is set as 1 03 which has been examined by the 2d test cases three span wise mesh grid resolutions are tested and the results are presented in fig 5 and table 3 the experimental data 1108 lehn 2003 is used as the benchmark for the mesh dependence test n z is the mesh node number in the span wise direction and n x y represents the mesh grid nodes in the x y plane fig 5 shows that as n z increases from 41 in mesh 1 to 61 in mesh 3 the oscillation amplitudes and il mean deflection do not show large discrepancies especially when comparing the simulation results from mesh 2 and mesh 3 table 3 shows that the simulation results with the three meshes predict identical mode number and nearly the same oscillation frequencies in both the il and the cf directions although the present numerical simulations over predict the oscillation frequencies the 4th order cf oscillation mode and the larger oscillation amplitudes in the upper half of the flexible cylinder can be correctly captured since the experimental displacement information is only provided at 8 locations it is difficult to discuss the high order response modes and the oscillation amplitude distributions in the il direction with the experimental data only that the il oscillation amplitudes are much smaller than the cf oscillation amplitudes and the present simulations can correctly predict the il vibration amplitude levels the reason for the frequency over prediction may be that the euler bernoulli beam fem model omits some geometric non linearity in the flexible cylinder as the maximum il mean deflection reaches around 10d in the cases where the incoming velocities are smaller the il mean deflection and non linearity are less prominent and the present code can better predict the oscillation frequency zheng and wang 2021 in our future work the present fsi code will be further upgraded with the non linear model of the flexible cylinder to better predict the cylinder oscillation characters at larger incoming velocities generally the data shows that as the mesh node numbers increases the simulation results gradually converge to constant values despite some over prediction on the cylinder oscillation frequencies the present simulations can correctly reflect the flexible cylinder response modes and the oscillation amplitude distribution characters along the span therefore it is safe to say that with sufficient nodes involved in the fluid mesh grids the flow induced vibration predictions are mesh grid independent from the mesh grid resolution the simulation results with mesh 2 is close to the benchmark experimental data and no obvious improvement in the simulation results can be observed by increasing the mesh nodes to the level of mesh 3 considering both the simulation precision and efficiency the y the spacing between nodes on the wall boundary the mesh spacing increasing ratio in x y plane mesh and the n z of mesh 2 are used in the following simulations 4 2 2 dimensional test results the 2d simulation results are plotted in fig 6 to show the possible oscillation characters of the 3d flexible cylinders the incoming velocity is 0 84 m s which is the same as in the experimental case 1108 lehn 2003 although the incoming velocity stays the same the reduced velocity u r ranges from 3 98 to 23 73 under the corresponding structural natural frequencies the mesh grids in the 2d test cases are identical with the 3d meshes in the corresponding x y planes for the circular cylinder cases the mesh node resolution is 200 201 within the near wall flow field region 20 d x 20 d 20 d y 20 d as has been previously stated 200 mesh nodes are evenly distributed along the circumference of the cylinder surface y 1 is used to define the mesh size next to the wall surface and a radial mesh size increasing ratio of 1 03 is used for the short fairing cases the mesh node resolution in the near wall region is 300 201 and the 300 nodes are not evenly distributed along the structural surface considering the y 1 constraint on the fairing tail besides that 201 nodes are still distributed in the radial direction and the mesh size increasing ratio is kept at 1 03 fig 6 a presents the il mean deflections of the bare cylinder and the fairing covered cylinder generally as the reduced velocity increases the il mean deflection of both the structures will gradually increase under all of the reduced velocities the cylinder covered with fairing have smaller il mean deflection when compared with the bare circular cylinder this suggests that the fairing device may reduce the fluid drag force exerted on the structure which may help reducing the il deflection of the flexible cylinders fig 6 b plots the cf oscillation amplitudes of the structures the bare cylinder has the largest value of cf vibration amplitude a y d 1 0 at u r 3 98 as the reduced velocity increases to u r 5 28 and u r 7 40 the cf oscillation amplitude reduces to a y d 0 7 when the reduced velocity reaches u r 11 56 and u r 23 73 the bare cylinder ceases to oscillate severely and the oscillation amplitude is small a y d 0 1 this conforms with the free vibration circular cylinder experimental data khalak and williamson 1999 in the upper branch lower branch and the out of synchronization velocity regions which is also plotted in fig 6 b the simulation results of the bare cylinder viv using the same fsi code zheng and wang 2017 as in the present work are also plotted for reference although the structural mass ratio natural frequency and incoming velocities in the simulation cases of zheng and wang 2017 are different from the present parameters the cylinder cf oscillation amplitudes are similar at the same u r values in contrast the cf oscillation amplitude of the cylinder covered with fairing increases along with the reduced velocity from a y d 0 4 at u r 3 98 to a y d 1 3 at u r 11 56 and reduces to a y d 0 1 at u r 0 1 previous experimental assi et al 2014 and numerical zheng and wang 2017 2018b studies suggest that the galloping oscillation instead of viv is prominent in the fairing cases since no experimental data can be found on the cylinder combined with c t 1 15 short fairing the experimental data of a cylinder combined with c t 1 34 and c t 1 44 short fairings stappenbelt 2010 are plotted to show the similar oscillation amplitude variations as can be seen from the experimental data as the fairing length increases the maximum galloping oscillation amplitude of the structure becomes larger and the large amplitude oscillation would occur at higher reduced velocity regions the present simulation results with the c t 1 15 fairing is in accordance with this trend fig 6 c shows that the bare circular cylinder oscillation frequency is locked to the level of the structural natural frequency f n at u r 5 28 and u r 7 40 that lies within the lock in region as the reduced velocity increases to u r 11 56 and u r 23 73 the cylinder cf oscillation frequency returns to the strouhal frequency marked by the line s t 0 2 the simulation results at u r 3 98 u r 5 28 and u r 7 40 are in agreement with the circular cylinder experimental data of khalak and williamson 1999 the cylinder vibration frequencies in the experimental data and in the similar simulation cases zheng and wang 2017 return to s t 0 2 at u r 10 similar as predicted in the present simulations fig 6 c also plots the structural oscillation frequencies in the c t 1 15 fairing simulation results and compared them with the experimental data of c t 1 34 and c t 1 44 fairing cases the structural vibration frequency in the fairing cases are generally smaller than in the circular cylinder cases within the low velocity region u r 10 it is also deserve noting that structures with larger c t have lower vibration frequencies as the reduced velocity increases beyond a threshold value the structural frequency quickly increases towards the level of s t 0 2 the present simulation results show similar trend with the experimental data as the structural vibration frequencies of the fairing c t 1 15 are larger than those in the c t 1 34 and c t 1 44 fairing cases while smaller than the frequencies in the bare cylinder cases within the velocity region of u r 10 as the reduced velocity increases to u r 23 73 the cf oscillation frequency also returns to the level of s t 0 2 in fig 6 d the phase difference θ of the bare circular cylinder is around 0 at u r 3 98 and jumps to the level of π when the reduced velocity increases into the lock in region and beyond the bare circular cylinder viv characters in the present simulation results conform with the experimental observation khalak and williamson 1999 the structural cf displacement of the fairing case is generally in phase with the cf fluid force exerted on the structure within the velocity range of 3 98 u r 11 56 and jumps to the level of π at u r 23 73 the discrepancies between the vibration performances of the bare circular cylinder and the fairing covered cylinder are due to the different underlying mechanism of viv and galloping oscillation as has been discussed in the experimental work of assi et al 2014 and in the numerical work of zheng and wang 2017 2018b the driving force of viv comes from the synchronization between the vortex shedding in the wake of the bluff body and the structure vibration in contrast in galloping oscillation the structure displacement controls the vortex structure evolution in the wake and the resulting fluid force brings strong instability to the structure vibration fig 7 depict the vorticity contour field of the bare cylinder and the fairing covered cylinder cases at u r 5 28 the instantaneous vorticity fields are taken when the structure is moving from the upper region y d 0 to the lower region y d 0 past the position of y d 0 obvious discrepancies can be observed in the flow fields in the bare cylinder case typical 2p vortex shedding mode is prominent as two pairs of reversely rotated vortex structures shed from the rear of the cylinder during one structural vibration period the vortex shedding is then in resonance with the cylinder vibration and the cf fluid force is out of phase with the structural vibration which has been shown in fig 6 d as for the fairing covered cylinder case fig 7 b shows that when the cylinder moves downwards the detached shear flow at the lower side of the structure reattach to the fairing tail and the shedding vortex structures is not in the typical 2p mode the reattached vortex structure then brings the cf fluid force that is in phase with the structural movement fig 6 d and the fluid force is dominated by the component at the cylinder oscillation frequency another phenomenon that is deserve noting is the third order component that is prominent in the cf fluid forces as is shown in fig 8 in both the bare cylinder case and the fairing covered case a higher order frequency component in c l is also prominent besides of the first order component at the frequency near the structural natural frequency it is deserve noting that the higher order cf fluid force frequency value 26 33 hz in the bare cylinder case and 19 52 hz in the fairing covered case approximately equals the sum of the 1st order frequencies of the cf fluid force and the il fluid force 8 67 hz and 17 33 hz in the bare cylinder case 6 67 hz and 12 86 hz in the fairing covered case this is in accordance with the experimental observations jauvitis and williamson 2004 dahl et al 2007 the third order harmonic component may be attributed to the interaction of the cylinder motion trajectory and the vortices in the wake and wu et al 2012 provided a possible explanation for the higher order harmonic frequency components in the fluid forces using a simplified fluid force model of wang et al 2003 and a viv force displacement model by jauvitis and williamson 2004 the higher order harmonic components are then found to be prominent when the phase angle between il and cf vibrations is within proper range although the third order harmonic cf fluid force component is prominent it is not reflected in the cf oscillation frequency spectrum this has also been observed in the experimental data while jauvitis and williamson 2004 claims that a transfer function between force and displacement filters out the third order frequency component in the force 4 3 3 dimensional simulation results with flexible cylinders now that we have studied the 2d cases that cover the possibly excited flexible cylinder natural frequencies in the cf direction 3d simulations are performed to show the oscillation characters of the flexible cylinders covered with short fairings specifically the influence of galloping oscillation on the flexible cylinder vibration characters is discussed 4 3 1 mean deflection and oscillation amplitude the root mean squared rms values of the structural oscillation displacement minus the mean deflection along the flexible cylinder span in the il and cf directions are plotted in fig 9 a i l r m s a c f r m s the mean deflections are the time averaged values of the il and cf displacements over 20 stable cycles over the cylinder span the flexible cylinders oscillate around the mean deflection positions and the il mean deflection values a i l m e a n at different locations are also plotted in fig 9 while the cf mean deflection values are nearly 0 the envelope of the oscillating flexible cylinder shape over several vibration periods in the 4 simulation cases are plotted to show more clearly the oscillation amplitude characters over the cylinder span and the excited cylinder modes in the il and cf directions fig 9 shows that by covering the flexible circular cylinder with short fairing devices the mean deflection of the cylinder in the il direction can be reduced over the whole cylinder span this is in agreement with the simulation results in the 2d test cases as is shown in fig 6 a although the 6th and the 7th mode are excited in the il direction in the flexible cylinder cases and they are not covered in the 2d cases in fig 6 a the 6th and the 7th natural frequencies of the flexible cylinder are 13 62 hz and 16 96 hz while the corresponding reduced velocities are u r 3 08 and u r 2 48 which are not far from the smallest reduced velocity u r 3 98 that we studied in the 2d simulations therefore both the 2d and 3d simulations predict reduced il mean deflections when the cylinder is covered with short fairing the 3d simulation results in fig 9 further suggest that by covering either the upper or the lower half of the flexible cylinder with the short fairing the il mean deflection can be reduced to the level where the whole span of the cylinder is covered with the fairing device the oscillation amplitudes of the flexible cylinder is small in the il direction when compared with that in the cf direction in all of the simulation cases the il oscillation amplitudes along the span of the cylinder are below the level of 0 2 d while the cf vibration amplitudes varies between approximately 0 1 d 0 8 d figs 9 and 10 show that within each case no obvious discrepancies can be observed in the il oscillation amplitudes along the cylinder while the differences among the cf vibration amplitudes are prominent in case 1108 and fair1 the 7th order response is excited in the il direction and the 4th order response is prominent in the cf direction in case 1108 the cf oscillation amplitude is larger in the upper region of the cylinder z l 0 5 and the present simulation predicts similar oscillation amplitude characters as the experimental data in this case the simulation predicts the largest cf oscillation amplitude occurs at about z l 0 86 in case fair1 larger cf oscillation amplitude can also be observed in the upper half of the cylinder while the largest value of a c f r m s can be observed at around z l 0 65 in case fair2 and fair3 the 6th order and the 4th order responses are prominent in the il and cf direction respectively larger cf oscillation amplitude can be found near the bottom of the cylinder and in the upper half of the cylinder in case fair2 while in case fair3 the a c f r m s value is larger in the upper half of the cylinder similar with the cf oscillation behaviour in case 1108 4 3 2 oscillation frequency fast fourier transform fft is performed on the simulation results of il and cf oscillation displacements in the 4 cases fig 11 plots the fft results and table 4 summarizes the il and cf oscillation frequency in the four cases in case 1108 and fair1 fig 11 shows that the dominating oscillation modes in the il and cf directions are the 7th order and the 4th order respectively the il and cf oscillation frequencies are also similar in these two cases as is shown in table 4 in contrast in case fair2 and fair3 the 6th order response dominates the cylinder vibration in the il direction and so does the 4th order response in the cf direction the il and cf oscillation frequencies in the fair2 and fair3 cases are also close from the aspect of dominating response modes and oscillating frequencies the four studied cases can be separated into two groups one group contains 1108 and fair1 while the other contains fair2 and fair3 we begin the analysis of this phenomenon by comparing the cf oscillation frequencies in case 1108 and fair3 with the corresponding values in the 2d test cases shown in fig 6 c the cf vibration frequency in the bare circular cylinder case 1108 is supposed to show similar characters with the bare 2d circular cylinder test case in contrast in case fair3 where the flexible cylinder is fully covered with the short fairing the cf oscillation frequency should be similar with the value in the 2d fairing covered cylinder case since the 4th order response is excited in the flexible cylinders in the cf direction it is reasonable to check the test results of the 2d cases that utilizes the corresponding natural frequency namely at f n 7 96 and u r 5 28 fig 6 c shows that the 2d prediction of the bare cylinder cf oscillation frequency at u r 5 28 is slightly larger than the value of 7 96 hz while in the fairing covered case the value is smaller than the natural frequency around 5 97 hz although these values are different from the corresponding cf oscillation frequencies in the flexible cylinder cases 7 58 hz in case 1108 and 6 18 hz in case fair3 the 2d and 3d simulation results reach an agreement that by covering the bare cylinder with short fairing the cf oscillation amplitude will be reduced although it is not yet safe to say that the underlying mechanism of the cylinder oscillation in case fair3 is the galloping oscillation the short fairing do have prominent influence on the hydrodynamic character of the flexible cylinder then we move on to case fair1 and fair2 in which the short fairing covers half of the cylinder span it is deserve concern that despite the same coverage ratio of the fairing device in the two cases the excited response mode orders and the oscillation frequency show obvious discrepancy in case fair1 where the lower half of the cylinder is covered with the short fairing the il and cf responses have similar characters as those of the bare cylinder in contrast in case fair2 where the fairing covers the upper half of the cylinder the structural responses show the oscillation characters of the fairing fully covered cylinder we will later discuss the underlying mechanism of this phenomenon 4 3 3 travelling wave in cylinder response and energy transfer the time history data of the cylinder il and cf displacements along the cylinder span in the four cases are plotted in fig 12 since the experiment only provided the displacement data at eight locations on the flexible cylinder the high order response in the il direction cannot be properly captured however the 4th order cf oscillation can be clearly observed from the experimental data as well as the travelling wave character in the cf response the cf response in case 1108 shows a mixed travelling wave and standing wave character as is shown in fig 12 the travelling wave in the cf direction originates from the bottom of the cylinder z l 0 and propagates towards the cylinder top z l 1 0 fig 12 also shows that the present simulation predicts the same oscillation mode and the travelling wave direction only that less standing wave component in the cf response is predicted than in the experimental data as for the fairing covered cases although the 4th order cf response is prominent in all of these cases the travelling wave directions shows large discrepancies in order to study the travelling wave characters of the cylinder cf response in a clearer manner the cf oscillation phase angles θ y at the excited dominant frequencies over the span of the flexible cylinders are plotted in fig 13 a the θ y values come from the fourier transform analysis results of the corresponding cylinder displacement time history data the phase angles at z l 1 are set to be zero and the θ y at other locations are adjusted accordingly the travelling wave propagates from the regions with larger values of θ y towards the regions with smaller θ y as suggested by lucor et al 2006 in fourier transform analyse results constant phase angle along the cylinder span stands for standing wave response while strictly linear phase variation stands for pure travelling wave response therefore the θ y values of case 1108 in fig 13 a suggests strong travelling wave response combined with standing wave components this is in agreement with our observation in fig 12 in case fair1 the cf travelling wave originates from both the top and the bottom of the cylinder and propagates towards the region of 0 45 z l 0 75 in case fair2 the cf travelling wave originates from the region of 0 25 z l 0 5 and travel towards both the bottom and the top of the cylinder in case fair3 the wave travels from the bottom towards the top similar with the cf response in 1108 while the response in fair3 shows more standing wave characters the discussions on fluid structure energy transfer are based on the force coefficient in phase with the structure velocity which has been used in the work of bourguet et al 2011 dahl et al 2010 and hover et al 1998 in the cross flow direction the time averaged value of the force coefficient component in phase with the structural velocity is defined as 7 c l v z 1 t s t s c l z t v y z t d t 1 t s t s v y 2 z t d t when it is positive the energy is transferred from the flow to the structure while negative value suggests inverse energy transfer the values of c l v in the four cases are plotted over the cylinder span in fig 13 b the energy transfer directions in these cases show large discrepancies within different regions since the 4th order response is prominent in the four cases in the cf direction we divide the cylinder into four regions and use a span averaged value of c l v to represent the energy transfer direction within each region the span averaged c l v within each region is defined as 8 c l v i r i c l v z d z l i here r i stands for the i t h cylinder region along the span r 1 0 z l 0 25 r 2 0 25 z l 0 5 r 3 0 5 z l 0 75 r 4 0 75 z l 1 and l i is the corresponding region length the c l v i values in each case are summarized in table 5 by comparing the data in this table with the cf oscillation phase angle in fig 13 a one can find that within the regions where the travelling wave moves towards the other regions the c l v i values are usually positive in contrast in the regions that only receive the travelling wave from the other regions the corresponding c l v i values are negative this suggests that the travelling wave propagates from the regions where the flexible cylinder receives the flow field energy towards the regions where the energy in the cylinder is damped by the surrounding fluid we may explain the variations in the cf oscillation amplitudes using the following theory since the driving force of the flexible cylinder oscillation comes from the flow field the local vibration severity can be explained by tracing the energy transport direction as the structural response travelling wave propagates from the energy input region towards the energy output region it is reasonable to assume that the energy is transported along with the wave we also notice that within each case the absolute value of the total positive c l v i is 2 5 times larger than that of the total negative c l v i which suggests that the flow field energy input is larger than the structural energy damped by the fluid thus the received energy within the negative c l v i regions may exceed the local energy damping by the fluid and results in large oscillation amplitude similar as the relation between the structural oscillation amplitude and the positive excitation suggested by khalak and williamson 1999 the cf oscillation amplitude distribution along the span in the studied cases can be correctly explained with this theory in case 1108 the travelling wave propagates from the bottom region r 1 towards the top region r 4 the c l v i values in r 1 r 2 and r 3 are positive while it is negative in r 4 according to our assumption the structural oscillation energy is transported from r 1 r 3 to r 4 and the oscillation amplitude in r 4 should be large this is in agreement with the data plotted in figs 9 and 10 where the cylinder cf oscillation amplitude is larger in region r 4 when compared with r 1 r 3 using the same method we can explain the larger cf oscillation amplitudes within region r 3 in case fair1 region r 1 and r 4 in case fair2 and region r 3 and r 4 in case fair3 the discrepancies between the cylinder oscillation frequencies may also be explained with this theory in the earlier analysis we have found that in case 1108 where the flexible circular cylinder is not covered with short fairing and in case fair3 where the flexible cylinder is fully covered with short fairing the structural responses are dominated by the hydrodynamic characters of the bare circular cylinder cross section and the fairing covered cylinder cross section respectively because of the different dominating cross sections the structural vibration frequencies and the dominating oscillation modes in the two cases show large discrepancies in the other two cases fair1 and fair2 only half of the cylinder span is covered with the short fairing the cross section that dominates the structural hydrodynamic character in each case is different due to the discrepancies in the travelling wave direction and energy transfer characters according to our assumption on energy transport in case fair1 the structural energy is transported towards region r 3 from the other regions by the travelling wave the accumulated energy and the resulting large oscillation amplitude within this region then dominates the whole cylinder oscillation characters that is the oscillation frequencies and the excited vibration modes are decided by the cross section of the flexible cylinder within region r 3 since the cylinder cross section in r 3 in case fair1 is the bare circular cylinder the oscillation frequencies and therefore the dominating vibration modes in the il and cf directions resemble those in the bare flexible cylinder case 1108 in contrast in case fair2 the structural energy is transported from region r 2 towards both the bottom and the top of the cylinder while it is also transported from region r 3 towards the top region r 4 the accumulated energy and general oscillation amplitude in region r 3 and r 4 is therefore larger than in r 1 and r 2 since the cross section in r 3 and r 4 is the fairing covered circular cylinder the oscillation frequency and excited vibration modes of the flexible cylinder dominated by this cross section resembles those in case fair3 where the whole cylinder span is covered with the short fairing 4 3 4 fatigue damage the fatigue damage along the cylinder span is evaluated using a damage index which has been used in the work of many researchers jhingran et al 2012 wang and xiao 2016 it takes into account the influence of response amplitudes frequencies and modal curvatures the damage index is written as 9 i d f z σ r m s 3 where f z is the zero crossing frequency of the local cylinder strain and σ r m s is the strain rms value the power of three in the equation assumes a slope of three in the s n curve this index is an effective fatigue damage quantifier that is independent of stress concentration factor material young s module or s n curve intercept the experimental data contains the cylinder surface strain time series signal while in the present numerical simulation the flexible cylinder is simplified as a tensioned beam and the surface strain is calculated from curvatures as suggested by vandiver and peoples 2003 10 σ d 2 2 v i z 2 as previously stated d is the cylinder diameter v i is the cylinder displacement in the i th direction x or y and z is the cylinder span wise direction the damage indexes along the cylinder span from the experimental data of case 1108 and the present simulation results of the four cases are plotted in fig 14 the simulation predicted fatigue damage indexes in case 1108 are generally in good agreement with the experimental data according to eqs 9 and 10 the damage index is influenced by the response frequency oscillation amplitude and vibration mode the present simulations predict different oscillation frequencies and vibration modes in the fairing covered cases and the corresponding fatigue damage in each case show different characters in case fair1 the oscillation frequency and vibration modes are similar with those in case 1108 and the resulting fatigue damage are at the same level due to the different cf oscillation amplitude distribution between the two cases the i d behaviours in the cf direction also shows some discrepancies since the oscillation frequencies in case fair2 and fair3 are smaller than the corresponding values in case 1108 and fair1 the fatigue damage over the cylinder span is generally smaller as well as is shown in fig 14 the discrepancies between the il oscillation frequencies is larger than that in the cf direction and more obvious gap can be observed in the il fatigue damage between the two group of cases thus by attaching the flexible cylinder with rigid short fairing device the cylinder fatigue damage may be reduced as the fairing devices are installed with proper arrangements 4 3 5 vorticity field characters the overview of the vorticity fields in the simulation cases are presented in fig 15 unlike in the 2d test cases it is difficult to identify certain vortex shedding modes while irregular transitional vortex shedding patterns are prominent in most span wise flexible cylinder regions however typical vortex shedding modes still can be observed at certain bare cylinder locations where the local travelling wave is not prominent and obvious vortex reattachment onto the short fairing tail can also be observed in the fairing covered regions the complex vortex structures in the wake of the cylinder may also suggest the existence of the dual resonance fft analysis is performed on the lift force coefficient data along the span of the flexible cylinders in the four cases and the results are plotted in fig 16 in the four cases the power spectral density psd values of c l at the cf oscillation frequencies are prominent in most span wise regions it is also obvious that besides the cf oscillation frequency component higher frequency components can also be observed and the frequency value equals the sum of the cf and il oscillation frequencies in each case the higher order frequency component in the lift force suggests that the dual resonance phenomenon can also be found in the flexible cylinder cases just as predicted by the 2d test cases although the dual resonance may lead to complex vortex structures as is shown in the 2d snapshots in fig 7 it still cannot explain the span wise variation in the vortex shedding modes in the flexible cylinder cases in flexible cylinder cases even when single mode oscillations are excited in both the il and cf directions the local cylinder oscillation amplitudes and trajectory shapes are different over the cylinder span when travelling wave becomes prominent in the responses the phase difference between the il and cf displacement over the cylinder span show more discrepancies resulting in a variety of oscillation trajectories along the cylinder this may be the reason for the intermittent and transitional vortex shedding patterns that can be observed in the present flexible cylinder cases we notice from fig 13 a that although the cf responses in the four cases are in mixed travelling standing wave form strong standing wave character can be found within each r i i 1 4 region which may lead to identifiable vortex shedding patterns in fig 17 we plot the relatively stable vortex structures within each r i region in the four cases it is deserve noting that all of the flow field snapshots are taken where the cf oscillation amplitude is relatively large within each r i region the c l v at these locations are found to have the same signs of the corresponding c l v i values which suggests that these snapshots can reflect the general vortex shedding characters related with the local fluid structure energy transfer in the region in contrast at locations where the cf oscillation amplitudes approximates 0 the vortex shedding patterns are in the 2s mode 2 single vortices off the back rear of the bluff body per cycle of body motion as can be observed in the flow around a fixed circular cylinder since the 2s vortex shedding pattern provides little insights into the fluid structure interaction characters in the flexible cylinders they are not plotted in fig 17 in case 1108 two types of vortex shedding patterns can be observed in the four regions in region r 1 and r 2 the cf oscillation amplitudes at the selected locations are relatively small when compared with those in r 3 and r 4 a y d 0 3 in r 1 and r 2 while the c l v values are positive same as c l v 1 and c l v 2 a p s vortex shedding mode is prominent in which 1 vortex pair and 1 single vortex are formed during one cylinder oscillation cycle as can be seen in the mark in the vorticity contour in fig 17 1108 r 2 in region r 3 the cf vibration amplitude at the presented location reaches a y d 0 7 and the c l v value is also positive same as c l v 3 the vortex shedding is in 2p mode in which two pairs of vortices are formed during one body motion cycle as is marked in fig 17 1108 r 4 in region r 4 the cf oscillation amplitude at the presented location further increases to a y d 1 0 and the local c l v is negative same as c l v 4 the 2p mode is still prominent while the distance between the vortex pairs are larger than in r 3 the 2p vortex shedding modes in region r 3 and r 4 are similar with the 2p mode in the 2d test case in fig 7 a while the p s mode in region r 1 and r 2 cannot be predicted by the 2d test simulations according to the summarize of the forced vibration experiment data by williamson and govardhan 2004 the p s mode can only be excited by forced circular cylinder vibration in free vibration cases the p s mode if it ever occurs will quickly evolve into other vortex shedding patterns since the p s mode results in strong fluid structure energy transfer while in free vibration cases the fluid excitation is approximately zero as for the 2p modes in r 3 and r 4 the vortex shedding modes and the corresponding body motion amplitudes as well as the c l v values are also in good agreement with the forced vibration experimental data on the rigid circular cylinder williamson and govardhan 2004 at the present reduced velocity u r 5 28 calculated based on the excited 4th order natural frequency with cf oscillation amplitude a y d 0 7 the 2p mode is prominent in the forced vibration experiment and the measured fluid excitation c l v is positive when the cf motion amplitude increases to a y d 1 0 the 2p mode still can be observed while the fluid excitation c l v is negative these phenomenon are in agreement with our observation in the r 3 and r 4 regions in the present simulation results therefore it is safe to say that in flexible cylinder cases where the fluid structure energy transfer is prominent the local structural motion the vortex shedding mode and the energy transfer characters are in agreement with the corresponding forced vibration data rather than the free vibration data on rigid cylinders in the fairing covered flexible cylinder cases similar vortex shedding characters can also be observed in the bare cylinder regions in r 3 and r 4 regions in case fair1 the cross section of the structure is the bare circular cylinder at the presented location in r 4 the local c l v and the c l v 4 are both positive the local cf oscillation amplitude is small a y d 0 3 and the p s mode is prominent in the wake at the selected location in r 3 the local c l v and the c l v 4 are both negative the local cf oscillation amplitude is large a y d 1 05 and the 2p mode is prominent the vortex shedding modes in the fairing covered region r 1 and r 2 are quite different from those in the bare cylinder regions in the two fairing covered regions the local c l v values at the presented locations are positive same as the corresponding c l v 1 and c l v 2 and the cf oscillation amplitudes are a y d 0 53 and a y d 0 75 respectively the vortex shedding structures at the two locations are in a 2c mode in which two corotating vortices are formed every half structure vibration cycle as is marked in fig 17 fair1 r 1 in case fair2 the vortex shedding mode in the bare cylinder region show similar characters as in the previous two cases at the presented location in region r 1 the c l v value is negative same as c l v 1 the cf oscillation amplitude is a y d 1 04 and the vortex shedding is in 2p mode in region r 2 the c l v value at the selected location and the c l v 2 are both negative the cf oscillation amplitude is a y d 0 27 and the p s vortex shedding mode is prominent in the fairing covered region r 3 and r 4 the vortex shedding modes cf oscillation amplitudes and the fluid excitation parameters are different the c l v value at the presented location in region r 3 is positive and the cf oscillation amplitude is a y d 0 85 while the 2c vortex shedding mode is prominent this is the same as the vortex shedding mode at the positive c l v locations in the fairing covered regions in case fair1 in region r 4 the c l v value at the presented location is negative and the cf oscillation amplitude is a y d 0 97 the vortices in the wake shows a 2p pattern although the distance between the vortex pairs are smaller than that in the bare cylinder regions this discrepancy may reflect the influence of the short fairing tail on the flow field structures in case fair3 where the flexible cylinder is fully covered with the short fairing similar vortex shedding pattern characters can be observed as in the fairing covered regions in case fair1 and fair2 in region r 1 and r 2 where the cf oscillation amplitude is relatively small and the span averaged c l v values are positive the 2c mode is prominent in region r 3 and r 4 where the cf oscillation amplitudes are larger and the c l v i values are negative the 2p vortex shedding mode can be captured at the selected locations the 2d test simulation with the short fairing covered cylinder still cannot predict the vortex shedding patterns in the flexible cylinder cases this is also because in the 2d free vibration rigid cylinder cases the fluid structural energy transfer is approximately 0 while in the flexible cylinder cases the energy transfer can be prominent 4 4 conclusion 1 by covering the flexible cylinder with fixed short fairings the il mean deflection values can be reduced over the whole cylinder span by either covering the upper or the lower half of the flexible cylinder the il mean deflection can be reduced to the level where the whole span of the cylinder is covered with the short fairing 2 the span averaged cf oscillation amplitude is slightly increased by covering the flexible cylinder with the fixed short fairing however the increment in the averaged oscillation amplitude in the flexible cylinder cases are not as large as the discrepancy in the cf oscillation amplitudes of the 2d free vibration viv and galloping therefore from the aspect of oscillation amplitude the fixed short fairing does not induce much stronger galloping oscillation in the flexible cylinder the cf oscillation amplitude distribution along the cylinder span however are heavily influenced by the location and coverage ratio of the fairing device 3 attaching the flexible cylinder with fixed short fairing would reduce the il and cf oscillation frequencies and therefore influence the excited response modes we find that by covering the upper half of the cylinder with the fixed short fairing the structural oscillation frequencies resemble those in the case where the cylinder is fully covered with fairing in contrast by covering the lower half of the cylinder with fairing the oscillation frequencies resemble those in the bare cylinder case this discrepancy can be explained with the travelling wave and energy transfer characters in different cases 4 the travelling waves in the cylinder cf responses are found to propagate from the regions where the flow energy transfers into the structure towards regions where the structural energy is damped by the fluid based on this observation we assume the structural kinetic energy is transported along with the travelling wave then we can explain the larger oscillation amplitudes in the structural energy damping regions and the smaller oscillation amplitudes in the structural energy input regions we can also explain the discrepancies in the oscillation frequencies in the studied cases with this theory in the case where the lower half of the cylinder is covered with fairing the accumulated energy and general oscillation amplitude in the bare cylinder region is larger than in the fairing covered region the bare cylinder cross section then dominates the hydrodynamic characters of the flexible cylinder and the oscillation frequencies as well as the excited vibration modes resemble those in the bare cylinder case in contrast in the case where the upper half of the cylinder is covered with fairing the accumulated energy and general oscillation amplitude in the fairing covered region is larger than in the bare cylinder region then the fairing covered cross section dominates the hydrodynamic characters of the flexible cylinder and the oscillation frequencies as well as the excited vibration modes resemble those in the fully fairing covered case 5 when the fixed short fairings are properly attaching onto the flexible cylinder the structural fatigue damage can be reduced due to the smaller oscillation frequencies and lower response modes which result in smaller curvature 6 intermittent and transitional vortex shedding structures are common in the wake of the flexible cylinder however at locations where the standing wave character is prominent identifiable vortex shedding modes can be found the typical vortex shedding modes the oscillation amplitudes and the energy transfer characters within each standing wave regions are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding forced vibration rigid cylinder experimental data this suggests that instead of the free vibration rigid cylinder data in which the fluid structure energy transfer is approximately 0 the forced vibration rigid cylinder data can better reflect the local oscillation characters of the flexible cylinder cases where the energy transfer is prominent the p s and 2p vortex shedding modes are found to be related with the fluid structure energy transfer in the bare cylinder region in contrast the 2c and 2p modes are in relation with the energy transfer in the fairing covered region 7 in the present work some new findings are based on the numerical studies on flexible cylinders and cannot be achieved by only studying the rigid cylinder cases first although the galloping oscillation is prominent in the rigid cylinder cases at large reduced velocities the short fairings do not induce strong galloping oscillations in the flexible cylinders the 4th order cf responses are excited in the flexible cylinder cases and the reduced velocities calculated using the corresponding natural frequencies are smaller than the values at which strong galloping is prominent in the rigid cylinder cases second the different short fairing setups on the flexible cylinders influence the travelling wave directions and the corresponding local fluid structure energy transport distributions which eventually lead to the differences in the flexible cylinder oscillation amplitude distributions the response frequencies and mode orders credit authorship contribution

20787,following the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b super rogue waves up to the fifth order are simulated in a numerical wave tank under the framework of navier stokes equations for the first time the numerical wave tank solves 2d navier stokes equations by using the finite difference method and simulates free surface flows by the volume of fluid method the simulation results are verified against the theory of high order rational solutions of the cubic schrödinger equation the features of localized velocity and pressure field are investigated by making comparison against those of standard 5 order stokes waves it is found that the flow field patterns of super rogue waves resemble those of equivalent stokes waves while notable quantitative difference can be observed keywords super rogue waves numerical wave tank velocity field pressure field stokes waves 1 introduction rogue waves are giant ocean waves which are much higher than the typical waves in a sea state they occur from nowhere and disappear without any trace hence pose great threat to ships and offshore structures rogue waves are hard to track as their durations are usually short they can happen in deep and shallow water with or without the influence of current and can be observed in bad storms or normal sea states the diversity of occurrence environment indicates that rogue waves may be caused by different reasons which is why so far a variety of models have been proposed to explain their generation mechanisms in the last decades numerous researches have been performed on rogue waves including their physical mechanisms numerical and experimental simulation methods prediction methods and wave structure interactions comprehensive reviews of these works can be found in kharif and pelinovsky 2003 dysthe et al 2008 and onorato et al 2013 recently more and more sea observational data has been studied based on which some forecast methods of rogue waves are proposed for instance gramstad et al 2018a investigated the occurrence of extreme and rogue waves in the datasets measured from sensors situated at the ekofisk field in the north sea the resulting statistical properties of wave heights and wave crests were analyzed together with the possible relations between the occurrence of rogue waves and spectral characteristics of the sea states through analyzing surface elevation records from two locations in the northeast pacific gemmrich and thomson 2017 found that rogue waves were most commonly located in the center of wave groups and that random superposition of nonlinear waves is sufficient to explain the observations of individual rogue waves cattrell et al 2018 collated and analyzed the largest dataset of single point field measurements from surface following wave buoys to search for predictors of rogue wave occurrence it is found that frequency of occurrence of rogue waves is not spatially uniform and each location is likely to have its own unique sensitivities which increase in the coastal seas slunyaev 2018 proposed a method for the analysis of groups of unidirectional waves within the framework of nonlinear schrödinger equation which can be used for extreme wave prediction hadjihosseini et al 2016 presented a multi point statistical method of data analysis to allow the grasping of extreme rogue wave events in a satisfactory statistical manner doong et al 2018 developed a warning model for coastal freak wave occurrences based on an artificial neural network seven parameters significant wave height peak period wind speed wave groupiness factor benjamin feir index kurtosis and wind wave direction misalignment are involved in the model bayındır 2016 adopted wavelet transformation to predict rogue waves and found that the triangular wavelet spectra of the rogue waves can be detected at early stages of the development of rogue waves in a chaotic wave field in deep water rogue waves are usually modeled within the framework of the nonlinear schrödinger equation nlse and its extensions such as the modified nonlinear schrödinger equation mnlse for instance akhmediev et al 2009a b numerically calculated chaotic waves of the focusing nlse starting with a plane wave modulated by relatively weak random waves and found that rogue waves could be described in terms of the collision of akhmediev breathers calini and schober 2017 investigated jonswap rogue waves using the inverse spectral theory of the periodic nlse and showed that the developing sea state with typical jonswap initial data could be well approximated by the first few dominant modes of the nonlinear spectrum and can be described in terms of a 2 or 3 phase periodic nls solution wang and balachandran 2018 investigated the formation of extreme waves in unidirectional sea by considering a stochastic model based on the interaction and phase coupling amongst modified envelope soliton solutions to the nlse gramstad et al 2018b studied wave statistical properties and occurrence of extreme and rogue waves in extensive set of crossing sea states with various spectral shapes and crossing angles sometimes the euler equations are solved to account for the full nonlinearity of the free surface condition toffoli et al 2010 presented a comprehensive analysis of statistics properties in jonswap sea states including the probability of occurrence of extreme waves within a variety of random directional wave fields by means of numerical simulations based on euler model and tests in a three dimensional basin toffoli et al 2008 investigated the occurrence of rogue waves through direct numerical simulations of the euler equations and found that both the upper and lower tails of the probability density function for the surface elevation significantly deviated from the commonly used second order wave theory toffoli et al 2011 analyzed the effects of crossing sea states on the occurrence of rogue waves by three dimensional experiments and high order numerical simulations based on the euler model slunyaev et al 2017 studied the dynamics of intense solitary wave groups of collinear surface waves by means of numerical simulations of the euler equations and laboratory experiments considering the process of solitary wave generation reflection from a wall and collisions wang et al 2019 investigated the influence of different parameters on focusing wave properties in a numerical wave tank with a fully nonlinear potential flow model adcock and taylor 2016 compared the broad banded modified nonlinear schrödinger equation model with full potential flow theory in simulating focusing unidirectional wave groups under deep water and observed modeling inaccuracy under certain circumstances of all the models of rogue waves the most widely accepted and studied one may be the modulation instability and its extension the soliton and breather solutions to the nlse the former gives good explanation on the sudden occurrence and short duration of rogue waves in a nonlinear sense onorato et al 2006 dyachenko and zakharov 2005 and the latter further gives specific expressions of wave surface which can be treated as prototypes of rogue waves in simulation of rogue wave structure interactions shrira and geogjaev 2010 hu et al 2015b the peregrine breather proposed by peregrine 1983 has been demonstrated to be an effective model of rogue waves it can be generated by using a time reversal method chabchoub and fink 2014 ducrozet et al 2020 in laboratories and has been proved to be able to exist in random sea states wang et al 2018 by performing the darboux transformation upon nlse the peregrine breather can be expanded into a hierarchy of high order rational breather solutions dubard et al 2010 which all present localization both in time and in space the existence of higher order rational solutions or super rogue waves up to the fifth order has been demonstrated in a physical wave tank chabchoub et al 2012b slunyaev et al 2013 simulated super rogue waves by solving the mnlse and the fully nonlinear potential euler equations lu et al 2016 adopted a fourth order split step pseudo spectral method to solve the mnlse and investigated the energy structure of super rogue waves alberello et al 2018 studied the velocity distribution of breaking rogue waves by experiments and evaluated the applicability of various methods of velocity prediction the present work simulates super rogue waves up to the fifth order in a numerical wave tank nwt solving navier stokes equations the simulation parameters are determined according to the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b and the simulation results are verified against the theory of high order rational solutions of nlse since existing researches in super rogue waves mainly focus on the propagation of wave groups and energy by analyzing surface elevations this paper concentrates on the localized flow fields of super rogue waves which are crucial for the study of wave structure interaction problems the localized velocity and pressure fields are analyzed by making comparison against those of 5 order stokes waves the simulation results have the potential application of investigating wave loads and structure safety under super rogue waves the content of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a short review on the theoretical background of super rogue waves and section 3 introduces the implementation of the nwt and the parameters of simulation since there is no innovation in section 2 and 3 we make them short and give necessary references the simulation results are analyzed in section 4 which involves the discussion of wave surface as well as the velocity and pressure fields in the vicinity of the maximum crests of super rogue waves the main conclusions of the paper are reported in section 5 2 theoretical background of super rogue waves the one dimensional nlse which describes the evolution of weakly nonlinear wave packets in deep water can be written as mei 1989 1 i a t c g a x ω 0 8 k 0 2 2 a x 2 ω 0 k 0 2 2 a 2 a 0 where x and t are the spatial and time coordinates respectively a is the wave envelope i is the imaginary unit ω 0 and k 0 represent the angular frequency and the wave number of the carrier waves and c g is the group velocity the deep water dispersion relation is ω 0 2 g k 0 with which the group velocity can be written as c g ω 0 2 k 0 by applying a simple variable substitution eq 1 can be converted into the standard nlse as follows 2 i ψ t ψ x x 2 ψ 2 ψ 0 where t ω 0 t 8 x x c g t k 0 and ψ 2 k 0 a the j order rational solution of eq 2 can be written in a general form as akhmediev et al 2009a b 3 ψ j ψ 0 1 j g j i h j d j exp 2 i ψ 0 2 t where ψ 0 is the constant background amplitude g j h j and d j are polynomials with respect to x and t in particular the 1 order rational solution also known as the peregrine breather is given by g 1 1 h 1 16 ψ 0 2 t and d 1 1 4 ψ 0 2 x 2 16 ψ 0 4 t 2 with the growth of order j the expressions of g j h j and d j become cumbersome quickly by far the expressions of the 8 order rational breather have been derived gaillard 2012b yet only breathers with orders not greater than 5 have been observed in water waves chabchoub et al 2012b the profiles of super rogue waves are illustrated in fig 1 detailed expressions of the breather solutions can be found in gaillard 2011 for order 1 to 3 and in gaillard 2012a for order 4 or higher which are not copied in the present work the surface elevation of various nonlinear orders can be expressed as chabchoub et al 2012b onorato et al 2013 4 η i re a x t e i k 0 x ω 0 t 5 η i i re a x t e i k 0 x ω 0 t 1 2 k 0 a 2 x t e 2 i k 0 x ω 0 t 6 η i i i re 1 1 8 k 0 2 a x t 2 a x t e i θ 1 2 k 0 a 2 x t e 2 i θ 3 8 k 0 2 a 3 x t e 3 i θ where η i η i i and η i i i are 1 order 2 order and 3 order surface elevations θ k 0 x ω 0 t where ω 0 ω 0 1 k 0 2 a x t 2 2 it is worthy of noting that the order of nonlinearity in the wave surface elevation is different from the order of the rational breather the former represents the order of stokes wave components and the latter the number of times of the darboux transformation matveev and salle 1991 required to obtain the rational breather 3 numerical method the simulations are performed in a 2d nwt developed in our previous study hu et al 2015a since the numerical method of the nwt is conventional and has no novelty only brief introduction is presented in this section the nwt solves navier stokes equations of incompressible newtonian fluid and adopts a vof youngs method youngs 1982 for free surface reconstruction the governing equations are 7 u k x k 0 8 u j t u k u j x k 1 ρ p x j g j υ x k u j x k u k x j 9 f t u k f x k 0 eqs 7 9 are the continuity equation the momentum equation and the fluid volume transportation equation respectively subscript k and j are index tensor notations and the summation convention is adopted u j is the velocity vector component p is pressure g j is the gravitational acceleration vector component υ is the coefficient of kinematic viscosity and f is the fluid volume function which is used in the vof method the pressure gradient term and diffusion term on the right side of eq 8 are discretized with the central difference scheme cds the nonlinear convention term on the left side of eq 8 is solved with a mixed cds and upwind difference scheme uds time derivative is discretized with a forward euler scheme a two step projection method is adopted to solve the velocity pressure equation which first calculates a temporary velocity field and then modifies it by solving the pressure field on the basis of the mass conservation equation a stress boundary condition is applied to the free surface boundary which indicates no shear stress and a constant normal stress i e air pressure on the free surface a non slip wall condition is used on the tank bottom and the right border of the nwt in the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b waves were generated by a single flap wave producing paddle activated by a hydraulic cylinder in our numerical simulations a wave generator boundary condition is assigned to the left border of the nwt which is an inlet boundary allowing wave entry from outside the pressure and velocity of the inlet boundary is determined by p p t h e o r y and u j u j t h e o r y where p t h e o r y and u j t h e o r y are the pressure and velocity predicted by the nlse theory to simulate super rogue waves the pressure and velocity are given by 10 p t h e o r y ρ g z ρ g re a x i t cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x i ω 0 t 11 u 1 t h e o r y re a x i t g k 0 ω 0 cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x i ω 0 t 12 u 2 t h e o r y re i a x i t g k 0 ω 0 sinh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x i ω 0 t where x i is the horizontal coordinate of the inlet boundary and a x t is given by the breathers solutions of the nlse a wave absorption zone is placed at the right end of the nwt a conserved wave absorption method is utilized to dissipate wave energy and meanwhile to absorb the additional fluid volume brought by rogue waves and unbalanced mass transportation during each period of wave generation detailed information of the wave generation and absorption methods can be found in hu et al 2015a the schematic diagram of the nwt is shown in fig 2 the size of the nwt depends on the wave parameters of numerical simulation which are selected according to the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b and listed in table 1 in all the simulations the length of the nwt is selected as l 8 λ and the water depth h λ 2 where λ is the wavelength the depth of the nwt is h h 1 5 η max where η max is the maximum surface elevation of the super rogue wave the grid size ranges from 0 013 λ to 0 016 λ in the horizontal direction and from h max 15 to h max 8 in the vertical direction where h max denotes the peak wave height the size of time step is smaller than t p 800 in all the simulations where t p is the period of the carrier waves the focusing positions of the rogue waves are 4 λ from the wave generator the length of the absorption region is close to λ 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface elevation fig 3 shows the surface elevation normalized against the background wave amplitude of super rogue waves measured at the focusing positions in fig 3 the red lines refer to the theoretical surface elevations of the first order nonlinearity given by eq 4 although distinctions exist the simulation results agree well with the theoretical ones in a global sense one can observe that the entire wave group splits into a bunch of wave packets during the formation of rogue waves this phenomenon is induced by sideband waves drawing energy from the carrier and growing into large amplitude waves which is a typical nonlinear focusing effect known as modulation instability the number of wave packets n p is related to the order of the breather solution j by n p 2 j 1 and the maximum crest height of the rogue wave equals 2j 1 times the carrier wave amplitude based on the analytical solutions of the rational breathers the maximum crest heights of the simulation results are found to be smaller than those predicted by the breather theory which is shown in fig 4 the same phenomenon has also been observed in slunyaev et al 2013 where super rogue waves were simulated within the framework of the mnlse and the fully nonlinear euler equations the deviation is owing to the high order nonlinearity neglected by the nlse another difference between the numerical and theoretical results is that the simulated surface histories present asymmetric shapes which never occur in the theory the asymmetry also happened in the simulation results of slunyaev et al 2013 and lu et al 2016 and the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b this is another effect of high order nonlinearity as is pointed out by slunyaev et al 2013 the degree of asymmetry becomes remarkable if the central region of the packet contains only a few wave oscillations it should be mentioned that the steepness of the last case of table 1 happens to equal the threshold steepness for wave breaking given by chabchoub et al 2012b yet no wave breaking occurs during our numerical simulation nevertheless the maximum surface height of fig 3 i is clearly smaller than the theoretically predicted value and palpable asymmetry can be observed these phenomena can be also observed in the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b which are the typical signs of wave breaking about to happen fig 5 shows the fourier transformation results upon the simulated wave surface histories using the fast fourier transform fft method a hierarchy of peaks with declining amplitudes can be found in fig 5 the first and largest peak represents the basic carrier wave followed by a series of smaller peaks which denote high order stokes wave components in the current simulations 3 order stokes nonlinearity is enough to describe the surface oscillation and higher order stokes components can be neglected in subplot b of fig 5 two dips with a triangle shaped crest can be observed at the basic peak this corresponds to the triangular spectra of the envelopes of super rogue waves which has already been reported by akhmediev et al 2011 and proved by the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012a detailed analysis on the surface elevations and the global energy evolution of super rogue waves has already been done in previous studies such as chabchoub et al 2012a lu et al 2016 bayındır 2016 wang et al 2018 and liao et al 2018 therefore we do not repeat these studies in the present works 4 2 velocity fig 6 shows the localized velocity fields under the maximum crests of the super rogue waves for ease of comparison the velocity fields of 5 order stokes waves with identical wavelengths and wave heights are also drawn in fig 6 one can observe large horizontal velocities underneath the wave crests by contrast the horizontal velocities are small and in the opposite direction in the vicinity of wave troughs despite the velocity fields of super rogue waves and the corresponding stokes waves are similar in the global sense which supports the theory of breather rogue waves explained as driven by the amplitude modulation of stokes waves distinctions can be found in the streamlines and sectional velocity distributions fig 7 shows the streamlines of four super rogue waves under their maximum crests with comparison against those of the 5 order stokes waves since the central wave packet of the rogue waves contain a number of wave oscillations in subplot a c and g of fig 7 the streamlines in these subplots show good symmetry however the streamlines show palpable asymmetric shapes in fig 7 e due to fewer wave oscillations in the central wave packet the asymmetry can be also reflected by the surface elevation shown in fig 3 g by comparison the streamlines of stokes waves show no significant signs of asymmetry another difference is that the streamlines look blunt at their lowest points for the super rogue waves and sharp for the stokes waves in other words the streamlines of the super rogue waves exhibit u shapes yet those of the stokes waves tend to be in v shapes for a u shape streamline both the top and the bottom are wide for a v shape streamline the top is wide yet the bottom is narrow in other words the width ratio l d l u in fig 8 is large for a u shape streamline and small for a v shape streamline the difference between streamline shapes indicates the ratio of the vertical velocity against the horizontal should be different for the two kinds of waves in order to reveal this difference four typical cross sections shown in fig 9 are selected fig 10 shows the distributions of the horizontal and vertical velocities denoted as u and v at the cross sections illustrated in fig 9 the velocities of super rogue waves and 5 order stokes waves are drawn in the same figure and a linear prediction is given for ease of comparison it is found that the velocities of the two kinds of waves show similar distribution shapes yet clear quantitative difference exists the velocities of super rogue waves are close to those of the stokes waves at enough depth however deviations can be found nearby the free surface the velocities mainly in vertical direction of the super rogue waves at wave nodes section 3 4 are smaller than those of the stokes waves the absolutes of the velocities mainly in horizontal direction of super rogue waves at the wave troughs are also smaller than those of the stokes waves however the velocities of super rogue waves can be much larger than those of stokes waves at regions underneath the maximum wave crests the same phenomenon can be also found in the experiment of alberello et al 2018 in which the velocities below the crest of a breaking rogue wave were much greater than the results of a linear prediction considering the fact that the phenomenon happens in the fluid domain above the still water line swl and that rogue waves often bring severe green water and impact to marine structures the comparison indicates that super rogue waves may be more dangerous than the stokes waves even if they possess the same wavelength and wave height to give a quantitative comparative study on the velocities of super rogue waves and stokes waves we introduce a group of parameters which are defined as u r j j 1 2 horizontal velocities of super rogue waves at cross section j u s j j 1 2 horizontal velocities of 5 order stokes waves at cross section j v r j j 3 4 vertical velocities of super rogue waves at cross section j v s j j 3 4 vertical velocities of 5 order stokes waves at cross section j u e j u r j u s j j 1 2 v e j v r j v s j j 3 4 u 0 phase speeds of 5 order stokes waves ε p steepness at the highest crests of super rogue waves i e 2 j 1 k 0 a 0 where j is the order of the breather solution with the results of all the 9 simulation cases fig 11 compares the mean sectional velocities of super rogue waves and those of 5 order stokes waves it is found the former can be well approximated by the latter at all the 4 cross sections illustrated in fig 9 this again verifies the fact that the velocity fields of super rogue waves resemble those of stokes waves fig 12 shows the change of velocity differences between super rogue waves and 5 order stokes waves with respect to the maximum velocities of 5 order stokes waves the former is described by the 2 norm of u e j and v e j and the latter as the maxima of u s 1 in fig 12 the velocity differences between super rogue waves and stokes waves increase with the velocity of stokes waves moreover u e j and v e j can be treated as linear functions of max u s 1 fig 13 displays the relative velocity differences between super rogue waves and stokes waves defined by u e j max u r j and v e j max v r j changing with the degree of wave nonlinearity measured by ε p one can observe that relative velocity differences increase with the growth of steepness in the global sense and the relationship can be roughly approximated by quadratic functions as is shown in fig 14 the maximum velocities of super rogue waves also increase with those of the corresponding 5 order stokes waves and the relationship seems to be nonlinear 4 3 pressure fig 15 contrasts the dynamic pressure fields of super rogue waves at the highest crests with those of the 5 order stokes waves to achieve a good comparison result hydrostatic pressure has been excluded from fig 15 for both kinds of waves the maximum dynamic pressures occur at the wave crests and the minimum at the troughs as a whole the pressure fields of super rogue waves and stokes waves are similar yet some local discrepancies can still be observed for example the maximum pressure in subplot e of fig 15 is smaller than that in subplot f and the negative pressures at the troughs of super rogue waves are larger than those of stokes waves before further discussion the following parameters are introduced p r j j 1 2 dynamic pressures of super rogue waves at cross section j p s j j 1 2 dynamic pressures of 5 order stokes waves at cross section j η max heights of the highest crests of the super rogue waves η 2 heights of the second highest crests of the super rogue waves fig 16 compares the vertical distributions of p r j and p s j one can find the maxima of both p r 1 and p s 1 always happen at swl started from swl p r 1 and p s 1 decline linearly as z increases and exponentially as z decreases p r 2 and p s 2 reach their minima on the wave surface and increase exponentially as z decreases therefore the pressure distributions of super rogue waves and stokes waves show similar patterns however the absolute value of p r j is smaller than that of p s j and p r 1 p s 1 seems to be smaller than p r 2 p s 2 under most circumstances fig 17 displays the extreme dynamic pressures of all the 9 simulation cases the extreme dynamic pressures of super rogue waves are compared against those of the corresponding 5 order stokes waves and a linear relation can be drawn this suggests the extreme pressures of super rogue waves may be approximated by the extreme pressures of the corresponding stokes waves multiplied by a factor smaller than 1 without inducing too much error the extreme pressures of super rogue waves can also be measured by ρ g η max which is the maximum dynamic pressure predicted by the linear wave theory as is shown in fig 18 the extreme pressures of super rogue waves are approximately proportional to ρ g η max the proportionality factors are smaller than 1 which means the linear wave theory overpredicts the extreme pressures of super rogue waves the difference between extreme pressures of super rogue waves and stokes waves is affected by nonlinear effects fig 19 investigates the relationship between peak steepness ε p and the relative difference on extreme pressures defined as e 1 max p r 1 max p s 1 max p r 1 and e 2 max p r 2 max p s 2 max p r 1 it is found that the magnitudes of e 1 and e 2 increase in a nonlinear manner with the growth of ε p the relationship is approximated by quadratic functions in fig 19 yet the goodness of the curve fitting still has room for improvement the relative difference on extreme pressures is also influenced by η 2 η max which reflects the relative size of the maximum wave crests with respect to their neighbors in fig 20 it is found that the magnitudes of e 1 and e 2 decline as η 2 η max increases this indicates the pressure fields of super rogue waves are close to those of the stokes waves if the rogue waves contain a number of giant crests with similar heights on the contrary if the maximum peak of a rogue wave is much taller than its neighbors the difference between the extreme pressures of the two kinds of waves becomes apparent in addition the relationship between e 1 e 2 and η 2 η max is also nonlinear 5 conclusions this paper simulates super rogue waves up to fifth order in a numerical wave tank and investigates their surface elevations as well as localized velocity and pressure fields by making comparison against 5 order stokes waves the main conclusions of the study are drawn as follows 1 the numerical results show good agreement with the rogue wave theory and the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b the triangular spectrum shapes and asymmetric wave outlines reported by chabchoub et al 2012a b can also be observed in the simulation results 2 as a whole the velocity fields of super rogue waves are similar to those of 5 order stokes waves with the same wavelengths and wave heights however the maximum velocities at the crests of the super rogue waves are larger than those of stokes waves this indicates super rogue waves may pose greater loads on deck and are thus more dangerous than stokes waves 3 the difference between the velocity fields of super rogue waves and stokes waves becomes great with the growth of the steepness at the maximum wave crest ε p 4 as a whole the pressure fields of super rogue waves resemble those of 5 order stokes waves with the same wavelengths and wave heights yet the magnitudes of extreme maximum and minimum dynamic pressures at the greatest crests and troughs of super rogue waves tend to be smaller than those of stokes waves 5 the extreme dynamic pressures of super rogue waves are approximately proportional to those of stokes waves and the maximum crest heights of the rogue waves the difference between extreme dynamic pressures of super rogue waves and those of stokes waves becomes great with the growth of the steepness at the maximum wave crest ε p and small if the rogue waves contain multiple large crests 6 from an engineering perspective stokes waves can substitute for super rogue waves in engineering issues such as designs and safety assessments yet some deviation can be induced the data points and fitting curves in figs 12 14 and figs 17 20 can be referred to during evaluating the difference between stokes waves and super rogue waves however sufficient safety margins should still be considered in case the results obtained with stokes waves under estimate the destruction of super rogue waves it is worthy of noting that we have found some abnormal waves whose heights can be over 7 times larger than the common wave heights along the western coast of taiwan strait these abnormal waves usually happen in general or even calm seas and the significant wave heights can be smaller than 0 5 m even though chabchoub et al 2012b believed that the super rogue wave theory cannot be directly applied to explain giant ocean rogue waves it may still be a promising model for explaining these

20787,following the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b super rogue waves up to the fifth order are simulated in a numerical wave tank under the framework of navier stokes equations for the first

against the theory of high order rational solutions of the cubic schrödinger equation the features of localized velocity and pressure field are investigated by making comparison against those of standard 5 order stokes waves it is found that the flow field patterns of super rogue waves resemble those of equivalent stokes waves while notable quantitative difference can be observed keywords super rogue waves numerical wave tank velocity field pressure field stokes waves 1 introduction rogue waves are giant ocean waves which are much higher than the typical waves in a sea state they occur from nowhere and disappear without any trace hence pose great threat to ships and offshore structures rogue waves are hard to track as their durations are usually short they can happen in deep and shallow water with or without the influence of current and can be observed in bad storms or normal sea states the diversity of occurrence environment indicates that rogue waves may be caused by different reasons which is why so far a variety of models have been proposed to explain their generation mechanisms in the last decades numerous researches have been performed on rogue waves including their physical mechanisms numerical and experimental simulation methods prediction methods and wave structure interactions comprehensive reviews of these works can be found in kharif and pelinovsky 2003 dysthe et al 2008 and onorato et al 2013 recently more and more sea observational data has been studied based on which some forecast methods of rogue waves are proposed for instance gramstad et al 2018a investigated the occurrence of extreme and rogue waves in the datasets measured from sensors situated at the ekofisk field in the north sea the resulting statistical properties of wave heights and wave crests were analyzed together with the possible relations between the occurrence of rogue waves and spectral characteristics of the sea states through analyzing surface elevation records from two locations in the northeast pacific gemmrich and thomson 2017 found that rogue waves were most commonly located in the center of wave groups and that random superposition of nonlinear waves is sufficient to explain the observations of individual rogue waves cattrell et al 2018 collated and analyzed the largest dataset of single point field measurements from surface following wave buoys to search for predictors of rogue wave occurrence it is found that frequency of occurrence of rogue waves is not spatially uniform and each location is likely to have its own unique sensitivities which increase in the coastal seas slunyaev 2018 proposed a method for the analysis of groups of unidirectional waves within the framework of nonlinear schrödinger equation which can be used for extreme wave prediction hadjihosseini et al 2016 presented a multi point statistical method of data analysis to allow the grasping of extreme rogue wave events in a satisfactory statistical manner doong et al 2018 developed a warning model for coastal freak wave occurrences based on an artificial neural network seven parameters significant wave height peak period wind speed wave groupiness factor benjamin feir index kurtosis and wind wave direction misalignment are involved in the model bayındır 2016 adopted wavelet transformation to predict rogue waves and found that the triangular wavelet spectra of the rogue waves can be detected at early stages of the development of rogue waves in a chaotic wave field in deep water rogue waves are usually modeled within the framework of the nonlinear schrödinger equation nlse and its extensions such as the modified nonlinear schrödinger equation mnlse for instance akhmediev et al 2009a b numerically calculated chaotic waves of the focusing nlse starting with a plane wave modulated by relatively weak random waves and found that rogue waves could be described in terms of the collision of akhmediev breathers calini and schober 2017 investigated jonswap rogue waves using the inverse spectral theory of the periodic nlse and showed that the developing sea state with typical jonswap initial data could be well approximated by the first few dominant modes of the nonlinear spectrum and can be described in terms of a 2 or 3 phase periodic nls solution wang and balachandran 2018 investigated the formation of extreme waves in unidirectional sea by considering a stochastic model based on the interaction and phase coupling amongst modified envelope soliton solutions to the nlse gramstad et al 2018b studied wave statistical properties and occurrence of extreme and rogue waves in extensive set of crossing sea states with various spectral shapes and crossing angles sometimes the euler equations are solved to account for the full nonlinearity of the free surface condition toffoli et al 2010 presented a comprehensive analysis of statistics properties in jonswap sea states including the probability of occurrence of extreme waves within a variety of random directional wave fields by means of numerical simulations based on euler model and tests in a three dimensional basin toffoli et al 2008 investigated the occurrence of rogue waves through direct numerical simulations of the euler equations and found that both the upper and lower tails of the probability density function for the surface elevation significantly deviated from the commonly used second order wave theory toffoli et al 2011 analyzed the effects of crossing sea states on the occurrence of rogue waves by three dimensional experiments and high order numerical simulations based on the euler model slunyaev et al 2017 studied the dynamics of intense solitary wave groups of collinear surface waves by means of numerical simulations of the euler equations and laboratory experiments considering the process of solitary wave generation reflection from a wall and collisions wang et al 2019 investigated the influence of different parameters on focusing wave properties in a numerical wave tank with a fully nonlinear potential flow model adcock and taylor 2016 compared the broad banded modified nonlinear schrödinger equation model with full potential flow theory in simulating focusing unidirectional wave groups under deep water and observed modeling inaccuracy under certain circumstances of all the models of rogue waves the most widely accepted and studied one may be the modulation instability and its extension the soliton and breather solutions to the nlse the former gives good explanation on the sudden occurrence and short duration of rogue waves in a nonlinear sense onorato et al 2006 dyachenko and zakharov 2005 and the latter further gives specific expressions of wave surface which can be treated as prototypes of rogue waves in simulation of rogue wave structure interactions shrira and geogjaev 2010 hu et al 2015b the peregrine breather proposed by peregrine 1983 has been demonstrated to be an effective model of rogue waves it can be generated by using a time reversal method chabchoub and fink 2014 ducrozet et al 2020 in laboratories and has been proved to be able to exist in random sea states wang et al 2018 by performing the darboux transformation upon nlse the peregrine breather can be expanded into a hierarchy of high order rational breather solutions dubard et al 2010 which all present localization both in time and in space the existence of higher order rational solutions or super rogue waves up to the fifth order has been demonstrated in a physical wave tank chabchoub et al 2012b slunyaev et al 2013 simulated super rogue waves by solving the mnlse and the fully nonlinear potential euler equations lu et al 2016 adopted a fourth order split step pseudo spectral method to solve the mnlse and investigated the energy structure of super rogue waves alberello et al 2018 studied the velocity distribution of breaking rogue waves by experiments and evaluated the applicability of various methods of velocity prediction the present work simulates super rogue waves up to the fifth order in a numerical wave tank nwt solving navier stokes equations the simulation parameters are determined according to the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b and the simulation results are verified against the theory of high order rational solutions of nlse since existing researches in super rogue waves mainly focus on the propagation of wave groups and energy by analyzing surface elevations this paper concentrates on the localized flow fields of super rogue waves which are crucial for the study of wave structure interaction problems the localized velocity and pressure fields are analyzed by making comparison against those of 5 order stokes waves the simulation results have the potential application of investigating wave loads and structure safety under super rogue waves the content of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a short review on the theoretical background of super rogue waves and section 3 introduces the implementation of the nwt and the parameters of simulation since there is no innovation in section 2 and 3 we make them short and give necessary references the simulation results are analyzed in section 4 which involves the discussion of wave surface as well as the velocity and pressure fields in the vicinity of the maximum crests of super rogue waves the main conclusions of the paper are reported in section 5 2 theoretical background of super rogue waves the one dimensional nlse which describes the evolution of weakly nonlinear wave packets in deep water can be written as mei 1989 1 i a t c g a x ω 0 8 k 0 2 2 a x 2 ω 0 k 0 2 2 a 2 a 0 where x and t are the spatial and time coordinates respectively a is the wave envelope i is the imaginary unit ω 0 and k 0 represent the angular frequency and the wave number of the carrier waves and c g is the group velocity the deep water dispersion relation is ω 0 2 g k 0 with which the group velocity can be written as c g ω 0 2 k 0 by applying a simple variable substitution eq 1 can be converted into the standard nlse as follows 2 i ψ t ψ x x 2 ψ 2 ψ 0 where t ω 0 t 8 x x c g t k 0 and ψ 2 k 0 a the j order rational solution of eq 2 can be written in a general form as akhmediev et al 2009a b 3 ψ j ψ 0 1 j g j i h j d j exp 2 i ψ 0 2 t where ψ 0 is the constant background amplitude g j h j and d j are polynomials with respect to x and t in particular the 1 order rational solution also known as the peregrine breather is given by g 1 1 h 1 16 ψ 0 2 t and d 1 1 4 ψ 0 2 x 2 16 ψ 0 4 t 2 with the growth of order j the expressions of g j h j and d j become cumbersome quickly by far the expressions of the 8 order rational breather have been derived gaillard 2012b yet only breathers with orders not greater than 5 have been observed in water waves chabchoub et al 2012b the profiles of super rogue waves are illustrated in fig 1 detailed expressions of the breather solutions can be found in gaillard 2011 for order 1 to 3 and in gaillard 2012a for order 4 or higher which are not copied in the present work the surface elevation of various nonlinear orders can be expressed as chabchoub et al 2012b onorato et al 2013 4 η i re a x t e i k 0 x ω 0 t 5 η i i re a x t e i k 0 x ω 0 t 1 2 k 0 a 2 x t e 2 i k 0 x ω 0 t 6 η i i i re 1 1 8 k 0 2 a x t 2 a x t e i θ 1 2 k 0 a 2 x t e 2 i θ 3 8 k 0 2 a 3 x t e 3 i θ where η i η i i and η i i i are 1 order 2 order and 3 order surface elevations θ k 0 x ω 0 t where ω 0 ω 0 1 k 0 2 a x t 2 2 it is worthy of noting that the order of nonlinearity in the wave surface elevation is different from the order of the rational breather the former represents the order of stokes wave components and the latter the number of times of the darboux transformation matveev and salle 1991 required to obtain the rational breather 3 numerical method the simulations are performed in a 2d nwt developed in our previous study hu et al 2015a since the numerical method of the nwt is conventional and has no novelty only brief introduction is presented in this section the nwt solves navier stokes equations of incompressible newtonian fluid and adopts a vof youngs method youngs 1982 for free surface reconstruction the governing equations are 7 u k x k 0 8 u j t u k u j x k 1 ρ p x j g j υ x k u j x k u k x j 9 f t u k f x k 0 eqs 7 9 are the continuity equation the momentum equation and the fluid volume transportation equation respectively subscript k and j are index tensor notations and the summation convention is adopted u j is the velocity vector component p is pressure g j is the gravitational acceleration vector component υ is the coefficient of kinematic viscosity and f is the fluid volume function which is used in the vof method the pressure gradient term and diffusion term on the right side of eq 8 are discretized with the central difference scheme cds the nonlinear convention term on the left side of eq 8 is solved with a mixed cds and upwind difference scheme uds time derivative is discretized with a forward euler scheme a two step projection method is adopted to solve the velocity pressure equation which first calculates a temporary velocity field and then modifies it by solving the pressure field on the basis of the mass conservation equation a stress boundary condition is applied to the free surface boundary which indicates no shear stress and a constant normal stress i e air pressure on the free surface a non slip wall condition is used on the tank bottom and the right border of the nwt in the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b waves were generated by a single flap wave producing paddle activated by a hydraulic cylinder in our numerical simulations a wave generator boundary condition is assigned to the left border of the nwt which is an inlet boundary allowing wave entry from outside the pressure and velocity of the inlet boundary is determined by p p t h e o r y and u j u j t h e o r y where p t h e o r y and u j t h e o r y are the pressure and velocity predicted by the nlse theory to simulate super rogue waves the pressure and velocity are given by 10 p t h e o r y ρ g z ρ g re a x i t cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x i ω 0 t 11 u 1 t h e o r y re a x i t g k 0 ω 0 cosh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x i ω 0 t 12 u 2 t h e o r y re i a x i t g k 0 ω 0 sinh k 0 z h cosh k 0 h e i k 0 x i ω 0 t where x i is the horizontal coordinate of the inlet boundary and a x t is given by the breathers solutions of the nlse a wave absorption zone is placed at the right end of the nwt a conserved wave absorption method is utilized to dissipate wave energy and meanwhile to absorb the additional fluid volume brought by rogue waves and unbalanced mass transportation during each period of wave generation detailed information of the wave generation and absorption methods can be found in hu et al 2015a the schematic diagram of the nwt is shown in fig 2 the size of the nwt depends on the wave parameters of numerical simulation which are selected according to the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b and listed in table 1 in all the simulations the length of the nwt is selected as l 8 λ and the water depth h λ 2 where λ is the wavelength the depth of the nwt is h h 1 5 η max where η max is the maximum surface elevation of the super rogue wave the grid size ranges from 0 013 λ to 0 016 λ in the horizontal direction and from h max 15 to h max 8 in the vertical direction where h max denotes the peak wave height the size of time step is smaller than t p 800 in all the simulations where t p is the period of the carrier waves the focusing positions of the rogue waves are 4 λ from the wave generator the length of the absorption region is close to λ 4 results and discussion 4 1 surface elevation fig 3 shows the surface elevation normalized against the background wave amplitude of super rogue waves measured at the focusing positions in fig 3 the red lines refer to the theoretical surface elevations of the first order nonlinearity given by eq 4 although distinctions exist the simulation results agree well with the theoretical ones in a global sense one can observe that the entire wave group splits into a bunch of wave packets during the formation of rogue waves this phenomenon is induced by sideband waves drawing energy from the carrier and growing into large amplitude waves which is a typical nonlinear focusing effect known as modulation instability the number of wave packets n p is related to the order of the breather solution j by n p 2 j 1 and the maximum crest height of the rogue wave equals 2j 1 times the carrier wave amplitude based on the analytical solutions of the rational breathers the maximum crest heights of the simulation results are found to be smaller than those predicted by the breather theory which is shown in fig 4 the same phenomenon has also been observed in slunyaev et al 2013 where super rogue waves were simulated within the framework of the mnlse and the fully nonlinear euler equations the deviation is owing to the high order nonlinearity neglected by the nlse another difference between the numerical and theoretical results is that the simulated surface histories present asymmetric shapes which never occur in the theory the asymmetry also happened in the simulation results of slunyaev et al 2013 and lu et al 2016 and the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b this is another effect of high order nonlinearity as is pointed out by slunyaev et al 2013 the degree of asymmetry becomes remarkable if the central region of the packet contains only a few wave oscillations it should be mentioned that the steepness of the last case of table 1 happens to equal the threshold steepness for wave breaking given by chabchoub et al 2012b yet no wave breaking occurs during our numerical simulation nevertheless the maximum surface height of fig 3 i is clearly smaller than the theoretically predicted value and palpable asymmetry can be observed these phenomena can be also observed in the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b which are the typical signs of wave breaking about to happen fig 5 shows the fourier transformation results upon the simulated wave surface histories using the fast fourier transform fft method a hierarchy of peaks with declining amplitudes can be found in fig 5 the first and largest peak represents the basic carrier wave followed by a series of smaller peaks which denote high order stokes wave components in the current simulations 3 order stokes nonlinearity is enough to describe the surface oscillation and higher order stokes components can be neglected in subplot b of fig 5 two dips with a triangle shaped crest can be observed at the basic peak this corresponds to the triangular spectra of the envelopes of super rogue waves which has already been reported by akhmediev et al 2011 and proved by the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012a detailed analysis on the surface elevations and the global energy evolution of super rogue waves has already been done in previous studies such as chabchoub et al 2012a lu et al 2016 bayındır 2016 wang et al 2018 and liao et al 2018 therefore we do not repeat these studies in the present works 4 2 velocity fig 6 shows the localized velocity fields under the maximum crests of the super rogue waves for ease of comparison the velocity fields of 5 order stokes waves with identical wavelengths and wave heights are also drawn in fig 6 one can observe large horizontal velocities underneath the wave crests by contrast the horizontal velocities are small and in the opposite direction in the vicinity of wave troughs despite the velocity fields of super rogue waves and the corresponding stokes waves are similar in the global sense which supports the theory of breather rogue waves explained as driven by the amplitude modulation of stokes waves distinctions can be found in the streamlines and sectional velocity distributions fig 7 shows the streamlines of four super rogue waves under their maximum crests with comparison against those of the 5 order stokes waves since the central wave packet of the rogue waves contain a number of wave oscillations in subplot a c and g of fig 7 the streamlines in these subplots show good symmetry however the streamlines show palpable asymmetric shapes in fig 7 e due to fewer wave oscillations in the central wave packet the asymmetry can be also reflected by the surface elevation shown in fig 3 g by comparison the streamlines of stokes waves show no significant signs of asymmetry another difference is that the streamlines look blunt at their lowest points for the super rogue waves and sharp for the stokes waves in other words the streamlines of the super rogue waves exhibit u shapes yet those of the stokes waves tend to be in v shapes for a u shape streamline both the top and the bottom are wide for a v shape streamline the top is wide yet the bottom is narrow in other words the width ratio l d l u in fig 8 is large for a u shape streamline and small for a v shape streamline the difference between streamline shapes indicates the ratio of the vertical velocity against the horizontal should be different for the two kinds of waves in order to reveal this difference four typical cross sections shown in fig 9 are selected fig 10 shows the distributions of the horizontal and vertical velocities denoted as u and v at the cross sections illustrated in fig 9 the velocities of super rogue waves and 5 order stokes waves are drawn in the same figure and a linear prediction is given for ease of comparison it is found that the velocities of the two kinds of waves show similar distribution shapes yet clear quantitative difference exists the velocities of super rogue waves are close to those of the stokes waves at enough depth however deviations can be found nearby the free surface the velocities mainly in vertical direction of the super rogue waves at wave nodes section 3 4 are smaller than those of the stokes waves the absolutes of the velocities mainly in horizontal direction of super rogue waves at the wave troughs are also smaller than those of the stokes waves however the velocities of super rogue waves can be much larger than those of stokes waves at regions underneath the maximum wave crests the same phenomenon can be also found in the experiment of alberello et al 2018 in which the velocities below the crest of a breaking rogue wave were much greater than the results of a linear prediction considering the fact that the phenomenon happens in the fluid domain above the still water line swl and that rogue waves often bring severe green water and impact to marine structures the comparison indicates that super rogue waves may be more dangerous than the stokes waves even if they possess the same wavelength and wave height to give a quantitative comparative study on the velocities of super rogue waves and stokes waves we introduce a group of parameters which are defined as u r j j 1 2 horizontal velocities of super rogue waves at cross section j u s j j 1 2 horizontal velocities of 5 order stokes waves at cross section j v r j j 3 4 vertical velocities of super rogue waves at cross section j v s j j 3 4 vertical velocities of 5 order stokes waves at cross section j u e j u r j u s j j 1 2 v e j v r j v s j j 3 4 u 0 phase speeds of 5 order stokes waves ε p steepness at the highest crests of super rogue waves i e 2 j 1 k 0 a 0 where j is the order of the breather solution with the results of all the 9 simulation cases fig 11 compares the mean sectional velocities of super rogue waves and those of 5 order stokes waves it is found the former can be well approximated by the latter at all the 4 cross sections illustrated in fig 9 this again verifies the fact that the velocity fields of super rogue waves resemble those of stokes waves fig 12 shows the change of velocity differences between super rogue waves and 5 order stokes waves with respect to the maximum velocities of 5 order stokes waves the former is described by the 2 norm of u e j and v e j and the latter as the maxima of u s 1 in fig 12 the velocity differences between super rogue waves and stokes waves increase with the velocity of stokes waves moreover u e j and v e j can be treated as linear functions of max u s 1 fig 13 displays the relative velocity differences between super rogue waves and stokes waves defined by u e j max u r j and v e j max v r j changing with the degree of wave nonlinearity measured by ε p one can observe that relative velocity differences increase with the growth of steepness in the global sense and the relationship can be roughly approximated by quadratic functions as is shown in fig 14 the maximum velocities of super rogue waves also increase with those of the corresponding 5 order stokes waves and the relationship seems to be nonlinear 4 3 pressure fig 15 contrasts the dynamic pressure fields of super rogue waves at the highest crests with those of the 5 order stokes waves to achieve a good comparison result hydrostatic pressure has been excluded from fig 15 for both kinds of waves the maximum dynamic pressures occur at the wave crests and the minimum at the troughs as a whole the pressure fields of super rogue waves and stokes waves are similar yet some local discrepancies can still be observed for example the maximum pressure in subplot e of fig 15 is smaller than that in subplot f and the negative pressures at the troughs of super rogue waves are larger than those of stokes waves before further discussion the following parameters are introduced p r j j 1 2 dynamic pressures of super rogue waves at cross section j p s j j 1 2 dynamic pressures of 5 order stokes waves at cross section j η max heights of the highest crests of the super rogue waves η 2 heights of the second highest crests of the super rogue waves fig 16 compares the vertical distributions of p r j and p s j one can find the maxima of both p r 1 and p s 1 always happen at swl started from swl p r 1 and p s 1 decline linearly as z increases and exponentially as z decreases p r 2 and p s 2 reach their minima on the wave surface and increase exponentially as z decreases therefore the pressure distributions of super rogue waves and stokes waves show similar patterns however the absolute value of p r j is smaller than that of p s j and p r 1 p s 1 seems to be smaller than p r 2 p s 2 under most circumstances fig 17 displays the extreme dynamic pressures of all the 9 simulation cases the extreme dynamic pressures of super rogue waves are compared against those of the corresponding 5 order stokes waves and a linear relation can be drawn this suggests the extreme pressures of super rogue waves may be approximated by the extreme pressures of the corresponding stokes waves multiplied by a factor smaller than 1 without inducing too much error the extreme pressures of super rogue waves can also be measured by ρ g η max which is the maximum dynamic pressure predicted by the linear wave theory as is shown in fig 18 the extreme pressures of super rogue waves are approximately proportional to ρ g η max the proportionality factors are smaller than 1 which means the linear wave theory overpredicts the extreme pressures of super rogue waves the difference between extreme pressures of super rogue waves and stokes waves is affected by nonlinear effects fig 19 investigates the relationship between peak steepness ε p and the relative difference on extreme pressures defined as e 1 max p r 1 max p s 1 max p r 1 and e 2 max p r 2 max p s 2 max p r 1 it is found that the magnitudes of e 1 and e 2 increase in a nonlinear manner with the growth of ε p the relationship is approximated by quadratic functions in fig 19 yet the goodness of the curve fitting still has room for improvement the relative difference on extreme pressures is also influenced by η 2 η max which reflects the relative size of the maximum wave crests with respect to their neighbors in fig 20 it is found that the magnitudes of e 1 and e 2 decline as η 2 η max increases this indicates the pressure fields of super rogue waves are close to those of the stokes waves if the rogue waves contain a number of giant crests with similar heights on the contrary if the maximum peak of a rogue wave is much taller than its neighbors the difference between the extreme pressures of the two kinds of waves becomes apparent in addition the relationship between e 1 e 2 and η 2 η max is also nonlinear 5 conclusions this paper simulates super rogue waves up to fifth order in a numerical wave tank and investigates their surface elevations as well as localized velocity and pressure fields by making comparison against 5 order stokes waves the main conclusions of the study are drawn as follows 1 the numerical results show good agreement with the rogue wave theory and the experiments of chabchoub et al 2012b the triangular spectrum shapes and asymmetric wave outlines reported by chabchoub et al 2012a b can also be observed in the simulation results 2 as a whole the velocity fields of super rogue waves are similar to those of 5 order stokes waves with the same wavelengths and wave heights however the maximum velocities at the crests of the super rogue waves are larger than those of stokes waves this indicates super rogue waves may pose greater loads on deck and are thus more dangerous than stokes waves 3 the difference between the velocity fields of super rogue waves and stokes waves becomes great with the growth of the steepness at the maximum wave crest ε p 4 as a whole the pressure fields of super rogue waves resemble those of 5 order stokes waves with the same wavelengths and wave heights yet the magnitudes of extreme maximum and minimum dynamic pressures at the greatest crests and troughs of super rogue waves tend to be smaller than those of stokes waves 5 the extreme dynamic pressures of super rogue waves are approximately proportional to those of stokes waves and the maximum crest heights of the rogue waves the difference between extreme dynamic pressures of super rogue waves and those of stokes waves becomes great with the growth of the steepness at the maximum wave crest ε p and small if the rogue waves contain multiple large crests 6 from an engineering perspective stokes waves can substitute for super rogue waves in engineering issues such as designs and safety assessments yet some deviation can be induced the data points and fitting curves in figs 12 14 and figs 17 20 can be referred to during evaluating the difference between stokes waves and super rogue waves however sufficient safety margins should still be considered in case the results obtained with stokes waves under estimate the destruction of super rogue waves it is worthy of noting that we have found some abnormal waves whose heights can be over 7 times larger than the common wave heights along the western coast of taiwan strait these abnormal waves usually happen in general or even calm seas and the significant wave heights can be smaller than 0 5 m even though chabchoub et al 2012b believed that the super rogue wave theory cannot be directly applied to explain giant ocean rogue waves it may still be a promising model for explaining these small abnormal waves credit authorship contribution statement zhe hu conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original draft writing review editing visualization xiaoying zhang

20788,an early assessment of the ship airwake characteristics is one of the most challenging tasks associated with the designing of vessels the design of warship superstructures has traditionally followed the basic polyhedron shape box type structures to achieve the desired stealth capability however presence of such a box shape bluff superstructure generates massively separated airwake over the ship helodeck region this airwake results into complex flow phenomena which carry strong velocity gradients in space and time along with widely varying turbulence length scales under such conditions the launch and recovery of a shipboard helicopter operations are very hazardous thus an accurate assessment of the resultant ship airwake flow phenomena at early design stages is desirable we present a comparative time accurate assessment study in order to gain a better understanding of the capability of the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans the scale adaptive simulation sas and the detached eddy simulation des turbulence models in predicting turbulent ship airwake characteristics detailed comparisons are conducted with respect to the in house experimental data results show that the des and sas produce nearly similar trends of the mean flow properties when compared to the experimental results however comparisons of velocity spectra indicate that sas can resolve the dominant large scale turbulent flow structures with less computational burden further this study also attempts to compare the variation of mean flow quantities with steady rans approach in order to quantify the percentage variation between the predictions of the steady and unsteady turbulence modelling approach keywords ship airwake generic frigate ship hybrid les rans urans sas des separated flow turbulent flow computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction the operation of helicopters onboard ships has always been a very complex task owing to the presence of massively separated ship airwakes high velocity gradients widely varying turbulence length scales these complexities arise mainly because of the box shaped bluff body superstructure of the ship also the presence of a large bluff superstructure with various military appendages create complex airwake environment over the ship rear deck i e helodeck flight deck the resultant airwake flow over the helodeck contains i widely time varying turbulence structures ii steep velocity gradients iii highly separated flow and iv the interaction of unstable separating shear layers and vortices these difficulties are more aggravated in the case of small vessels such as frigate or destroyer class ships due to the confined deck area moreover the inclusion of new design features to accommodate various military armaments on a small confined vessel poses novel challenges all such requirements often lead to aerodynamic implications on the ship s performance by promoting the large scale flow separation in the wake healey 1987 further these flow complexities together can have a significant impact on the shipborne helicopter operations it is found that the dominant turbulent energy in the frequency range of 0 1 2 hz over the helodeck has a significant impact on the helicopter aerodynamics zan 2005 thus from an engineering point of view there is a strong need to establish a suitable and economical unsteady numerical modelling approach which can resolve the unsteady ship airwake flow characteristics reasonably well at the early design stage itself with this motivation a significant number of papers dealing with computational studies on various aspects of the ship airwake aerodynamics were gathered during our literature survey shukla et al 2019a these studies reveal that the flow past a generic ship body is i massively separated ii highly unsteady and three dimensional and iii the airwake characteristics are independent of reynolds number re beyond 104 based on ship beam at such high reynolds number the flow over a ship and the wake are fully turbulent and the flow structures are nearly unchanged despite the flow being highly unsteady in nature the literature reveals that the steady unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach are the most preferred choice for the numerical modelling of the ship airwakes the reason behind such preference is mainly due to its robustness and computationally less expensive as compared to the conventional unsteady cfd approaches such as direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les for a higher reynolds number flow the ship airwake contains a wide spectrum of turbulence scales hence application of dns or les in such scenarios is expected to be prohibitively very expensive therefore both these approaches are still not practical at early design stages for the engineering applications like a ship where the order of reynolds number is typically in the range of 104 107 in contrast the disadvantages of traditional rans models are i it has several modelling uncertainties and ii it often fails in the prediction of massively separated flows the reason behind such deficiency in performance because the traditional rans approach models all the flow scales and involve several arbitrary coefficients with single point closures thus it is not able to efficiently deal with the highly separated bluff body flows where multi point statistics plays a critical role in the flow physics shukla et al 2019a one of the key motivations behind conducting such a scale resolve simulation in ship building industry is mainly to get detail insight of the airwake s flow phenomena to gauge the overall performance of the vessel under different wind conditions the outcome of such a flow analysis is very important from the design aspect and it helps to optimize the ship superstructure shape and size at an early design stage moreover these kinds of ship airwake predictions are also used for piloted flight simulations which are later used to assess the shipboard helicopter launch and recovery operations roper et al 2006 thus from a naval architecture and researcher point of view there is a strong need to establish a suitable and economical unsteady numerical modelling approach which can resolve the unsteady ship airwake flow characteristics reasonably and can capture the dominant frequency range effectively for the piloted flight simulator analysis in this context the use of rans based hybrid turbulence models is a preferred choice due to its lesser computational demand and wide range of application hence the performance of the three unsteady modelling approaches namely urans sas and des are evaluated in order to predict the ship airwake characteristics the key objective of this study is to examine the performance of the urans sas and des approaches for their capability of resolving the dominant ship airwake turbulent frequency range a k ω sst framework based urans sas and des simulations of flow past a generic simplified frigate ship sfs2 at reynolds number re 6 104 have been performed and compared in the present work extensive comparisons are presented in terms of i mean flow field characteristics and ii instantaneous flow field characteristics to qualitatively and quantitatively examine the overall performance of the three numerical approaches under consideration further an attempt has also been to gauge the variation of mean flow parameters over the helodeck region between the unsteady and steady flow modelling approaches and quantify the percentage change it is expected that such quantification would provide a benchmark guideline of accuracy versus cost estimate and it may also pave the path to establish suitable technique criteria gauging the ship helicopter flow characteristics based on the mean flow parameters to the best of the author s knowledge there is no such study reported in the literature which highlights the extent of variations in the mean flow variables for unsteady and steady flow modelling approaches in context of the ship airwake this paper is organized into six sections in section 2 a brief background of numerical approaches under consideration is given from mathematical formulation point of view following this a detail discussion on the adopted numerical methodology including brief details of the turbulence modelling and governing equations are presented in section 3 subsequently section 4 presents the computational setup including details of the geometry configuration grid generation computational domain solver settings and boundary conditions followed by a justification of the choice of time step and time averaging procedure section 5 gives the results and discussion including code validation comparison to experimental results and then the performance comparisons of all the numerical approaches under consideration finally section 6 concludes the paper with a summary of the important findings and possible future directions 2 background in recent years the study of massively separated high reynolds number ship airwake flow and its numerical modelling became a vibrant research area after the inception of high performance computing technology shukla et al 2014 2017a 2017b 2018 2019b 2020a in the present context the development of efficient high fidelity numerical techniques to accurately assess the ship airwake flow phenomena and to bridge the gap between the les and rans approach is one of the popular research trends in the computational fluid dynamics cfd domain polsky et al 2000 syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 thornber et al 2010 shukla et al 2015 2020b zhang et al 2018 the main objective of developing such approaches is mainly to accurately predict the complex high reynolds number bluff body flows at relatively less computational burden in the last one decade several numerical methods have evolved and implemented to investigate the massively separated airwake flow characteristics namely hybrid rans les models such as detached eddy simulation des see details spalart 2001 hybrid second generation urans models such as scale adaptive simulation sas see details menter and egorov 2010 and partially averaged navier stokes pans see details girimaji 2006 the des method is based on the hybrid formulation of les and rans spalart 2001 this hybrid formulation links the turbulent length scale to the grid spacing in the region of interest such that the formulation automatically increases the level of eddy viscosity and switches from les to rans where the grid spacing is relatively high compared to the turbulent length scale this increase in eddy viscosity results into artificial damping of the flow field perturbations by the turbulence model and breaks the turbulent structures to propagate further in rans mode by switching from les to rans variables in the region of coarser grid the des avoids the burden of resolving small scale motion especially in the near wall region by reducing the burden of having a very fine mesh requirement at the same time the des smoothly shifts to les and reliably resolves the wider scales of airwake in regions away from walls thus it is anticipated that the des approach numerically performs close to les and better than the traditional urans approach however the application of des is slightly computationally expensive at the early stages of design the sas and pans both approaches are classified under the second generation urans models the traditional rans models do not involve physical length scales whereas the les model contains explicitly a length scale associated with the numerical grid this length scale mainly determine the size of the resolved fluctuations recently there have been some new rans models derived which are able to resolve substantial part of the turbulent fluctuations without involving the explicit dependency on the numerical grid these kinds of models are termed as second generation urans models frohlich and terzi 2008a in contrast to the traditional rans these kinds of models contain some additional terms in the evolution equation which sense the amount of resolved fluctuations the sas approach is proposed by menter and egorov 2010 this model is originally derived from the rotta k kl model where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and l is the macro length of turbulence the authors used transport equations for k and φ k l and showed that the k l transport equation adds an extra term of von karman length scale into the turbulence length scale equation due to this extra length scale term the sas model can resolve substantial portion of the turbulent fluctuations in unsteady flow in essence as compared to the traditional urans model the sas model contains two length scales a classical one which is related to first derivative of resolved velocity analogous to the traditional rans model and a second one due to the extra term of von karman length scale which is related to the second derivative of the resolved velocity this method does not explicitly require a very fine grid resolution and allows to dynamically adjust the resolved structures in a urans simulation thus the sas model can demonstrate a behavior similar to the des model in unsteady regions of the flow field at the computational burden equal to urans and signifies an alternative unsteady simulation technique this allows an efficient passage from urans to scale resolve simulation and has been used especially for the massively separated flows such as flows around airfoil zheng et al 2016 cylinders and simplified vehicles egorov et al 2010 menter and egorov 2005 3 numerical methodology this section describes the adopted methodology in terms of undertaken turbulence modelling approaches and their governing equations in the present study we mainly focus on the top side ship airwake characteristics and hence the effect of ship motion is not modelled a three dimensional k ω sst framework based urans sas and des model are employed for the present numerical study the governing equations of all the three approaches are given in the following subsections 3 1 sst k ω model the shear stress transport sst k ω model was developed to effectively blend the robust and accurate formulation of the standard k ω model in the near wall region and k ε model in the far field to achieve a seamless blend transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation rate ω are solved to specify the turbulent viscosity mentor 1994 equations 1 and 2 the transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation rate ω are given as transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy k 1 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k s k transport equation for specific dissipation rate ω 2 t ρ ω x i ρ ω u i x j γ ω ω x j g ω y ω d ω s ω in equations 1 and 2 g k and g ω represents the generation of turbulence kinetic energy and generation of specific dissipation rate due to mean velocity gradients respectively the y k and y ω represent the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence d ω represents the cross diffusion term the s k and s ω are user defined source terms and the γ k and γ ω represent the effective diffusivity of k and ω respectively which are calculated as described below the effective diffusivities for the sst k ω model are given by 3 γ k μ μ t σ k γ ω μ μ t σ ω where σk and σω are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ω respectively the turbulent viscosity μ t is computed as follows 4 μ t ρ k ω 1 m a x 1 α s f 2 α 1 ω where s is the strain rate magnitude 3 2 scale adaptive simulation model the scale adaptive simulation model is based on the reformulation of rottas s equation for the integral length scale which provide one kind of a blend between rotta k kl and sst k ω model menter and egorov 2010 egorov et al 2008 in sas model the scale defining equation is derived from the exact transport equation of the turbulent length scale as proposed by rotta 1968 along with the second derivative of the velocity field as source term see detail rotta 1972 the scale adaptive simulation model is formulated as two equation model with the variable φ k l for the scale equation as shown 5 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k c μ 3 4 ρ k 2 x i μ t σ k k x j 6 ρ t ρ u j x j k p k a 1 a 2 l l v k 2 a 3 ρ k x j μ t σ x j 7 l v k k u u u u i

authors recast the sas approach with an additional source term in the ω with some minor changes egorov et al 2010 the latest version of the additional source term source term is 9 f s a s m a x ρ a 4 k s 2 l l v k 2 c 2 ρ k m a x 1 ω 2 ω x j ω x j 1 k 2 k x j k x j 0 with a 4 3 51 and c 2 further other variants have also been proposed for sas model namely one equation variant where solving for only a single equation for φ k l and replacing the transport equation for k by the algebraic expression v t s c μ c μ 1 4 s see menter et al 2006 for more details the sas model formulation is having an extra term von karman length scale l v k 7 in unsteady separated flow cases this term being dominate over the other terms and result into the full activation of the sas model functionality accordingly the model can reduce the turbulent viscosity by adding to the production term in the ω equation instead of increasing the dissipation term in the k equation in the des approach hence this model can produce reasonable spectra for turbulence without explicit grid or time step dependency and behaves similar to des in many situations this method deemed to be a safer passage from urans to scale resolving simulation especially for complex applications at relatively coarser grids especially where high quality les grids cannot be generated for the massively separated flow regions 3 3 detached eddy simulation model the des model was first introduced by spalart and co workers spalart 2001 to eliminate the main limitations of les models by proposing a hybrid les rans formulation this hybrid formulations works on this blending framework a typical blending framework form for the given hybrid model is given by 10 h y b r i d f r a n s 1 f l e s w i t h 0 f 1 where φ represents the quantity to be modelled in the momentum equation the f is a blending factor for this framework both one equation and two equation rans based models are used see spalart 2001 for details for two equation based framework sst k ω model is used with this formulation the wall boundary layers are entirely covered by the sst k ω rans model and the free shear flows away from the walls are typically handled in les mode the advantage of des framework that it is simple and can be clubbed with any rans based models des was the first hybrid model which allows a smooth transition between les and urans the switch between rans and les on des model is based on the criterion as 11 c d e s δ m a x l t for rans c d e s δ m a x l t for les δ m a x max δ x δ y δ z where δ m a x is the maximum edge length of the local computational grid the detailed formulation for a two equation model sst k ω is as follow 12 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k ρ k 3 2 min l t c d e s δ m a x x j μ μ t σ k k x j 13 l t k 3 2 ε k β ω the dissipation term in the equation 12 is reformulated as 14 e d e s ρ k 3 2 min l t c d e s δ ρ k 3 2 l t min 1 c d e s δ l t ρ k 3 2 l t max 1 l t c d e s δ 15 e d e s ρ k 3 2 l t max 1 l t c d e s δ 1 f d e s where the constant c d e s 0 65 the function of f d e s designed in such a way as to give f d e s 1 inside the wall boundary layer and f d e s 0 away from the wall in other words the des model allows yielding a suitable description of the near wall flow in a statistical sense which only requires a fine grid in the wall normal direction and it can be used with a relatively coarse grid in the tangential direction the switch between the rans and les approaches is accomplished by an automated criterion given in equation 11 frohlich and terzi 2008b 4 computational setup all the computations presented in this paper have been performed using a three dimensional incompressible commercial solver ansys fluent the fluent code discretizes the navier stokes equations using a cell centred finite volume method on unstructured grids and then solves the governing equations of steady unsteady rans srans urans sas and des further the grids are generated using ansys icem mesh generation tool with hexahedral elements to setup the overall computational procedure the des predictions of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 was considered as a reference detail of geometry computational domain boundary conditions and solver settings are highlighted in the subsequent sections 4 1 geometry configurations the present study uses the simplified frigate ship model sfs2 as a generic configuration of frigate ship geometry as shown in fig 1 this configuration was developed as a part of an international collaboration under the technical cooperation program ttcp roper et al 2006 in order to validate the various cfd codes used for study of ship airwakes and to generate validation data through model testing zan 2005 the sfs2 generic model represents the major design features of a modern warship including i a full breadth superstructure containing a forward bow and a rear deck helodeck and ii a small top superstructure bridge ahead of the hangar dimensional ratios for this model are very similar to the frigate and destroyer classes of warships the 1 100 scale wooden model of ship was fabricated and being used for the in house wind tunnel piv experiments the ship beam wb equal to 0 14 m is considered as a characteristic dimension the dimensions of the ship geometry are given with respect to the ship beam fig 1 4 2 computational grid the grid generation is quite significant in computational modelling since the discretizing of computational domain the solving processing time computational burden rate of convergence and capability to capture the required flow accurately are solely dependent on the quality of grid grid size grid growth and grid refinement region the hexahedral grids provide considerable advantage in terms of low cell count per unit area compared to the hybrid or tetra grid thus the hexahedral grid with boundary layer elements near bodies and grid refinement region is used for the present study among the three approaches under consideration the des method is highly gird sensitive as discussed earlier therefore an adequate level of grid refinement is necessary close to wall as well as in the region of interest i e helodeck for better flow field accuracy in order to reasonably resolve the flow structures close to the ship wall accurately the o grid technique is used to create dense grids near to the walls further the grid refinement region across the helodeck is provided based on standard cfd practices the key challenge on this grid is in mainly dealing with the smooth cell growth to maintain the satisfactory aspect ratio especially around the sharp triangular bow region as discussed earlier the des method is most demanding in terms of grid resolution among all the three approaches under consideration at the same time it is also difficult to assess the quality of the mesh by conducting a grid independence study for such computationally expensive unsteady simulation thus a fine grid size of 6 5 million with non dimensional wall unit y 5 is used following the guidelines of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 the non dimensional grid size in three coordinate directions kept at δx 100 δy 5 and δz 50 with local grid spacing δ 0 h h g r 1 7 10 2 in the region of interest also it is deemed that the fine grid resolution based on the des model guidelines would be suitable for the other approaches as well the overall grids across the computational domain and a grid refinement region in the vicinity of the ship helodeck including near wall and region of interest is shown in fig 2 4 3 computational domain the selection of computational domain is based on consideration of the cross sectional dimensions of wind tunnel in which the in house piv measurement were conducted the ship model is positioned symmetrically over the test section center the error estimated in the positioning of the model is estimated to be within 1 mm the projected cross section of the model is nearly 163 cm2 against the wind tunnel test cross section of 3375 cm2 which gives a blockage ratio within 5 the cross section of computational domain is taken same as the wind tunnel dimension i e 3 5 wb 5 5 wb whereas the upstream distance between inlet and for of the ship is10 wb and the downstream distance between aft of the ship and outlet is 25 wb are considered with respect to the ship beam wb being the characteristic length the co ordinate dimensions and velocities are denoted by x and u in streamwise direction y and v in the transverse direction and z and w in the vertical direction respectively the co ordinate origin is positioned in the symmetry plane at the height of the helodeck from bottom and at the end of the hangar i e starting of the rear step fig 3 4 4 solver settings and boundary conditions the closure equation set of k ω sst framework based urans sas and des model are integrated over the discretized computational domain by the cell centred finite volume method and interpolations are introduced for the fluxes in the surface integrals method for better accuracy the spatial discretization of the convective term a bounded central difference scheme is used and a second order accurate central differencing discretization scheme is used for the diffusive terms for the pressure velocity coupling the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso algorithm is used which solves the pressure correction equation in an iterative method until the desired convergence is achieved the boundary conditions are adopted as per the literature shukla et al 2019a a pressure based solver is used along with incompressible steady air flow consideration under atmospheric pressure field the turbulence specifications namely turbulent intensity and length scale are considered based on the literature shukla et al 2014 polsky et al 2000 syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 in our simulations we assume that vwind and vship are coplanar with the ocean surface the relative wind velocity vwind v wod u and its direction is represented by ψ yaw wind over deck angle all simulations are performed under headwind ψ 00 at re 6 104 based on ship beam the following boundary conditions are prescribed in the solver fig 3 o as the wind tunnel experiments are being modelled thus the wall boundary condition with no slip for all the three velocity components is applied at far field of computational domain i e port side starboard wide and top respectively similarly wall with no slip condition is assigned on the ship o velocity inlet is provided at upstream of the ship as uniform flow velocity with the turbulence intensity of 1 of the freestream kinetic energy at a length scale of 0 3 cm at standard atmosphere conditions o outlet is assigned as a fixed static pressure condition with the flux constrained to be parallel to the free stream flow at atmosphere conditions 4 5 choice of time step and time averaging procedure the choice of an adequate time step is very important to ensure spatial and temporal resolution of the solution to identify the optimal time step we have followed two considerations i the cfl criteria forrest and owen 2010 and ii solver recommendation for capturing the dominate frequency fluent theory guide 2015 the reason behind to consider the solver recommendations while selecting the time step for given grid is mainly to classify the upper bound flow resolving limit of the des model as our key intent is to accurately capture the dominant ship airwake turbulent energy frequency range of 0 1 2 hz over the helodeck as it is known that the disturbances at frequencies above 2 hz does not affect the shipboard helicopter operations forrest and owen 2010 thus the performance assessment of the methods under consideration would be logical and competitive for resolving the dominant frequency range in line with the above two considerations the cfl criteria led to a lower limit of time step value as δt 1 10 4 s and the upper limit of time step is decided from the solver recommendation which is 100 time steps per period of the dominant frequency range fluent theory guide 2015 the dominant frequency range for the ship airwakes is reported to lie in between 0 1 and 2 hz healey 1987 zan 2005 shukla et al 2019a thus this led to an upper bound of the time step value δt 2 10 2 s the choice of lower time step would definitely resolve more turbulent energy at higher frequency in the case of des approach however the same has not been valid in the case of urans and sas methods and it would drastically increase the simulation time consequently the increase in computational expense by selecting a smaller time step is not justified with this understanding we deemed that the choice of time step in between the lower limit and upper limit would be a suitable time step for the comparative assessment later to verify this we had conducted time step independence exercise using time steps scaled by a factor of 5 between the above mentioned time step range to test the spatial and temporal sensitivity of the solution comparison of mean flow statistics to experimental data demonstrated that the time step value δt 1 10 3 s is appropriate and changing the time step lower than this value had very little effect on the spatial and temporal resolution of the solution thus the time step value 1 10 3 s has been used for all the three unsteady approaches under consideration further we also conducted an exercise to identify the optimal number of sub iterations at every time step calculation outcome of this exercise showed that 40 iterations per time step gave at least four orders of magnitude drop in the continuity residual and at least five in the others increasing the number of sub iterations beyond 40 did not increase convergence significantly but added considerably increased the run time thus the number of sub iterations value 40 has been used in all the simulations all the governing equations are time marched using a second order accurate time stepping scheme all the unsteady computations are run initially for approximately 50 non dimensional time units t physical time convective time scale which is equivalent to approximately 7 5 s of physical flow time the initial run of computations for this much time is required to remove the start up transients before the unsteady sampling can be started to ensure this the analysis of velocity time histories are monitored separately and it is found that a time of 7 5 s is sufficient for the ship airwakes to reach a statistically steady state afterwards the instantaneous flow statistics for the next 200 non dimensional time units which is equivalent to approximately 30 s of physical flow time were gathered the mean flow statistics were then calculated from the gathered data by performing temporal averaging a large number of flow time units are considered mainly for precise comparative assessment 5 results and discussions this section presents the results and discussions of the comparative assessment between the three unsteady approaches under consideration detail discussions on qualitatively and quantitatively comparison are covered under the three sub sections firstly the code validation and comparison to experimental data lee 2003 is discussed in section 5 1 subsequently the extensive performance comparison of the numerical approaches under consideration is presented in terms of mean flow characteristics in section 5 2 and instantaneous flow characteristics in section 5 3 respectively the comparison of mean flow characteristics also includes the variation of mean flow quantities with steady rans approach in order to quantify the percentage deviations between the predictions of the steady and unsteady turbulence modelling approach 5 1 code validation and comparison to experimental data code validation is an important activity to ascertain the reliability of the adopted cfd methodology in any numerical study we conducted the code validation exercise against the experimental results lee 2003 and des results forrest and owen 2010 available for the sfs geometry in literature subsequently we also evaluated the performance of all the numerical methods under consideration in the present study by comparing it against the experimental results lee 2003 separately details of the individual comparison cases are discussed in successive paragraphs for code validation the des prediction is compared against the available experimental data of national research council nrc lee 2003 and des results of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 for headwind condition ψ 00 the measurements were conducted by nrc in three dimensional space using hot film anemometry and hence the mean velocity data reported is for all the three mean velocity components u v w it is already highlighted in literature that the flow over the helodeck is highly three dimensional shukla et al 2019a thus we deemed that validation using all the three velocity component is necessary to ascertain the accuracy of the initial stage des simulations moreover this exercise will also ensure that the grid size and time step adopted for the des simulation is appropriate to predict the unsteady flow behavior of ship airwake and can be employed to other approaches as well the des predictions for all the three mean velocity components are compared with experimental lee 2003 and computational forrest and owen 2010 results over the helodeck at location of x l h d k 0 5 across the ship beam at non dimensional height of z h h g r 1 as shown in fig 4 this location is chosen as limited measurement data is available for the headwind condition in open literature variation of all the three mean velocity components between experimental lee 2003 and computational results of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 highlight that there is hardly any variation in both the des solutions further it is also seen that the predicted des solution is found to match reasonably with the reported experimental lee 2003 as well as des forrest and owen 2010 results subsequently we evaluate the performance of all the numerical methods under consideration i e des sas urans unsteady rans and srans steady rans by comparing it against the experimental lee 2003 results in fig 5 variation of all three components of velocity is plotted at x l h d k 0 5 along the ship beam at non dimensional hangar height of z h h g r 1 the comparison of predicted des fig 5 a and sas fig 5 b results is found to be reasonably matching with the experimental data with very minor variations however the predictions of urans fig 5 c and srans fig 5 d are seen to be slightly deviated especially for the streamwise and vertical component of velocity compared to the experimental results overall it is seen that all four predictions match reasonably with the experimental data with minor variations the agreement between the numerical predictions and the experimental data for the generic ship sfs2 configuration is deemed to be satisfying based on this overall evaluation exercise we deem that our cfd methodology is reliable enough to be employed for further comparative assessment of des sas urans and srans turbulence modelling approach in the predictions of massively separated ship airwake characteristics details of extensive performance comparison among all the above turbulence modelling approaches are presented in the subsequent sections 5 2 performance comparison based on mean flow characteristics in this section we present the performance comparison of all the three unsteady numerical predictions along with the steady rans prediction based on the mean flow field statistics and attempt to establish the percentage deviations between the solution of steady and unsteady turbulence modelling approach further we also present a detail discussion on the mean flow characteristics exists over the flight deck to gain a better insight into the resultant ship airwake phenomena evaluation of the mean flow quantities is done with respect to the streamwise velocity as an assessment parameter during our in house experimental measurements of an isolated ship sfs2 configuration it was found that the airwake flow characteristics on the helodeck is primarily governed by the streamwise velocity at headwind condition shukla 2020 therefore the streamwise velocity comparison is presented between our in house experimental and all the four numerical predictions the in house measurements were undertaken by particle image velocimetry piv on a rectangular measurement plane having dimensions of 30 cm length 22 5 cm width over the helodeck rotor plane x y plane a total of 600 instantaneous flow field images were obtained at the measurement plane which are post processed to calculate the time averaged mean flow field fig 6 shows the normalized streamwise velocity contour plots at heights z h hgr 0 5 over the helodeck in a longitudinal plane x y plane in our in house experiments shukla 2020 we have conducted measurement at four longitudinal planes located at z h hgr 0 1 helo touch down height z h hgr 0 5 helo hovering height z h hgr 1 helo hangar height and z h hgr 1 2 helo approaching height respectively among these four locations the experimental results have shown drastically increase in flow disturbance on the plane located at z h hgr 0 5 i e the helo hovering height also we found that the flow over the helodeck it highly unsteady three dimensional and massively separated with having a bi stable behaviour it was found that the bi stable behaviour causes the flow asymmetric which is more striking at plane located at height z h hgr 0 5 occurrence of this flow phenomenon mainly causes the drastic increment in the flow disturbance therefore we deemed that the z h hgr 0 5 location would be the most critical and the same has been considered for overall comparison to get a better estimate of the performance of numerical techniques under consideration it is seen that all the numerical approaches capture the mean flow physics reasonably with slight change in recirculation region compared to experimental data fig 6 a one can see that the des and sas nearly predict the same extent of recirculation region as observed in experiments whereas the urans approach underpredicts the recirculation region but the variation is within 5 the srans approach relatively more underpredicts the extent of recirculation region with variation up to 15 importantly one can also see that the asymmetry feature of the flow is captured by all the three unsteady approaches with minor variation fig 6 b c d however the steady rans approach could not be able to capture this asymmetry feature of the flow fig 6 e while correlating the experimental results we found that this asymmetry feature of the flow is mainly induced due to the bi stable flow behaviour which is purely an unsteady phenomenon therefore the same was not able to capture by the steady rans predictions due to its modelling limitation which does not take into account the unsteadiness of the flow further to have a quantitative comparison among all the predictions the cumulative error over the plane has been evaluated for all the four numerical approaches by comparing with the experiments and are given as percentage error in table 1 the table also gives an approximate estimate of the simulation time in terms of wall clock time on a local workstation the error calculation between the experimental and numerical predictions are undertaken based on the cumulative root mean square rms approach the rms is calculated for the predicted mean flow variables the values are extracted at the corresponding grid points from the computational domain from the converged solution for all the corresponding measured planes afterwards the difference between the measured and the computed values of normalized flow variable is calculated for example the resultant velocity v is calculated for all the corresponding grid pixel points finally the percentage of error between the experimental measurements and the numerical prediction is thereafter calculated at plane z h hgr 0 5 by using equation 16 16 percentage error on each plane 1 n i 1 n v v w e x p v v w c f d 2 where v is the resultant velocity in m sec vw is the wind velocity or free stream velocity in m sec v vw exp is the normalized resultant velocity from experimental measurements v vw cfd is the normalized resultant velocity from numerical simulation and n is the number of data points overall it is seen that the des approach shows an error of less than 5 whereas the sas and urans approach show an error of about 6 and 7 respectively the error for srans approach is around 8 the calculation time is very high for the des followed by sas urans and srans the relative comparison of the computational burden with respect to the steady rans computation time shows that the des is nearly 30 times costly followed by the sas which is around 20 times costly and then the urans which is nearly 18 times costly however the error variation corresponding computational burden between them is around 3 2 and 1 respectively more importantly the error variation between des and sas is around 1 whereas the computational time approximately is one and half times less for sas the sas and urans prediction show the deviation in error to be around 1 and the computational time is approximately same based on this comparison the sas approach deemed to be most suitable for the unsteady simulations whereas the srans approach can be considered to be suitable in the initial stage of parametric optimisation studies 5 2 1 analysis of mean flow characteristics over the helodeck in this section we present a detail analysis of the resultant turbulent ship airwake characteristics over the helodeck with respect to the helicopter landing approach reported literatures have highlighted that the most routine ship based helicopter landing operations are performed under three common key stages namely i approach sidestep ii station keeping hovering over the deck and iii vertical landing these key stages are often referred as mission task elements stage mtes forrest and owen 2010 among these three stages the second stage is considered most critical in terms of the pilot workload shukla et al 2019a during the stage 1 to stage 2 the helicopter starts going into the highly unsteady airwake region and hover over the moving deck for quite some time prior to achieve the quiescent period for landing i e stage 3 taking a cue from this information we conducted the mean flow analysis with respect to the mtes stages to get a better perspective of the helodeck flow field fig 7 a and b shows the variation of time averaged non dimensional streamwise velocity at heights z h hgr 0 1 and 1 0 over the helodeck respectively in fig 7 a it is clearly seen that the reverse flow zone extends nearly up to the half of the helodeck length close observation also shows that the extent of the recirculation region slightly extended towards the downstream compared to z h hgr 0 5 fig 6 more importantly the flow seems to lose the asymmetric behaviour and is seen nearly symmetric possibly due to the effect of the helodeck surface correlating trends at z h hgr 0 1 and 0 5 suggested that only the second half of the ship deck region i e downstream of x l hdk 0 5 would be suitable region for shipborne helicopter operations subsequently on the top plane z h hgr 1 0 the velocity deficit area is relatively less spread out in the spanwise direction and there is no negative velocity region seen in fig 7 b the region of low momentum region ranges between 0 and 0 4 restricted up to x l hdk 0 15 and offers relatively higher headwind component over the rotor plane which is necessary to provide higher safe margin for recovery of the helicopter overall the flow variations seen at the top plane is mostly attributed by the top deck superstructure i e funnel bridge deck overall the comparison of mean flow variation between the three mtes locations shown that the flow over the helodeck is relatively more disturbed on the plane located at the helo hovering height as the asymmetry behaviour of the flow striking more at z h hgr 0 5 fig 6 c to verify this further we compared the measured and predicted time averaged flow streamline structure at z h hgr 0 5 as shown in fig 8 as only a limited experimental data has been generated thus to demonstrate a clear perspective of the three dimensional airwake flow characteristic we present the variation of predicted streamlines over the helodeck at two mutually perpendicular planes i e z h hgr 0 5 and y w b 0 as shown in fig 8 b further fig 8 a shows the flow streamlines to be intricated asymmetric and stretched towards the longitudinal direction while comparing this with predicted flow topology fig 8 b it is now clear that there are three vortices located in the vicinity of the helodeck among these three vortices two are located on the x y plane and another one is located on the x z plane symmetry plane occurrence of the two vortices located on the x y plane indicate the formation of an inverted three dimensional horseshoe shape vortex whose end remains attached to the helodeck surface and could be in a bi stable state thus seen asymmetric on the other side the vortex present in the symmetry plane is formed due to the step of ship superstructure and indicates the formation of d shaped vortex as a results of flow separation and formation of a recirculation zone overall it is concluded that the flow over the helodeck is highly three dimensional and massively separated with having a bi stable behaviour it is also verified that the flow asymmetric which is more striking at plane located at height z h hgr 0 5 could be the cause of significant adverse effect produced by the drastic increment in the flow disturbance due to the bi stability 5 3 performance comparison based on instantaneous flow characteristics in order to assess the performance of des sas and urans predictions the qualitative and quantitative instantaneous flow field comparison is presented with respect to the formation of eddy structures of the airwake section 5 3 1 b time histories variation section 5 3 2 and c power spectral density psd of velocity field section 5 3 3 5 3 1 formation of eddy structures of the airwake this section presents the formation of eddy structures of the ship airwake over the helodeck using iso surface of λ2 criterion λ2 is defined as the 2nd eigen value of the of the sum of square of the strain rate and rotation tensor s2 ω2 a small negative value of λ2 can show coherent eddy structures in the flow field fig 9 shows the variation of the instantaneous flow field in terms of formation of eddy vortex structure through the iso surface of negative value of λ2 across the ship the iso surface of λ2 plot is frequently used to demonstrate the level of the eddy structures of the flow being resolved to illustrate the variation of vortex core flow structure over the helodeck a top view of the iso surface is presented and compared for all the three unsteady approaches the figure demonstrates the complex nature of eddy flow structures associated with the ship airwake present over the helodeck it is observed that the urans prediction fig 9 c shows relatively very weak eddy structures probably due to the lower unsteadiness level in the flow field and seems failed to resolve the flow scales as anticipated earlier in contrast a significant higher number of coherent eddy structures are located over the helodeck in the des predictions fig 9 a and sas predictions fig 9 b focusing on fig 9 a and b it is observed that the des prediction shows very strong and continuous eddy structures over the helodeck whereas the sas prediction shows relatively large eddy structures only reason behind such variation in the occurrence of eddy structures is mainly due to the ability of the des approach to resolve more flow scales associated with the flow close to the les approach one can clearly see that the occurrence of this small eddy structures downstream as a result of the flow interaction with the wake of the top superstructure funnel in des prediction therefore the dense small eddy structures are seen over the helodeck in the des solution fig 9 a on the other side the sas prediction is not able to resolve such small scale eddy structures and thus only large scale eddy structures are seen over the helodeck fig 9 b overall one could say that the des and sas solutions reasonably resolve the large scale eddy flow structures over the helodeck with minor variations similar eddy structures over the helodeck for headwind condition are also reported in des results of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 5 3 2 time histories variation in this section we present the time history variation of the normalized longitudinal and vertical velocity measured at the probe point located at the centre of the helodeck i e x l lhd 0 5 y w b 0 z h hgr 0 5 for all the three unsteady numerical approaches from fig 10 it is clearly seen that the both the velocity components exhibit unsteadiness throughout the physical time of 30 s for all the three numerical approaches one can observe that trend of time histories does not look significantly different through the whole physical time however the urans prediction shows relatively lower unsteadiness level throughout the physical time with fluctuations ranging between 0 6 and 0 1 and 0 2 to 0 2 times the freestream value for the longitudinal and vertical velocity component respectively on the other side the des and sas predictions exhibit significantly very high unsteadiness throughout the solution time with fluctuations ranging nearly from 0 8 to 0 2 and 0 4 to 0 4 times the freestream value for the longitudinal and vertical velocity component respectively similar trend is also reported for the transverse velocity component though the variation is relatively less and the mean value come close to the zero overall the unsteadiness level depicted by des prediction is seen to be slightly high as compared to the sas prediction correlating this variation with the eddy flow structure comparison fig 9 it is now clear that the urans approach does capture the unsteadiness of the flow throughout the solution time but with significant variation in the fluctuating range compared to des and sas approach also this lower velocity fluctuations seen in the urans solution fig 10 a and b results into the occurrence of relatively few eddy structures over the helodeck fig 9 overall it is verified that the urans predictions are not able to resolve the flow structures effectively due to lower unsteadiness levels hence the urans approach may not be suitable for the prediction of unsteady flow phenomena of ship airwakes over the helodeck the sas method performs reasonably well and its solution accuracy is close to des within certain variation as a result of the sas modelling limits thus the subsequent discussion compares the performance of the sas and des in order to further check the ability to resolve the dominant frequency range 5 3 3 power spectral density of velocity field this section highlights the performance of sas method in terms of velocity spectrum to gauge its effectiveness in resolving the dominant ship airwake frequency range of 0 1 2 hz for this purpose the longitudinal velocity time histories data is used to calculate the velocity spectrum and compared between des and sas approach such comparison is often reported to determine time scale of the energy containing turbulent eddies in the case of ship airwake aerodynamics zan 2005 forrest and owen 2010 the power spectral density psd plot has frequently been used to identify the frequency containing the majority of the energy in an unsteady signal the psd is defined as the power in the fluctuating turbulent velocity in a given longitudinal transverse vertical direction this is calculated as the square of the fourier transform of the flow velocity divided by the duration of the time sample this provides an energy per unit time per frequency band and is commonly referred as power spectral density to calculate the power spectra of velocity the time histories of axial component of velocity data is recorded at probe points located at x l lhd 0 5 y w b 0 z h hgr 0 5 over the helodeck fig 11 shows the comparison of spectral analysis of longitudinal velocity fluctuations over the helodeck in between experiments and numerical predictions of sas and des the psd plot indicates that the sas prediction is able to resolve the turbulent energy same as des up to range 0 1 3 hz effectively for higher frequency the des resolves the turbulent energy effectively whereas the sas approach is unable to resolve the turbulence energy to the same extent which is due to the limitations of sas model formulation overall it is observed that the peak of spectral analysis for both the solution lies nearly in the same range 0 1 3 hz which matches reasonably well with the in house experimental result literature reveals that for relatively high reynolds numbers flow the vortex shedding does not occur at a single distinct frequency but rather over a narrow band of frequencies forrest and owen 2010 de sampaio and coutinho 2000 therefore the flow past a ship airwake consists of a wide range of length and time scales leading to a dominant frequency range rather than a definite peak further this velocity spectrum variation also indicates that the flow over the ship helodeck contain significant amount of low frequency energy carried by the large scale eddies ranges 0 1 3 hz this energy is mainly carried by the large scale eddies in the process of formation of larger eddies into smaller eddies many of these eddy structures could be of similar scale as the helicopter rotor which may significantly influence the rotor motion and affect the shipboard helicopter launch and recovery operations hence it can be said that the landing location situated close to the helo hangar i e inside the wake could adversely affects the onboard helicopter operation overall it is concluded from the instantaneous flow quantities performance comparison that the sas method performs reasonably well and able to resolve the dominant ship airwake turbulent energy range with solution accuracy close to des now correlating the discussion made in section 5 2 fig 6 it is now understood that the des method is able to resolve relatively more turbulence scales among the three unsteady numerical approaches and thus offers better predictions in the mean flow characteristics also on the other side the steady rans formulation does not account for the unsteadiness as well as the scale resolving ability and thus the predictions do not capture the crucial nature of the flow and thus offers relatively poor predictions in the mean flow characteristics further it is also verified that the flow over the ship helodeck has a large velocity deficit region wake region exists behind the helo hangar which is associated with steep velocity gradients unsteady recirculating flows and asymmetry flow topology even at headwind condition occurrence of this asymmetric flow phenomena has already been investigated by several researchers and termed as flow bi stability shukla et al 2020b syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 thornber et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 6 conclusions the present study offers comparative assessment of various unsteady turbulence modelling approaches in predictions of ship airwake characteristics three unsteady numerical approaches rans sas and des are extensively evaluated the unsteady numerical approaches being considered for the investigations are also compared with steady rans numerical approach in order to gauge the percentage changes in the mean flow statistics the overall evaluation based on mean and instantaneous flow features show that the des and sas methods are able to resolve the dominate frequency range 0 1 2 hz reasonably well and also capture the unsteadiness of ship airwake characteristics effectively the urans method fails to capture the flow unsteadiness effectively further it is also important to note that the variation of mean flow features between the unsteady approaches des and sas and steady rans solution is marginally within the range of 2 5 whereas the computational burden is almost one thirtieth of des and one twentieth of sas respectively based on this study it is concluded that the steady rans method can be adopted for the parametric studies at initial stages subsequently the unsteady investigation can be pursued only for the optimised cases in the final stage either with the des or sas method depending on availability of the computational resources the summary of main conclusions from this study includes the following it is found that des and sas both can resolve the dominant frequency range 0 1 2 hz reasonably well and model the unsteadiness of ship airwake characteristics effectively it is concluded that the sas approach could be a suitable passage from urans to scale resolving simulation especially to deal with the complex ship airwake at relatively coarser grids and provide a cost effective option for the prediction of the unsteady ship airwakes flow phenomena it is found that the mean flow variation between the unsteady and steady numerical method is marginal and within the range of 2 5 thus this supports that the mean flow statistics gathered from steady rans approach can be used to evaluate the parametric investigations overall the sas approach deemed to be most suitable for the unsteady simulations whereas the application of the steady rans approach can be suitable in the initial stage of parametric optimisation studies credit authorship contribution statement shrish shukla conceptualization methodology

20788,an early assessment of the ship airwake characteristics is one of the most challenging tasks associated with the designing of vessels the design of warship superstructures has traditionally followed the basic polyhedron shape box type structures to achieve the desired stealth capability however presence of such a box shape bluff superstructure generates massively separated airwake over the ship helodeck region this airwake results into complex flow phenomena which carry strong velocity gradients in space and time along with widely varying turbulence length scales under such conditions the launch and recovery of a shipboard helicopter operations are very hazardous thus an accurate assessment of the resultant ship airwake flow phenomena at early design stages is desirable we present a comparative time accurate assessment study in order to gain a better understanding of the capability of the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans the scale adaptive simulation sas and the detached eddy simulation des turbulence models in predicting turbulent ship airwake characteristics detailed comparisons are conducted with respect to the in house experimental data results show that the des and sas produce nearly similar trends of the mean flow properties when compared to the experimental results however comparisons of velocity spectra indicate that sas can resolve the dominant large scale turbulent flow structures with less computational burden further this study also attempts to compare the variation of mean flow quantities with steady rans approach in order to quantify the percentage variation between the predictions of the steady and unsteady turbulence modelling approach keywords ship airwake generic frigate ship hybrid les rans urans sas des separated flow turbulent flow computational fluid dynamics 1 introduction the operation of helicopters onboard ships has always been a very complex task owing to the presence of massively separated ship airwakes high velocity gradients widely varying turbulence length scales these complexities arise mainly because of the box shaped bluff body superstructure of the ship also the presence of a large bluff superstructure with various military appendages create complex airwake environment over the ship rear deck i e helodeck flight deck the resultant airwake flow over the helodeck contains i widely time varying turbulence structures ii steep velocity gradients iii highly separated flow and iv the interaction of unstable separating shear layers and vortices these difficulties are more aggravated in the case of small vessels such as frigate or destroyer class ships due to the confined deck area moreover the inclusion of new design features to accommodate various military armaments on a small confined vessel poses novel challenges all such requirements often lead to aerodynamic implications on the ship s performance by promoting the large scale flow separation in the wake healey 1987 further these flow complexities together can have a significant impact on the shipborne helicopter operations it is found that the dominant turbulent energy in the frequency range of 0 1 2 hz over the helodeck has a significant impact on the helicopter aerodynamics zan 2005 thus from an engineering point of view there is a strong need to establish a suitable and economical unsteady numerical modelling approach which can resolve the unsteady ship airwake flow characteristics reasonably well at the early design stage itself with this motivation a significant number of papers dealing with computational studies on various aspects of the ship airwake aerodynamics were gathered during our literature survey shukla et al 2019a these studies reveal that the flow past a generic ship body is i massively separated ii highly unsteady and three dimensional and iii the airwake characteristics are independent of reynolds number re beyond 104 based on ship beam at such high reynolds number the flow over a ship and the wake are fully turbulent and the flow structures are nearly unchanged despite the flow being highly unsteady in nature the literature reveals that the steady unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach are the most preferred choice for the numerical modelling of the ship airwakes the reason behind such preference is mainly due to its robustness and computationally less expensive as compared to the conventional unsteady cfd approaches such as direct numerical simulation dns and large eddy simulation les for a higher reynolds number flow the ship airwake contains a wide spectrum of turbulence scales hence application of dns or les in such scenarios is expected to be prohibitively very expensive therefore both these approaches are still not practical at early design stages for the engineering applications like a ship where the order of reynolds number is typically in the range of 104 107 in contrast the disadvantages of traditional rans models are i it has several modelling uncertainties and ii it often fails in the prediction of massively separated flows the reason behind such deficiency in performance because the traditional rans approach models all the flow scales and involve several arbitrary coefficients with single point closures thus it is not able to efficiently deal with the highly separated bluff body flows where multi point statistics plays a critical role in the flow physics shukla et al 2019a one of the key motivations behind conducting such a scale resolve simulation in ship building industry is mainly to get detail insight of the airwake s flow phenomena to gauge the overall performance of the vessel under different wind conditions the outcome of such a flow analysis is very important from the design aspect and it helps to optimize the ship superstructure shape and size at an early design stage moreover these kinds of ship airwake predictions are also used for piloted flight simulations which are later used to assess the shipboard helicopter launch and recovery operations roper et al 2006 thus from a naval architecture and researcher point of view there is a strong need to establish a suitable and economical unsteady numerical modelling approach which can resolve the unsteady ship airwake flow characteristics reasonably and can capture the dominant frequency range effectively for the piloted flight simulator analysis in this context the use of rans based hybrid turbulence models is a preferred choice due to its lesser computational demand and wide range of application hence the performance of the three unsteady modelling approaches namely urans sas and des are evaluated in order to predict the ship airwake characteristics the key objective of this study is to examine the performance of the urans sas and des approaches for their capability of resolving the dominant ship airwake turbulent frequency range a k ω sst framework based urans sas and des simulations of flow past a generic simplified frigate ship sfs2 at reynolds number re 6 104 have been performed and compared in the present work extensive comparisons are presented in terms of i mean flow field characteristics and ii instantaneous flow field characteristics to qualitatively and quantitatively examine the overall performance of the three numerical approaches under consideration further an attempt has also been to gauge the variation of mean flow parameters over the helodeck region between the unsteady and steady flow modelling approaches and quantify the percentage change it is expected that such quantification would provide a benchmark guideline of accuracy versus cost estimate and it may also pave the path to establish suitable technique criteria gauging the ship helicopter flow characteristics based on the mean flow parameters to the best of the author s knowledge there is no such study reported in the literature which highlights the extent of variations in the mean flow variables for unsteady and steady flow modelling approaches in context of the ship airwake this paper is organized into six sections in section 2 a brief background of numerical approaches under consideration is given from mathematical formulation point of view following this a detail discussion on the adopted numerical methodology including brief details of the turbulence modelling and governing equations are presented in section 3 subsequently section 4 presents the computational setup including details of the geometry configuration grid generation computational domain solver settings and boundary conditions followed by a justification of the choice of time step and time averaging procedure section 5 gives the results and discussion including code validation comparison to experimental results and then the performance comparisons of all the numerical approaches under consideration finally section 6 concludes the paper with a summary of the important findings and possible future directions 2 background in recent years the study of massively separated high reynolds number ship airwake flow and its numerical modelling became a vibrant research area after the inception of high performance computing technology shukla et al 2014 2017a 2017b 2018 2019b 2020a in the present context the development of efficient high fidelity numerical techniques to accurately assess the ship airwake flow phenomena and to bridge the gap between the les and rans approach is one of the popular research trends in the computational fluid dynamics cfd domain polsky et al 2000 syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 thornber et al 2010 shukla et al 2015 2020b zhang et al 2018 the main objective of developing such approaches is mainly to accurately predict the complex high reynolds number bluff body flows at relatively less computational burden in the last one decade several numerical methods have evolved and implemented to investigate the massively separated airwake flow characteristics namely hybrid rans les models such as detached eddy simulation des see details spalart 2001 hybrid second generation urans models such as scale adaptive simulation sas see details menter and egorov 2010 and partially averaged navier stokes pans see details girimaji 2006 the des method is based on the hybrid formulation of les and rans spalart 2001 this hybrid formulation links the turbulent length scale to the grid spacing in the region of interest such that the formulation automatically increases the level of eddy viscosity and switches from les to rans where the grid spacing is relatively high compared to the turbulent length scale this increase in eddy viscosity results into artificial damping of the flow field perturbations by the turbulence model and breaks the turbulent structures to propagate further in rans mode by switching from les to rans variables in the region of coarser grid the des avoids the burden of resolving small scale motion especially in the near wall region by reducing the burden of having a very fine mesh requirement at the same time the des smoothly shifts to les and reliably resolves the wider scales of airwake in regions away from walls thus it is anticipated that the des approach numerically performs close to les and better than the traditional urans approach however the application of des is slightly computationally expensive at the early stages of design the sas and pans both approaches are classified under the second generation urans models the traditional rans models do not involve physical length scales whereas the les model contains explicitly a length scale associated with the numerical grid this length scale mainly determine the size of the resolved fluctuations recently there have been some new rans models derived which are able to resolve substantial part of the turbulent fluctuations without involving the explicit dependency on the numerical grid these kinds of models are termed as second generation urans models frohlich and terzi 2008a in contrast to the traditional rans these kinds of models contain some additional terms in the evolution equation which sense the amount of resolved fluctuations the sas approach is proposed by menter and egorov 2010 this model is originally derived from the rotta k kl model where k is the turbulent kinetic energy and l is the macro length of turbulence the authors used transport equations for k and φ k l and showed that the k l transport equation adds an extra term of von karman length scale into the turbulence length scale equation due to this extra length scale term the sas model can resolve substantial portion of the turbulent fluctuations in unsteady flow in essence as compared to the traditional urans model the sas model contains two length scales a classical one which is related to first derivative of resolved velocity analogous to the traditional rans model and a second one due to the extra term of von karman length scale which is related to the second derivative of the resolved velocity this method does not explicitly require a very fine grid resolution and allows to dynamically adjust the resolved structures in a urans simulation thus the sas model can demonstrate a behavior similar to the des model in unsteady regions of the flow field at the computational burden equal to urans and signifies an alternative unsteady simulation technique this allows an efficient passage from urans to scale resolve simulation and has been used especially for the massively separated flows such as flows around airfoil zheng et al 2016 cylinders and simplified vehicles egorov et al 2010 menter and egorov 2005 3 numerical methodology this section describes the adopted methodology in terms of undertaken turbulence modelling approaches and their governing equations in the present study we mainly focus on the top side ship airwake characteristics and hence the effect of ship motion is not modelled a three dimensional k ω sst framework based urans sas and des model are employed for the present numerical study the governing equations of all the three approaches are given in the following subsections 3 1 sst k ω model the shear stress transport sst k ω model was developed to effectively blend the robust and accurate formulation of the standard k ω model in the near wall region and k ε model in the far field to achieve a seamless blend transport equations for turbulent kinetic energy k and specific dissipation rate ω are solved to specify the turbulent viscosity mentor 1994 equations 1 and 2 the transport

dissipation rate due to mean velocity gradients respectively the y k and y ω represent the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence d ω represents the cross diffusion term the s k and s ω are user defined source terms and the γ k and γ ω represent the effective diffusivity of k and ω respectively which are calculated as described below the effective diffusivities for the sst k ω model are given by 3 γ k μ μ t σ k γ ω μ μ t σ ω where σk and σω are the turbulent prandtl numbers for k and ω respectively the turbulent viscosity μ t is computed as follows 4 μ t ρ k ω 1 m a x 1 α s f 2 α 1 ω where s is the strain rate magnitude 3 2 scale adaptive simulation model the scale adaptive simulation model is based on the reformulation of rottas s equation for the integral length scale which provide one kind of a blend between rotta k kl and sst k ω model menter and egorov 2010 egorov et al 2008 in sas model the scale defining equation is derived from the exact transport equation of the turbulent length scale as proposed by rotta 1968 along with the second derivative of the velocity field as source term see detail rotta 1972 the scale adaptive simulation model is formulated as two equation model with the variable φ k l for the scale equation as shown 5 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k c μ 3 4 ρ k 2 x i μ t σ k k x j 6 ρ t ρ u j x j k p k a 1 a 2 l l v k 2 a 3 ρ k x j μ t σ x j 7 l v k k u u u u i

authors recast the sas approach with an additional source term in the ω with some minor changes egorov et al 2010 the latest version of the additional source term source term is 9 f s a s m a x ρ a 4 k s 2 l l v k 2 c 2 ρ k m a x 1 ω 2 ω x j ω x j 1 k 2 k x j k x j 0 with a 4 3 51 and c 2 further other variants have also been proposed for sas model namely one equation variant where solving for only a single equation for φ k l and replacing the transport equation for k by the algebraic expression v t s c μ c μ 1 4 s see menter et al 2006 for more details the sas model formulation is having an extra term von karman length scale l v k 7 in unsteady separated flow cases this term being dominate over the other terms and result into the full activation of the sas model functionality accordingly the model can reduce the turbulent viscosity by adding to the production term in the ω equation instead of increasing the dissipation term in the k equation in the des approach hence this model can produce reasonable spectra for turbulence without explicit grid or time step dependency and behaves similar to des in many situations this method deemed to be a safer passage from urans to scale resolving simulation especially for complex applications at relatively coarser grids especially where high quality les grids cannot be generated for the massively separated flow regions 3 3 detached eddy simulation model the des model was first introduced by spalart and co workers spalart 2001 to eliminate the main limitations of les models by proposing a hybrid les rans formulation this hybrid formulations works on this blending framework a typical blending framework form for the given hybrid model is given by 10 h y b r i d f r a n s 1 f l e s w i t h 0 f 1 where φ represents the quantity to be modelled in the momentum equation the f is a blending factor for this framework both one equation and two equation rans based models are used see spalart 2001 for details for two equation based framework sst k ω model is used with this formulation the wall boundary layers are entirely covered by the sst k ω rans model and the free shear flows away from the walls are typically handled in les mode the advantage of des framework that it is simple and can be clubbed with any rans based models des was the first hybrid model which allows a smooth transition between les and urans the switch between rans and les on des model is based on the criterion as 11 c d e s δ m a x l t for rans c d e s δ m a x l t for les δ m a x max δ x δ y δ z where δ m a x is the maximum edge length of the local computational grid the detailed formulation for a two equation model sst k ω is as follow 12 ρ k t ρ u j k x j p k ρ k 3 2 min l t c d e s δ m a x x j μ μ t σ k k x j 13 l t k 3 2 ε k β ω the dissipation term in the equation 12 is reformulated as 14 e d e s ρ k 3 2 min l t c d e s δ ρ k 3 2 l t min 1 c d e s δ l t ρ k 3 2 l t max 1 l t c d e s δ 15 e d e s ρ k 3 2 l t max 1 l t c d e s δ 1 f d e s where the constant c d e s 0 65 the function of f d e s designed in such a way as to give f d e s 1 inside the wall boundary layer and f d e s 0 away from the wall in other words the des model allows yielding a suitable description of the near wall flow in a statistical sense which only requires a fine grid in the wall normal direction and it can be used with a relatively coarse grid in the tangential direction the switch between the rans and les approaches is accomplished by an automated criterion given in equation 11 frohlich and terzi 2008b 4 computational setup all the computations presented in this paper have been performed using a three dimensional incompressible commercial solver ansys fluent the fluent code discretizes the navier stokes equations using a cell centred finite volume method on unstructured grids and then solves the governing equations of steady unsteady rans srans urans sas and des further the grids are generated using ansys icem mesh generation tool with hexahedral elements to setup the overall computational procedure the des predictions of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 was considered as a reference detail of geometry computational domain boundary conditions and solver settings are highlighted in the subsequent sections 4 1 geometry configurations the present study uses the simplified frigate ship model sfs2 as a generic configuration of frigate ship geometry as shown in fig 1 this configuration was developed as a part of an international collaboration under the technical cooperation program ttcp roper et al 2006 in order to validate the various cfd codes used for study of ship airwakes and to generate validation data through model testing zan 2005 the sfs2 generic model represents the major design features of a modern warship including i a full breadth superstructure containing a forward bow and a rear deck helodeck and ii a small top superstructure bridge ahead of the hangar dimensional ratios for this model are very similar to the frigate and destroyer classes of warships the 1 100 scale wooden model of ship was fabricated and being used for the in house wind tunnel piv experiments the ship beam wb equal to 0 14 m is considered as a characteristic dimension the dimensions of the ship geometry are given with respect to the ship beam fig 1 4 2 computational grid the grid generation is quite significant in computational modelling since the discretizing of computational domain the solving processing time computational burden rate of convergence and capability to capture the required flow accurately are solely dependent on the quality of grid grid size grid growth and grid refinement region the hexahedral grids provide considerable advantage in terms of low cell count per unit area compared to the hybrid or tetra grid thus the hexahedral grid with boundary layer elements near bodies and grid refinement region is used for the present study among the three approaches under consideration the des method is highly gird sensitive as discussed earlier therefore an adequate level of grid refinement is necessary close to wall as well as in the region of interest i e helodeck for better flow field accuracy in order to reasonably resolve the flow structures close to the ship wall accurately the o grid technique is used to create dense grids near to the walls further the grid refinement region across the helodeck is provided based on standard cfd practices the key challenge on this grid is in mainly dealing with the smooth cell growth to maintain the satisfactory aspect ratio especially around the sharp triangular bow region as discussed earlier the des method is most demanding in terms of grid resolution among all the three approaches under consideration at the same time it is also difficult to assess the quality of the mesh by conducting a grid independence study for such computationally expensive unsteady simulation thus a fine grid size of 6 5 million with non dimensional wall unit y 5 is used following the guidelines of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 the non dimensional grid size in three coordinate directions kept at δx 100 δy 5 and δz 50 with local grid spacing δ 0 h h g r 1 7 10 2 in the region of interest also it is deemed that the fine grid resolution based on the des model guidelines would be suitable for the other approaches as well the overall grids across the computational domain and a grid refinement region in the vicinity of the ship helodeck including near wall and region of interest is shown in fig 2 4 3 computational domain the selection of computational domain is based on consideration of the cross sectional dimensions of wind tunnel in which the in house piv measurement were conducted the ship model is positioned symmetrically over the test section center the error estimated in the positioning of the model is estimated to be within 1 mm the projected cross section of the model is nearly 163 cm2 against the wind tunnel test cross section of 3375 cm2 which gives a blockage ratio within 5 the cross section of computational domain is taken same as the wind tunnel dimension i e 3 5 wb 5 5 wb whereas the upstream distance between inlet and for of the ship is10 wb and the downstream distance between aft of the ship and outlet is 25 wb are considered with respect to the ship beam wb being the characteristic length the co ordinate dimensions and velocities are denoted by x and u in streamwise direction y and v in the transverse direction and z and w in the vertical direction respectively the co ordinate origin is positioned in the symmetry plane at the height of the helodeck from bottom and at the end of the hangar i e starting of the rear step fig 3 4 4 solver settings and boundary conditions the closure equation set of k ω sst framework based urans sas and des model are integrated over the discretized computational domain by the cell centred finite volume method and interpolations are introduced for the fluxes in the surface integrals method for better accuracy the spatial discretization of the convective term a bounded central difference scheme is used and a second order accurate central differencing discretization scheme is used for the diffusive terms for the pressure velocity coupling the pressure implicit with splitting of operator piso algorithm is used which solves the pressure correction equation in an iterative method until the desired convergence is achieved the boundary conditions are adopted as per the literature shukla et al 2019a a pressure based solver is used along with incompressible steady air flow consideration under atmospheric pressure field the turbulence specifications namely turbulent intensity and length scale are considered based on the literature shukla et al 2014 polsky et al 2000 syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 in our simulations we assume that vwind and vship are coplanar with the ocean surface the relative wind velocity vwind v wod u and its direction is represented by ψ yaw wind over deck angle all simulations are performed under headwind ψ 00 at re 6 104 based on ship beam the following boundary conditions are prescribed in the solver fig 3 o as the wind tunnel experiments are being modelled thus the wall boundary condition with no slip for all the three velocity components is applied at far field of computational domain i e port side starboard wide and top respectively similarly wall with no slip condition is assigned on the ship o velocity inlet is provided at upstream of the ship as uniform flow velocity with the turbulence intensity of 1 of the freestream kinetic energy at a length scale of 0 3 cm at standard atmosphere conditions o outlet is assigned as a fixed static pressure condition with the flux constrained to be parallel to the free stream flow at atmosphere conditions 4 5 choice of time step and time averaging procedure the choice of an adequate time step is very important to ensure spatial and temporal resolution of the solution to identify the optimal time step we have followed two considerations i the cfl criteria forrest and owen 2010 and ii solver recommendation for capturing the dominate frequency fluent theory guide 2015 the reason behind to consider the solver recommendations while selecting the time step for given grid is mainly to classify the upper bound flow resolving limit of the des model as our key intent is to accurately capture the dominant ship airwake turbulent energy frequency range of 0 1 2 hz over the helodeck as it is known that the disturbances at frequencies above 2 hz does not affect the shipboard helicopter operations forrest and owen 2010 thus the performance assessment of the methods under consideration would be logical and competitive for resolving the dominant frequency range in line with the above two considerations the cfl criteria led to a lower limit of time step value as δt 1 10 4 s and the upper limit of time step is decided from the solver recommendation which is 100 time steps per period of the dominant frequency range fluent theory guide 2015 the dominant frequency range for the ship airwakes is reported to lie in between 0 1 and 2 hz healey 1987 zan 2005 shukla et al 2019a thus this led to an upper bound of the time step value δt 2 10 2 s the choice of lower time step would definitely resolve more turbulent energy at higher frequency in the case of des approach however the same has not been valid in the case of urans and sas methods and it would drastically increase the simulation time consequently the increase in computational expense by selecting a smaller time step is not justified with this understanding we deemed that the choice of time step in between the lower limit and upper limit would be a suitable time step for the comparative assessment later to verify this we had conducted time step independence exercise using time steps scaled by a factor of 5 between the above mentioned time step range to test the spatial and temporal sensitivity of the solution comparison of mean flow statistics to experimental data demonstrated that the time step value δt 1 10 3 s is appropriate and changing the time step lower than this value had very little effect on the spatial and temporal resolution of the solution thus the time step value 1 10 3 s has been used for all the three unsteady approaches under consideration further we also conducted an exercise to identify the optimal number of sub iterations at every time step calculation outcome of this exercise showed that 40 iterations per time step gave at least four orders of magnitude drop in the continuity residual and at least five in the others increasing the number of sub iterations beyond 40 did not increase convergence significantly but added considerably increased the run time thus the number of sub iterations value 40 has been used in all the simulations all the governing equations are time marched using a second order accurate time stepping scheme all the unsteady computations are run initially for approximately 50 non dimensional time units t physical time convective time scale which is equivalent to approximately 7 5 s of physical flow time the initial run of computations for this much time is required to remove the start up transients before the unsteady sampling can be started to ensure this the analysis of velocity time histories are monitored separately and it is found that a time of 7 5 s is sufficient for the ship airwakes to reach a statistically steady state afterwards the instantaneous flow statistics for the next 200 non dimensional time units which is equivalent to approximately 30 s of physical flow time were gathered the mean flow statistics were then calculated from the gathered data by performing temporal averaging a large number of flow time units are considered mainly for precise comparative assessment 5 results and discussions this section presents the results and discussions of the comparative assessment between the three unsteady approaches under consideration detail discussions on qualitatively and quantitatively comparison are covered under the three sub sections firstly the code validation and comparison to experimental data lee 2003 is discussed in section 5 1 subsequently the extensive performance comparison of the numerical approaches under consideration is presented in terms of mean flow characteristics in section 5 2 and instantaneous flow characteristics in section 5 3 respectively the comparison of mean flow characteristics also includes the variation of mean flow quantities with steady rans approach in order to quantify the percentage deviations between the predictions of the steady and unsteady turbulence modelling approach 5 1 code validation and comparison to experimental data code validation is an important activity to ascertain the reliability of the adopted cfd methodology in any numerical study we conducted the code validation exercise against the experimental results lee 2003 and des results forrest and owen 2010 available for the sfs geometry in literature subsequently we also evaluated the performance of all the numerical methods under consideration in the present study by comparing it against the experimental results lee 2003 separately details of the individual comparison cases are discussed in successive paragraphs for code validation the des prediction is compared against the available experimental data of national research council nrc lee 2003 and des results of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 for headwind condition ψ 00 the measurements were conducted by nrc in three dimensional space using hot film anemometry and hence the mean velocity data reported is for all the three mean velocity components u v w it is already highlighted in literature that the flow over the helodeck is highly three dimensional shukla et al 2019a thus we deemed that validation using all the three velocity component is necessary to ascertain the accuracy of the initial stage des simulations moreover this exercise will also ensure that the grid size and time step adopted for the des simulation is appropriate to predict the unsteady flow behavior of ship airwake and can be employed to other approaches as well the des predictions for all the three mean velocity components are compared with experimental lee 2003 and computational forrest and owen 2010 results over the helodeck at location of x l h d k 0 5 across the ship beam at non dimensional height of z h h g r 1 as shown in fig 4 this location is chosen as limited measurement data is available for the headwind condition in open literature variation of all the three mean velocity components between experimental lee 2003 and computational results of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 highlight that there is hardly any variation in both the des solutions further it is also seen that the predicted des solution is found to match reasonably with the reported experimental lee 2003 as well as des forrest and owen 2010 results subsequently we evaluate the performance of all the numerical methods under consideration i e des sas urans unsteady rans and srans steady rans by comparing it against the experimental lee 2003 results in fig 5 variation of all three components of velocity is plotted at x l h d k 0 5 along the ship beam at non dimensional hangar height of z h h g r 1 the comparison of predicted des fig 5 a and sas fig 5 b results is found to be reasonably matching with the experimental data with very minor variations however the predictions of urans fig 5 c and srans fig 5 d are seen to be slightly deviated especially for the streamwise and vertical component of velocity compared to the experimental results overall it is seen that all four predictions match reasonably with the experimental data with minor variations the agreement between the numerical predictions and the experimental data for the generic ship sfs2 configuration is deemed to be satisfying based on this overall evaluation exercise we deem that our cfd methodology is reliable enough to be employed for further comparative assessment of des sas urans and srans turbulence modelling approach in the predictions of massively separated ship airwake characteristics details of extensive performance comparison among all the above turbulence modelling approaches are presented in the subsequent sections 5 2 performance comparison based on mean flow characteristics in this section we present the performance comparison of all the three unsteady numerical predictions along with the steady rans prediction based on the mean flow field statistics and attempt to establish the percentage deviations between the solution of steady and unsteady turbulence modelling approach further we also present a detail discussion on the mean flow characteristics exists over the flight deck to gain a better insight into the resultant ship airwake phenomena evaluation of the mean flow quantities is done with respect to the streamwise velocity as an assessment parameter during our in house experimental measurements of an isolated ship sfs2 configuration it was found that the airwake flow characteristics on the helodeck is primarily governed by the streamwise velocity at headwind condition shukla 2020 therefore the streamwise velocity comparison is presented between our in house experimental and all the four numerical predictions the in house measurements were undertaken by particle image velocimetry piv on a rectangular measurement plane having dimensions of 30 cm length 22 5 cm width over the helodeck rotor plane x y plane a total of 600 instantaneous flow field images were obtained at the measurement plane which are post processed to calculate the time averaged mean flow field fig 6 shows the normalized streamwise velocity contour plots at heights z h hgr 0 5 over the helodeck in a longitudinal plane x y plane in our in house experiments shukla 2020 we have conducted measurement at four longitudinal planes located at z h hgr 0 1 helo touch down height z h hgr 0 5 helo hovering height z h hgr 1 helo hangar height and z h hgr 1 2 helo approaching height respectively among these four locations the experimental results have shown drastically increase in flow disturbance on the plane located at z h hgr 0 5 i e the helo hovering height also we found that the flow over the helodeck it highly unsteady three dimensional and massively separated with having a bi stable behaviour it was found that the bi stable behaviour causes the flow asymmetric which is more striking at plane located at height z h hgr 0 5 occurrence of this flow phenomenon mainly causes the drastic increment in the flow disturbance therefore we deemed that the z h hgr 0 5 location would be the most critical and the same has been considered for overall comparison to get a better estimate of the performance of numerical techniques under consideration it is seen that all the numerical approaches capture the mean flow physics reasonably with slight change in recirculation region compared to experimental data fig 6 a one can see that the des and sas nearly predict the same extent of recirculation region as observed in experiments whereas the urans approach underpredicts the recirculation region but the variation is within 5 the srans approach relatively more underpredicts the extent of recirculation region with variation up to 15 importantly one can also see that the asymmetry feature of the flow is captured by all the three unsteady approaches with minor variation fig 6 b c d however the steady rans approach could not be able to capture this asymmetry feature of the flow fig 6 e while correlating the experimental results we found that this asymmetry feature of the flow is mainly induced due to the bi stable flow behaviour which is purely an unsteady phenomenon therefore the same was not able to capture by the steady rans predictions due to its modelling limitation which does not take into account the unsteadiness of the flow further to have a quantitative comparison among all the predictions the cumulative error over the plane has been evaluated for all the four numerical approaches by comparing with the experiments and are given as percentage error in table 1 the table also gives an approximate estimate of the simulation time in terms of wall clock time on a local workstation the error calculation between the experimental and numerical predictions are undertaken based on the cumulative root mean square rms approach the rms is calculated for the predicted mean flow variables the values are extracted at the corresponding grid points from the computational domain from the converged solution for all the corresponding measured planes afterwards the difference between the measured and the computed values of normalized flow variable is calculated for example the resultant velocity v is calculated for all the corresponding grid pixel points finally the percentage of error between the experimental measurements and the numerical prediction is thereafter calculated at plane z h hgr 0 5 by using equation 16 16 percentage error on each plane 1 n i 1 n v v w e x p v v w c f d 2 where v is the resultant velocity in m sec vw is the wind velocity or free stream velocity in m sec v vw exp is the normalized resultant velocity from experimental measurements v vw cfd is the normalized resultant velocity from numerical simulation and n is the number of data points overall it is seen that the des approach shows an error of less than 5 whereas the sas and urans approach show an error of about 6 and 7 respectively the error for srans approach is around 8 the calculation time is very high for the des followed by sas urans and srans the relative comparison of the computational burden with respect to the steady rans computation time shows that the des is nearly 30 times costly followed by the sas which is around 20 times costly and then the urans which is nearly 18 times costly however the error variation corresponding computational burden between them is around 3 2 and 1 respectively more importantly the error variation between des and sas is around 1 whereas the computational time approximately is one and half times less for sas the sas and urans prediction show the deviation in error to be around 1 and the computational time is approximately same based on this comparison the sas approach deemed to be most suitable for the unsteady simulations whereas the srans approach can be considered to be suitable in the initial stage of parametric optimisation studies 5 2 1 analysis of mean flow characteristics over the helodeck in this section we present a detail analysis of the resultant turbulent ship airwake characteristics over the helodeck with respect to the helicopter landing approach reported literatures have highlighted that the most routine ship based helicopter landing operations are performed under three common key stages namely i approach sidestep ii station keeping hovering over the deck and iii vertical landing these key stages are often referred as mission task elements stage mtes forrest and owen 2010 among these three stages the second stage is considered most critical in terms of the pilot workload shukla et al 2019a during the stage 1 to stage 2 the helicopter starts going into the highly unsteady airwake region and hover over the moving deck for quite some time prior to achieve the quiescent period for landing i e stage 3 taking a cue from this information we conducted the mean flow analysis with respect to the mtes stages to get a better perspective of the helodeck flow field fig 7 a and b shows the variation of time averaged non dimensional streamwise velocity at heights z h hgr 0 1 and 1 0 over the helodeck respectively in fig 7 a it is clearly seen that the reverse flow zone extends nearly up to the half of the helodeck length close observation also shows that the extent of the recirculation region slightly extended towards the downstream compared to z h hgr 0 5 fig 6 more importantly the flow seems to lose the asymmetric behaviour and is seen nearly symmetric possibly due to the effect of the helodeck surface correlating trends at z h hgr 0 1 and 0 5 suggested that only the second half of the ship deck region i e downstream of x l hdk 0 5 would be suitable region for shipborne helicopter operations subsequently on the top plane z h hgr 1 0 the velocity deficit area is relatively less spread out in the spanwise direction and there is no negative velocity region seen in fig 7 b the region of low momentum region ranges between 0 and 0 4 restricted up to x l hdk 0 15 and offers relatively higher headwind component over the rotor plane which is necessary to provide higher safe margin for recovery of the helicopter overall the flow variations seen at the top plane is mostly attributed by the top deck superstructure i e funnel bridge deck overall the comparison of mean flow variation between the three mtes locations shown that the flow over the helodeck is relatively more disturbed on the plane located at the helo hovering height as the asymmetry behaviour of the flow striking more at z h hgr 0 5 fig 6 c to verify this further we compared the measured and predicted time averaged flow streamline structure at z h hgr 0 5 as shown in fig 8 as only a limited experimental data has been generated thus to demonstrate a clear perspective of the three dimensional airwake flow characteristic we present the variation of predicted streamlines over the helodeck at two mutually perpendicular planes i e z h hgr 0 5 and y w b 0 as shown in fig 8 b further fig 8 a shows the flow streamlines to be intricated asymmetric and stretched towards the longitudinal direction while comparing this with predicted flow topology fig 8 b it is now clear that there are three vortices located in the vicinity of the helodeck among these three vortices two are located on the x y plane and another one is located on the x z plane symmetry plane occurrence of the two vortices located on the x y plane indicate the formation of an inverted three dimensional horseshoe shape vortex whose end remains attached to the helodeck surface and could be in a bi stable state thus seen asymmetric on the other side the vortex present in the symmetry plane is formed due to the step of ship superstructure and indicates the formation of d shaped vortex as a results of flow separation and formation of a recirculation zone overall it is concluded that the flow over the helodeck is highly three dimensional and massively separated with having a bi stable behaviour it is also verified that the flow asymmetric which is more striking at plane located at height z h hgr 0 5 could be the cause of significant adverse effect produced by the drastic increment in the flow disturbance due to the bi stability 5 3 performance comparison based on instantaneous flow characteristics in order to assess the performance of des sas and urans predictions the qualitative and quantitative instantaneous flow field comparison is presented with respect to the formation of eddy structures of the airwake section 5 3 1 b time histories variation section 5 3 2 and c power spectral density psd of velocity field section 5 3 3 5 3 1 formation of eddy structures of the airwake this section presents the formation of eddy structures of the ship airwake over the helodeck using iso surface of λ2 criterion λ2 is defined as the 2nd eigen value of the of the sum of square of the strain rate and rotation tensor s2 ω2 a small negative value of λ2 can show coherent eddy structures in the flow field fig 9 shows the variation of the instantaneous flow field in terms of formation of eddy vortex structure through the iso surface of negative value of λ2 across the ship the iso surface of λ2 plot is frequently used to demonstrate the level of the eddy structures of the flow being resolved to illustrate the variation of vortex core flow structure over the helodeck a top view of the iso surface is presented and compared for all the three unsteady approaches the figure demonstrates the complex nature of eddy flow structures associated with the ship airwake present over the helodeck it is observed that the urans prediction fig 9 c shows relatively very weak eddy structures probably due to the lower unsteadiness level in the flow field and seems failed to resolve the flow scales as anticipated earlier in contrast a significant higher number of coherent eddy structures are located over the helodeck in the des predictions fig 9 a and sas predictions fig 9 b focusing on fig 9 a and b it is observed that the des prediction shows very strong and continuous eddy structures over the helodeck whereas the sas prediction shows relatively large eddy structures only reason behind such variation in the occurrence of eddy structures is mainly due to the ability of the des approach to resolve more flow scales associated with the flow close to the les approach one can clearly see that the occurrence of this small eddy structures downstream as a result of the flow interaction with the wake of the top superstructure funnel in des prediction therefore the dense small eddy structures are seen over the helodeck in the des solution fig 9 a on the other side the sas prediction is not able to resolve such small scale eddy structures and thus only large scale eddy structures are seen over the helodeck fig 9 b overall one could say that the des and sas solutions reasonably resolve the large scale eddy flow structures over the helodeck with minor variations similar eddy structures over the helodeck for headwind condition are also reported in des results of forrest et al forrest and owen 2010 5 3 2 time histories variation in this section we present the time history variation of the normalized longitudinal and vertical velocity measured at the probe point located at the centre of the helodeck i e x l lhd 0 5 y w b 0 z h hgr 0 5 for all the three unsteady numerical approaches from fig 10 it is clearly seen that the both the velocity components exhibit unsteadiness throughout the physical time of 30 s for all the three numerical approaches one can observe that trend of time histories does not look significantly different through the whole physical time however the urans prediction shows relatively lower unsteadiness level throughout the physical time with fluctuations ranging between 0 6 and 0 1 and 0 2 to 0 2 times the freestream value for the longitudinal and vertical velocity component respectively on the other side the des and sas predictions exhibit significantly very high unsteadiness throughout the solution time with fluctuations ranging nearly from 0 8 to 0 2 and 0 4 to 0 4 times the freestream value for the longitudinal and vertical velocity component respectively similar trend is also reported for the transverse velocity component though the variation is relatively less and the mean value come close to the zero overall the unsteadiness level depicted by des prediction is seen to be slightly high as compared to the sas prediction correlating this variation with the eddy flow structure comparison fig 9 it is now clear that the urans approach does capture the unsteadiness of the flow throughout the solution time but with significant variation in the fluctuating range compared to des and sas approach also this lower velocity fluctuations seen in the urans solution fig 10 a and b results into the occurrence of relatively few eddy structures over the helodeck fig 9 overall it is verified that the urans predictions are not able to resolve the flow structures effectively due to lower unsteadiness levels hence the urans approach may not be suitable for the prediction of unsteady flow phenomena of ship airwakes over the helodeck the sas method performs reasonably well and its solution accuracy is close to des within certain variation as a result of the sas modelling limits thus the subsequent discussion compares the performance of the sas and des in order to further check the ability to resolve the dominant frequency range 5 3 3 power spectral density of velocity field this section highlights the performance of sas method in terms of velocity spectrum to gauge its effectiveness in resolving the dominant ship airwake frequency range of 0 1 2 hz for this purpose the longitudinal velocity time histories data is used to calculate the velocity spectrum and compared between des and sas approach such comparison is often reported to determine time scale of the energy containing turbulent eddies in the case of ship airwake aerodynamics zan 2005 forrest and owen 2010 the power spectral density psd plot has frequently been used to identify the frequency containing the majority of the energy in an unsteady signal the psd is defined as the power in the fluctuating turbulent velocity in a given longitudinal transverse vertical direction this is calculated as the square of the fourier transform of the flow velocity divided by the duration of the time sample this provides an energy per unit time per frequency band and is commonly referred as power spectral density to calculate the power spectra of velocity the time histories of axial component of velocity data is recorded at probe points located at x l lhd 0 5 y w b 0 z h hgr 0 5 over the helodeck fig 11 shows the comparison of spectral analysis of longitudinal velocity fluctuations over the helodeck in between experiments and numerical predictions of sas and des the psd plot indicates that the sas prediction is able to resolve the turbulent energy same as des up to range 0 1 3 hz effectively for higher frequency the des resolves the turbulent energy effectively whereas the sas approach is unable to resolve the turbulence energy to the same extent which is due to the limitations of sas model formulation overall it is observed that the peak of spectral analysis for both the solution lies nearly in the same range 0 1 3 hz which matches reasonably well with the in house experimental result literature reveals that for relatively high reynolds numbers flow the vortex shedding does not occur at a single distinct frequency but rather over a narrow band of frequencies forrest and owen 2010 de sampaio and coutinho 2000 therefore the flow past a ship airwake consists of a wide range of length and time scales leading to a dominant frequency range rather than a definite peak further this velocity spectrum variation also indicates that the flow over the ship helodeck contain significant amount of low frequency energy carried by the large scale eddies ranges 0 1 3 hz this energy is mainly carried by the large scale eddies in the process of formation of larger eddies into smaller eddies many of these eddy structures could be of similar scale as the helicopter rotor which may significantly influence the rotor motion and affect the shipboard helicopter launch and recovery operations hence it can be said that the landing location situated close to the helo hangar i e inside the wake could adversely affects the onboard helicopter operation overall it is concluded from the instantaneous flow quantities performance comparison that the sas method performs reasonably well and able to resolve the dominant ship airwake turbulent energy range with solution accuracy close to des now correlating the discussion made in section 5 2 fig 6 it is now understood that the des method is able to resolve relatively more turbulence scales among the three unsteady numerical approaches and thus offers better predictions in the mean flow characteristics also on the other side the steady rans formulation does not account for the unsteadiness as well as the scale resolving ability and thus the predictions do not capture the crucial nature of the flow and thus offers relatively poor predictions in the mean flow characteristics further it is also verified that the flow over the ship helodeck has a large velocity deficit region wake region exists behind the helo hangar which is associated with steep velocity gradients unsteady recirculating flows and asymmetry flow topology even at headwind condition occurrence of this asymmetric flow phenomena has already been investigated by several researchers and termed as flow bi stability shukla et al 2020b syms 2008 forrest and owen 2010 thornber et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 6 conclusions the present study offers comparative assessment of various unsteady turbulence modelling approaches in predictions of ship airwake characteristics three unsteady numerical approaches rans sas and des are extensively evaluated the unsteady numerical approaches being considered for the investigations are also compared with steady rans numerical approach in order to gauge the percentage changes in the mean flow statistics the overall evaluation based on mean and instantaneous flow features show that the des and sas methods are able to resolve the dominate frequency range 0 1 2 hz reasonably well and also capture the unsteadiness of ship airwake characteristics effectively the urans method fails to capture the flow unsteadiness effectively further it is also important to note that the variation of mean flow features between the unsteady approaches des and sas and steady rans solution is marginally within the range of 2 5 whereas the computational burden is almost one thirtieth of des and one twentieth of sas respectively based on this study it is concluded that the steady rans method can be adopted for the parametric studies at initial stages subsequently the unsteady investigation can be pursued only for the optimised cases in the final stage either with the des or sas method depending on availability of the computational resources the summary of main conclusions from this study includes the following it is found that des and sas both can resolve the dominant frequency range 0 1 2 hz reasonably well and model the unsteadiness of ship airwake characteristics effectively it is concluded that the sas approach could be a suitable passage from urans to scale resolving simulation especially to deal with the complex ship airwake at relatively coarser grids and provide a cost effective option for the prediction of the unsteady ship airwakes flow phenomena it is found that the mean flow variation between the unsteady and steady numerical method is marginal and within the range of 2 5 thus this supports that the mean flow statistics gathered from steady rans approach can be used to evaluate the parametric investigations overall the sas approach deemed to be most suitable for the unsteady simulations whereas the application of the steady rans approach can be suitable in the initial stage of parametric optimisation studies credit authorship contribution statement shrish shukla conceptualization methodology

20789,the controllability and maneuverability of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv in practical applications need to be properly validated and assessed before the prototype is finalized for manufacturing with regard to mathematical system model of the auv hydrodynamic coefficients have a dominant effect on the quality of vehicle pre testing and evaluation which is crucial to be estimated

errors the oukf identification algorithm is certified to be more precise and superior compared with ekf and ukf approaches in the presence of arma noisy model keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv system identification extended kalman filter ekf unscented kalman filter ukf optimized unscented kalman filter oukf 1 introduction in recent years auv technique had met a growing development in variety of aspects in underwater engineering applications and gradually extended from littoral to offshore areas b allotta et al 2016 j m j journée and w w massie 2001 underwater vehicle would become an indispensable tool in exploitation for seabed resources and complex deep water task johannes falnes 2002 the rising interest is pushing up the refinement for both performance and reliability of the underwater vehicle in this way the hydrodynamic character of an auv is supposed to be a backbone feature while the success of vehicle modeling and designing is concerned for the sake of evaluating the maneuverability and hydrodynamic character before the prototype is finalized for manufacturing a well acceptable mathematical methodology for which describes the transient dynamic response of the underwater vehicle needs to be established by means of hydrodynamic coefficients alexander v inzartsev 2009 j m j journée and jakob pinkster 2002 identification for hydrodynamic model of an auv dominantly depends on the quality of estimation for coupled hydrodynamic coefficients based on highly nonlinear and complicated submerged behavior of the vehicle thor i fossen 1995 kihun kim et al 2002 carried out a series of tailored test runs and identifications with respect to the hydrodynamic response of a classical prototype named snuuv i based on multiple navigating sensor suite and post processing means attribute to piecewise experiment method measured quantities provide most authentic hydrodynamic coefficients with poor cost performance and larger experiment perturbations therefore more rational and feasible numerical hydrodynamic identification approaches for auv pre testing ought to be put forward as a desirable option one type of linear approximation strategy in auv hydrodynamic identification applications was investigated by means of nonlinear transformation or optimal nonlinear filtering h j kushner 1967 j k uhlmann et al 2000 feng x et al 2012 adjusted the stability of nonlinear prediction state space model for the underwater craft by satisfying candidate lyapunov error function at each time index time step within whole identification process nevertheless this proposed approximation strategy drastically slashes the coriolis centripetal effect between hull and trailing appendages of the craft which inevitably brings about deteriorative process noise accumulation and error transmission hence optimized numerical hydrodynamic identification approaches are more preferable for quasilinear and coupled issues which have been testified to be effective and compatible yao et al 2017 a r m pinheiro and e apolonio de barros 2013 proposed an optimized numerical estimator based on ekf algorithm prediction results shared in this study showed an acceptable agreement compared with available experiment data however according to strict filtering procedure jacobian matrices or even quadratic hessian tensors for both mathematic state space transitional model and measurement model of the vehicle need to be solved within each estimation circle of ekf method which will sharply enlarge the computational complexity of the quasilinear algorithm and be unfeasible occasionally as to highly nonlinear estimation distinctions from different kf algorithms should be considered associated with detailed verifications mohammad taghi sabet et al 2014 applied both ekf and ukf algorithms to evaluate ten quadratic damping coefficients for a novel submerged prototype called remus discrete state vector for which described underwater status and behaviors of the vehicle in this work was augmented with undetermined terms to ensure the closure of auv system model but employing ekf algorithm unavoidably brought about local truncation error in high order taylor series linearization stage which would cause a salient influence on the precision of identification outputs in this paper most identified coefficients based on ukf approach were on the verge of corresponding experiment true values with less bounded error and local singularity instead of ekf albeit estimation precision has been elevated computational complexity estimation experiment mean absolute deviations mad and overall convergence rate of the ukf identification algorithm still shows certain possibility to be improved in this way fan et al 2017 proposed intermediate correction coefficients known as sampling weighted values appended on each estimation circle in adaptive ukf algorithm to minimize the partial derivative of measurement index function and to enhance the resemblance between mean predicted values in time update stage and corresponding experiment values the sampling weighted values would be iteratively tuned into a small magnitude by recursion rule and update gradient descent lemma to accelerate the convergence rate of the numerical solution and to reduce prediction error at each time step which revealed great potential in adaptive system identification applications j dunik et al 2012 put forward a concentrated investigation for scaling parameters arisen in statistical sampling and weighting stage within adaptive ukf process sufficient tests and intuitive comparisons had been executed to eventually verify the rationality and robustness of the recursive scaling parameters bingbing gao et al 2021 proposed a model predictive cubature rule kalman filter distributed optimal fusion mpckf dof the hybrid distributed optimal fusion reckoned local filtering solutions of integrated mimu gnss and mimu cns subsystem simultaneously through the cubature rule to achieve the globally optimal state estimation and to efficiently hinder the disturbance effect the model predictive filter mpf in mpckf dof provided kinematic model error prediction and system state correction based on the concept of mahalanobis distance when criterion index of kinematic model error identification in cubature kalman filter was not satisfied on a basis of classified root mean square error rmse statistics and experimental results the convergence rate and correction precision of mpckf dof are generally high under three error circumstances nevertheless the determination of weighting matrices and hypothesis of block error covariance matrix in distributed optimal fusion are fully empirical which may lead to suboptimal or biased filtering solutions moreover prediction and identification for kinematic model error via mpf will accompany with relatively large computational complexity therefore practical estimation precision and error inhibiting performance of the adaptive ukf algorithm still need to be improved with considerable potential for further hydrodynamic identification investigations besides accumulative system process noise and measurement noise will cause a pronounced impact on precision of the numerical results estimated through kf identification approaches hyeon kyu yoon and key pyo rhee 2003 gaoge hu et al 2020 put forward a maximum likelihood adaptive unscented kalman filter method mlaukf which aimed to enhance the algorithm robustness against process noise uncertainty if the filtering process reached steady state the solution for system process noise covariance q would be estimated and updated optimally via maximum likelihood principle ml with the assistance from proposed instrumental diagonal matrix the asymptotic convergence and unbiasedness of the ml estimator were proved with certain conditions to ensure the algorithm stability in view of monte carlo simulations and practical experiments mlaukf possesses high convergence rate and small resultant rmse in online estimations by advantage of real time updating estimation and recursive optimization in the presence of process noise uncertainty and perturbations affection bingbing gao et al 2018 proposed a novel adaptive ukf algorithm mmaukf through maximum likelihood principle mlp to optimize inaccurate system noise statistic estimation cooperated with moving horizon estimation mhe for suppressing the unbounded growth of computational complexity in mlp optimization process expectation maximization technique is proposed to iteratively estimate the candidate system noise statistics besides an expectation step e step is combined with a maximization step m step to acquire a new set of nonlinear system noise statistic parameters according to simulation and experiment results presented in this study the mmaukf can efficiently restrict the online perturbations from inaccurate system noise statistics in the filtering solution with high navigation accuracy and desired computational complexity however the initial penalty in conditional probability calculation within mhe process is empirically simplified and closed form expressions for conditional expectations of the nonlinear system functions in e step are difficult to be obtained occasionally in despite of aforementioned shortcoming the proposed mmaukf still shows great potential for adaptive ukf identification algorithm in inaccurate system noise statistic condition mehdi zare ernania et al 2015 implemented a consistent set of hydrodynamic identifications for nine damping forces and torques based on two typical prototypes known as isimi and nps auv ii arma noisy model was brought in for both system process noise covariance matrix q and measurement noise covariance matrix r at each algorithm step to restrain the unobserved shocking effect with excellent adaptability and estimation experiment deviation feng x and schulteis j 1993 put forward a black box identification method in frequency domain with hybrid arma noisy model the interacting multiple mechanism was inserted into tuning parameters and recursive structure within arma model at each time step to correct the identified time series signals adaptively the recovered consequences shared in this work are in line with original expectations well which heuristically reveals promising potential in arma noisy model for auv hydrodynamic identification applications in consideration of aforementioned surveys there are still plenty of blank areas and black dots with respect to estimation precision and authenticity of time domain discrete kf hydrodynamic identification algorithms for which need to be padded keisuke miyabayashi et al 2012 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2008 in this study oukf approach is proposed based on recursive tuning rule and update gradient descent lemma with requisite algorithm stability analysis li et al 2010 ekf ukf and oukf algorithms will be adopted severally to identify auv viscous linear damping coefficients with pre processing numerical model validation measurement updating frequencies of three kf algorithms coincide with the sampling interval of system discretization which is capable of contributing to a fair and elaborate performance comparison furthermore arma noisy model is included correspondingly to dispose algorithm precision and process noise inhibiting issues highlighted in time update stage within kf estimation process in following chapters of this paper preliminarily a concise description for mathematical frame system and nonlinear auv dynamic model will be introduced in conjunction with augmented system model and corresponding arma noisy model these are enriched by the explanation for single estimation circle of standard time domain discrete ekf and ukf identification algorithm and the demonstration for recursive tuning rule within oukf approach with appropriate algorithm stability analysis eventually estimated comparable results with respect to pre processing numerical model validation and non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficient identification with corresponding estimation experiment

1964 mathematical dynamic model of the auv needs to comprise mass inertia moments geometrical components cog and cob control inputs appendage forces and moments rigid body components hydrostatic components weight and buoyancy and hydrodynamic components added mass coefficients and damping coefficients merely certain aforementioned components are able to be acquired theoretically with sufficient precision eng yh et al 2008 in general added mass coefficient calculations would meet a satisfying agreement with corresponding experiment data with average uncertainty below 5 in this way hydrodynamic identification for added mass coefficients is not supposed to be taken into consideration emphatically d humphreys and k watkinson 1978 conversely damping coefficients are commonly reckoned via direct experiment approach strip theory or non coupled approximation with great perturbations and ubiquitous process errors hence seventeen main concerned non dimensional viscous linear

dynamic model on account of the incompatibility between state space dimension of undetermined coefficients and state space dimension of inputs and outputs seventeen viscous linear damping coefficients will not be identified straightforward which should be augmented into state space transitional model for three kf algorithms as extra state variables θ a banazadeh and m t ghorbani 2013 idris e putro et al 2009 based on discrete augmented state space transitional model and measurement model augmented system model of the auv pijush k kundu and ira m cohen 2008 can be formulized through eqs 11 and

state estimation for the auv if the undetermined non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficients are included into augmented state vector x at each time step dimension of augmented state space transitional model will be deterministically enhanced with more likelihood for noise accumulation and error transmission which correspondingly results in a dominant impact on estimation precision and perturbations inhibiting performance of kf hydrodynamic identification algorithms s j julier and j k uhlmann 2004 hence suitable optimization is requisite for system process noise covariance matrix q in addition q needs to be propagated within the time update stage of each kf estimation circle which should be treated as time varying matrix with regard to tailored zeroth system process noise covariance matrix q 0 matthew c best 2010 arma noisy model has been adopted for optimizing q in three kf algorithms associated with additive zero mean gaussian white system process noise vector w as

variation of undetermined viscous linear damping coefficients within three kf identification algorithms which is capable of permitting nonzero variable adaptation mohammad taghi sabet et al 2018 yet if θ is entirely interpreted as noise magnitude of system process noise covariance matrix q will be relatively large in contrast with measurement noise covariance matrix r which recursively amplify the updated kalman gain matrix k to gradually implement greater corrections for θ as a consequence the estimations for posteriori undetermined coefficients are enlarged which will inevitably enhance the instability of kf algorithms j k uhlmann et al 2000 heuristically λ supplies an approach to equilibrate and stabilize kf algorithms through curbing the average magnitude of q in whole identification process ρ denotes expected proportional changing parameter which is proposed to adjust the initial varying rate of q 0 combined with system noise tuning parameter γ denotes forgetting

first order lag rate based on time constant τ and system discretization sampling interval δt feng x and schulteis j 1993 which can be expressed in line with eq 16 16 γ 1 e δt τ in addition the measurement noise covariance matrix r within kf identification algorithms needs to be determined as well at each time step by arma noisy model resembled to eqs 14 and 15 based on zeroth covariance

a p et al 2007 in this study the time domain discrete extended kalman filter will be adopted as an appropriate quasilinear estimator heuristically evolved from classical linear kalman filter method

detailed pseudo code of standard ekf algorithm has been presented in table a1 of appendix a by means of proper local linearization the cost effective and universal ekf identification approach is able to achieve second order estimation precision nevertheless applying ekf approach needs jacobian matrices which will drastically increase the computational complexity besides truncation error arisen in taylor series linearization process can cause a fatal effect on the identification authenticity of ekf approach or even induce serious divergence in highly nonlinear system models a r m pinheiro and e apolonio de barros 2013 3 2 unscented kalman filter with respect to plentiful high fidelity auv system models in practical engineering applications deterministic solutions are required based on whole intrinsic nonlinearity of the vehicle dynamic models however ekf algorithm definitely treats the auv system model as linear by means of local taylor linearization with considerable truncation error and poor identification performance in strongly nonlinear issues keisuke miyabayashi et al 2012 by contrast the standard time domain discrete ukf approach on a basis of unscented transformation ut

nonnegative incorporation weighting parameter which is included to incorporate the deviation from high order term in dynamic model function of the auv and the priori information of state distribution resembled to eq 28 priori mean predicted augmented state vector x ˆ k k 1 can be interpreted as a mean augmented sigma point χ k k 1 0 collaborated with corresponding priori predicted covariance

ukf estimation circle as eqs 39 and 40 39 x ˆ k k x ˆ k k 1 k k y k y ˆ k k 1 40 p k k p k k 1 k k p y k y k k k t by convention taylor series linearization and jacobian matrices calculation are not requisite to be considered in standard time domain discrete ukf identification algorithm at each time step posteriori augmented state vector and corresponding posteriori covariance matrix need to be updated on a basis of statistical ut process which preserves the intrinsic nonlinearity of auv dynamic model well with high order estimation precision and preferable algorithm stability analogous to gauss hermite quadrature approach mohammad taghi sabet et al 2018 detailed pseudo code of standard ukf algorithm has been presented in table a2 of appendix a 3 3 optimized unscented kalman filter 3 3 1 recursion rule as for ukf identification algorithm the scaling parameter λ will greatly influence the authenticity and rationality of the prediction process rambabu kandepu et al 2008 which ought to be cautiously tailored as a crucial factor in this study by means of recursive tuning rule for further probable improvement normally if the concerned scaling parameter λ maintains independent or time invariant in entire hydrodynamic identification process as standard ukf algorithm the flexibility and reliability of both statistic predicted estimation and measurement correction will be undesirable j dunik et al 2012 furthermore the needless estimation error generated in time update stage within ukf identification algorithm will be gradually accumulated which has a significant effect on the precision of priori mean predicted measurement vector innovation covariance and posteriori updated results j k uhlmann et al 2000 in order to approach predicted measurement estimations to corresponding measurement mean values effectively the hydrodynamic identification issue with respect to the auv can be heuristically represented as prediction error constraint in oukf algorithm which is equivalent to the minimization for a measurement index function j proposed in fan et al 2017 as eq 41 41 j t r y ˆ k k 1 y k y ˆ k k 1 y k t i 1 n p y k y k i i p y k y k i i 2 where t r is matrix trace proximity operator y k is expectation of measurement vector at kth time step n is dimension of auv measurement model p y k y k is corresponding mean measurement covariance matrix p y k y k i i and p y k y k i i are diagonal elements of covariance matrix p y k y k and p y k y k respectively hence smaller j indicates preferable identification performance at current algorithm step in addition if scaling parameter λ is employed as a recursive factor to adaptively tune the measurement index function j and posteriori results of oukf identification algorithm at each time step the restriction from previous estimations is supposed to be taken into account consistently to raise the rationality and reliability of the recursive tuning rule b yang et al 2014 in this work recursive scaling parameter λ is hypothesized by means of update gradient descent lemma which has been formulized as eq 42 42 x k 1 x k γ f x where x denotes a series with time scale k γ denotes the adjusting step f denotes a function with respect to series x analogously recursive scaling parameter λ k 1 at k 1 th time step will be iteratively assumed in line with eq 43 43 λ k 1 λ k γ j λ t where λ k is recursive scaling parameter at kth time step t is learning rate in this way recursive scaling parameter λ k 1 needs to be tuned via corresponding partial derivative j λ to elevate the real time update efficiency and estimation flexibility of oukf identification algorithm based on eq 41 the partial derivative of measurement index function relative to recursive scaling parameter j λ can be calculated as eq 44 44 j λ t r y ˆ k k 1 λ y ˆ k k 1 y k t y ˆ k k 1 y k y ˆ k k 1 t λ i 1 n 2 p y k y k i i p y k y k i i p y k y k i i λ as to eq 44 j λ should be interpreted as a tuning sensitivity for measurement index function j associated with recursive scaling parameter λ at each time step within oukf identification algorithm larger j λ means that recursive scaling parameter λ possesses a salient adaptive tuning ability for imprecise measurement index function j sequentially authenticity and accuracy of predicted measurement estimations and posteriori results at following time step can be efficiently optimized by update gradient descent lemma on the contrary if j λ is smaller predicted measurement estimations at following time step will become more steady and more uncorrelated with recursive scaling parameter λ fan et al 2017 within each single estimation circle of oukf identification algorithm the tuning sensitivity j λ needs to be computed through eq 44 nevertheless y ˆ k k 1 λ and p y k y k i i λ are undetermined in the initial stage of current time step for the sake of acquiring unknowns for tuning sensitivity calculation the partial derivative for each oukf estimation circle relative to recursive scaling parameter λ is requisite which has been spread out from eqs 45 52 45 χ k 1 k 1 i λ x λ x ˆ k 1 k 1 λ i 0 χ k 1 k 1 i λ x λ p k 1 k 1 n λ p k 1 k 1 λ i i 1 2 n χ k

ˆ k k 1 λ t at each algorithm step with obtained y ˆ k k 1 λ and p y k y k ii λ from eqs 45 52 the tuning sensitivity for measurement index function j λ can be calculated in line with eq 44 in this way the recursion rule will eventually be established between predicted measurement estimations and scaling parameter li et al 2010 based on update rule of gradient descent lemma formulized in eq 43 the recursive scaling parameter λ needs to be tuned adaptively associated with corresponding tuning sensitivity j λ to flexibly correct the real time predicted measurement estimations and gradually improve the posteriori identification performance of oukf algorithm which has been depicted in fig 3 3 3 2 algorithm stability analysis in this study algorithm stability analysis for proposed oukf approach is indispensable the essence of algorithm stability for oukf lies in the variation status of transmission error δ with respect to recursive scaling parameter λ if δ is progressively amplified during one complete iteration process based on oukf approach and update gradient descent lemma the error variation will become more sensitive to the precision of iteration solution λ which might make oukf approach more unstable conversely if δ is gradually minified the error variation tends to be more uncorrelated with the adaptive identification algorithm and gradient descent process of recursive scaling parameter λ which indicates that prediction and measurement correction of oukf approach are much stable and credible within corresponding iteration process yacine bouzidi et al 2016 with regard to algorithm stability analysis for oukf approach variation status of transmission error δ with respect to recursive scaling parameter λ needs to be investigated emphatically in this way scaling parameter recursion equation eq 43 ought to be preliminarily linearized as follows 53 λ k 1 λ k γ j λ t 1 γ j λ k λ t λ k in line with euler differential iteration method eq 53 can be further rewritten as 54 λ k 1 1 γ j λ k λ t λ k 1 γ t λ k where t is weighted learning rate in view of transmission error δ assume that 55 δth λ where λ is expected solution for scaling parameter combined eq 54 with eq 55 error variation equation eq 56 will be correspondingly acquired as follows 56 δ k 1 1 γ t δ k where δ k 1 and δ k are transmission errors with respect to λ at k 1 th time step and kth time step severally for the sake of equilibrating the possible stochastic or negative singularities arisen in the δ series eq 56 needs to be modularized on both sides as 57 δ k 1 1 γ t δ k in this way during one complete oukf iteration process if the transmission error δ tends to be minified gradually the fundamental stability criteria formulized in eq 58 will be generally satisfied to ensure gradient descent process and predicted estimation increasingly stable and independent in the presence of error variation and system noise transmission which needs further validations 58 1 γ t 1 γ j λ k λ t 1 besides in practical oukf hydrodynamic identification applications unknown posteriori augmented state vector x ˆ k k will be determined within each estimation circle respectively in accordance with recursion rule and specific noise statistics sequentially the convergence study for posteriori numerical solution x ˆ k k can be employed to further investigate and analyze the algorithm stability of proposed oukf approach m bartelt and w li 1995 according to eq 53 tuning sensitivity j λ will adaptively influence the variation trend of predicted estimation and posteriori results at following algorithm step by means of adjusting recursive scaling parameter λ hence in a sense the convergence study for posteriori numerical solution x ˆ k k at each algorithm step can be approximately interpreted as algebraic fitting regression issue with corresponding training independent variable j k λ k to substantially satisfy the l lipschitz condition mei changlin and zhang wenxiu 2002 yishuang hu et al 2018 the optimal value of tuning sensitivity j λ is pre hypothesized as j λ argmin x ˆ k k j k λ k within one complete fitting regression process if learning rate t atl t l lipschitz theorem can be consistently formulized based on x ˆ k k j k λ k and j λ as eq 59 59 x ˆ k k j k λ k x ˆ k k j λ j 0 λ 0 j λ 2 2 2 tk where l t is an empirical adjusting constant along with algebraic fitting regression process smaller j 0 λ 0 j λ 2 2 2 tk indicates that regression training data x ˆ k k j k λ k is gradually close to the desired region consequently the error amplification and system noise transmission can correspondingly be curbed in this way the algorithm stability of proposed oukf approach will be increasingly strengthened the crux in oukf identification approach lies in the hypothesis for recursive scaling parameter λ and tuning sensitivity j λ fan et al 2017 except redundant computational complexity compared with standard ukf algorithm the oukf approach shows great potential in hydrodynamic identification and auv pre testing with preferable prediction accuracy and adaptability which needs further adjustments and validations detailed pseudo code of oukf algorithm has been presented in table a2 of appendix a 4 simulation results three time domain discrete kf approaches involved in this study have been simulated and compared based on mathematical dynamic model of nps auv ii to reveal the potential and advantage of oukf in practical hydrodynamic identification applications simulation results on a basis of corresponding experimental field tests are about to be spread out and discussed respectively foundational simulation parameters arisen in arma noisy model and two ukf identification algorithms have been summarized in table 3 4 1 motion scenario and particulars within cartesian o ned geographical inertial frame system real time maneuvering trajectory of the auv in vested motion scenario is assumed as spiral pushpak jagtap et al 2016 k m bossley et al 1999 which is illustrated in fig 4 in this work the rotating rate of trailing e1619 driven propellers is pre set as 200 rpm zigzag functions with respect to angle amplitudes will be treated as the actuator input signals for auv maneuvering in consideration of physical limitations in testing site rudder angle δ r and stern plane angle δ s need to be restricted into default open interval 10 10 uniformly xiao liang et al 2009 k m bossley et al 1999 by convention an essential purpose for applying identification algorithms based on correlated experiment data lies in pre validating the mathematical model and hydrodynamic character of the auv prototype in designing and testing stage to meet with the practical precision requirement and further bearing error b allotta et al 2018 in this work available real time translational and rotational experiment outputs of the involved navigating sensor suite can be the foundation of dependable validation brief datasheets of primary navigating sensors mounted on the auv have been presented in table 4 4 2 pre processing numerical model validation figs 5 and 6 illustrate comparable kf estimations based on arma noisy model related to 6 dof auv translational and rotational velocities respectively in body fixed frame system which will be further regarded as pre processing numerical model validation in this study on a basis of corresponding experiment outputs moreover parallel estimations without arma noisy model have been implemented simultaneously to seek the substantial effect from arma model on kf algorithms and associated validation results within numerical model validation process 6 dof velocity curves need to be estimated via three kf algorithms with uniform time step and zero initialized condition for a fair comparison sequentially fidelity of the auv mathematical model and actual estimation performance of three kf algorithms correlated with arma noisy model can be preliminarily surveyed and validated with regard to pre processing numerical model validation the main concerned estimation experiment deviations will be denoted in the light of mean absolute errors mae between estimated values and corresponding experiment outputs related to 6 dof translational and rotational velocities for further detailed evaluation with respect to three kf algorithms and arma noisy model in addition for the sake of investigating intrinsic influence from arma noisy model on kf algorithm and corresponding estimation reasonably and intuitively absolute deviations based on arma model addition in regards to three kf algorithms will be presented for a fair and independent performance comparison mae and absolute deviations in pre processing numerical model validation have been shown severally in table 5 as to figs 5 and 6 the velocity curves of sway and roll meet salient oscillations in the initial stage with a certain time to converge bounded error of roll velocity curve is relatively large estimations for sway roll and yaw based on arma noisy model deviate enormously from parallel estimations without arma model in contrast to surge heave and pitch estimations which reveal slight precision improvement for practical estimation due to arma noisy model the whole estimations for heave pitch and yaw are more stable with few singularities all curves estimated based on arma model steadily possess similar variation trend as parallel curves with consistent adaptability and stability corresponding estimation curves with respect to ukf and oukf algorithms are quite adjacent and match the experiment values well with high accuracy and credibility according to mae and absolute deviations appeared in 6 dof pre processing numerical model validation within table 5 the estimation experiment deviations in regard to ukf and oukf algorithms are dramatically smaller than ekf especially for rotational velocity estimations which is principally in line with theoretical expectation the average values of translational and rotational mae related to parallel estimations without arma model are all larger than the average mae based on arma model which indicates that the arma noisy model is able to slightly enhance the estimation precision and perturbations inhibiting performance of three kf algorithms in general the absolute deviations of ukf and oukf are resembled with negligible difference and pronouncedly larger than ekf in this way through applying arma noisy model the practical degree of improvement for entire 6 dof ukf and oukf estimations will be superior to ekf which reveals that the ukf and oukf algorithms possess an acceptable compatibility with arma model to further interact both advantages in accordance with velocity curves and corresponding errors presented in figs 5 to 6 and table 5 the actual numerical estimation precision of oukf algorithm based on arma noisy model is slightly preferable instead of ukf with the potential to fulfill stricter error tolerance which preliminarily validates the reasonability and superiority of arma model based adaptive kf algorithm 4 3 tuning sensitivity analysis furthermore the essential distinction between standard ukf and proposed oukf approaches needs to be emphatically taken into account and investigated to intuitively highlight the detailed advantage and stability performance of adaptive oukf algorithm in this way the variation trend of tuning sensitivity j λ might be a feasible interim indicator for algorithm performance comparison the entire variation trends of tuning sensitivity with respect to standard ukf and oukf approaches based on arma noisy model within one complete estimation process have been acquired and depicted in figs 7 and 8 respectively with uniform iteration step and sensitivity calculation process for a fair comparison in line with figs 7 and 8 tuning sensitivities with respect to standard ukf and oukf approaches are both unsteady in initial stage of the iteration process with considerable disarray and bounded error which eventually converge to zero with a certain time sequentially along with iteration step the recursive scaling parameter λ will become more uncorrelated with prediction and posteriori estimations of two ukf approaches with lower algorithm adaptability on a basis of rmse criteria the rmses of sensitivity peak statistics with respect to ukf and oukf are 1 8109e 01 and 4 5723e 02 severally therefore in contrast with standard ukf approach the average fluctuation of tuning sensitivity with respect to oukf is intuitively smaller with less iteration step to converge which indicates that oukf approach owns much flexible and stable adaptive tuning performance for corresponding prediction and measurement correction through recursive scaling parameter λ to efficiently obtain more exact and reasonable posteriori estimation results furthermore in the light of figs 7 and 8 the tuning sensitivities with respect to standard ukf and oukf approaches both exceed the zero thresholds in initial stage of iteration process and gradually converge into negative region the sensitivity exceedance with respect to oukf is quite smaller than ukf with less iteration step to converge in this way based on fundamental stability criteria expressed in eq 58 two conclusions can be revealed two ukf approaches are both unstable in initial stage of iteration process with more divergent singularities oukf approach is obviously more stable than ukf in one complete iteration process on a basis of l lipschitz theorem formulized in eq 59 and figs 7 to 8 optimal value of tuning sensitivity j λ argmin x ˆ k k j k λ k will progressively approach the initial sensitivity j 0 λ 0 correspondingly constraint term j 0 λ 0 j λ 2 2 2 tk is able to be decreased gradually along with iteration step sequentially l lipschitz condition will be satisfied for algebraic fitting regression issue in regard to posteriori numerical solution x ˆ k k j k λ k which indicates that the disarray and fluctuation state within initial stage of two ukf estimation processes tends to become increasingly stable along with iteration step hence combining aforementioned conclusions with corresponding rmses of sensitivity peak statistics oukf approach based on flexible arma noisy model and efficient recursion rule can be certified to be a quite rational and precise numerical method with preferable algorithm stability performance in contrast with standard ukf approach 4 4 hydrodynamic identification the hydrodynamic coefficient identification on a basis of corresponding pre processing numerical model validation and tuning sensitivity analysis can be employed to distinguish the authentic identification performance of three kf algorithms in this study seventeen non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficients m q m w m δs n r n v n p n δr z q z w z δs y r y v y p y δr k p k r and k v in auv augmented system model will be identified by three kf algorithms based on arma noisy model as illustrated from figs 9 to 13 solid thick lines denote true linear damping coefficients each abscissa denotes time step corresponding linear damping coefficients identified by ekf ukf and oukf algorithms are denoted via solid thin dash and dotted curves respectively all the coefficient identifications have been consistently initialized as zero with uniform time step for a fair and credible comparison in addition the precision and overall deviation of identification curves need to be represented through identification error in this work with regard to detailed curve analyses the identification error can be employed to definitely reveal the identification performances of three kf algorithms by means of rmse criteria and percentage of steady state error sse criteria among true coefficients ekf identified coefficients ukf identified coefficients and oukf identified coefficients rmses and percentage of sses for coefficient identifications have been spread out in table 6 as depicted from figs 9 to 13 the overwhelming majority of non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficient curves identified by three kf algorithms are intuitively unsteady in the initial stage with considerable disarray and bounded error each coefficient identification curve in figs 9 to 13 possess an asymptotic trend to gradually converge to a stable region nearby corresponding true value with appropriate convergence rate which is adequately strengthened through arma noisy model besides the identification performances of ukf and oukf algorithms for all coefficients are distinctly higher in contrast with ekf according to table 6 the error magnitude orders of most identified coefficients lie on a small and reasonable region except sses of n p n δr y p and k v overall rmse of ekf identification is generally larger than ukf and oukf analogously rmse of ukf identification is slightly larger than oukf except z δs y r y v and k r which implies that the robustness and credibility of ukf identification algorithm are medium the ekf identifications with respect to n p y p and k r show relatively large percentage of sses in table 6 convergence performance of ekf identification algorithm embodied from figs 9 to 13 is undesirable as well due to taylor truncation linearization by contrast algorithm stability and identification precision of ukf and oukf are explicitly higher than ekf which reveals great superiority of statistical kf approaches on the contrary computational complexity of ekf algorithm is lower than ukf and oukf with the cost of poor accuracy which can be adopted as a flexible or cost effective option based on comparable results in figs 9 to 13 and table 6 m coefficients and z coefficients identified by oukf algorithm are sufficiently authentic and satisfying with relatively small error and fluctuation in transient period especially for m δs z q and z δs the average percentage of sses for ekf ukf and oukf identifications are 5 2711 1 3986 and 0 8696 respectively in this way the proposed oukf algorithm seems to show preferable identification precision and favourable algorithm stability under uncertainties and perturbations in contrast with ekf and ukf which ought to benefit from recursive tuning rule within each time step and arma noisy model the identification outputs acquired from oukf algorithm might be further treated as a suitable pre validation for experiment issues with low error tolerance 5 conclusion in this paper pre processing numerical model validation for prototype nps auv ii and corresponding hydrodynamic identification for seventeen non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficients based on ekf ukf and proposed oukf algorithms have been implemented severally to provide an assistance for further practical auv hydrodynamic performance assessment and vehicle maneuverability experiment undetermined coefficients are augmented in system model of the auv in addition arma noisy model has been included into three kf algorithms to enhance the estimation precision and perturbations inhibiting performance in line with figs 5 to 6 and table 5 6 dof translational and rotational velocity estimations based on arma noisy model meet a satisfying agreement with corresponding experiment outputs which validates the fidelity and reasonability of the auv mathematical model and the dependability of arma model on a basis of figs 7 to 13 and table 6 identification precision and adaptive tuning ability of oukf algorithm are definitely preferable in contrast with ekf and ukf with acceptable stability performance which highlights the superiority and potential of adaptive kf approach in auv hydrodynamic identification applications in future the

20789,the controllability and maneuverability of an autonomous underwater vehicle auv in practical applications need to be properly validated and assessed before the prototype is finalized for manufacturing with regard to mathematical system model of the auv hydrodynamic coefficients have a dominant effect on the quality of vehicle pre testing and evaluation which is crucial to be estimated with adequate accuracy to curb the uncertainty from modeling simplifications the standard time domain discrete extended kalman filter ekf and unscented kalman filter ukf algorithms are two promising numerical approximation approaches for hydrodynamic identification technique with favourable computational complexity and acceptable estimation precision in this paper a study with respect to time domain discrete optimized ukf oukf algorithm based on recursive tuning rule and update gradient descent lemma for a typical prototype known as nps auv ii will be proposed to enhance adaptability and prediction performance of the identification approach with appropriate verification in addition auto regressive moving average arma noisy model needs to be included into three kalman filter kf algorithms to further improve the estimation precision and perturbations inhibiting performance pre processing numerical model validation and non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficient identification based on three kf algorithms will be implemented respectively to provide an assistant pre assessment for the vehicle in accordance with comparable outputs and estimation experiment errors the oukf identification algorithm is certified to be more precise and superior compared with ekf and ukf approaches in the presence of arma noisy model keywords autonomous underwater vehicle auv system identification extended kalman filter ekf unscented kalman filter ukf optimized unscented kalman filter oukf 1 introduction in recent years auv technique had met a growing development in variety of aspects in underwater engineering applications and gradually extended from littoral to offshore areas b allotta et al 2016 j m j journée and w w massie 2001 underwater vehicle would become an indispensable tool in exploitation for seabed resources and complex deep water task johannes falnes 2002 the rising interest is pushing up the refinement for both performance and reliability of the underwater vehicle in this way the hydrodynamic character of an auv is supposed to be a backbone feature while the success of vehicle modeling and designing is concerned for the sake of evaluating the maneuverability and hydrodynamic character before the prototype is finalized for manufacturing a well acceptable mathematical methodology for which describes the transient dynamic response of the underwater vehicle needs to be established by means of hydrodynamic coefficients alexander v inzartsev 2009 j m j journée and jakob pinkster 2002 identification for hydrodynamic model of an auv dominantly depends on the quality of estimation for coupled hydrodynamic coefficients based on highly nonlinear and complicated submerged behavior of the vehicle thor i fossen 1995 kihun kim et al 2002 carried out a series of tailored test runs and identifications with respect to the hydrodynamic response of a classical prototype named snuuv i based on multiple navigating sensor suite and post processing means attribute to piecewise experiment method measured quantities provide most authentic hydrodynamic coefficients with poor cost performance and larger experiment perturbations therefore more rational and feasible numerical hydrodynamic identification approaches for auv pre testing ought to be put forward as a desirable option one type of linear approximation strategy in auv hydrodynamic identification applications was investigated by means of nonlinear transformation or optimal nonlinear filtering h j kushner 1967 j k uhlmann et al 2000 feng x et al 2012 adjusted the stability of nonlinear prediction state space model for the underwater craft by satisfying candidate lyapunov error function at each time index time step within whole identification process nevertheless this proposed approximation strategy drastically slashes the coriolis centripetal effect between hull and trailing appendages of the craft which inevitably brings about deteriorative process noise accumulation and error transmission hence optimized numerical hydrodynamic identification approaches are more preferable for quasilinear and coupled issues which have been testified to be effective and compatible yao et al 2017 a r m pinheiro and e apolonio de barros 2013 proposed an optimized numerical estimator based on ekf algorithm prediction results shared in this study showed an acceptable agreement compared with available experiment data however according to strict filtering procedure jacobian matrices or even quadratic hessian tensors for both mathematic state space transitional model and measurement model of the vehicle need to be solved within each estimation circle of ekf method which will sharply enlarge the computational complexity of the quasilinear algorithm and be unfeasible occasionally as to highly nonlinear estimation distinctions from different kf algorithms should be considered associated with detailed verifications mohammad taghi sabet et al 2014 applied both ekf and ukf algorithms to evaluate ten quadratic damping coefficients for a novel submerged prototype called remus discrete state vector for which described underwater status and behaviors of the vehicle in this work was augmented with undetermined terms to ensure the closure of auv system model but employing ekf algorithm unavoidably brought about local truncation error in high order taylor series linearization stage which would cause a salient influence on the precision of identification outputs in this paper most identified coefficients based on ukf approach were on the verge of corresponding experiment true values with less bounded error and local singularity instead of ekf albeit estimation precision has been elevated computational complexity estimation experiment mean absolute deviations mad and overall convergence rate of the ukf identification algorithm still shows certain possibility to be improved in this way fan et al 2017 proposed intermediate correction coefficients known as sampling weighted values appended on each estimation circle in adaptive ukf algorithm to minimize the partial derivative of measurement index function and to enhance the resemblance between mean predicted values in time update stage and corresponding experiment values the sampling weighted values would be iteratively tuned into a small magnitude by recursion rule and update gradient descent lemma to accelerate the convergence rate of the numerical solution and to reduce prediction error at each time step which revealed great potential in adaptive system identification applications j dunik et al 2012 put forward a concentrated investigation for scaling parameters arisen in statistical sampling and weighting stage within adaptive ukf process sufficient tests and intuitive comparisons had been executed to eventually verify the rationality and robustness of the recursive scaling parameters bingbing gao et al 2021 proposed a model predictive cubature rule kalman filter distributed optimal fusion mpckf dof the hybrid distributed optimal fusion reckoned local filtering solutions of integrated mimu gnss and mimu cns subsystem simultaneously through the cubature rule to achieve the globally optimal state estimation and to efficiently hinder the disturbance effect the model predictive filter mpf in mpckf dof provided kinematic model error prediction and system state correction based on the concept of mahalanobis distance when criterion index of kinematic model error identification in cubature kalman filter was not satisfied on a basis of classified root mean square error rmse statistics and experimental results the convergence rate and correction precision of mpckf dof are generally high under three error circumstances nevertheless the determination of weighting matrices and hypothesis of block error covariance matrix in distributed optimal fusion are fully empirical which may lead to suboptimal or biased filtering solutions moreover prediction and identification for kinematic model error via mpf will accompany with relatively large computational complexity therefore practical estimation precision and error inhibiting performance of the adaptive ukf algorithm still need to be improved with considerable potential for further hydrodynamic identification investigations besides accumulative system process noise and measurement noise will cause a pronounced impact on precision of the numerical results estimated through kf identification approaches hyeon kyu yoon and key pyo rhee 2003 gaoge hu et al 2020 put forward a maximum likelihood adaptive unscented kalman filter method mlaukf which aimed to enhance the algorithm robustness against process noise uncertainty if the filtering process reached steady state the solution for system process noise covariance q would be estimated and updated optimally via maximum likelihood principle ml with the assistance from proposed instrumental diagonal matrix the asymptotic convergence and unbiasedness of the ml estimator were proved with certain conditions to ensure the algorithm stability in view of monte carlo simulations and practical experiments mlaukf possesses high convergence rate and small resultant rmse in online estimations by advantage of real time updating estimation and recursive optimization in the presence of process noise uncertainty and perturbations affection bingbing gao et al 2018 proposed a novel adaptive ukf algorithm mmaukf through maximum likelihood principle mlp to optimize inaccurate system noise statistic estimation cooperated with moving horizon estimation mhe for suppressing the unbounded growth of computational complexity in mlp optimization process expectation maximization technique is proposed to iteratively estimate the candidate system noise statistics besides an expectation step e step is combined with a maximization step m step to acquire a new set of nonlinear system noise statistic parameters according to simulation and experiment results presented in this study the mmaukf can efficiently restrict the online perturbations from inaccurate system noise statistics in the filtering solution with high navigation accuracy and desired computational complexity however the initial penalty in conditional probability calculation within mhe process is empirically simplified and closed form expressions for conditional expectations of the nonlinear system functions in e step are difficult to be obtained occasionally in despite of aforementioned shortcoming the proposed mmaukf still shows great potential for adaptive ukf identification algorithm in inaccurate system noise statistic condition mehdi zare ernania et al 2015 implemented a consistent set of hydrodynamic identifications for nine damping forces and torques based on two typical prototypes known as isimi and nps auv ii arma noisy model was brought in for both system process noise covariance matrix q and measurement noise covariance matrix r at each algorithm step to restrain the unobserved shocking effect with excellent adaptability and estimation experiment deviation feng x and schulteis j 1993 put forward a black box identification method in frequency domain with hybrid arma noisy model the interacting multiple mechanism was inserted into tuning parameters and recursive structure within arma model at each time step to correct the identified time series signals adaptively the recovered consequences shared in this work are in line with original expectations well which heuristically reveals promising potential in arma noisy model for auv hydrodynamic identification applications in consideration of aforementioned surveys there are still plenty of blank areas and black dots with respect to estimation precision and authenticity of time domain discrete kf hydrodynamic identification algorithms for which need to be padded keisuke miyabayashi et al 2012 wang et al 2014 liu et al 2008 in this study oukf approach is proposed based on recursive tuning rule and update gradient descent lemma with requisite algorithm stability analysis li et al 2010 ekf ukf and oukf algorithms will be adopted severally to identify auv viscous linear damping coefficients with pre processing numerical model validation measurement updating frequencies of three kf algorithms coincide with the sampling interval of system discretization which is capable of contributing to a fair and elaborate performance comparison furthermore arma noisy model is included correspondingly to dispose algorithm precision and process noise inhibiting issues highlighted in time update stage within kf estimation process in following chapters of this paper preliminarily a concise description for mathematical frame system and nonlinear auv dynamic model will be introduced in conjunction with augmented system model and corresponding arma noisy model these are enriched by the explanation for single estimation circle of standard time domain discrete ekf and ukf identification algorithm and the demonstration for recursive tuning rule within oukf approach with appropriate algorithm stability analysis eventually estimated comparable results with respect to pre processing numerical model validation and non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficient identification with corresponding estimation experiment

1964 mathematical dynamic model of the auv needs to comprise mass inertia moments geometrical components cog and cob control inputs appendage forces and moments rigid body components hydrostatic components weight and buoyancy and hydrodynamic components added mass coefficients and damping coefficients merely certain aforementioned components are able to be acquired theoretically with sufficient precision eng yh et al 2008 in general added mass coefficient calculations would meet a satisfying agreement with corresponding experiment data with average uncertainty below 5 in this way hydrodynamic identification for added mass coefficients is not supposed to be taken into consideration emphatically d humphreys and k watkinson 1978 conversely damping coefficients are commonly

transitional model will be deterministically enhanced with more likelihood for noise accumulation and error transmission which correspondingly results in a dominant impact on estimation precision and perturbations inhibiting performance of kf hydrodynamic identification algorithms s j julier and j k uhlmann 2004 hence suitable optimization is requisite for system process noise covariance matrix q in addition q needs to be propagated within the time update stage of each kf estimation circle which should be treated as time varying matrix with regard to tailored zeroth system process noise

if θ is entirely interpreted as noise magnitude of system process noise covariance matrix q will be relatively large in contrast with measurement noise covariance matrix r which recursively amplify the updated kalman gain matrix k to gradually implement greater corrections for θ as a consequence the estimations for posteriori undetermined coefficients are enlarged which will inevitably enhance

detailed pseudo code of standard ekf algorithm has been presented in table a1 of appendix a by means of proper local linearization the cost effective and universal ekf identification approach is able

and poor identification performance in strongly nonlinear issues keisuke miyabayashi et al 2012 by contrast the standard time domain discrete ukf approach on a basis of unscented transformation ut ought to be a promising estimator with pronounced distinction from ekf algorithm rambabu kandepu et al 2008 which has been illustrated in fig 2 for the sake of embodying real time statistical propagation property of nonlinear auv dynamic model function instead of estimating an overall state probability density function pdf through cloud of stochastic sampling points in monte carlo method only 2n sigma sampling vectors χ k 1 k 1 i i 1 2 2n known as sigma points nearby a zeroth sigma sampling vector χ k 1 k 1 0 liu et al 2008 need to be pre hypothesized as eq 28 χ k 1 k 1 i x x ˆ k 1 k

propagation property of nonlinear dynamic model function with coincident mean value and covariance as original state distribution correspondingly s j julier and j k uhlmann 2004 in this way sigma sampling propagation within ut process is capable of preserving the intrinsic nonlinearity of auv dynamic model well which is distinct from ekf truncation linearization in the time update stage of ukf identification algorithm priori mean predicted augmented state vector x ˆ k k 1 and priori predicted covariance matrix p k k 1 at kth time step should be estimated on a basis of eqs 30 and 31 30 x ˆ k

nonnegative incorporation weighting parameter which is included to incorporate the deviation from high order term in dynamic model function of the auv and the priori information of state distribution resembled to eq 28 priori mean predicted augmented state vector x ˆ k k 1 can be interpreted as a mean augmented sigma point χ k k 1 0 collaborated with corresponding priori predicted covariance

ukf estimation circle as eqs 39 and 40 39 x ˆ k k x ˆ k k 1 k k y k y ˆ k k 1 40 p k k p k k 1 k k p y k y k k k t by convention taylor series linearization and jacobian matrices calculation are not requisite to be considered in standard time domain discrete ukf identification algorithm at each time step posteriori augmented state vector and corresponding posteriori covariance matrix need to be updated on a basis of statistical ut process which preserves the intrinsic nonlinearity of auv dynamic model well with high order estimation precision and preferable algorithm stability analogous to gauss hermite quadrature approach mohammad taghi sabet et al 2018 detailed pseudo code of standard ukf algorithm has been presented in table a2 of appendix a 3 3 optimized unscented kalman filter 3 3 1 recursion rule as for ukf identification algorithm the scaling parameter λ will greatly influence the authenticity and rationality of the prediction process rambabu kandepu et al 2008 which ought to be cautiously tailored as a crucial factor in this study by means of recursive tuning rule for further probable improvement normally if the concerned scaling parameter λ maintains independent or time invariant in entire hydrodynamic identification process as standard ukf algorithm the flexibility and reliability of both statistic predicted estimation and measurement correction will be undesirable j dunik et al 2012 furthermore the needless estimation error generated in time update stage within ukf identification algorithm will be gradually accumulated which has a significant effect on the precision of priori mean predicted measurement vector innovation covariance and posteriori updated results j k uhlmann et al 2000 in order to approach predicted measurement estimations to corresponding measurement mean values effectively the hydrodynamic identification issue with respect to the auv can be heuristically represented as prediction error constraint in oukf algorithm which is equivalent to the minimization for a measurement index function j proposed in fan et al 2017 as eq 41 41 j t r y ˆ k k 1 y k y ˆ k k 1 y k t i 1 n p y k y k i i p y k y k i i 2 where t r is matrix trace proximity operator y k is expectation of measurement vector at kth time step n is dimension of auv measurement model p y k y k is corresponding mean measurement covariance matrix p y k y k i i and p y k y k i i are diagonal elements of covariance matrix p y k y k and p y k y k respectively hence smaller j indicates preferable identification performance at current algorithm step in addition if scaling parameter λ is employed as a recursive factor to adaptively tune the measurement index function j and posteriori results of oukf identification algorithm at each time step the restriction from previous estimations is supposed to be taken into account consistently to raise the rationality and reliability of the recursive tuning rule b yang et al 2014 in this work recursive scaling parameter λ is hypothesized by means of update gradient descent lemma which has been formulized as eq 42 42 x k 1 x k γ f x where x denotes a series with time scale k γ denotes the adjusting step f denotes a function with respect to series x analogously recursive scaling parameter λ k 1 at k 1 th time step will be iteratively assumed in line with eq 43 43 λ k 1 λ k γ j λ t where λ k is recursive scaling parameter at kth time step t is learning rate in this way recursive scaling parameter λ k 1 needs to be tuned via corresponding partial derivative j λ to elevate the real time update efficiency and estimation flexibility of oukf identification algorithm based on eq 41 the partial derivative of measurement index function relative to recursive scaling parameter j λ can be calculated as eq 44 44 j λ t r y ˆ k k 1 λ y ˆ k k 1 y k t y ˆ k k 1 y k y ˆ k k 1 t λ i 1 n 2 p y k y k i i p y k y k i i p y k y k i i λ as to eq 44 j λ should be interpreted as a tuning sensitivity for measurement index function j associated with recursive scaling parameter λ at each time step within oukf identification algorithm larger j λ means that recursive scaling parameter λ possesses a salient adaptive tuning ability for imprecise measurement index function j sequentially authenticity and accuracy of predicted measurement estimations and posteriori results at following time step can be efficiently optimized by update gradient descent lemma on the contrary if j λ is smaller predicted measurement estimations at following time step will become more steady and more uncorrelated with recursive scaling parameter λ fan et al 2017 within each single estimation circle of oukf identification algorithm the tuning sensitivity j λ needs to be computed through eq 44 nevertheless y ˆ k k 1 λ and p y k y k i i λ are undetermined in the initial stage of current time step for the sake of acquiring unknowns for tuning sensitivity calculation the partial derivative for each oukf estimation circle relative to recursive scaling parameter λ is requisite which has been spread out from eqs 45 52 45 χ k 1 k 1 i λ x λ x ˆ k 1 k 1 λ i 0 χ k 1 k 1 i λ x λ p k 1 k 1 n λ p k 1 k 1 λ i i 1 2 n χ k

ˆ k k 1 λ t at each algorithm step with obtained y ˆ k k 1 λ and p y k y k ii λ from eqs 45 52 the tuning sensitivity for measurement index function j λ can be calculated in line with eq 44 in this way the recursion rule will eventually be established between predicted measurement estimations and scaling parameter li et al 2010 based on update rule of gradient descent lemma formulized in eq 43 the recursive scaling parameter λ needs to be tuned adaptively associated with corresponding tuning sensitivity j λ to flexibly correct the real time predicted measurement estimations and gradually improve the posteriori identification performance of oukf algorithm which has been depicted in fig 3 3 3 2 algorithm stability analysis in this study algorithm stability analysis for proposed oukf approach is indispensable the essence of algorithm stability for oukf lies in the variation status of transmission error δ with respect to recursive scaling parameter λ if δ is progressively amplified during one complete iteration process based on oukf approach and update gradient descent lemma the error variation will become more sensitive to the precision of iteration solution λ which might make oukf approach more unstable conversely if δ is gradually minified the error variation tends to be more uncorrelated with the adaptive identification algorithm and gradient descent process of recursive scaling parameter λ which indicates that prediction and measurement correction of oukf approach are much stable and credible within corresponding iteration process yacine bouzidi et al 2016 with regard to algorithm stability analysis for oukf approach variation status of transmission error δ with respect to recursive scaling parameter λ needs to be investigated emphatically in this way scaling parameter recursion equation eq 43 ought to be preliminarily linearized as follows 53 λ k 1 λ k γ j λ t 1 γ j λ k λ t λ k in line with euler differential iteration method eq 53 can be further rewritten as 54 λ k 1 1 γ j λ k λ t λ k 1 γ t λ k where t is weighted learning rate in view of transmission error δ assume that 55 δth λ where λ is expected solution for scaling parameter combined eq 54 with eq 55 error variation equation eq 56 will be correspondingly acquired as follows 56 δ k 1 1 γ t δ k where δ k 1 and δ k are transmission errors with respect to λ at k 1 th time step and kth time step severally for the sake of equilibrating the possible stochastic or negative singularities arisen in the δ series eq 56 needs to be modularized on both sides as 57 δ k 1 1 γ t δ k in this way during one complete oukf iteration process if the transmission error δ tends to be minified gradually the fundamental stability criteria formulized in eq 58 will be generally satisfied to ensure gradient descent process and predicted estimation increasingly stable and independent in the presence of error variation and system noise transmission which needs further validations 58 1 γ t 1 γ j λ k λ t 1 besides in practical oukf hydrodynamic identification applications unknown posteriori augmented state vector x ˆ k k will be determined within each estimation circle respectively in accordance with recursion rule and specific noise statistics sequentially the convergence study for posteriori numerical solution x ˆ k k can be employed to further investigate and analyze the algorithm stability of proposed oukf approach m bartelt and w li 1995 according to eq 53 tuning sensitivity j λ will adaptively influence the variation trend of predicted estimation and posteriori results at following algorithm step by means of adjusting recursive scaling parameter λ hence in a sense the convergence study for posteriori numerical solution x ˆ k k at each algorithm step can be approximately interpreted as algebraic fitting regression issue with corresponding training independent variable j k λ k to substantially satisfy the l lipschitz condition mei changlin and zhang wenxiu 2002 yishuang hu et al 2018 the optimal value of tuning sensitivity j λ is pre hypothesized as j λ argmin x ˆ k k j k λ k within one complete fitting regression process if learning rate t atl t l lipschitz theorem can be consistently formulized based on x ˆ k k j k λ k and j λ as eq 59 59 x ˆ k k j k λ k x ˆ k k j λ j 0 λ 0 j λ 2 2 2 tk where l t is an empirical adjusting constant along with algebraic fitting regression process smaller j 0 λ 0 j λ 2 2 2 tk indicates that regression training data x ˆ k k j k λ k is gradually close to the desired region consequently the error amplification and system noise transmission can correspondingly be curbed in this way the algorithm stability of proposed oukf approach will be increasingly strengthened the crux in oukf identification approach lies in the hypothesis for recursive scaling parameter λ and tuning sensitivity j λ fan et al 2017 except redundant computational complexity compared with standard ukf algorithm the oukf approach shows great potential in hydrodynamic identification and auv pre testing with preferable prediction accuracy and adaptability which needs further adjustments and validations detailed pseudo code of oukf algorithm has been presented in table a2 of appendix a 4 simulation results three time domain discrete kf approaches involved in this study have been simulated and compared based on mathematical dynamic model of nps auv ii to reveal the potential and advantage of oukf in practical hydrodynamic identification applications simulation results on a basis of corresponding experimental field tests are about to be spread out and discussed respectively foundational simulation parameters arisen in arma noisy model and two ukf identification algorithms have been summarized in table 3 4 1 motion scenario and particulars within cartesian o ned geographical inertial frame system real time maneuvering trajectory of the auv in vested motion scenario is assumed as spiral pushpak jagtap et al 2016 k m bossley et al 1999 which is illustrated in fig 4 in this work the rotating rate of trailing e1619 driven propellers is pre set as 200 rpm zigzag functions with respect to angle amplitudes will be treated as the actuator input signals for auv maneuvering in consideration of physical limitations in testing site rudder angle δ r and stern plane angle δ s need to be restricted into default open interval 10 10 uniformly xiao liang et al 2009 k m bossley et al 1999 by convention an essential purpose for applying identification algorithms based on correlated experiment data lies in pre validating the mathematical model and hydrodynamic character of the auv prototype in designing and testing stage to meet with the practical precision requirement and further bearing error b allotta et al 2018 in this work available real time translational and rotational experiment outputs of the involved navigating sensor suite can be the foundation of dependable validation brief datasheets of primary navigating sensors mounted on the auv have been presented in table 4 4 2 pre processing numerical model validation figs 5 and 6 illustrate comparable kf estimations based on arma noisy model related to 6 dof auv translational and rotational velocities respectively in body fixed frame system which will be further regarded as pre processing numerical model validation in this study on a basis of corresponding experiment outputs moreover parallel estimations without arma noisy model have been implemented simultaneously to seek the substantial effect from arma model on kf algorithms and associated validation results within numerical model validation process 6 dof velocity curves need to be estimated via three kf algorithms with uniform time step and zero initialized condition for a fair comparison sequentially fidelity of the auv mathematical model and actual estimation performance of three kf algorithms correlated with arma noisy model can be preliminarily surveyed and validated with regard to pre processing numerical model validation the main concerned estimation experiment deviations will be denoted in the light of mean absolute errors mae between estimated values and corresponding experiment outputs related to 6 dof translational and rotational velocities for further detailed evaluation with respect to three kf algorithms and arma noisy model in addition for the sake of investigating intrinsic influence from arma noisy model on kf algorithm and corresponding estimation reasonably and intuitively absolute deviations based on arma model addition in regards to three kf algorithms will be presented for a fair and independent performance comparison mae and absolute deviations in pre processing numerical model validation have been shown severally in table 5 as to figs 5 and 6 the velocity curves of sway and roll meet salient oscillations in the initial stage with a certain time to converge bounded error of roll velocity curve is relatively large estimations for sway roll and yaw based on arma noisy model deviate enormously from parallel estimations without arma model in contrast to surge heave and pitch estimations which reveal slight precision improvement for practical estimation due to arma noisy model the whole estimations for heave pitch and yaw are more stable with few singularities all curves estimated based on arma model steadily possess similar variation trend as parallel curves with consistent adaptability and stability corresponding estimation curves with respect to ukf and oukf algorithms are quite adjacent and match the experiment values well with high accuracy and credibility according to mae and absolute deviations appeared in 6 dof pre processing numerical model validation within table 5 the estimation experiment deviations in regard to ukf and oukf algorithms are dramatically smaller than ekf especially for rotational velocity estimations which is principally in line with theoretical expectation the average values of translational and rotational mae related to parallel estimations without arma model are all larger than the average mae based on arma model which indicates that the arma noisy model is able to slightly enhance the estimation precision and perturbations inhibiting performance of three kf algorithms in general the absolute deviations of ukf and oukf are resembled with negligible difference and pronouncedly larger than ekf in this way through applying arma noisy model the practical degree of improvement for entire 6 dof ukf and oukf estimations will be superior to ekf which reveals that the ukf and oukf algorithms possess an acceptable compatibility with arma model to further interact both advantages in accordance with velocity curves and corresponding errors presented in figs 5 to 6 and table 5 the actual numerical estimation precision of oukf algorithm based on arma noisy model is slightly preferable instead of ukf with the potential to fulfill stricter error tolerance which preliminarily validates the reasonability and superiority of arma model based adaptive kf algorithm 4 3 tuning sensitivity analysis furthermore the essential distinction between standard ukf and proposed oukf approaches needs to be emphatically taken into account and investigated to intuitively highlight the detailed advantage and stability performance of adaptive oukf algorithm in this way the variation trend of tuning sensitivity j λ might be a feasible interim indicator for algorithm performance comparison the entire variation trends of tuning sensitivity with respect to standard ukf and oukf approaches based on arma noisy model within one complete estimation process have been acquired and depicted in figs 7 and 8 respectively with uniform iteration step and sensitivity calculation process for a fair comparison in line with figs 7 and 8 tuning sensitivities with respect to standard ukf and oukf approaches are both unsteady in initial stage of the iteration process with considerable disarray and bounded error which eventually converge to zero with a certain time sequentially along with iteration step the recursive scaling parameter λ will become more uncorrelated with prediction and posteriori estimations of two ukf approaches with lower algorithm adaptability on a basis of rmse criteria the rmses of sensitivity peak statistics with respect to ukf and oukf are 1 8109e 01 and 4 5723e 02 severally therefore in contrast with standard ukf approach the average fluctuation of tuning sensitivity with respect to oukf is intuitively smaller with less iteration step to converge which indicates that oukf approach owns much flexible and stable adaptive tuning performance for corresponding prediction and measurement correction through recursive scaling parameter λ to efficiently obtain more exact and reasonable posteriori estimation results furthermore in the light of figs 7 and 8 the tuning sensitivities with respect to standard ukf and oukf approaches both exceed the zero thresholds in initial stage of iteration process and gradually converge into negative region the sensitivity exceedance with respect to oukf is quite smaller than ukf with less iteration step to converge in this way based on fundamental stability criteria expressed in eq 58 two conclusions can be revealed two ukf approaches are both unstable in initial stage of iteration process with more divergent singularities oukf approach is obviously more stable than ukf in one complete iteration process on a basis of l lipschitz theorem formulized in eq 59 and figs 7 to 8 optimal value of tuning sensitivity j λ argmin x ˆ k k j k λ k will progressively approach the initial sensitivity j 0 λ 0 correspondingly constraint term j 0 λ 0 j λ 2 2 2 tk is able to be decreased gradually along with iteration step sequentially l lipschitz condition will be satisfied for algebraic fitting regression issue in regard to posteriori numerical solution x ˆ k k j k λ k which indicates that the disarray and fluctuation state within initial stage of two ukf estimation processes tends to become increasingly stable along with iteration step hence combining aforementioned conclusions with corresponding rmses of sensitivity peak statistics oukf approach based on flexible arma noisy model and efficient recursion rule can be certified to be a quite rational and precise numerical method with preferable algorithm stability performance in contrast with standard ukf approach 4 4 hydrodynamic identification the hydrodynamic coefficient identification on a basis of corresponding pre processing numerical model validation and tuning sensitivity analysis can be employed to distinguish the authentic identification performance of three kf algorithms in this study seventeen non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficients m q m w m δs n r n v n p n δr z q z w z δs y r y v y p y δr k p k r and k v in auv augmented system model will be identified by three kf algorithms based on arma noisy model as illustrated from figs 9 to 13 solid thick lines denote true linear damping coefficients each abscissa denotes time step corresponding linear damping coefficients identified by ekf ukf and oukf algorithms are denoted via solid thin dash and dotted curves respectively all the coefficient identifications have been consistently initialized as zero with uniform time step for a fair and credible comparison in addition the precision and overall deviation of identification curves need to be represented through identification error in this work with regard to detailed curve analyses the identification error can be employed to definitely reveal the identification performances of three kf algorithms by means of rmse criteria and percentage of steady state error sse criteria among true coefficients ekf identified coefficients ukf identified coefficients and oukf identified coefficients rmses and percentage of sses for coefficient identifications have been spread out in table 6 as depicted from figs 9 to 13 the overwhelming majority of non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficient curves identified by three kf algorithms are intuitively unsteady in the initial stage with considerable disarray and bounded error each coefficient identification curve in figs 9 to 13 possess an asymptotic trend to gradually converge to a stable region nearby corresponding true value with appropriate convergence rate which is adequately strengthened through arma noisy model besides the identification performances of ukf and oukf algorithms for all coefficients are distinctly higher in contrast with ekf according to table 6 the error magnitude orders of most identified coefficients lie on a small and reasonable region except sses of n p n δr y p and k v overall rmse of ekf identification is generally larger than ukf and oukf analogously rmse of ukf identification is slightly larger than oukf except z δs y r y v and k r which implies that the robustness and credibility of ukf identification algorithm are medium the ekf identifications with respect to n p y p and k r show relatively large percentage of sses in table 6 convergence performance of ekf identification algorithm embodied from figs 9 to 13 is undesirable as well due to taylor truncation linearization by contrast algorithm stability and identification precision of ukf and oukf are explicitly higher than ekf which reveals great superiority of statistical kf approaches on the contrary computational complexity of ekf algorithm is lower than ukf and oukf with the cost of poor accuracy which can be adopted as a flexible or cost effective option based on comparable results in figs 9 to 13 and table 6 m coefficients and z coefficients identified by oukf algorithm are sufficiently authentic and satisfying with relatively small error and fluctuation in transient period especially for m δs z q and z δs the average percentage of sses for ekf ukf and oukf identifications are 5 2711 1 3986 and 0 8696 respectively in this way the proposed oukf algorithm seems to show preferable identification precision and favourable algorithm stability under uncertainties and perturbations in contrast with ekf and ukf which ought to benefit from recursive tuning rule within each time step and arma noisy model the identification outputs acquired from oukf algorithm might be further treated as a suitable pre validation for experiment issues with low error tolerance 5 conclusion in this paper pre processing numerical model validation for prototype nps auv ii and corresponding hydrodynamic identification for seventeen non dimensional viscous linear damping coefficients based on ekf ukf and proposed oukf algorithms have been implemented severally to provide an assistance for further practical auv hydrodynamic performance assessment and vehicle maneuverability experiment undetermined coefficients are augmented in system model of the auv in addition arma noisy model has been included into three kf algorithms to enhance the estimation precision and perturbations inhibiting performance in line with figs 5 to 6 and table 5 6 dof translational and rotational velocity estimations based on arma noisy model meet a satisfying agreement with corresponding experiment outputs which validates the fidelity and reasonability of the auv mathematical model and the dependability of arma model on a basis of figs 7 to 13 and table 6 identification precision and adaptive tuning ability of oukf algorithm are definitely preferable in contrast with ekf and ukf with acceptable stability performance which highlights the superiority and potential of adaptive kf approach in auv hydrodynamic identification applications in future the effect from real time system process noise will be considered in recursive tuning rule to further improve the identification performance of oukf algorithm ethics approval and consent to participate we
